My husband and I stayed here last weekend for one night. I had spent some time trying to find a great place to stay in Seattle. Read the tripadvisor reviews, saw that it was listed in T&L Top 500 hotels, etc. Seemed like a pretty good bet it would be a fantastic place. It was great, fine...but just not really the amazing little boutique hotel I'd expected from the reviews and ratings. We thought the room was nice, but again, not incredible. The service could have been better too. The woman at the front desk was very friendly, but got a few things wrong. On another note -- if you are visiting Seattle, try to eat at Canlis. We had an incredible meal there!

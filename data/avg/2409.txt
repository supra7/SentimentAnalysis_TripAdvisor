?? I didn't think this place was that bad at all. Was really braced for the worst after reading the reviews, so thank heaven it didn't live down to my expectations. I got this hotel on Priceline after picking a "two star" accommodation...apparently it had formerly been rated one star. Paid $75 plus taxes. Firstly, yes, it's an economy hotel. The furnishings weren't opulent but they were decent enough. Looked like someone went to Ikea and bought out the place (although it'd be basic, no frills Ikea stuff, not the fancy rugs and decor.) The bed was very comfortable, I thought (and I'm used to the plushy digs at Hampton Inn, Sheraton, etc). I slept like a log. No loud noises in the hall, the light blocking curtains worked great, lots of good water pressure, air conditioner ran like a champ. Plus my room at least was spotless. Plenty of close, free parking, a relief when you arrive in the wee hours and are walking into the lobby alone. The night watchman let me in well after the lobby closed and gave me a key, no problem. Honestly? I'd gladly stay here again. The free coffee in the lobby was great. The only item I'd add: there's another Extended Stay nearby. Be sure you're at the right one before you unload all your bags.

Spent 3 nights here as part on an Orlando trip. we had a great rate - paid in advance in the UK. We booked a 1 bed apartment but were upgraded to a gorgeous and huge 2 bed which was more than big enough for the 3 of us - may daughter had a whole apartment to herself. Rooms were confortable, my only criticism is that the air conditioning does not come out in a steady stream - it bursts on and off really loudly and is pointed at the beds so we went from hot to freezing and back to hot again - this kept us awake sometimes. Pool area is quiet and clean, bar dull and not open often. Wouldnt come back to this hotel again - not because of any fault with the hotel - but because we like to walk to a restaurant/bar in the evenings abd I found this part of I Drive quite seedy. I much prefer the other end near to Pointe Orlando. Overall - lovely hotel, great value but would go elsewhere next time.

Even though the reviews were not good, I decided to go with the convenience and security of staying attached to the hospital. I was staying two nights while my husband was hospitalized for surgery. We left home at 4 a.m. to be at the hospital at 6 a.m. It was hours between recovery and being moved to a room. I was able to check in to the hotel and take a nap. I never had to worry about my car, the staff was gracious and the bell-man walked me to my car the day of discharge and actually moved it close to the elevator for me. Not the Hyatt, but a god-send for me.

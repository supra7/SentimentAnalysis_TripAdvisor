My two sisters and I stayed in this travel lodge for one night whilst we were visiting London to watch Dirty Dancing in the West End. The hotel was directly opposite London Euston tube and trian station which meant that we didn't have to carry our overnight bag very far. The reception staff were a bit abrupt but we were checked in very quickly. The rooms are quite basic but were very clean, comfortable and had a nice flat screen television on the wall. All in all, very good value for money as we only paid 40 between the 3 of us and that included our breakfast!!!

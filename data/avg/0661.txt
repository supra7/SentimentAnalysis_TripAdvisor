I've stayed here twice, once overlooking the street, the last time looking onto the roof of an old building. I must say if I was reviewing the staff alone, it would say excellent. The rooms just seem really old with lots of new paint and decor. The rooms I stayed in were small and not all that comfortable. Maybe I'm just not the boutique hotel kind of guy. For the price, I think there are nicer places to stay.

The CP has been here for a long time. You can tell the age of the hotel just by the size of the elevators - small. Still they are centrally located in downtown and the owners have made an effort to remain current by updating the decor, adding computer desks and the like. Don't look for swank new bathrooms - it's still a basic shelf-style sink and a bath tub crammed in with a very noisy toilet. But they've made an effort. The room was clean, and the staff friendly and helpful. Being July accommodations in downtown were very limited and prices were high. (My clients paid, but I think 2 nights was around $600.) If I had a choice I would definitely not pay that much for this room, but they're weren't a lot of options. By the way, there's not free internet here. (I hate that. It's so old school to charge $10 a day for internet!)

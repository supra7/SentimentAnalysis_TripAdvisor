Unfortunately I had a very negative first impression of this hotel because of the staff when I checked in. We stayed two nights and the rest of the visit was fine. I liked the bed except that the mattress pad was bunched up under the sheets and didn't go all the way to the foot of the bed. The best part of the stay was the free fitness room. The business center was also convenient.

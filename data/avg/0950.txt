We stayed here for 5 nights on a trip to Seattle. I don't expect much from budget accommodation, you do get what you pay for, but for the time that we actually spend at the hotel (left daily at 8am, back at 9:30pm) I cannot complain. The hotel is very well situated with a Starbucks (surprise!) just around the corner at a gas station. It is also a short walk from the Space Needle and the 5 Point Caf. We had no trouble walking around at night. Our room overlooked the pool with the Jacuzzi/spa bath and on our first night it was a bit noisy outside. (In summer, one might have to keep that in mind.) After traveling for 24 hours the noise did not really bother us. The room was spacious, clean, it had a safe and a small fridge which came in handy. There is a bit of a gap between the room door and the floor which lets through a bit of light in the evening (if you like to sleep in total darkness like I do), but a towel quickly sorted that out. Our towels were nice and fluffy and that there was no bath did not bother us at all. The hotel lift is a bit stuffy. The breakfast is quite a sugary affair but coffee, orange juice, a wonderful Washington apple and a bagel can set you up for the start of the day. I would definitely stay there again.

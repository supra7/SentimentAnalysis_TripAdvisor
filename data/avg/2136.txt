My husband and I stayed at the Trump LV first week in February for 4 nights. We have noted the following: Good points: Friendly, professional and efficient service Good value for money Very clean room/bathroom Non-smoking, quiet and casino - free resort Good decor throughout the hotel Bad points: Location - although not far from the Strip access is a bit a awkward There is only one bar at the hotel which closes at 11pm, when tried to order cocktail as a room service staff did not know how to make one (Pinacolada) Breakfast bar could not cope with number of guests on Saturday morning- had to wait for 30mins to be seated for breakfast There were no slippers or bathrobes provided in the room- had to call housekeeping service (although their response was very quick- items were delivered within 10mins) There is fixed shower which was extremely temperamental changing water temperature randomly from hot to cold No shower in the Jacuzzi so impossible to rinse your body after taking a bath Bath towel sizes are for Lilliputians- never seen such small bath towels in any hotels Hotel does not provide shower gel- instead guest get body soap which is not very nice (maybe something to do with preventing guests to use bath/shower gels in Jacuzzi) Train noise is very loud- I am a very heavy sleeper (especially after long-haul flights) but the train hooting was so loud- definitely much louder than any traffic noise you might experience in busy cities such as NY- and we were based on 51st floor in city view room

Please note that this is not a review written by someone who has been treated poorly and then overreacts and gives it a 3 out of 5, this is based on evidence experienced and overall cannot give it more. Good Stuff: Good size rooms, nicley decorated. Beautiful (!) beach and location. The pools are great and facilities are actually pretty good. Spa and Gym + Tennis was great and was met by friendly staff etc. Bad Stuff: Seriously, all you people who give this place a 5, what sort of food do you eat at home? I don't want to be a Euro-Snob here but the Italian, French and other International Cuisine was awful, everything from the basics to the quality and the presentation. I know that a All Inclusive basis lowers the standard as the Hotel loses the incentive to perform to a higher standard, but this was actually below poor. Breakfast buffets were actually quite good, but you cannot try and hide the same buffets as quality resturants in the evenings. The staff used their hands without washng them all the time in front of you, touching the food etc. Overall the food brings the place down. The fact that when you order a glass of water it tastes of the last drink that was in the glass, as the pool bar hardley washes the glasses is just poor, to say the least. If you are accustomed to something better than this, the step down is not worth it.

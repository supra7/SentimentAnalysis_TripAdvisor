The tea somellier refused to serve us tea during their advertised tea tasting event. We rushed to finish the tour of the sity to return in time for this event advertised on hotel site, in room info, in the lobby... But we were told by the "tea lady" that in order to do this we need to buy a 4 course meal (??? between 3-5pm? we just had a lunch!) Had to involve a front desk manager to get a cup of tea (they served it to us in a different reataurant to avoid unpleasnt "tea lady" encounter again) Would highly recommend "Parings" restaurant there though. Great food and service! We didn't have a good dining experience in other restaurants. Go to Finales or Maggianno's across the street if Parings is full

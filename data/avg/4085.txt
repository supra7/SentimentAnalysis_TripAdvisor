Stayed at the Marriot for a conference and the fact that it is across the street from the Back Bay Station is great. However that's the last time I would use that particular adjective when describing this Marriot. The rooms are starting to show their age and painting a door multiple times will not help. The elevators don't seem to be able to keep up with a large crowd and you'll find yourself waiting quite awhile on some occasions. The breakfast at Gourmeli's is typical of any hotel overpriced for the quality and while the staff is courteous, the size of the hotel will not allow for anything resembling personal service. It's convenient, but I imagine there are other places nearby that would prove superior.

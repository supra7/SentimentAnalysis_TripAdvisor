We stayed in this hotel for three nights. We chose it because we had three people in our party and it was one of the few places that had triple rooms. I was pleasantly surprised by the beds/bedding and overall layout of the room. We used this as a hub for traveling. It's located about a 10 min walk from Outram MRT but, a word of caution: If you have someone elderly in your party, you may want to rethink this hotel. The walk is entirely uphill and can be quite tiring. Not a fault of the hotel, though. The only thing I was let down about was the unexpected rudeness we received. A female friend of mind had made all the reservations and plans but when she approached the male concierge to ask questions, he promptly IGNORED her and addressed questions and answers to the only male in our party. The check-in staff even asked our male counterpart for his credit card even though the reservation was made with one of our female friend's credit card. We were really surprised to encounter such blatant sexism in Singapore. Price is a little high for what this hotel offers but once we got around the sexism issue by letting the male do all the talking, the hotel was happy to hire cabs for us and tell us where we needed to go. However, I pity the all-female party who comes to this hotel. I wonder how they would treat them?

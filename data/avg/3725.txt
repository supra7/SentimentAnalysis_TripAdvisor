The room was in need of a makeover. Comforters looked dirty and worn, closet door slats were askew, one window-blind was broken. The bathroom seemed dirty, specifically because the shower curtain was discolored and filthy looking. On the positive - check-in and check-out were fast, front desk staff was friendly. Room service was very good, fast and the server was friendly. The lobby is very nice and the complimentary breakfast was good. However, I wouldn't stay here again.

The pros: Great location, right in downtown Seattle next to all the shopping areas. Great customer service. We're upgraded to a king deluxe room on the 36th floor overseeing the city, but the room smells like B.O! We called the front desk, customer service switched us to another room on 41th floor right away. The cons: The room is outdated. Molds in the bathroom, not so heavenly towels and showerhead (the showerhead is stained with brown mildew, yew!). The first room on the 36th room South tower smells like B.O. The second room on the 41th floor North tower is clean overall, but the bathroom smells like sewage! We are truely disappointed with Westin, which is supposed to be a 4 stars hotel!

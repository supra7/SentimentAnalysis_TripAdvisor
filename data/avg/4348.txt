We booked online and reserved a double room with an extra roll away bed for $71 per night. When we confirmed the reservation just before the trip the hotel advised that only smoking rooms were available. Upon arrival the front desk offered us the option of moving into the living room/dining room of a non-smoking suite. The catch was that we would be on two sofa beds and a roll away. We agreed to this as it was at no extra charge, it would be a change from the ordinary and the room was non-smoking. The main door opened into a small foyer revealing two separate rooms with key card access. Our room was roughly 40'x25' and even with both sofa beds extended, we still had plenty of room to manuever despite the existence of the roll away, six-chair dining table, armoire, writing desk, end tables and two sitting chairs. The big problem though was the quality of the bedding. No matter how you dress it up, a sofa bed is an uncomfortable night's sleep and mine seemed to have an especially thin mattress. More dissapointing was the bathroom. The tile was old and cracking. The toilet seemed to be an afterthought. It was wedged flush (excuse the pun) with the tub and mere inches from the vanity. It made for some rather awkward positioning when one needed a few minutes of quiet contemplation. As a minor point, the bell captain and the too-numerous-to-count bell hops were more interested in standing around outside than helping people with their bags. On the plus side, the bartenders were genuine in their banter and the whole first floor area had a great old world hotel feel to it. The location to the Arlington T stop is very handy and the faux Irish pub around the corner serves a quality pint of Guinness. If you like chain eateries, there is a Legal Sea Food nearby as well as a couple of other places.

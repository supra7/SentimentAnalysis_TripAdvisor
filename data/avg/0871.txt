Stayed March 5-7, 2010, paid $75 a night through Priceline. Pros - I really liked the downtown location, central to everything - great food and lots of shopping nearby. Front desk and concierge were friendly and polite. I was given the choice of a king or two doubles when we checked in, and chose the king which was on a lower floor, in hindsight I'd choose the two doubles on the higher floor as we stayed on the 12th floor and only had a view of the monorail and surrounding buildings. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the furnishings were decent and the bathroom was clean. The gym was also well equipped, clean and had personal T.V's for the cardio machines with clean headsets. Cons - You could hear every little noise from the hallway, the sound didn't seem to be muffled at all. I also feel like free Internet access should be standard in this day and age, paying an extra $16 per day for WiFi feels like a money grab. Hotel parking is really expensive; however parking in the underground lot next door (which is connected by the overpass walkway) is only $18 for 24 hours. Overall, we saved a lot by booking through Priceline, so I thought it was good value for the money - however I don't think it's worth the rack rate. We'd return if we got another deal as the location is great.

Upon arrival at night, the hotel did not have a room available we reserved over 2 months ago. We were put up in another room. The staff moved our luggage to our reserved room the next day. I did have to remind the management twice to refund the difference. The room was just average in my opinion even though we had a ocean view room. The property was showing its age. It was clean, and well maintained except for some minor peeling wall paper, and old caulking etc... Overall its a nice hotel, but it needed some updating.

I expect occupancy and room taxes; however, this hotel charges > $26.00 in taxes. The room rate of $173/night is most misleading. The most annoying charge is the $50.00 PER NIGHT "incidental fee" in case of damages or other charges. Even more vexing is the fact that it takes so long for this fee to be reimbursed to one's card. The front desk staff explains it as a "hold" that will be reimbursed to the card. It doesn't matter what it's called - the money is still not available until such time as the charge is reversed. If the stay is three nights, that's an additional $150.00 charge for the privilege of occupying that hotel. As someone who makes my own bed, hangs up my towels, produces little in the way of garbage and only goes to the hotel room to sleep, I find this charge unacceptable and intrusive and borderline insulting. I'll probably avoid Marriott properties as much as possible in the future. Additionally, the ATM machine was out of service for the entire visit. The closest ATM was somewhere down the block.

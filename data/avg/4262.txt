On arrival at the hotel, we asked about car parking and the Car park Valet took the car away, there was no mention of the $40.00 per night charge, it was only by coincidnce we found the charge displayd in small print. There was plenty of car parking facilities close by at less cost and street parking was available. On collection of the car it was noticeably damaged on the rear bumper bar, fortunately, we took out full insurance on the rental car, so there was no problems with the rental company. The accommodation was reasonable, but the bathroom was pretty small and the fact that there was no tea or coffe making facilities was a dfinite minus!! The room service charges were exorbitant and the additional mandatory gratuities and admin charge for the service was another major minus point. All in all I would rate the hotel as a thre *** star hotel, and overpriced at that even thou we got a deal price.

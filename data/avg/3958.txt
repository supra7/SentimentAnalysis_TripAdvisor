Nice little hotel and the rooms and service are excellent. The lobby is tiny and nothing to write home about and it lacks a bar - so generally there a no common areas. The beds are nice and they are very dog friendly. The gym is big but 2 of the 3 treadmills were dead. Hard for us to understand how this place was #1 on trip advisor though... I think next time we'll stay in the four seasons.

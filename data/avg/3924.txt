bad: pretty sketchy neighborhood that near but only for a block that behind the hotel - some towels have stains -some dirt in small crevasses like between the bed and frame for me there were bread crumbs in my room - lots of spiders/web on the window all on the outside but some webs in the rooms too very few though -missing room sign (do not disturb, cleaning service) good: GREAT LOCATION--- in the middle of downtown. everything is in walking distance about 10-25 mins -pretty cheap - Really comfy bed/pillow -nice looking rooms. modern interior, nice to have a mini kitchenette -lots of different food places near by -chinatown is right across the street -grocery store near by unknown: didn't really have to call room service/customer service (front desk people were nice from the interactions that i had with them) - restaurant was not open yet -didn't wake up to try the continental breakfast overall: 3 1/2 out of 5

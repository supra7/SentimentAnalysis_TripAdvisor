This is a basic hotel: 3 computers in the Business Center, 6 machines in the Fitness Room, unsecured/complimentary parking,no "family friendly" resturants, but it is clean and appears to be fairly new. It is not within walking distance of any Chicago destination and it is in an area that is being redeveloped, so be prepared. If all you need is a a place to sleep,don't need to keep children/family occupied, and are willing to pay for parking at your destinations or ride the Chicago transit system, you will be fine.

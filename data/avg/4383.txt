Booked on Priceline - got the room for $140 which is not so great for Priceline. When I checked in I asked if I could have 2 beds - and I could - for an additional $30 per night. I declined - but quickly changed my mind when I saw the size of the King room I was assigned. It was easily the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. I've been to NYC, Paris, London, etc. & know how small a room can be in a large city. This was a new level of tiny. I quickly went downstairs & paid the additional $$ to upgrade (first time I've ever been charged additional fees to upgrade - usually it's complimentary - & I doubt the hotel was full based on the lack of a crowd throughout stay). The second room worked - large enough. The location is the selling point of this hotel - 2 blocks from Newbury St., close to subway, restaurants, etc. Parking is a JOKE at $42 per night. You can park across the street at the Prudential center for $39 a night but good luck negotiating the maze of parking levels. Overall, the hotel is a good value if you book on Priceline. I wouldn't feel comfortable paying the rack rate, however. It's been remodeled & has character, but it's still rough around the edges. I would consider staying there again if I scored a deal, otherwise I'd look elsewhere for a nicer option.

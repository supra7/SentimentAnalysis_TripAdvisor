My husband and I just returned from a week long stay at El Dorado Maroma. This was our second visit to this property. Let me start with the things we truly enjoyed both times we were there. If you want to know the negatives, skip to the bottom. It is a beautiful place with gorgeous rooms. We have stayed in an ocean view room on the third floor, and a swim up suite next to the main pool. The swim up suite was superior largely due to not having to climb three flights of stairs. Overall, the level of service is excellent. All guests are treated with kindness. We appreciated the personal touches and over the top attention. I must admit, my husband was more eager to return a second time. He now agrees that two visits probably exceeded our desire for the type of vacation we desire. Here are the reasons why. First, we did not appreciate, especially on a second stay being questioned about the type of package we had booked and ultimately were refused services that were a part of the package. In addition, our personal concierge suddenly became invisible when we declined a tour to promote ownership. Very disappointing. The food this time was not as good. The "Asian" restaurant was subpar. The attempts at "Italian" food were acceptable but definitely not authentic or excellent in any way. The Mexican dishes were good. We would not recommend the tours offered. Tulum could have been enjoyable and informative but was neither because of the Lomas representative. They are aggressive and eager to promote them....with the agent going so far as to tell us that booking a tour would really help his family. The beach was constantly cluttered with seaweed and smelled. Certain areas of the resort also have a terrible odor. We couldn't explain why but it was very unpleasant. El Dorado Maroma is very secluded. For some, this is perfect... but if you want to do anything on your own, off the resort, it is a chore. We will not return.

i was at pera tulip for almost a week with a friend of mine. location of the hotel was a gift for us as we were addicted to Istiklal St. not to mention Metro station and Taqsim Sq. was so near to the hotel. the interior designer had a good taste; thou' small room, bathroom, lobby but all beautifully designed. nice and polite staff. thin walls, good for eavesdropping. delicious diverse breakfasts. tranquilizing lighting in passages and rooms. if i could make it one more time to Istanbul, i would choose pera tulip to stay in.

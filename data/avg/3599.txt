This is a hotel for business travel, shares parking lot with a Residence Inn. I wouldn't recommend it for a family with children.We had difficulty reaching the hotel directly (don't like the Marriott web site) when we were trying to determine the correct exit off Central Expressway. Having lived in Dallas, we managed but Central Expressway traffic isn't for the faint of heart. Breakfast is limited, but convenient. Much better service for our drinks at 6. No restaurants within walking distance. Overall, I suspect the next door La Quinta is probably exactly the same with cheaper prices and a free breakfast.

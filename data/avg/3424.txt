First time stepped into the hotel, hoping will get great service. Very Dissapointed with the service at the lobby cafe. Staff were very busy chit chatting and the outlet was very noisy from the chinese restaurant. I had 4 beers and requested for a glass of water before I leave and was told that drinking water will not be served. In business we need to be little flexible, but even after having 4 beers, I was denied a glass of water.

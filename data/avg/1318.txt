I stayed at the SeaTac Marriott for two nights. It's an older Marriott property, and it shows its age. Rooms are recently upgraded with the most recent Marriott furnishings, but they are rather small. Bathrooms are rather small as well (but not as small as some Marriotts). Water-saving faucets are a joke (in general, I have a dim view of hotels that claim to be earth-friendly but don't bother to recycle bottles and cans). The AC in my room was quiet and functional. Windows are not as soundproof as some other airport hotels. Fortunately, the hotel is1/2 mile east of the main runways and as such away from flight arrival-departure paths. One design flaw of the hotel is that it is centered around a covered courtyard which contains the swimming pool. Yes, there's a large swimming pool in the middle of the hotel! As a result, the atrium and surrounding areas smell like chlorine. Fortunately, my room faced the outside (parking lot) instead of the atrium and smelled fresh enough. Parking is expensive, but there's a convenient free shuttle to SeaTac. The Concierge Lounge breakfast is unappetizing, consisting of eggs, greasy sausage, some fruit, and supermarket bread. Finally, free internet access for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members. Others pay $12.95/night like most Marriotts. Friendly staff. Would I stay here again? Probably, but mostly for the convenience. The Hilton nearby looks newer - worth trying the next time around.

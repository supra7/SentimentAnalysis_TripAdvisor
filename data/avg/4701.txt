I was running a little late checking out so I called the front desk to ask for 30 minutes more to check out. The woman at the front desk said she had to pull up my reservation first. Then she asked me how i was going to pay for the valet parking (which I never had in the first place). After explaining to her that I self parked, with an attitude she told me that the hotel was fully booked and not to take any longer than 30 mins. (As if everyone is really rushing to Chicago right now for some reason!?) Anyways, as I was saying "thank you" just to be polite, she hung up on me. I stayed there 2 days and after the first night, the room wasn't cleaned until late afternoon. Also, the first day we found old drinks in the refrigerator that had already expired. The room directory is outdated and not specific.

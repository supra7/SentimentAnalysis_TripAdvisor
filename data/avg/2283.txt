The front desk help was the highlight of our stay. They were very helpful in getting us cabs, helping to plan activities, and scheduling an in room massage. The cleaning staff left a little to be desired. Our towels were dirty, and for the most part they were seen sitting in the walkways snacking and using their cell phones. We were woken in the early morning by people going down the stairs in the unit above and closing the shared door to our cottage caused a loud bang to our inside door. Would suggest the upper unit if you can climb stairs. The cook at the cafe was friendly but others were not. The cafe breakfast of belgium waffles were actually toaster waffles. The other food such as eggs and bacon were precooked and slapped between 2 pieces of bread and thrown in a pannini maker. Should of invested in a waffle maker and a fresh cooked breakfast would of been more appropriate for a hotel at this price. Just saying. This is an ok hotel but it tries to pass it's self off as a luxury oceanfront hotel. No oceanfront to walk here. Being next to Walgreens was a perk if you needed something but it's location for a "quote oceanfront hotel" if you can see past the shrubs, was a bit odd. Would probably not stay here again. Upon checkout a $25 per day resort fee was added making it a very expensive stay. For that price you can stay anywhere in Key West.

This airport is a bit pricey but the convenience is nice if you have an early flight out. I found the room accommodations to be nice, especially the Phillips radio with the i-Phone port for playing music. If it were not for the convenience to the airport I would not stay in this hotel because it is over priced for the quality level of the hotel. Taxi fare to the city and back is ~ 40 SGD so if you have the time in your schedule stay in town not at this airport

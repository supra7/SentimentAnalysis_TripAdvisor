The Novotel Amsterdam makes a good first impression, nicely done lobby and walking distance to the RAI Conference Center. With the white tiles, they were constantly mopping the floor, felt sorry for the cleaning crew. Room sizes are good, are clean, very spartan and dorm room like in decor and finishes. Service was great, front desk speaks english well and getting a cab was never a problem. On site restaurant does your basic business hotel breakfast, with european cold cut selection too, but for dinner tries to be both Asian and American, being Asian American I found the combination confusing... food was OK. Go out into old Amsterdam for dinner at one of the great Indonesian places. All in all, if you're attending a conference at RAI, it's a convenient place to stay, won't find much to write home about, at least at the Novotel.

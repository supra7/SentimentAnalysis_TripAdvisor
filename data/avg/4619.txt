Checked in to the hotel for our 1st anniversary. The girl checking us in was horrible, barely said 2 words to us and seemed annoyed we were bothering her. Later in the stay we over heard her saying she was transfering to a different department, no excuse to do your current job poorly. The room was clean and very nice, view was of the AC unit but didn't mind since the unit wasn't loud. Disappointed with the ala carte sunday brunch, went to another hotel for brunch instead. Room service staff was fantastic and so was the menu. Catie Copley is the most adorable dog! She is a great addition to the lobby especially if when you have Ms. Personality at the front desk. Concierge was very distracted, halfway through helping us he stopped and was getting information for someone else, we waited 5 minutes before he returned to us. The female concierge was the greatest, she deserves a raise. Doormen were very friendly and were very helpful with directions.

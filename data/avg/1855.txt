My family and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during Thanksgiving. For the price, you don't get a lot for what you pay for. The hotel has an older feeling to it and the decor reflects the same. Furthermore, the service is average at best because the hotel has too many rooms. We had to beg for a girl at the pool to bring us a drink. After waiting almost an hour, she finally came. The nice restaurant on site (Spat's) was definitely not worth the money, although it was alright food-wise. The bottom line for this resort is that it is so large that you feel like a number, not a guest . . . We won't be staying again.

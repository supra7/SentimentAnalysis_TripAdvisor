My family and I stayed in one of their apartments in July of 2011. We traveled with 4 kids, 3 teenagers, and 4 adults. The apartment was spacious and very clean when we arrived and it fit us well. The kitchen was large as well as one bathroom. We also had a small bathroom with just the basics. The cupboards were well stocked with towels, toilet paper, washcloths, etc... and the kitchen was stocked with dishes, utensils, etc... We also had a large living room and dining room. The location was perfect for us, especially with younger children. The only complaints that I have was the front door lock did not lock well and when it did you had a difficult time getting it open. The other complaint I have was housekeeping. We cleaned our own place and never saw a housekeeper for the week we were there. We had to take our dirty towels to the front office to exchange them for clean ones and when I did that I was told they had 5. I then took the five towels back to the apartment to share for 11 people. No one ever came and changed our bed sheets the whole time we were there. If there was no housekeeping for the apartments, I wish we were told. Otherwise the lobby and hallways were clean. We also requested 2 roll-away beds for our apartment and they were not there when we arrived eventhough I booked this hotel in January. I would go back but I have a few questions before I would!

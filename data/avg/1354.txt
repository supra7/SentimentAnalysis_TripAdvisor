Just spent one night here to break up the drive between Vancouver BC and Portland. $63 a night from Priceline (and, as many others have complained, another $20 for parking). It's a lovely hotel but built like a Vegas hotel (i.e. very spread out). The staff are less than enthusiastic (perhaps from many years of being blasted for charging for parking at an airport hotel!) but the room is very nice. Comfy beds, flat screen TV with lots of high-def channels. There is free wi-fi (lobby only, otherwise you're paying for it) and a nice pool (packed with screaming kids, alas). Lots of noise from the hall way, too. We were grateful to have to deal with only one night. For those without a car, it would seem like a better deal. There is a big transit station right across the street.

I agree with other reviews about the helpful staff - they are always ready to help or offer recommendations, and the valet parking is efficient. Again, though, the rooms are extremely small - just a bed and a dresser, a closet and a bathroom. We decided to pay more for the artist king room because of reviews that claimed they are a bit roomier, but I can't imagine what the queen rooms are like given the small size of our king room! Perhaps we were given the worst king room in the hotel since someone mistakenly quoted us an extra-low room rate. The sheets were super-starched but the selection of pillows and the down duvet were very nice. The bathroom towels were cheap and scratchy, and the tub and sink are starting to show wear. The air conditioner has adjustable temperature settings, but the fan is always quite strong, which isn't very nice at night. On our second day our used towels were removed, but they were not replaced. The location is good if you're interested in the market and downtown shopping, but it's definitely not the closest option and you might be able to get closer without paying more. When you add up what the hotel does and does not offer, it doesn't seem to equate with the high prices. We've paid the same price for rooms at other prime location boutique hotels where the rooms were also small but they got the small things right (like soft, fluffy towels).

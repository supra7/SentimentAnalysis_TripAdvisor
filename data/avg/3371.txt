This place was ideal for the night between arriving on a cruise and leaving on an early morning train. There was a bus direct from the cruise terminal and it's a short walk to Central Station. I was never sure whether this was a classic heritage hotel or just very old fashioned. It's certainly not up to 4 star standards. The room was small with no view but it was very quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel bistro was closed for a private function so we had our dinner in the pub section which was typical but good pub food.

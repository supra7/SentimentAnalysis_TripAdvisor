We stayed at this hotel for a conference. We were given an accessible room with a "roll-in shower" without a divider between shower & floor -- we soon learned this meant a giant puddle in the middle of the bathroom floor that didn't dry the entire day. This room would be better used for someone with actual need for accessible accommodations. The room was small and dark, with a dismal view of an alley. But all this isn't unexpected for a city hotel; what really rankled were the outrageous charges for every single amenity that by all rights should be included in a luxury hotel. Internet access was $15/day (!! is this 1991?), the daily use of gym cost the same amount (!!!), and I was charged a $5 handling fee for a package I received at the hotel -- which wasn't even delivered to my room; I had to actually walk over to shipping to pay for the privilege of being handed my package. It's truly disappointing that a landmark hotel should so gracelessly charge for basic amenities. The hotel showed signs of past splendor, but is now just a fancily wallpapered cash cow. Staying at a modest Holiday Inn Express, with free internet, gym and breakfast, would have been better. Shame on you, Hilton.

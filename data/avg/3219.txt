I visited Chicago on a budget and decided to stay because the cost. The place makes you feel like you are on a budget, the rooms are very plain. The service was below average. Tried being friendly to the staff but they act emotionless and like they don't like their jobs. It was by no means the worse place I've stayed, but I felt like a cheap skate for staying here. If you are just passing thru this is an okay place, but if you want a Chicago experience, spend a little more and stay somewhere else.

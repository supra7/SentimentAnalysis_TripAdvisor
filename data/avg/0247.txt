Stayed here with my company one night following an off-site meeting. The location is great- within walking distance of the Seattle Center (and Space Needle), Pike Place Market, Pacific Place (shopping center), and adjoining to Westlake Center. The monorail stop is really close. We were in a corner room on the 7th floor, and I thought it was a reasonable size. The bed was comfortable and the room had a good view of downtown Seattle streets. Furniture and overall decorating scheme were nice enough, but I think the carpet and bathrooms could use updating. The bathroom sink was nice, but the tub looked a bit ancient and not really in a cute historical way. However, the service was GREAT and everyone was nice. Valet parking was free, and when I realized I had forgotten a toothbrush, I was brought one (and toothpaste) within 5 minutes. Also, I didn't use it, but there was free wireless internet. A lot of hotels nickel and dime you, so it was nice to not have that happen. One strange thing was...we had oatmeal raisin cookies at our work meeting, and I found olives in mine...not sure if that was on purpose or not but GROSS!

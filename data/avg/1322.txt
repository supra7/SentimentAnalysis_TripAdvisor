I had no bad experiences, and both the bed (very comfy!) and the staff (very nice!) were excellent. Good airport bus service, too. Strangely small room, but I don't really care about that. I booked the hotel based on the pictures I saw on the website and on expedia -- kind of cool looking indoor atrium, like a good Hyatt. The pictures do not lie, but on the other hand a closer resolution reveals that all the common areas in the hotel are pretty tired. The restaurant was definitely not worth a visit, although I'll put in a plug for the Eggs Benedict at the buffet (!). Not the handmade omelets, which are basically scrambled eggs with stuff in them. If you want a good meal, get one the other side of security at the airport (Vino Volo or Anthony's), or else walk a block to the Hilton and go to Spenser's. At the time I booked I could have got either the Hilton or the Doubletree for the same amount. Judging what I've read on the site, I should have gone for the Doubletree.

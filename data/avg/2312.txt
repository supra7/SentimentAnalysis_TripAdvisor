We enjoyed our stay at the Parrot Key, but an accumulation of "niggling" little things kept it from being a great experience. Our room was clean and nicely appointed. Not too often to we see crown moulding in a hotel room. Although the hotel advertises Free Wireless, it didn't work. Even the wi-fi signal to the complimentary computer in the hotel lobby was so weak, no internet connections were possible. The technician who tried to help said the hotel had recently gone from 70 to 140 units, and the signal they had contracted for was no longer strong enough to service all of them. I agree with the other guests who were disappointed with the Walgreen's parking and the "unavertised" resort charges. Our check in was delayed because they were having problems activating room keys (they forgot to make an adjustment to daylight savings time) With no shuttle to the downtown, we decided to walk - the clerk told us it was 1.5 miles. To Duval Street though, it was closer to 3 miles with not too much to see on the way. While we enjoyed a great sleep, it was interrupted at 6 a.m. by two hotel employees (right below our window), having an animated conversation about how to fix a pool valve. We'd probably try the Parrot Key again, but would hope they start to focus more on the little things that often make such a bid difference to travellers.

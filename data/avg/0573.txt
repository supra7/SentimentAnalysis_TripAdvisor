Beds & linens here are not up to the quality we usually find at 4* hotels. Also, we asked for a queen bed, but were given a room with two doubles after being told they were only an inch smaller than a queen, but they felt much smaller. Attention to details seems missing here - we needed to look up an address, but found that the yellow pages in the room didn't cover the downtown area. Even if we'd found it, the room had no pen to write it down. Small things, but indicative. To top things off, they didn't clean our room the second day. And no wireless internet in the rooms. Overall, I'd say the hotel is no better than your average 3* hotel.

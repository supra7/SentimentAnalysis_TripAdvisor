Being the only smoke free hotel on the strip we decided to stay. Vegas is very smoker friendly. Also, my husband and I don't gamble so we appreciated the relaxed, peaceful atmosphere. It's a nice hotel with poor housekeeping. One day they did not even give us any toilet paper although I left the empty on the floor. The location is OK. It's off the strip by a good bit and you have to hike which would not be so bad except it's poorly lit and the sidewalks are not good. This is also too far to walk in high heels. To make up for this the Trump provides shuttles to the strip. They are handy and the drivers are nice, BUT, if you miss the shuttle, walking can be treacherous.

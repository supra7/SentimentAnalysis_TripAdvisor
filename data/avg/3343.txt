The hotel itself is really quite something. And although one member of staff should not taint your view of all, one member of staff in particular was the most unhelpful rude individual I have ever come across staying in a hotel. We only asked for some milk for coffee!!! The location itself is fantastic however some of the streets heading into La Rambla are a little unsavoury, making my firend and I feel very uncomfortable. That said the hotel is fantastically modern and great on a friday and Saturday night with live DJs and the drinks and food are not overpriced at all

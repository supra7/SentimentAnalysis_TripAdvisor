Didn't expect a lot from Executive for the price, CAD $115/nt. Was an overnighter but longer stays might want to consider other alternatives it can be noisy for light sleepers. Walls are pretty thin and it is an old hotel after all. Location is quite central and about 10 min away to Pike Place. Another 15 min to Chinatown. And under 10 min away to downtown shopping. Space Needle area will require a cab, but monorail is walking distance. The funky Capitol Hill shouldn't be more than 10 min drive away and some consider it even a walking distance. Parking was included and is in parkade in the building next door. Internet consisted of one computer and getting the chance to get on it is hit and miss... more likely 'miss' unless you get up nice and early. This being Seattle, there was a Starbucks across the street and Seattle's Best Coffee right in the lobby. Overall good value.

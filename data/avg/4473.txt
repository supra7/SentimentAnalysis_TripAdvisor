The facility itself is one of those poor sisters built in the 70s -- nondescript concrete. The lobby and rooms are pleasantly appointed and of decent size, no argument with amenities. The staff was friendly and competent. The room service, however, was abysmal. Breakfast, particularly, was a great disappointment. Overall impression: So - so. This hotels main claim to fame is a very convenient proximity to the convention center. You can do much worse, but for a somewhat upscale chain, this branch is a disappointment.

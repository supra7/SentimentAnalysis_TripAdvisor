We had stayed here 2 years ago for the same overnight prior to a flight and found it fine. This time was very disappointing. The staff were very helpful and friendly but the hotel is showing wear and feels pretty depressed. The pool and hot tub are really small. The pool was not heated, though indoor. The hot tub was warm, not hot. The mangers special- free drinks and snacks was nice but the tables had not been cleaned from breakfast that morning. Parking was $10 which seems about average. And charging for Internet wireless or wired is absolutely ridiculous but seems to be a trend, certainly in the hotels around Sea Tac. The free shuttle was good though we waited 40 mins to go back to the hotel after dropping family at the airport.

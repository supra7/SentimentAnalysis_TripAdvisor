We found the staff to be friendly and accomodating. Not the best location as the people out on the sidewalks within a block of the hotel were just, plain unfriendly! However, get past that and the folks around New Orleans really try to make you feel welcome, at least during Mardi Gras. Overall, I'd say this is a good hotel for the money. The biggest drawback to the room was the tiny bathroom. The sink was hardly large enough to wash your hands in! However, we didn't go there to spend much time in our room. Valet service was prompt and friendly as well. hey also provided a safe, refrig., coffee maker and a microwave in the room.

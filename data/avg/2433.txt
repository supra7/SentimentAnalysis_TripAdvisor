This hotel is your typical 2-3 star hotel that is only useful if you need to be right near the airport. There is nothing within walking distance except a Ruby Tuesday's. The hotel itself is average. Our first room was stinky and the air conditioner didn't work. We were immediately moved to a room that was clean and acceptable for 1 night. The customer service at this hotel is exceptional. It is the only reason I gave this review a 3 star. Everyone was very helpful, and they moved our room in less than 5 minutes. To be honest though, I would not stay here again. I just got a really good deal for 1 night and couldn't pass up the rate.

We stayed at the Premier Room 1202 on the 1st night, clean, spacious but the bed was old and soft, pillows were not good. Next morning we requested change of room and the staff immediately attended to our request and we got Room 802, the bed was perfect but I still don't prefer the quality of the pillows. All in all, the hotel is about 10 mins walk to Outram MRT via a dark and small road from the back of hotel car park, ladies please don't walk alone. Good to have free Wifi.

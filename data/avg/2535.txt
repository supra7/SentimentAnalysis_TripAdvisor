We stayed at this hotel New Years Eve, the staff were very friendly on our arrival we were checked in easily no problems. We had a double room which was the typical Travelodge room basic no frills, once again just a pet hate of mine a double room has 2 people so why is there only 3 pillows I always have to ask for another one. Excellent location for all the train stations just over road from Euston and about 5 minutes to Kings Cross/ St Pancras. Breakfast was terrible though, eggs smelt of kippers, orange juice was just water with a bit of orange in it, We couldnt drink it. Bed was too soft and very lumpy Otherwise this is a reasonable hotel if you just want a base to sightsee its a perfect location for underground.

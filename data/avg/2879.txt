This place was fine - was it a five star hotel - no. However, you get what you pay for! We were looking for a cheap place to stay - we got it! Comfortable bed, close to downtown, plenty of ice in the ice machine (despite what many reviews say) - and I wasn't scared! (I'm easily scared - and I wasn't scared!) I'm not saying this is the nicest place out there - but for the money - it was great! I think most people must be looking for something more! If your expectations aren't unreasonable for the money - you'll be fine! Also - the photos are what it looked like!

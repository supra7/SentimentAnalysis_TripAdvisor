Nice clean hotel and rooms were clean. We arrived early after coming from our cruise ship but wasn't allowed to check in until after 14:00, so had to hang around for a few hours, we couldn't even use the pool area as we had no towels or card to access the lifts.. We had 3 beds in our room and all were portable beds which I thought was a bit poor for the standard of hotel that was advertised. No tea or coffee making facilities, but the free internet was good. Liked the location as it was only a 10 euro taxi ride to Las Ramblas. Plus the next block had its own ramblas with nice restaurants and cafes without the prices found in the main tourist area.

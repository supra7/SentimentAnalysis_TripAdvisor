As Hilton Honor members, we stayed on the 15th floor (16 floors in all). The suites have 2 tvs (a tube tv in the bedroom and a flat screen tv in the living room). The bedroom was quiet. If you plan on having on any guests sleep on the sofa bed in the living room, plan to bring some earplugs. You can hear doors slamming and the noise from the atrium. You can also hear guests from the next door room. While we were there, the hotel was replacing the carpeting and drapery in the the rooms so we heard hammering before 8 am. When we left for the breakfast buffet ($12 pp), one of the construction workers asked us if he can go in the room to do some work. Of course, we answered no. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet in one of the restaurants, which consisted of made-to-order omelettes, waffles, pancakes, fresh fruit, bagels, pastries, bacon, sausage, potatoes, cereal, oatmeal, freshly-squeezed orange, juice, pop, coffee and milk. Our room had a nice view of the river. The hair dryer in the bathroom did not work, so we just grabbed another one from one of the rooms that was being renovated. We had to call housekeeping to bring toilet paper since we ran out. The hotel has a swimming pool and good-sized exercise facilities. The location was okay. It was a 20 min. walk from the Central stop (Red LIne train). You can also take the 64 bus, which stops across the street from the hotel, but it runs every 30 min. to 1 hour depending on the time of the day. Make sure you arrive early to take the free hotel shuttle. You are supposed to make reservations but there were people who got on without reservations and some people had to wait for the next shuttle. We found that the easiest way to go to the airport was to take the hotel shuttle to the Aquarium stop and take the Blue Line.

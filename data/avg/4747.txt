Their website gives the impression that they have two, and only two, types of rooms: regular and suite. The rooms actually come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. When checking in, we didnt make any specific request, so we got a narrow room with a bed that was too big for it, and no view to boot. Lesson learned -- specifically ask for a big room, and a river view, or at least a view out on to Wabash Avenue. Also, definitely take them up on their offer of a free pass at the gym down the street, the exercise room is more like a closet. And the curb in front of the hotel gets crowded, so dropping off luggage can be an adventure. The bellhops do their best, but someone directing traffic would be better.

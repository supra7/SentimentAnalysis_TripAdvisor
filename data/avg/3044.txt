We stayed at Augusta Lucilla Palace for 5 nights in early June. The location is very convenient  close to Termini Station, good (safe) neighbourhood with cafes, restaurants, Laundromat etc. Within a short walking distance are Maria Magiorre, Republicca, 15 minutes to Trevi and about 30 minutes to the Colosseum. The front desk staff we dealt with are all pleasant, accommodating and courteous. As we were travelling with our 8 yr old son, we were given a good size room with a sofa bed (already converted to a bed). Id say overall the hotel is clean. My only complaint is the bathroom. The shower doors do not shut properly which made it difficult to bathe without getting the floors outside the shower area all wet. And there is also a very faint smell of urine in the bathroom  when we first arrived and in the succeeding days. (We just kept the door shut at all times!) The breakfast buffet is a pretty good deal. Theres a wide variety to choose from. We husband liked that theres hot food such as scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages aside from the usual bread, butter and cheese and cereals. If they want to improve on the breakfast, it would be nice if they serve fresh fruits instead of canned / preserved fruits. Overall, Id say overall its ok.

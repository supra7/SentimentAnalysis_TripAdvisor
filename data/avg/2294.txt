Pictures show sand, chairs, but no water, that is because it is on the other side of a fence and hedge row. Daily maid service consisted of trash pick up and making beds. Had dead wood roach in upstaires bedroom for four days before it was removed, service consisted of exchanging towels daily. They have parking available for about 75% of the guests, additional parking is next door in Walgreens parking lot. I will go back to Key West, but I will not stay here. Great bartender Shelly with lots of information on resturants in area. She was correct on every recomendation.

I needed to find a place close by to Termini train station so I could catch my flight out the next morning. I only slept in the room for 4 hours and we had a lot of problems. The wi-fi did not work when I arrived back at 0130 in the morning. Thank god there was a computer in the lobby that worked so we could check in for our flight! The power also went out when we went to bed, so I could not sleep with the air conditioning on. When I woke up, I put the tv and air on and soon afterwards the power went out again! My boyfriend had to take a shower in the dark! So, I am not sure if there is a fuse problem or if the hotel workers just turned off the power. When I spoke to the man at the front desk, he walked over to the light/fuse box and turned all these switches on. Other than that, the room wasn't so bad. So, if you are an experienced budget traveler looking for a cheap place for 1 night and nothing else was available, than one night isn't going to do so much harm. But if you are looking to stay in Rome for more than one night, please find somewhere else.

We had no problems with this hotel. It was clean, cheap, and decent, the staff was friendly, and it was near the museum of flight, where we were headed the next day. This was actually an unexpected extension of our trip to Seattle, and we had already checked out of the hotel we stayed in for the rest of the trip, so this place worked out perfectly for us.

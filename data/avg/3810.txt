The good: good location (5min from train station), reasonable price for being in Venice, clean. Wifi works in the room but it costs extra and wasn't all that cheap. The bad: Your locked in from 1230am to 7am. That means no getting in or getting out. Especially not good if you have an early train. Bunk beds weren't all that comfortable. No fan or AC so either room gets stuffy or you have to leave window open (usually noisy on the street below until at least midnight). Shared bathrooms get quite busy. Also tended to be noisy in the halls. It seemed that everyone slammed their doors (probably just the design of the building though -tight doors.) In a pinch I would stay here again, but I would prefer another hotel next time.

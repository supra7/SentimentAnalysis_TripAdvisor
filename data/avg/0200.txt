We stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne on the 14th the 15th. It was a clean hotel with lots of character and the room had its own kitchenette which proved useful. The staff on the front desk when we arrived were very useful and gave us plenty of info on the surrounding area and what to see in Seattle. This review would have been a 5 however when we arrived we were asked for a deposit on a credit card of $60 ($30 per night of stay) which we were not informed of when we booked the room. This was supposed to be refunded when we left however nearly a week later this has still yet to be done. Also the website we booked through stated we had breakfast with the room which it didnt, however we think this is a problem with the website as this happened to us at a later stay in Portland.

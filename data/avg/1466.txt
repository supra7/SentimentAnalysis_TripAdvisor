We spent our entire time on the beach. Why go and sit by the pool? We saw fish in the ocean swimming with us. Take flip flops to wear on the boards on the beach or risk burning the bottom of ur feet! There are bathrooms at the bar around the pools. The seafood at oceana is wonderful. Ask for a double helping of scallops! This was our 2nd trip to maroma. We stayed in a swim out room. We used it everyday. Was it worth it? Not really. Although it was beautiful. Very noisyin the middle of the night. Next trip to Mexico will be at the iberostar. So much more to do.

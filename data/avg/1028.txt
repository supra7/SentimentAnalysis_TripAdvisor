I recently stayed at the W as I was attending a conference at the hotel during the last week of September. I had high expectations as I understood that the W hotels have a good reputation for being contemporary, high service hotels. The hotel is dark, rooms are OK....not too special. I was disappointed overall with the quality of furnishings and surroundings. The sink in the bathroom wouldn't drain and had to call to have the sink repaired as soon as I checked in. The water pressure at the hotel was horrible, it took about 30 minutes to run 2 inches of water in the tub. I heard similar complaints from other guests. The hotel is in a great downtown location but I don't think it's worth the high price.

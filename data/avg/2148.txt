Initial impression was great: nice lobby, friendly service, lovely room. Then the train noise..... First night I was woken up by the sound of a train sounding its horn 5 times through the night. Not a quick short burst, but a long NOOOOISY horn. We had been given a room facing the train track, on the 29th floor, and the noise was genuinely unbearable. To give you an idea how loud it was, I heard it clearly whilst walking on the strip between the bellagio and ceasars palace the following night. On requesting a room change the following morning, we were promptly changed to another identical room - but facing another side of the hotel, 30 levels higher. From here, you could still occasionally hear the train but was far far more bearable, and slept well from then on. The hotel is itself is fine; only just off the strip, no more than 5 minutes walk, so no problems at all. Happy hours(s) at the bar every night, 5 dollars for cocktails. I generally enjoyed my stay, but unsure as to whether Id recommend due to the noise. Please please make sure you request a room away from the tracks if you do stay here!

Let's start with Michael, the bellman who advised me that taking the SEPTA train during rush hour would get me to the Amtrak station more quickly than a cab and gave me exact instructions about how to get there. At the end of the day, I got on the train and was tapped on the shoulder by none other than Michael the bellman, who happened to be on my train and said he was glad that i made it. He even told me when it was time for me to get off the train and, once at the station, which way to go to get to Amtrak asap. If that's not four-star service, i don't know what is. Also, when i ordered room service, it arrived so quickly that i actually thought they had made a mistake and perhaps that was someone else's meal; no it was mine! I also had a great sleep -- very comfy bed and totally quiet, even though at the airport. Typical Marriott decor (i.e., nothing special.) Only downside was that my colleague found the meeting/catering staff difficult to deal with, partly because they were off-site. Great being attached to the airport -- you can walk across to terminal B.

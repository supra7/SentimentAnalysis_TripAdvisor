I agree with most of what's been said here, this is not as nice as many of the big-city Marriotts we've stayed in. Ugly lobby, one lone check-in person moving at a snail's pace (it was 9:30 pm), no one to greet us or help with bags, dirty elevator, scratched front doors, etc., etc. It does not feel like a luxury hotel, by any means. We have also stayed at the Westin at the other end of the Copley Place Mall, and it's much nicer (and usually more expensive). But for the right price, it certainly fits the bill if you're not looking for a particularly special experience. Pros: extremely convenient location, central to businesses, adjacent to the Copley Place mall, which has the usual assortment of high-end stores. Good grocery store, Shaw's, directly across the street for odds and ends, and a decent wine selection. Our room, 2923 @ $249/night, was on a corner on the concierge floor (free food) and had large panoramic windows with a great city view - we watched a thunderstorm. Large room, plenty of storage. Helpful concierge, car rental right in the lobby. I also appreciated a 3 pm checkout, and the hotel was completely full; prompt bell service, brought fridge to room quickly for no charge. Mostly responsive staff. Cons: basic motel-like bathroom, shower/tub combo not very elegant, tired decor, extra charge for internet. My biggest complaint is the deferred maintenance and outdated look of the place.

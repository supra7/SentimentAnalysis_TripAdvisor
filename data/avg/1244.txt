We stayed 3 days at the Doubletree Hotel in July 2006. The front desk staff were grouchy, uninterested and not pleasant to deal with. We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel. We were quite surprised as this was the only hotel during our two week Washington State vacation that did not provide a fantastic experience. Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable and spacious. I would not stay at a Doubletree Hotel again. It must be an unhappy place to work because it sure comes through to the customer. Spend your money at a hotel that does not see guests as interruptions in their day.

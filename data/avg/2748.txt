My friend & I stayed at Hotel 91 in Chinatown for 1 night ~ Saturday, 9/27/08. I read the reviews here religiously to make sure I chose wisely & was prepared for everything. We chose this hotel b/c it is literally 1 block from where our bus drops off/picks up. So, for our purposes the location couldn't have been better. We arrived in NYC at an unexpected 6am! The bus driver had a lead foot. Happily, our room was available & we went right up. It was eery that the entire first floor was vacant, nothing but empty tiny shops with glass windows. It was a pain in the @$$ that check-in/out was on the second floor - just added 1 more thing you had to do when coming in creating an unecessary ripple in what would ordinarily be a smooth arrival. The staff were incredibly friendly (& gorgeous) throughout our entire stay, including my phone calls to confirm our reservation, as well as another reservation I made for October which I had to switch around, then ultimately cancel. Our room was nice - the walls were bare - something I'm not used to seeing, but I guess I prefer nothing as opposed to tacky, cheap art on the walls. The Manhattan Bridge was right outside our window & we naturally heard the trains, but it wasn't enough to be a bother. The bathroom was beautiful, but while unpacking my travel case I saw some dried-on brown gunk near the faucet, which I was able to remove w/ my fingernail. Now for the shower...while my friend was taking a shower I heard this loud Clang!!, followed by her laughing - thank god. She burst out in a towel & asked me, "Did you hear that?!" The handle that controlled the water flow/temperature had fallen off & into the tub. This made adjusting the water temperature a nightmare. We could shove the handle back on & adjust the temperature slowly, but it took forever. The A/C worked great, but that D@*%^D remote gadget was ridiculous. It looked like something you could use to fly a spaceship with. Why the need to be so complicated? It sucked that we were only provided with 1 tall cabinet to store our clothing. This closet only had 3 hangers & a small shelf at the bottom. My friend ended up keeping everything in her suitcase - just not enough room to accomodate clothing/shoes for 2 people!!! The beds were like a dream - probably the 2nd best hotel bed I have ever slept in. The linens were pristine & the beds came w/ 4 pillows!! That was a fantastic bonus. I'm used to just 2 crappy pillows - I lay there wishing I had 2 more....this hotel made my wish come true!! Very clean & superbly comfortable. Overall our stay was very nice. However, when I returned home I realized I had left my camera's battery charger plugged into an outlet in the hotel room - I even have a picture to prove it - take a look & see! I made numerous phone calls to the hotel regarding this & while they were very nice & promised to leave a note & call to let me know either way, etc. etc. It resulted in nothing - not even the phone call they promised to let me know whether or not they found it. I've since replaced it, but that lack of effeciency & customer service is troubling. Overall we enjoyed our stay & would go back - the price was decent for what we got ~ $199. And, if anyone stays in room 403 & sees my battery charger in the outlet by the television - tell the front desk asap!! :)

Pros: Looks good, comfortable beds, free and fast Internet access, free light breakfast, kitchenette. Cons: It's not done yet, location, design instead of function, inconsistent housekeeping, security of building. Tough to love or hate this place. It's stylish in an IKEA and black paint sort of way. Our bed was comfortable, and the front desk staff was pleasant. Breakfast of muffins, fruit, yogurt, juices, and hot beverages was very good. Microwave and fridge in room a plus. However, as others have stated, the location is at the fringe of a neighborhood that may not be expected when booking a trendy, boutique hotel. Windows shades let in a lot of ambient light. Housekeeping, in our case, consisted of bringing more towels, making up the bed, and calling it a day. Soap was never replaced (4-day stay), and floor was rarely, if ever, swept. Dished piled in sink for 2 days. No reading lights. Bathroom poorly equipped -- no real shelf, and only 2 small towel hooks. Workers are still finishing meeting rooms and final touches in common areas. Maybe the building gets locked up after we were in for the night, but from what we saw the front and side doors were unlocked and the elevator never required us to swipe our key card for floor access. There is no restaurant (which many sites list as a current feature) but they say there will be one this autumn. Most travel sites have this classified as a 3 or 3.5 star property, but I struggle to see how it qualifies.

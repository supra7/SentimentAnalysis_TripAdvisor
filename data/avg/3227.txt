The only pro for this hotel was the free parking part. We parked our car and took the bus for travelling around. Its not very far from the famous "Miracle Mile". I did not like walking from the bus stop to the hotel at all, even at day time.The hotel has a great lobby, but the charm of the hotel kind of ends there.The rooms were just ok. We had the back parking lot view from our room- so you can take it as no view. We did not have a central ac but a window one, which is fine. The bed as such was good, I had a good night sleep. The blanket was dirty and I never used it. The bathroom was fine, the shower horrible. Towels were neat. They can order pizza for you from the hotel, we never had that. Chicago is filled with amazing places to eat, why eat hotel pizza? The front desk staff were very amiable. We booked it through priceline and it was good for the price. I am not sure about internet connection though. All in all if you are in a group filled with fun people and plan to just get in to sleep and park your car then this hotel really suits you.

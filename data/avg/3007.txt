After reading the exceptional reviews we were very disappointed in this hotel. We stayed for 10 days and feel that we had time to make a better judgement than the previous reviewers who had stayed for a matter of a few days. On arrival our reception was not as welcoming as we had been led to believe. The receptionist was only interested in selling us tours and lost interest when we told him this was not our first visit to Venice. We had an upgrade to a room overlooking the square which was adequate but hardly up to the glowing reviews and certainly not 5 star. rather gloomy and a very hard bed. The cleaners did a wonderful job and could not be faulted. The breakfast was no more than adequate, same thing every day without any variation. The orange juice was awful, watered out of existence. You had to buy squeezed orange juice from the bar. tea making faciities did not include coffee. We had to buy instant coffee and fresh milk. the milk they supplied (on request) was UHT.) The waiters were a little friendly and the cleaners also. 2 receptionists (Mario and the young man with the red hair and beard) were the only ones who were helpful and friendly. The tall guy with the glasses on was downright miserable. The hotel is very interesting but generally does not warrent all these rapturous reviews. I can only think that they have not experienced 4 or 5 star hotels. Venice itself is not the Venice that we knew 7 years ago. I know it is in a state of being restored and that can not be avoided, it badly needs it, but the masses of people arriving on the cruise liners is apalling. Everwhere is crowded from dawn to early hours of the morning. I'm afraid we wont be going back to Venice. It is so expensive, can you believe 1 euro 50 cents to use a loo. It's back to the Mediterranean for us. Venice has lost it's way and it's romance in it's rip-off quest for money.

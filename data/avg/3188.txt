We picked this hotel based on the great reviews in TripAdvisor. In line with previous comments, it is true that the location is great and the roof terrace is a wonderful place to have breakfast and afternoon tea. However, Uzen, the owner was only present briefly for 1 day--other than that the staff ran the hotel. The desk clerk we found to not be very forthright with us, and his English only seemed to lead to confusion. We complained about the odors from a drainpipe in our bathroom and nothing was done to alleviate the problem. We complained that the bathtub was not draining and it was not addressed. The room was so cramped that it was difficult to find a place to put our 2 bags. Last but not least the wireless, which was important to us was sporadic at best and completely stopped working the last 2 days of our stay. Maybe, if Uzen took more care to be present and oversee her business, these complaints could have been resolved.

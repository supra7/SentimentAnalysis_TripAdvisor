Beautiful hotel, but our room was not properly clean. Loved: the huge bathtub, quiet place to return to after gambling, friendly staff. Hated: the dirty bathroom floor, resort fee, room service was horrible, trekking through the mall each day to get to the action on strip. Keep in mind there is NO casino in this hotel, you do have to walk about 10 min through mall, or around it, to get to strip. Our room was nice and large. The tv in the bathroom mirror was nice.

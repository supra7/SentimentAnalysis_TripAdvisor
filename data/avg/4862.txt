I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton while in Chicago for a trade show at McCormick Place. The lobby is glamorous, theres a Starbucks on the main level, and the food at nearby Corner Bakery Caf is really good, but thats where my praise of this hotel ends. After being checked in, I wasnt directed to the elevators. I figured they would be easy to locate, but I actually had to find a hotel staff member to point me in the right direction. Once I got to the right floor, the halls and room numbers are confusingly laid out. The room was clean, but nothing special. The worst part of the experience was the business center. I needed to print meeting materials and make copies for the tradeshow booth, and while the computer had my credit card and was charging me by the minute and for printing, neither of the printers would print anything! I had to call a 1-800 number to talk them through the situation to get a refund for what was charged to my credit card. The copier was also broken. I ended up standing in line at the FedEx Kinkos at McCormick Place to get the materials what I needed. What a hassle!

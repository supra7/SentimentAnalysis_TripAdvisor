The hotel is under construction and the lobby is almost gone! The front desk can only accommodate 2-3 staff members so be prepared for a LONG wait checking in/out or to simply ask a question. While my spouse checked in, I went to ask the concierge for directions to a nearby restaurant that we had selected for dinner. There was no concierge at 8 P.M. on a Wednesday night. I then turned to the bellman who was very rude. Smokers line the walkway into the hotel so there is a smoke fog all the time. The room was ho-hum sand-colored Sheraton with no extras or frills. It had the minimum of niceties with a small predictable bathroom. We attended a reception in the Presidental Suite and the upholstery was so worn it was in shreds!!! Our room was not clean and the linens were not changed after it was requested daily. There were coffee grounds on the bathroom floor that were never cleaned the entire stay. There was an unidentified "something" on the edge of the toliet. I hate to think... We travel a lot and I would not stay here again.

Right across the street from Seatac airport, easy walking distance, they do have a shuttle for those rainy days though. Nice lounge and business center, a pool and hot tub to relax in, nice patio in the back, friendly staff at the desk who remember your name. The worse thing is they allow dogs,even big dogs, that can sometimes spoil a room, some are starting to smell like pets....the desk is always good with moving you to another room if you happen to get one that isn't fresh. Over all, this is a nice to place to stay when flying in or out.

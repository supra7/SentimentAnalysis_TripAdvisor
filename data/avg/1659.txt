My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of October for a business conference. My impression was generally of a crowded, cold, almost impersonal establishment, and a pricey one at that. It was the first hotel that we have been at that could not honor a reservation request for a king bed, pointedly emphasizing that the request was just that, merely a request. It's one singular plus is its location; next to the convention center, the gaslamp district, and the ball park. If that location is not important to you, I would seriously consider looking elsewhere.

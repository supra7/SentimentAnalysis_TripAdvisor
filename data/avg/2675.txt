I liked the comfort of the beds, the flow of water in the shower, and the helpfulness of the staff, but that is pretty much it. Aside from the convenient location to the MetroMover, which was all we needed to get to the bayside station. The hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments. It lacks a new television sets. Switching between channels was quite dreadful; the volume was vastly different for every other station. The room was a bit dusty and the coffee station did not have stir sticks. In addition, it did not enough tea bags for two people. With the absents of bath towels in our room, especially after haven already taking a shower, made the experience of drying off a difficult challenge. The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in. We witnessed an arrest by hotel security staff after a man refused to leave the motor lobby. Btw, when you arrive at the hotel, it is quite confusing where the check in is located (2nd floor). In this case, I would suggest more signage for those arriving at the hotel.

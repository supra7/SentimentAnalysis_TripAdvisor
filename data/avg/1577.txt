Just back from a 4 night stay at Boutique Hotel Trevi. Shared a triple room with friends. Can't really fault the room itself, it served our needs (other than the fact that you had to hold the shower head in your hand, but we didn't ask for it to be fixed). Tea / Coffee making facilities would have been nice. Didn't hear a sound from the busy street below, which was great. The only thing that I would have an issue with is the lack of duvet cover over the duvets. There was just a sheet on the bed with a bare duvet over it. God knows when or if those duvets ever got cleaned. It didn't bear thinking about who slept under the same duvet previously without a cover. If you weren't dizzy from the twisty walk down to breakfast, it served our needs adequately. Decent coffee would have been a nice start to the day but as no-one greeted or spoke to us at breakfast, you could only presume that the awful coffee from the vending machine was the only option. The staff at reception were not the friendliest. As we only really went to the hotel each evening to sleep, it served our purpose fine. However, it was quite expensive for what we got.

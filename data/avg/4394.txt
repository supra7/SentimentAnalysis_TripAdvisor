My husband had a training in Harvard and this was perfect location for the purpose. It is WALKING DISTANCE to HARVARD. The hotel has good facilities, a nice lobby and restaurant and shuttles to main attracctions and sites in Boston for free. My kid and I were not so pleased with the hotel choice as we were there for leisure and it is not good for this: it is far from almost everything except for Harvard, no cafes or shops around. And the hotel itself lacks infrastructure: the bar is quite limited, the shop is really a small corner by the reception where they have put some bottles, medicines and chocolates. There is not even a cappucino available at the hotel. In room TV is so limited! Just 35 channels and no one for kids! So, if you have to spend a while inside the hotel, it will be quite boring. Rooms are large, not very new but comfortable. Fridge, minibar and microwave. Bed is very good. Bathrooms are ok. Not luxurious at all but clean and comfortable. Staff is UNBELIEVABLE! They are warm, kind, always smiling, always trying to help. They care so much for you that they come to offer help even when you are not asking them for it. I dont know if it was because my kid and me were wandering along the hotel all day and they are not used to have families (just business people), but they seemed to be delighted to have us (especially my kid) there and they offered warm cookies, cokes and coffee for free all the time. The shuttle used to stop at noon. Once, I had to go to the aquarium at noon and there was not shuttle service until 3 pm: well, they took us to the aquarium just to help us. This hotel has such a great service that they made me love the hotel and the brand even when I usually prefer more luxurious ones. Good for people and for the manager! As a conclusion: perfect for business, great service. If your plan is leisure, pick some other hotel near downtown.

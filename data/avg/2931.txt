I was impressed by the rooftop pool and the location when we booked. Upon arrival, it was a long wait to check in, and when we retrieved our bags from the storage room - the bell person gave us the wrong bag (luckily we are honest -- else someone would be out a lap top). The roof top pool was cool, but small and not really decorated at all. The room was decent, nice bedding, and clean. The "business center" had only 2 computers, which were busy a lot so prepare for a wait. The elevators were antiquated - but functional. If it matters to you that the front desk staff are friendly -- this is not the spot to stay. They barely said as much as hello each time we passed by.

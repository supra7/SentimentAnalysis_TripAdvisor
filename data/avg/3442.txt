It's worth going through immigration to stay at this hotel as opposed to the in-terminal transit hotels. It is a perfect location and means no messing with the queue for a taxi. It is quiet even with take-off and landing aircraft happening next door. It's stylish and modern. However, I've stayed several times since it opened and noted on this recent trip that maintenance and cleanliness is falling down. There are signs of wear and tear and little care. Room sofas and carpets are looking a little grotty; there was damage to the vanity in the bathroom that hadn't been repaired between guests and the bathroom hadn't been cleaned well since the previous guest. I boiled the kettle to tip scalding water over the bath tub. At the moment it still is the best of the airport hotels and breaks up long haul flights in a welcome way but for the price, hotel management need to keep it looking as flash as when it opened. The restaurant offers an extensive buffet (breakfast and dinner). SGD12 for a large bottle of water in the room is slightly extortionate (tip for travellers: a US uni professor - a world expert on water purification - once told me that he rated SIngapore tap water the purest in the world so that cost can be avoided).

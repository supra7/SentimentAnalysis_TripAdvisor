The Bayfront us located on the dock near the convention center. Vert nice hotel, elevators work beautifully, rooms/bathrooms are nice. The pool is functional, but the view from the pool is basically an old rusted Dole ship, but we kne thy coming in. My biggest complaint was Sunday breakfast, party of 6, Fathers day, my wife wanted to sit outside. Big mistake, service outside was not very good. We ordered the breakfast sandwiches and it took 45 minutes.

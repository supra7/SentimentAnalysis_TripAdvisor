Check in was a breeze, as we were allowed to check in a bit early. However, I was extremely annoyed when I heard the single gentlemen next to me get upgraded to a suite, while I had a King room with my wife and infants. What was really annoying is that I am a Kimpton "In Touch" member, which is their rewards program. I will be canceling that membership, as it is obviously worthless. I didn't complain, because if they didn't offer, then the staff must not care and I will not stay again. The rooms are clean and well appointed, with comfortable beds but they are small. The window seats are a nice touch when you want to relax and view the river or skyline. The location is great, as you are at the top right corner of the Loop and near Magnificent Mile. One major complaint, and this is a big one.......cold food Every time we ordered room service or ate in the restaurant, our food was COLD. So, why didn't I complain? I don't send food back, as I fear the reprisals. This hotel could be great, but its the little things that make it miss. Boutique seems to be a nice way of saying, "not quite there yet or not 100% perfect".

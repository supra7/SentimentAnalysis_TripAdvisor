Paid full rate for 4th of July weekend. Rooms are small, bathroom even smaller. Shower curtain had very strong mildew smell. Beds were comfortable and frig in room was nice. Bellhop staff was outstanding no matter who was on shift--helpful and polite beyond the call of duty. Staff in general was top notch. Bartender on night of July 3rd gave great advice for 4th of July events. Elevators were burdensome and slow. I realize it was a holiday weekend, but waited up to 30 mins at checkout to get an elevator on the 12th floor that we could fit on with luggage. Very inconvenient. Business Center in lobby very convenient to print out boarding passes. Hilton Honors members. Will shop around next time in Boston.

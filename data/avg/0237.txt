Excelllent hotel in a very good location. A short walk to Pikes Market and other downtown places, and near the monorail to the Seattle Tower/Needle - well worth a trip and lunch). We were impressed by the Concierge service before we even arrived - Wendy (chef Concierge) kindly emailed me very detailed and helpful explanation of the various ways of getting from Seatac airport to hotel, which were spot on. During our two stays (on the way in to Washington state - 3 night stay, and on the way out - 1 night stay) the Concierges helped us immensly. Top marks for that. Check in was brief and courteous, but a "doorman"? (or perhaps he was just a flunky dressed up to stand around uselessly) watched my wife and I struggle on through the front door (here there are no bellhops) with three suitcases, but didnt even come to hold the door open for us! On the other (side) door, there are several bellhops who are very helpful and courteous. During our 2nd stay, there was a conference going on which took over the upper section of the lobby, where we previously had enjoyed sitting and reading, and which also meant the exit to the mall and train centre next door was locked. Noisy, too, with recpetions going on a lot, drowning out the ablity to hold a conversation in reception at times. Perhaps the hotel should organise a private room for these events. Otherwise, very enjoyable stay, and

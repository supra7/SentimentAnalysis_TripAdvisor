Best features: most rooms have great views, beds are comfy, location, location, location (if you're looking to be downtown with easy walking access to most activities: pike market, waterfront, shopping, restaurants, theatre, etc etc. I found the hotel very dated which could stand a refresh in practically every category (updated rooms would be a great place to start). The fees are pretty high given how dated the rooms & overall decor were. Beware, parking is pricey - $30+/day. Overall: Low marks for value. Rooms are a bit noisy from what seems like thinner than avg walls. Also, if its windy, prepare yourself b/c the building sways! I was told this is 'normal', but still left me with a very uneasy feeling for 2 nights - and I was only on the 16th floor (out of 48!) Nice try on the in-room dining menu for healthy food options, but still found it difficult to find anything tasty and reasonably priced. Suggest taking a short walk to Nordstrom who has a nice restaurant (take out too) with several options: seafood, burgers, etc. all very good. Business features were what you'd expect with high-speed internet in the rooms, good cab service, and decent seating area in the rooms. Staff was friendly and accomodating. if you're travelling on business, then this hotel would be a solid choice. I don't think I would recommend it for leisure travel... unless perhaps, it was part of a cruise package or where you have a short stay and willing to trade value for location, good views, and comfortable beds.

Stayed at this hotel for a business conference, so was very frustrated that no wireless internet was available in the rooms. Wireless internet is available on the first and second floor common areas of the hotel, but you get kicked out at 2am. Internet can be purchased in your room, via an Ethernet cable, but only one laptop can be hooked up at a time. But rather annoying to have to pay for the internet on top of the expensive hotel rates. Otherwise, decent hotel.

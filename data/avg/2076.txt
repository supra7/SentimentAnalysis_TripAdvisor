We have stayed in bungalow 4 days and had nice rest after partying on cruise ship before. It would be difficult to call this place Hotel& Spa. I would rather call this as a small romantic hotel, as Spa is silly. You can get the same "spa" procedures 50 meters from the hotel near the beach paying 5 time cheaper price. Hotel management have no clue what is " a spa". There was not much need for personal pool near bungalow, as open sea was great. If you have no rubber shoes for swimming, I would recommend a beach about 200 m on the left. This is place with nice sand and water. I believe, the best in this place is a chef. Food is excellent. We have bought lobster from the local fishermen and a chef made excellent risotto with our lobster. Be careful renting a car. Car rental companies with the hotel staff doing their best to make you happy. However, be sure to present when giving car back. We been significantly overcharged for gas.

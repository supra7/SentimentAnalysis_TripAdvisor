We took advantage of the very low rates at the Park Plaza Hotel during the Christmas season for a bachlorette party. The front desk sweetly offered to upgrade us to a "two bedroom room" which we thought would be a awesome. Yikes, these are horrible little rooms in the really old part of the hotel, very dark small rooms with small windows looking over a parking lot. Essentially they took two tiny back of the house rooms, took down the wall between them and voila you get a medium sized, ugly room with two baths. Two tiny, moldy rooms that were built in the '50's and not updated. They then switched us to a beautiful room with a view over St. James Street. Big room, big bath, all is well. It was great fun looking out over the twinkly bright lights of the big city and down to the city scene below. Great location for shopping and sightseeing, dining and the theatre district. No Wi Fi in rooms! And just a clunky (maybe dial-up) connection in the rooms which did not fit my late model laptop. There is a fee of $10 to use this connection. Or you can go downstairs in sit in the one corner of the lobby that has Wi-Fi. Not great service for a business oriented hotel. But the price and the location were worth it. Just do NOT book one of those two bath rooms. Convenient parking at a good price ($23) across the street at the Motormart. Au Bon Pan and a couple restaurants in the lobby.

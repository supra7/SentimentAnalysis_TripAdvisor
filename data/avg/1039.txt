As most of us do now we read the previous reviews for the W Seattle prior to booking our stay, so we knew to expect the dim lighting in the hallways, the fee for the internet in the rooms and the trendy bar type scene at night in the lobby. All minor things in our opinion. We booked this hotel based on location, value for money, and the overall appearance of the rooms and amenties. Our room had all the modcons you expect from any hotel these days. TV, fridge, couch, comfy beds and pillows, a huge selection of bathroom amenities, mini bar, and so on. There was even a music cd to play and a trendy clock radio and ipod charger. Unfortunately not compatible to the iphone which would have been really handy. However the housekeeping let us down. For the first 2 nights we had to request them to come and makeup our room after we returned late in the day to find it unserviced. On the third day we actually spoke to the lobby staff and asked them to ensure our room was madeup before we got back as we were going on a day trip and would be tired . The staff not only ensured this was done but gave us a complimentary cheese and desert platter and a card advising they hoped we had a great trip down to Mt Rainier. A wonderful thought which really made up for the previous days lack of service. If we ever return to Seatlle we would look for alternate accommodation as we have never had to ask for housekeeping in all our travels throughout the world and have stayed in hotels with much lower rating and received better service. Overall just an average experience that could have been excellent with better attention to detail. It was very dissapointing to find the room not mad up on day 2 after our request the day before. We thought that after having a problem the staff would have addressed it.

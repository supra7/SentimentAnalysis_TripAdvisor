Stayed at the Fairmont Copley Plaza for 3 nights from 8th July 2009. Very nice hotel and well located. Stayed in Room 136 on 1st floor. The only problem with this room was that it backed onto the generator at the back of the hotel and made a terrible noise. We did ask reception to be moved to be told that each room faced the same way (which was not true). However, we stayed in the room and funnily enough either got used to the noise or just didn't notice it after the first night, so if you do go make sure you ask whether the room is at the back where the generator is. Overall the room, service, cleanliness etc could not be faulted. Did not eat at the hotel as lots of eating places around. Hotel right next to Trinity Church and the Library. If you do visit Boston, the two things you must do is the Duck Tour which lasts one and a half hours and is very enjoyable and informative. This costs 60 Dollars. The other thing is the unofficial Harvard University Tour which is done by students of the University. Again great fun and very informative. A tip is usually given of 10 dollars per person at the end of the tour. Quincy market is the place to hang out during the day and at night where there is the famous food court, street performers, shopping etc. Find Filenes Department Store for discounted designer shopping, it's a must and also visit Little Italy. We visited firstly during the day which was very quiet but a very different story at night (absolutely heaving with people) there are 184 Italian restaurants to choose from. We ate at Piccola Venezia but be warned the portions were huge. Also very beautiful is the public garden which is on the back of Boston Common, both must be strolled through. All in all a great city break. Would definitely recommend.

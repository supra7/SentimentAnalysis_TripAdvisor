We booked a single night before an early flight through Priceline but was a bit aprehensive after reading some of the reviews. As it turns out the room was basic but just fine. Overall the room was clean and there was a wonderful oatmeal/almond soap in the shower. The front desk clerk was very helpful when we arrived and offered to print our boarding passes for us (no business center). The only con is that I asked for 2 extra pilows but there was only one available at 10pm.

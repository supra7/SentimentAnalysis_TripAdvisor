We have stayed here a few times now, after long-haul flights into Philly, before continuing our journey the following day. The hotel is pretty unremarkable, but is located close to the airport (with free shuttle bus service) and staff are very friendly and helpful. In our experience, the prices aren't particularly cheap but breakfast is included, There's a Ruby Tuesday restaurant over the road from the hotel, which is very convenient if you have not yet picked up your rental car (which we tend to do the following morning). There's also an ATM/cash-point within walking distance.

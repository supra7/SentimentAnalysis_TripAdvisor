Booked this place between Christmas and New Year based on TripAdvisor recommendations... and not really impressed. Having spent over $2,500 on 2 rooms for 4 nights, I would have expected more than a room tinier than my own (tiny) bedroom at home, chipped finishes, broadband that hardly ever worked, and one bottle of mineral water for the entire stay. The staff were friendly enough, but the overall impression was, well... just so-so. I can't say I hated it, I can't say I loved it. On the plus side, the location is great, in the heart of the Lower East Side with many cool bars and restaurants nearby.

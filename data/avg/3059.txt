Terrific location. We are walkers so we were able to go anywhere we wanted from the hotels central location. We wheeled our suitcases from the train station (3 minutes) into the hotel. Room was a good size for european standards. It was updated and modern. View wasn't that great but we weren't there to look out the window. Breakfast was average and there were lots of choices. I am not sure if garbage day is every day but it seemed like it. 7AM we could here the garbage being picked up. Staff not overly friendly but efficient. All in all, a good hotel.

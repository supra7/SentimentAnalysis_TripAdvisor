This is our 2nd trip to the Westin Seattle. I guess I feel it is getting a bit tired as the sheets are a bit pilly, the towels are slightly threadbare ~ you know...just showing a bit of age. However, the staff here is excellent and we have great service and love to come on our annual trip away from the kids. I suggest a room above floor 20 to get away from the potential noise from the monorail. Housekeeping has been lacking in the recent hotels I have stayed in but here - they got it right! So impressed with the housekeeping. The TV is crummy and unless we were doing something wrong, all the channels are in analog, therefore it looks terrible. The 5th Ave., Cafe in the lobby is actually really good and handy if you are needing something quick and tasty before heading out for the day - they have it all from oatmeal to omelets to eggs and cereal. Again, staff there is super friendly. The lounge was good for a couple drinks - DO try the Dungeness Crab Mac n' Cheese - REAL CRAB.... and tasty....skip the calamari - ick. This location is right around the corner from EVERYTHING downtown. We never bring a car and we hit all the major Seattle hotspots. There is an AMC movie theatre at the mall around the corner that sells $3 Microbrew beer! There is a pizza joint a couple blocks away (Serious Pie) that will make you re-think your traditional pizza and come begging for more. The shops are all close, live theatre and Top Pot Donuts for warm fresh donuts! All in all, this is a good place and we will certainly come back ... it is like staying at your aunt's place in the spare room ... nice and clean, friendly but nothing outstanding or new. A little dated but comfortable and predictable.

We stayed at Rodeway Inn for one night. I had to take my licensing exam in Philadelphia. My friends came along with me. Check in was very easy. Staff very friendly. Hotel receptionist discounted the parking right across the street for us, so it cost us 10$ for 24 hours, which was awesome! Location is great. Lots of small cafes and restaurants around. City Hall is only 3-4 minutes away, as well as the subway station. The area is very safe and very pretty - right on the border of historical Philly and downtown. Cute tiny streets with brick houses are right around the corner. Starbucks across the street. We had two rooms reserved. One was facing the street and the other one in the back. The first one was significantly better as it had high ceilings and huge windows. Although the rooms are pretty small and very simple, they have a flat screen TV, hair dryer, fridge and a coffee maker in. I have not looked for an iron, but I am sure it was there too. The rooms are pretty clean, the bed was super soft and comfortable. Hotel is situated in a very old building, therefore the elevator is funny and the hallway/staircase is very old fashioned, which actually added on some charm and coziness, as we all like older hotels:) Overall we would recommend this place for stay. Friendly staff, great location and small, but cozy rooms.There is also a continental breakfast which unfortunately we have not checked out.

THis hotel suffers from what I call the "priceline phenomena". I did get the room on priceline. Kaanapali is very busy with many large hotels. It reminds me of some large resort areas in Mexico. Not really my idea of a restful vacation. The luau was awesome and worth every penny. They have recently reformatted it so do see it. The food at the luau was suprisingly good. The breakfast buffet was lousy. Take a walk to Whaler's Village and have breakfast there. The rooms were OK. The hotel is kept up as well as one could expect given its age and exposure to salty air. The workout room was very nice but it is irritating to have to pay a resort fee then another fee to access the spa...what is that? But the hotel seems in a bit of disprepair generally and I think this goes hand-in-hand with having to discount your rooms on priceline. Same goes for the Hyatt in Irvine, CA. Overall it is what I would expect from a priceline hotel. But I keep comparing it to one of my favorite hotels, the Hyatt on Kauai, and there is just no comparison.

The location was superb, right in passeig garcia, close to all the shops, restaurants, bars, and the plaza catalunya is just less than 5 minutes away. The room was stylish and the bed was good. Room looks nice and quirky (no bathroom walls) which I found quite impractical. Small sink, no vanity cabinet you end up putting your stuff in the bath tub. Having no bathroom door means that as soon as you got out from the shower cubicle you are greeted by the cold air from the air conditioning.

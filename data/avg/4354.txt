In short summary, the lobby was nice, friendly check-in, common areas nice (but a bit dusty) the room was a good size (a little worn) and the bathroom was small. But in the city who is going to stay in their hotel room the whole time. Excellent location, prompt valet service. Prefer other Boston Hotels, but would stay here again.

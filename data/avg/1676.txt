Nice megaplex Hilton. Over 1000 rooms and decent lobby area. My problem was being told my room with "a great view" was in a corner with half of the outside obstructed by the adjacent rooms and the hallway window with the guests able to see directly into my room. I called the front desk and was assured the window tint did not allow guests to see inside. This explaination was at the same time a woman was waving back at me while I was trying to get her attention. I then asked for a room change but, was denied due to the hotel at max. capacity despite checking in 10 min. ago.

Hotel Curious tries to be hip and fresh, but really it was quite standard to me. Everything was fine, no problems, but everything was just basic. Kind of looks like the dcor is all from IKEA. Theres nothing wrong with that, but thats just what it reminded us of. I was sort of put off right from the start when I was checking in. Having just come from outside, obviously, and being tired and sans makeup, I left my sunglasses on. After talking to the front desk guy for a few minutes, all of a sudden he got all flustered and said he couldnt talk to people with sunglasses on and that its inappropriate, and wouldnt continue talking to me unless I took them off. I felt like he was scolding me or something and it was really strange. Up until then he had been nice though. The room, again, was basic and fine. The bed was comfortable for me as it was on the soft side. The free breakfast was the highlight for us. Really tasty meats and cheese, hard boiled eggs, croissants, delicious peaches, melon, cereal and yogurt. The hotel is located just off La Ramblas, about a minutes walk. This is good and bad  good because the Metro station is close if you need it, bad because you have to cross that annoying sea of people if you want to get to the other side. If I were ever to happen to stay in Barcelona again, I would give somewhere else a try.

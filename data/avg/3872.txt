I was looking forward to staying at The Point Orlando because of the pictures I had seen on their website. I must say, I was disappointed. The room was not well maintained. The shower curtain was stained and had snags all over it and the bathroom counter didn't appear very clean either. The sheets on the bed were clean, so we stayed. We had only booked it for two nights before moving on to Disney. On a positive note, it is very conveniently located to Universal Studios. I believe this is a time share resort and I can definitley say we would NOT buy this timeshare!

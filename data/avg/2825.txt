Stayed at this hotel for one night during a business trip in Amsterdam. My single room: - Small - Too dark (bring a flashlight) - Bed not that comfortable. Breakfast was OK with most of the expected food items. Location is excellent. It is situated on the P.C. Hoofstraat shopping Street. Within walking distance from Rijksmuseum, Leidse Square and Vondel Park. For shorter stays this is an OK hotel.

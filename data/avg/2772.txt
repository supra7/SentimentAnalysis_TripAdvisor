We stayed here for five nights in Feb-March 2011. I must admit we had high expectations of this leg of our trip, being Hollywood after all! Unfortunately, we soon realised that Hollywood Blvd is not all we hoped. We found it to be quite dirty, seedy and definitely did not feel safe walking around late at night. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the heart of Hollywood so it is easy to see the famous sites. We arrived the day before the Oscars so the street was mostly blocked off but it was good to see everything set up and we walked along the red carpet at Kodak theatre (no celebrity spotting, sadly!) We hired a car which was great because we could venture out of the city along the coast and we spent a day at Malibu, Universal studios, Warner Bros studios (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!) and Six Flags theme park. There is also a great shopping centre close by called The Grove which has lots of nice restaurants. Back to the hotel, we found it a bit challenging to drive out of the carpark as North Highland avenue is extremely busy all the time. There is a small supermarket/liquor store and pizza restaurant across the road which came in handy. The breakfast at the hotel is very nice and the staff are helpful. Our room was average, overlooking the dreary streets of LA. I think we were just disappointed overall because we hoped Hollywood would be nicer, but in terms of the hotel itself and the location, we would recommend to anybody keen to visit LA. I think given the little time we actually spent in Hollywood, if we returned we would stay elsewhere further out. I highly recommend hiring a car to get around. The Blvd is bustling with action, characters and tourists but not nearly as "glitzy" and "glamourous" as I expected!

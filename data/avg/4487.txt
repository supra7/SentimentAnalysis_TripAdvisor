Stayed here in December 2011. Convenient location. Easy walk to Boston Common. Internal access to Macy's. The room we had had 2 double beds - which were comfortable, The room was clean but carpet was worn and furniture had seen better days. The bathroom was on the small side and is definintely due to be updated. On the upside, the rooom service food was good value and quite respectable. Our daughters have a tendency to order room service wherever we go, they were impressed! Internet was only free in the lobby. There is a computer in the lobby where one can print boarding passes.

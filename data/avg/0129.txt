My fiance and I stayed there while sight-seeing in downtown Seattle for a few days vacation. Rate was about $60 a night which isn't too bad considering the location near downtown where average prices are twice as much. One good thing is that there is some parking available at the motel unlike some other motels in the area. The room was small but adequete and had a musty/cigarette smell but otherwise was clean. Bathroom was small but clean and complimentary soap and towels as well as a shower. As with some other reviews, it is a bit noisy with the traffic and el-train going by but was tolerable since we were close to many of the downtown things we were wanting to go to. If you are looking for a decent deal but not expecting the Hilton--for around sixty bucks it wasn't too bad.

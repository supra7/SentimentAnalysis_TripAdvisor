The hotel is next to the airport which is why we chose it. With 2 kids and an early morning flight, we thoght it would be a convenient and comfortable stay. Boy, was i wrong! The hotel does not have a restaurant on site and all they offer is menu's to close by cheesy delivery places. The pool was closed for repairs for a week. the hotel website did not bother to mention that at all. Our room had a huge, UGLY STAIN on the carpet, the water in the shower did NOT DRAIN well, they provided 3 towels for 4 of us and there was only 1 creamer for coffee. Obviously, the dont care much about details. Other than free Wi-Fi, the hotel doesnt offer anything of value. maybe it will work well for the business traveller, but for families, it's definitely a BAD CHOICE.

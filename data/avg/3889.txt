Maid service is available but if you want the full maid service you have to pay extra to get the room fully cleaned. The beds were made, the garbage was clear (most of the time), but the showers were not cleaned because we didn't pay for the extra full maid service. The kitchen is stocked with almost everything you need to cook. Bring your own herbs and spices; save your take-out packets of soy sauce, salt & pepper packets, you'll need them to flavor your food. Food delivery is available to the hotel. There is coffee and breakfast available for purchase down in the lobby. Internet is not complimentary. Shuttle service to Disney Parks and Universal is available but it's a bus that also goes to other hotels to pick up guests so you're looking at almost an hour to get to Disney when it's just a 20 minute ride to Disney from the hotel.

Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and overall our stay was great.The location is perfect for exploring new york but the standard of cleaning really leaves much to be desired.The staff are pleasant enough when they are not chatting among themselves and the concierge helpful if you need directions etc but the whole impression this hotel gives is a slovenly unprofessional couldn,t care less one.If they dont raise their standards of housekeeping and customer service i am afraid the hotel will become shabby very quickly(this hotel is only a few years old and already it looks tired)The entrance to the hotel hasn.t been swept for what looks like quite a while and the flooring in the bedrooms is badly in need of the dyson treatment. The beds are really comfortable and the bathrooms ok with good showers ,the rooms are a bit small but you don,t go to New York to stay in the room.Visited the excellent Thai restaurant just across the road and can highly recommend it although there is an italian restaurant adjoining the hotel.Enjoy New York!!

We just got home from a trip to Las Vegas with our kids. My dad lives there so we visit fairly often. The Trump Hotel rooms really are lovely. We had a one bedroom suite that had all we needed for a family of four. That's really all they have to offer, though. The service was not great. Housekeeping failed to come to our room the first full day there. They stopped by the next morning to ask us when we'd like the room cleaned. We gave them a time and returned to our room in the late afternoon to find they had not come. Since there is no casino, not much choice for restaurants (and when I wanted to eat something at 11 AM, neither was open) and the spa is insanely overpriced, we had to leave the hotel to do anything except go swimming. The pool is nice (but no frills). I left wishing we had stayed at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay which also offers one bedroom suites. It would have cost us a bit more but I would have left much more satisfied. Better pool, better location, better customer service, more choices for eating, close proximity to a casino with the quiet lobby that's better for kids.

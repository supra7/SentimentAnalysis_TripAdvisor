The front desk staff were very friendly and very helpful. I booked a rate that was a $20 higher but it included breakfast, internet and parking. As it's so close to the airport they charge for parking so it's worth the extra in the rate for it to be included. The room was fine. It looks very tiered because they have used browns everywhere, It wasn't actually as bad as it looked at first glance. It is very close to the airport, rooms on one side are looking directly at the airport gates. You can hear the aircraft taking off from inside the room.

...this favorite hotel is starting to show it's wear. Lobby and common areas are still quiet, clean, beautiful attention to detail, with fragrant air pumped into Lobby. However rooms are starting to show wear and tear. Disappointed in the suite we stayed in last trip (we stay regularly for business) and furniture was in need of some attention. Bed was creaky, carpets in need of cleaning, hair in tub, dents and small nicks in furniture show some lack of attention. Will I stay again? Sure, but hope we see these uncommonly lovely and large rooms back to their original elegance.

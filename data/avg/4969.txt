We got a great deal on a room at the Palmer House so decided to stay there. It was clear, upon check-in, that you get what you pay for. Our room, a Studio, was tiny. I'm not kidding -- I know people with walk-in closets bigger than the room we had. It was long and narrow, with one full-size bed located right inside the door. Past the bed, they had crammed in all of the furniture that they put in regular sized rooms. One dresser would have been fine -- we really didn't need the desk and chair across from it, because you had to move the chair away from the desk to open the bureau drawers. The only other issue was the feeling of a constant crowd in the hotel. The only time I have ever had to stand in a long queue, literally snaking between velvet ropes to register, was when we went to Las Vegas. The Palmer House Hilton had the same feel as a busy Vegas hotel --- all hustle/bustle and no elegance or personalized service. We were awakened both nights, once at 2AM and the next night at 4AM, by screaming teenagers coming back from partying. Since the bed was right by the door, we could hear everything in the hallway, which didn't exactly make for a pleasant night's rest. My advice -- stay there for the location, and the price if you can get a good deal on the web, but beware!

We stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Changi at the airport in Singapore on the final night of our 3 months holiday of Europe. This hotel is convenient for a 1 night stopover. The shuttle train from the airport terminal to the hotel was good but on arrival reception was hard to locate. Reception was very dark and not helpful after a long flight from Frankfurt. The room was OK accessed through a long open verandah through very hot humid conditions. we had dinner at the restaurant and this was not nice but very expensive. Service was very poor. Breakfast was a disaster and we found it very hard to find suitable foods. We have been in Asia before and have not had this trouble. We are probably too choosey after staying at magnificient hotels during our holiday and our comments should not deter anyone from staying there for convenience to the airport. It was a complete let down for our last night.

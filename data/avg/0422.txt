Wife and I used Marriott points to stay 3 nights in downtown Seattle. The room was OK, nothing special. The bed was very stiff and uncomfortable. We both had trouble sleeping most nights. Bathroom shower is outdated. Hotel undergoing major renovations. Hotel Gym was fine. Hotel is at top of a substantial hill, so get prepared if you are going to walk around Seattle. Hotel is in good location in proximity to most things in downtown. If you don't care to walk, the City buses are free to ride pretty much anywhere downtown.

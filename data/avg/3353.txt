Great Value Hotel for Tokyo I have stayed at Shinjuku Vintage many times since 2000 with the last stay in October 2006. Not much has changed over the years. Hotel still looks the same and the condition has been maintained the same, so looks exactly the same as it did in 2000! Clean and tidy,Only change to the hotel which I have welcomed is broadband access now available in all rooms free of charge. You just ask at reception for the cables which come in a small clear plasic case, that's Japanese packaging for you! When you leave, you just leave it in the room, no need to remove it and take it back to reception on check out.Yes, the rooms are small but do remember this is Tokyo with some of highest real estate prices in the World. I have stayed in other hotels in Tokyo with larger rooms but also with corresponding larger hotel bills. Walking through the Kabukicho (red light district) to get to the hotel can be a bit intimidating at first but you soon become accustomed to it. There is no problem with personal security at all. Loads of cheap 24hr eateries (yoshinoya, matsoya etc)within 10 mins walk if jetlag has got the better of you.As to not having a local shop, I am not sure how well the other reviewer looked around.... if you turn left out of the hotel, there is a 24hr supermarket less than 50metres away!Overall I can recommend this hotel to anyone who just needs a clean and convenient place to stay in Tokyo. Being located in Shinjuku, 10 mins walk from JR station, it is a great place to base your holiday in Tokyo as Shinjuku Station has connections to everywhere in Tokyo and beyond.You pay for what you get and based on this you cannot go wrong.

This hotel is beautiful and the staff is attentive. Our concierge was wonderful. The room was good size but there was really no place to sit except the bed. A sofa would have been nice. The food in the restaurant and in room service was average at best and there are very few amenities. For $400/night I would think they might have a swimming pool or a spaor even gourmet dining. The location was great, but there are other (less expensive) hotels in the same location. We will be trying one of those out next time. I would not pay more than $250/night for this hotel.

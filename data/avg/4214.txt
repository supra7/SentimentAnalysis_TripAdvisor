I found my room to be somewhat dark and gloomy but I suppose that relates in part to the age and historic ambiance of the hotel.The garage parking was expensive,$44 per day.Also they charge for internet access and local calls.The staff however were helpful,especiaaly the concierge Frank Gallagher.He recommended Old Town Trolley Tours who were excellent.

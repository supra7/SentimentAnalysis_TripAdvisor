My husband stayed here on business quite some time ago, and everything was excellent. This time, we were not as impressed. The service was still excellent. And they have complimentary wine in the lobby for an hour each evening. That was nice! And the location is great -- walking distance to Pike's Market and lots of shopping. One of the first things I noticed when we got to our room was that the upholstered chair next to the bed was in tatters. No kidding. In at least four places it was not just threadbare, but literally torn down to the stuffing. For a hotel of this quality, this is completely unacceptable. Perhaps one of their doggie-guests been chewing on the chair. That's another thing. We didn't realize it was a pet-friendly hotel. I don't know if that's a new thing, but my husband never saw any pets there the first time around. Maybe because it was during the week, and this time we were there on a weekend. I'm fond enough of dogs, but I don't really want them staying in the hotel rooms that I stay in. However, it's my fault for not noticing the pet-friendly tags on their website beforehand. The dogs were well-behaved overall. There were several in the lobby off and on, and we heard barking twice from our room. Lastly, the weekend rate in February was a great deal, we thought. But that was before we added in the cost to valet park. It's posted $36 a night, but with taxes it was about $44/night. So be sure to figure that when you're looking at room rates.

Very clean and modern hotel. We slept in a small suite. Friendly staff. Food ordered through room service was good. The spa is nice, very clean and attractive with welcoming staff. The massage (for an extra fee) was very overpriced and not good quality. Another negative point: the room was cold and nothing was done to heat it... This explains the lower grade, otherwise I did not observe any other flaws in this hotel.

Trip: 7-26-05 to 7-29-05 The best thing about this hotel is the main lobby floor and the cafe/bar. It's beautifully decorated and high windowed ceilings make for a nice place to have breakfast. The location is good but we spent more time in Wicker Park and the Gold Coast so I would probably stay in the GC next time to save on cab fair. The doormen at the hotel with the exception of one grumpy old guy were the best service people in the hotel. They were quick to open your door or hail you a cab - even in the pouring rain. However, the front desk people were unresponsive and didn't do what they said they would do. Really young people running the show who didn't seem to care about the service they provided. The bar closes really early which is unfortunate since like I said it's the best part of the hotel. The rooms are terribly tiny even though we had a nice view the bed was so close to the entertainment center which had faulty doors. Not what you would expect from a $250/night room. But Chicago is great and the people are super friendly!

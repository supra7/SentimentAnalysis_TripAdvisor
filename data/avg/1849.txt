Just left the Hyatt after a three night stay on March 5 as part of our honeymoon. The place it not bad, but it's nothing special either. Staff shrugged when I asked why the Kanaapali beach was only six feet wide. They said there had been storms in the fall that washed away most of the sand! Minor detail for a beachfront property, I guess To adapt the resort puts its chairs and cabanas on terraces set back from the beach!! Also note that much of the beach has rocks underneath the water with sharp edges. I have been to hundreds of beaches without issue and I sliced open my toe at this one! To the Hyatt's credit, their security team was efficient in patching me up, but was frustrating nonetheless. A few bright points, though. First, the room service was exceptional -- some of the best we have had, and I have stayed in hundreds of hotels worldwide. We ate breakfast of kings beautifully presented, looking out on the ocean and the food was full of flavor and very fresh. Second, the pools and facilities looked like they would be great for families/kids and the golf arrangements also looked great. Third, the concierge actually answered the phone promptly almost every time we called and had useful info. Apart from that, the property felt like a large Holiday Inn. The hallways are dingy, ceilings in the rooms are low, colors are very corporate (white/tope/black basically), bathrobes are made of polyester and the amenities are just standard. The bed and pillows were satisfactory, however. Overall, the value is average. Also note that there are NO EXTRAS included with your room rate. Resort fee of $15/day for basically nothing, cabana rentals are $40/day etc. etc. Towels, however, are free, fortunately.

This is my go-to hotel for business trips to Chicago. The rooms are clean and well designed, though the concrete ceiling is a bit off-putting at first. Depending on the room, though, the views can be tremendous (or you can be seen through the floor-to-ceiling windows by the people in the offices/apartment building across the street). The staff are helpful, but don't expect them to remember your name, no matter how often you stay there, and I certainly would not call them friendly. Ultimately, the hotel is clean and it's a great value for the price, and that's a major motivation for my continuing to stay here.

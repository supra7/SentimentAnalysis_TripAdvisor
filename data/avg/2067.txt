We spent three nights at Hotel Opera and have mixed reviews. We had reserved and paid in advance for a king size bed / room and on checking in were told it wasn't available until the next night - no explanation or apology. The room we were given was tiny and smelled so strongly of smoke that I barely slept. We moved to a bigger room the next day and it a bit better and cleaner. The location is terrible for sightseeing. It is close to the train station, but once you've arrived by train you don't need to be in that area - you're going to spend a lot of time walking to the sights and if you're squeamish about walking at night in a city, you're going to be very unhappy. We were glad to have a TV but the stations were really limited without switching to pay-per-view, which is mostly porn (as openly advertised in the bedside pamphlet) so we avoided it all together and were a bit grossed out. On the good side, the breakfast was delicious and the bigger rooms had nice places to spread out / unpack. The staff was very nice and gave us a free mini laptop and internet access so we could check on things at home via email. Overall, stay somewhere else - the Hotel Opera oversells itself. You only see pictures of the suite and the regular rooms are not much different than an American Holiday Inn, smoking is allowed in the rooms and the location is really out of the way.

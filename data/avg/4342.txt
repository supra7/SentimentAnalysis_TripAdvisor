I was pleasantly surprised at my current stay at the Park Plaza hotel. With all of the not so good reviews of this hotel, I was really expecting the worse upon arrival. We arrived prior to check in and had no problems getting into our room ... and were also given maps and several recommendations/directions by the gentleman who delivered our luggage. I would agree that the rooms are probably on the small side, but given the price we paid (through Priceline) I wasn't expecting anything more than that. My only slight complaint would be the air conditioning. As most reviews have written, it was never cold in the room ... the AC definitely kept most of the humidity out, but just never got it as cool as I would have expected. Again, given the age of the hotel ... what can you expect? We were never uncomfortable ... just a little warmer than we would have preferred. As we were traveling on vacation, the location of this hotel was ideal for our stay. It's about a block away from the nearest T station and within walking distance of many tourist locations. Overall, I was very pleased w/ our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone I know traveling to Boston (as well as stay there again myself). I just felt I needed to write a positive review, as I feel the Park Plaza has gotten some unfair negative reviews. I hope this puts any travelers w/ an upcoming stay at the Park Plaza at ease, as I know we were very concerned about this hotel based on other reviews we had read.

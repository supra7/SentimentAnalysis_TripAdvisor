Being new, the hotel has contemporary dcor, dcor is a matter of taste, and the public areas look very nice but reminded me of the new Terminal 5 at London Heathrow Airport and I found it to have a very sterile and clinical feel. As previous reviewers have stated, it is close to the convention centre and Petco Centre. The staff at check-in and check-out didnt really seem to know what they were doing. The self parking car park charge was $22.00, which I felt was a too much. The hotel is in a nice position with great views, but it is too big and way too impersonal and not really my cup of tea.

This hotel is in serious need of some updates. The front desk employees do their job but are not friendly at all. The restaurant employees @ breakfast were very friendly and worked very hard to keep the buffet stocked. The rooms are small and our room was suppose to be non-smoking but smelled as if this was the first time it was used as non-smoking (ashtrays in the room). The floor when we first stepped off the elevator had some type of deoderizer smell that was so strong that you could actually taste it. The TV reception was awful. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I stay @ it again given the choice.

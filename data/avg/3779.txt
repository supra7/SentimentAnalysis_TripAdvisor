Was booked into this hotel by the company paying for my visit. The room was very small and could use some renovation. The walls were thin and I could hear everything in the next room. Only one of the two elevators was working and it was very slow. I ended up getting my exercise by running up and down the stairs. The small exercise room had four machines crammed into it with barely enough room to get around. It didn't feel like there was any air circulation as another person and I were working out. I guess it can serve double purpose as an exercise room and a sauna. The free breakfast was decent and the free local shuttle was great. The free milk and cookies at night was also a nice touch. Housekeeping did not clean my bathroom one day and also forgot to leave any towels. The front desk was pleasant for the most part but gave me conflicting information when I inquired about a shuttle to the airport. The night before I was to depart, I called and front desk and was informed that I can arrange for an airport shuttle anytime and the cost would be $17. The next morning, I ask the front desk to arrange for an airport shuttle. He gave me the phone number but told me that airport shuttles require at least 24 hour notice and it was too late. He offered to call a taxi for me which would cost $40+. So I called the airport shuttle company myself and easily arranged a pickup. The cost...$17. The hotel calls itself an European boutique hotel but has a ways to go.

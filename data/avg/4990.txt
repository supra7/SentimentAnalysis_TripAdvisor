I have stayed at the Palmer House multiple times in the last few years for various conferences. Of the various hotels that I have stayed in while visiting Chicago (I go quite often), I have enjoyed the Palmer House the least. I have never had a truly dreadful experience at the hotel, but I have never truly been made to feel welcome either. When reviewers on this website say the rooms are small, they are not joking. Room size is not something that generally bothers me since I usually travel alone, but I have stayed in rooms that barely had enough space for a full bed and dresser. I will admit that the rooms are generally nicely furnished and that housekeeping does a good (and unobtrusive) job of keeping them clean. I have noticed a change in the attitude of the hotel staff; they have become much more standoffish in the last few years (the previously mentioned housekeeping and doormen/bell desk staff are a laudable exception to this), and they seem to believe that because the hotel has an attractive--though overrated--lobby and is THE Palmer House, you should be grateful that you are allowed to stay. I never feel welcome at the Palmer House, whereas at other hotels in the area that are in the same "peer group," I am always made to feel welcome. However, I must also say that I have never had a real snafu in dealing with the staff either--when I check bags or something like that, everything is properly handled and always ready when I need it. In summary, there is nothing WRONG with this hotel, but I have had more pleasant experiences at similarly priced or less expensive hotels all over the city.

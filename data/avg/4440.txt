As HH Gold member I was given an upgrade, but in reality, it was only a higher floor, not a better room. Room is ok, a little less than average. No executive lounge and the breakfast for HH is in a separate room with a very limited choice. Staff was pleasent. I beleive that for the same $$$, there are better choices in the area

This hotel is appropriate for business travelers who want to stay by the airport. The Qualtiy of the room was fine but the restaurant costs are very high and it costs $22 to park. We booked the room through hotwire to try to save a few bucks and got stuck here (we did not have to stay by the airport). I have learned my lesson about hotwire.

We were a group of 11 celebrating a 50th birthday. As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are very small and our room had no drawers and a minute wardrobe with only 5 hangers, so we lived out of our suitcase. All rooms are twins and because of the size of the rooms, they are virtually doubles because they are so close to each other! The bathroom was also tiny but functional. Couldn't complain about our bathroom - it was clean and the shower as good and hot - but others in our group had problems with a very bad sewage smell and one couple was moved. The hotel did sort out the problem for the other couple and they stayed where they were. You have to pay 7.50 Euros per day if you want tea and coffee making facilities brought to your room. There is no bar; only a small lobby area with a drinks vending machine (soft drinks and lager). The dining room is small and in the basement (serves breakfast only). We had breakfast included in our rate but it isn't worth it really, unless you like lots of bread and jam or cold ham and cheese. There is a very limited choice of cereals, yoghurts and fruit juices but I would personally recommend you go out to eat and use the money you save on not paying the breakfast rate on a decent breakfast elsewhere. The hotel has been decorated in a modernistic style and is quite dark (carpets, ceiling, bedding). If you suffer with poor eyesight in the evening and want to read in bed, I'd recommend taking a torch! The hotel is in a nice area, within easy walking distance of the Rijksmuseum and Leidesplein Square, and some upmarket shops. It is easy to get around on trams from here and only a short walk to grab a canal boat tour or hire bikes. Also within walking distance is the Bols liqueur factory and the Heineken factory. This hotel is OK if you're only using it to sleep in. You can't eat or drink here (except the continental breakfast or the drinks vending machine). There is a lift but this hotel would be useless for anyone disabled.

I had previously stayed at the Palomar Hotel in Dallas many times and decided to try the "other " Kimpton property when Palomar was not available. I agree with previous respondents who commented about thin walls- I was awakened 2 different nights by alarm and phone in the room next door. I did find the service to be quite helpful. I had many faxes coming with a work project and front desk was polite and helpful. The neighborhood around is very nice. Getting a cab can be tough-waited 30 minutes and was late to appointment as did not budget this much time. Room is new and nice although somewhat spartan. Restaurant food is good although service is somewhat slow with only one person serving entire restaurant.

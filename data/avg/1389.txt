I've had a love-hate relationship with Radisson Hotels for decades. The price point at most locations matches many upscale brands (Hilton, Marriott, etc.), but in the end my experiences suggest that the Radisson brand is only average value for the price point. The Seattle Airport location is great if you are doing business at/near the airport. You can literally walk from the terminal to the hotel in under five minutes. The property is clean and well kept, but by no means spectacular. Rooms are generous and well equipped. However, the TV's are old tube sets that are not on par with most other brands. Beds are comfortable. NOW FOR THE BAD PART!!!! This property has, without question, THE LOUDEST ELEVATOR I HAVE EVER HEARD! I arrived at the hotel around 11 PM and noticed the right-side elevator was closed for the night with a sign in front of it that read "Closed for Energy Conservation." Well, that may be true, but the REAL reason they close the elevator is because when it is operating the sound is deafening! I had a room on the 6th floor a few doors down from the elevator and was awakened by the noise when they turned it on around 4:30 AM. I asked to move to a different room and even though the room was considerably further away, you could still hear and feel the noise. Management confirmed that they are aware of the problem but had no idea if they would ever fix it. If you decide to stay at this property use caution and insist on a room far away from the elevator.

My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma for 7 days. The Travel Agency hyped it up so much, however we were disappointed with the service and food. We were to have access to internet wireless in our room, however it was a poor signal even after calling three times to the consierge. I finally ran into an IT person and "fixed" the problem only to have service for less than 12 hours. The service in the restaurants is fair at best except for two to three waiters. (Samuel & Mario were great) At breakfast, I observed waiters hovering around the Spanish speaking residents and ignoring English speaking residents when requiring service. Our room was nice stepping out into a pool shared with 6 other couples. Several of the couples were very nice and friendly. One couple however, choose to swim naked and had sex in the pool. (That type of hotel is just down the road called Desires if that is what they wanted to do!) The food at most of the restaurants were tasteless and very hot inside. The Seaside Grille had the most flavorful foods. with a view of the ocean. One thing I found rude, was we were given small bottles of liquor (rum, vodka and tequila) two nights in a row) Not drinking them immediately, when I went looking for the bottle of rum, all but the tequilia had been removed from our room! One last thought, if you are wine drinkers the wine is awful and a "good bottle" costs extra an is marked up by 500%. Being wine snobs, we brought our own wine and glasses, only to have the glasses disappear from our room. A bottle of sunscreen cost $24 USD. We have stayed in many places over the years in Cancun and found the service here is one of the worse. And when did it get so damn expensive!!

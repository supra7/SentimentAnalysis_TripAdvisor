This hotel is an old 1960's circular hotel, that delivers against the basic Westin Promise: Good beds and linens, decent room for business. The staff were pleasant, and cabs easy to come by. Breakfast in the main floor cafe was above average. No real reason to return, as it was expensive for the age and odd shaped rooms.

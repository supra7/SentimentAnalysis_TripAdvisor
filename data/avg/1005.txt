I should start with a disclaimer. I booked this room on Priceline for $66--with that price I shouldn't complain at all. That being said, there were a few things about this hotel that didn't stack up to my expectations, especially compared with my stays at Hotel Monacos (both in Seattle and elsewhere). The first room we were given (on what I assume was not that busy a night given that they were giving rooms away for $66) was the handicap accessible room right next to the elevator. One of my favorite things about hotels is take a long hot shower with a quality showerhead, and the accessible room has one of those floppy heads. While I'm not usually one to request a new room, I did just that, and the front desk happily obliged. The new room was smaller (not an issue for me) and well appointed. However, it smelled of cleaning products...bad. They must have just cleaned the carpet or something. We left the window open for about an hour, and it didn't do much. We eventually got used to it, but still... Given that I had already requested one move, I didn't want to do it again. My only other issue with the room was that the bathrobes (again, I enjoy my hotel bathing experiences) were very old and worn. The leopard print was faded and the cloth rough. One other note, this is not the hotel to go to for views. As far as I can tell it is pretty boxed in, and you are likely to get views of walls, parking garages, and next door buildings.

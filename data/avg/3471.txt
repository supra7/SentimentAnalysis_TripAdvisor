Stayed in one of the new wings. Make sure you keep to the same lift as they go to different parts of the hotel. Room spacious but very beige, including a beige carpet (not what I was expecting in a country famed for its carpets) with a damp area that was not remedied during the stay. No apology either. The rooms could do with some splashes of colour in the decor. Good size TV though Pay TV did not appear to be available. Adaptor provided in drawer. Chipped spout (!!!) on the teapot for room service breakfast, though at least it had tea leaves and a strainer. Only enough butter for one slice of toast. The extra butter I asked for didn't arrive. I returned at 9 pm and turndown had not been done - Housekeeping said it went on until 11 pm so ask for 'early' turndown if you have young children. Staff by pool area were not forthcoming in offering drinks and didn't clean the table next to me and no snacks were available after 5 at the pool. So, not quite a five star experience all round, in my opinion. Laundry service was good, as was the food at Aqua, the restaurant. Floor was slippery with a puddle of water by the fountain near the spa entrance and the poolside by the indoor pool was also slippery - my children slipped in both areas. Hair salon next to the spa. Good view of the Bosphorus. Good pool with underwater music. I will go back to Istanbul but will be considering alternative hotels.

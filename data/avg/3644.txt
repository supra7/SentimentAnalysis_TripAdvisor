Nice Hotel but needs redecoration. The beds were a bit too soft and the furniture was a little old and broken in places. The bathroom was small and also needed redecoration. The front desk staff were fine. Although the night shift clerk was not very friendly when we checked in. I hope this perhaps has changed maybe he had a bad night?? The surroundings were clean and efficient. This hotel is okay for a night or two and the freeway is easily accessible from hotel.

It is an OK hotel to stay for a night or two but not very boutique, not that luxury and certainly not very WOW as per the W Hotels' mantra of self-gratification. Check in (about 10 pm) was the most underwhelming experience. Not friendly, not informative (no mention of the hotel restaurant, breakfast or gym)  just a rushed credit card - room card exchange transaction. No help with the bags. No tea/coffee facilities in the room: expected a nice espresso machine (not much to ask for in a WOW hotel, is it?) but not even a kettle. Internet is 15 USD for 24 hours. Toiletries were not replenished on one of the nights. Bathroom towels were all of slightly different degree of wear and fluffiness so one gets three shades of white in a bale: from white-white to white-gray. Room was spacious but not sound insulated: could hear furniture opening/closing noises from the room next door and the noise of hotel elevators going up and down. I would not stay at this property again.

I agreed with all the comments on Trip Advisor- it is a bit far for comfort but the 90 bus is really frequent and the 84 goes straight into the Historic Centre. We stayed there as everywhere else was full with John Paul pilgrims. The air con is a bit noisy, the walls are a bit thin and the drains smell a bit but the bed is huge and the TV too. Surprisingly the only TV channels are Italian plus one French news channel. On the plus side there are a string of fine restaurants a few metres away including the superlative Taverna dei Briaganti.

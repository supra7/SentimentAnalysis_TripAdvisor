I stayed for three nights on business. Pros: Overall great accommodations, Good Service, big rooms, freshly renovated, maintained and yummy cookies! Cons: Poor air conditioning. No minibar. Tasteless generic in-room coffee. Horrible location. Taxi required to access practically anywhere. Details: First, the hotel should be called Cambridge as it far from major Boston sites, business and areas of interest. Harvard and other parts of Cambridge are much closer -- but still a bit of a hike for the typical traveler. The nearest transit stop is 3/10th of a mile at the Central stop on redline. To access Backbay and Newberry Street it is a beautiful walk along the banks of the Charles River -- albeit 3 miles away. My room #302 was newly renovated and looked over both the Charles (exterior) and the hotel's 16-story atrium (interior). The room was orderly, contemporary, properly maintained and absolutely huge. I had enough seating for eight guests (too bad I was alone on business). The living room is nice, but I simply did not use. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom average. There is a mini-kitchen with refrigerator and microwave  but no minibar. I agree that a major downside to the room is the climate control, which does NOT cool the room. I f the windows opened this would not be a problem. The result is a stuffy situation. In my room the air also made a loud rattle noise as it ran. Furthermore, beware of the third floor as some rooms sit directly above the hotels award winning destination jazz club. The club is first class and popular with the locals. My room was exactly atop the club and I could hear the beat of percussion and live horns. Luckily management requires the club to shut down at 10 PM.

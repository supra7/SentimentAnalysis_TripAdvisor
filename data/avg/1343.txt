Stayed at the Quality Inn for 1 night (June 9). We arrived late Friday and had no problem finding parking or checking in. The staff were friendly and easy going. The lobby is small and had a few guests watching the TV and using the one computer with Internet access. Our room was one floor up (no elevators) and was clean. The carpet is old but one of the staff commented that management was going to redo all the carpeting. You could tell there was gum and other gunk in places on the carpet but it was more old than dirty. The main floor hallway had a strong smell of smoke but our 2nd floor hallway was OK. Bathroom was simple. The sink and mirror are part of the room. Our room had a microwave and a fridge. Local calls were free. We couldn't hear our neighbors even though it was apparently 100% full that night. That said the building is old and wood-frame so I wouldn't be surprised with some of the other reviews. One of our friends couldn't sleep because of the occasional airplane flying overhead. Breakfast was very simple, with cereal, the standard waffle-iron waffles, coffee and juice. I'd stay again but then I again there are many other hotels in the area so I might try a neighboring one. Overall, no real complaints. It's no Holiday Inn but then it doesn't pretend to be. Clean room, nice staff, cheap rates.

We just returned from a weekend in Boston with my family. I must say this is the ideal location for sightseeing in Boston. You can walk almost anywhere! Right across from the Quincy Marketplace, Freedom Trail, Beacon Hill, North End, etc....Tons of great restaurants nearby. The water taxi to the airport is right there as well as access to the T and bus tours. As an elite member, I had requested a quiet room ahead of time. As well, we asked for adjoining rooms. Previous reviews advised to stay away from rooms that open onto the central lobby and that is where they put us! We did get adjoining rooms, but the music and noise from the lounge could be heard in our room. When I asked about changing rooms, they indicated that we could pay to upgrade to another room. We were already unpacked and didn't feel like lugging our bags over to another room. Marriott needs to treat their Elite members better. As other reviewers indicated, the breakfast buffet was good but $25.00+ is quite pricey when you can walk to other places nearby. We had drinks and appetizers in the lounge one evening and we had two hunt down our waitress a couple of times to order more drinks and finally settle the tab. Health Club looked large and plenty of the usual machines...we were too busy to use it. The pool looked OK....but full of kids. A little mix up with the bill at check-out, but they managed to fix it rather quickly. Overall, there are tons of great hotels in Boston...I will think twice about where I stay next time.

After quite a bit of hassle with Karisma office on our booking and its payments, we were happy with the room and location of the resort. The beach is nice and the bay very beautiful. However, we were not impressed by the quality of the food, to say the least. The drinks available weren of pretty bad quality as well. In general the staff is very friendly and helpful, but we left the resort with a bad feeling because of the following: we brought some cash to the hotel, we couldn't lock it in our safe because we only got the key to the safe on day three of our stay. We didn't realise until after a few days that someome had taken money from our cash, only small amounts each day, but well worth it if you accumulate these amounts. We went to reception to inform the hotel about our suspicions. They initially seemed to take it seriously and investigated the case. Then on the day of our checkout we were told that they did not find any proof that one of their staff members had taken the money, basically they made us feel like idiots and told us to send a complaint to their customer services email address if we wanted. Though we appreciate their initial reaction, the final feeling when we left the resort was one of disappointment, like silly kids being told off and one thing is for sure: we will never ever return to Karisma resorts again.

I booked this hotel because of its convenient location (close to my customer and to the airport), but that's about all the positive I can say about the location. It's based in the middle of nowhere, you can't come out of the hotel just to have a drink in a bar somewhere close. The people are very friendly and the beds are exrtemely large and comfortable. The rooms are comfortable, large in size, good size bathroom, BUT, because of all the white (furniture, walls, lights) it's like waking up in a hospital. My bedside lamps were not working, so I had to switch on the big light in the morning and that's just horrible. Not everything was functionning in the room: phone, bedside lamps, safe. Inconvenient, because i asked a wake-up call! The buffet breakfast was very nice, only possitive things to say about it, but the breakfast room seems more like an IKEA cafetaria. The tried to make a design hotel out of it, but they forgot to give it any character. It's a missed opportunity, because it's a brand new hotel. I will not go back. There's better options in the Madrid area for the same price.

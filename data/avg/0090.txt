Right on top of Pike's Market and close to the 'waterfront' shopping - this hotel is small and convenient, comfortable and cozy. It is not 'the best' - but, it is perfect for 1 or 2 nights stay. Rooms are a little dated and cookie-cutter and bordering on boring - beds are comfortable, bathrooms are functional - but, the hotel overall lacks any signature features or stand-out elements. Service was friendly (Noel was wonderful, and the valet service was speedy and efficient) - however, the hotel needs an injection of warmth and personality. It was just 'ok' and apart from the excellent location - not anything to write home about.

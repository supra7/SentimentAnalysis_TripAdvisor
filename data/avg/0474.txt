We went out to seattle for a birthday party came across this hotel, as we have stayed in the quality inn before in canada. the price was good $119.00 A NIGHT but when my wife and I saw the room it was so small you couldn't move around in it. the bathroom was tiny you could only have one person in it, no couter space and dirty mirror. no closet in room and bad view from window. the biggest thing of the hotel was the INTERNET, i run my own business and there was no signal to the room for internet, had to walk down the hall to around the elevator to get a signal. thats bull when it tells you in the hotel room they have the best signal.lol. the pool was closed. the only thing that was really good is the free parking, breakfast and quiet sleep.

Hotel is starting to fray around the edges a bit, but its clean and the the staff are friendly, so for an overnight stay while catching a flight from Sea-Tac its a very good option. Best thing about this hotel is the distance from the terminal. From the baggage claim you turn right and walk through the far doors, past the local transit bus stops and you can see the hotel in front of you, took us around 5 minutes to walk. Numerous options for food around the hotel, Dennys, I-Hop etc, and 13 coins 24 hour restaurant next door. If you can get a good rate and are only staying to catch a flight then the Radisson will do the job.

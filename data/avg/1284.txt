Okay for the discounted price, definitely not worth the normal $89 - $129 Stayed here 3 nights. Because of all the rotten reviews of this hotel, I was dreading our stay. It was not an outstanding hotel, but I've certainly stayed in worse. Here are my thoughts:Pros - 1. Comfortable bed, lots of pillows, clean linens and towels. 2. The bathroom was clean.3. Toiletries are an extra touch.Cons - 1. Paper thin walls and doors. Expect to hear your neighbors and those in the hallway.2. No wi-fi in the hotel rooms. You have to go to the lobby and sit with your laptop to get internet access.3. The business center consists of one computer in the lobby with NO printer - no way to print, even for a fee.4. On our 3rd morning, we left the hotel early. Came back that evening and the room had not been cleaned, the bed was unmade, dirty towels on the floor, no new toiletries. I called the front desk - was met with rude help. I explained the circumstances. No apology or offer to remedy the situation. I finally asked if I could come to the front desk and pick up some clean towels and the woman at the desk answered, Yeah, that's okay.5. The halls could use better lighting.6. Dirty stairwells.7. No elevator (consider this if you have difficulty navigating stairs, or carrying luggage up the stairwell.)7. On the 3rd evening, the t.v. would not work. They gave us a new room. Then in the new room, there was no keyboard for the t.v. internet.The hotel is located in an industrial district, which did not bother me a bit. Nice coffee shop in the lobby. I paid $55 per night on Priceline. It would not have been worth more, but at that price was okay.

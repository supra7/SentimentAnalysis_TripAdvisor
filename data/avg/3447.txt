This hotel is only convenient if you are planning to depart from Terminal 3 of Changi Airport, if not I see no reason to stay here at all. If your flight is in the wee hours of 4am, there is no sky train to take you to terminal 1 or 2. The airport shuttle is so infrequent, it's best not to wait for it. The best way to get to the other terminals is by taxi, about $10, the hotel can call for you. For those who are on transit, the transit hotel is definitely a better deal and most convenient. The reception at Crowne Plaza is very pleasant but I am qyite disappointed with the room. It's spacious and modern but not clean. There was a used cotton bud at the bathtub (see photo) ! We called and they send the personnel to come and remove it, even offered to clean up the bathtub. But i am already disappointed and definitely won't want to use the bathtub that day. Note that one can still hear the air planes taking off and landing, but it is not deafening.

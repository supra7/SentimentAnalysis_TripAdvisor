Good part= location, beds, chocolate cake at breakfast (!). Bad part= Other peoples' reviews on bathrooms, ie small sinks, no soap holder, bumping onto a shelf when brushing teeth, having to be really comfortable with other half to share this room, all are true. I couldnt agree more. Rooms are not welcoming, ours in particular was pretty small, although with street view. Half of the days the room was perfectly cleaned, the other half not as much. Definetely not luxurious. No luxurious bath products, no slippers, no water bottles in the fridge. Conclusion=This is NOT a 5 star hotel. I'd say it's a low 4 star one. Sorry...

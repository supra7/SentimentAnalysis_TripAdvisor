The lobby and common spaces in this hotel share a beautiful historic charm characteristic of the the epic "Chicago School" style of architecture. The rooms (at least my room) don't quite share same aesthetic at all. The room was quite nice but was uncomfortably mismatched with the historic character of the building. Instead it seemed to be stuck in the early 90's which, I believe, is when the hotel was renovated. Nevertheless, this place is in a great location; the rooms are comfortable if a tad small; and I loved their breakfast tea selection even if the remainder of the complimentary breakfast was a bit sparse. Unfortunately, the animal print robes were tattered and tacky - not at all fitting for a hotel in this price range.

We got our room on priceline for a very cheap rate, so I can't complain about that. I have to say I have been disappointed with our room. AC will not cool room. Shower has absolutely no water pressure. Towels are limp & dingy & threadbare. Mattress is hard & pillows are lumpy. We slept in, so maid service skipped us. We left hotel by 10:30 am. I've never stayed at a hotel that didn't come back & make the room up. We got back this evening & had clean towels (which I requested) but the dirty ones were still piled on the floor! Bed was not made either! Wow. I would NOT classify this as a 4 star hotel!

First of all, I think they gave me the worst room, only a queen size bed, and a room that seemed to be part of a larger suite as there was a adjoining room b/c I got a deal on hotwire for $89... check in, lady was indifferent to me checking in, told me they had no king, just queen or double, I chose double, little did I know it was a Murphy bed! An uncomfortable murphy bed in a westin, like come on!!! Room wasn't clean, used stir stick on the floor, hair on couch, carpet dirty. Washroom was small. Elevators were dirty, writing on wall, fingerprints on doors, buttons worn out. If this is what a westin is like, I'll never go back, I feel like writing in and getting a refund. I parked across street for $30 as cheaper than valet at westin. I don't know, there's so many nicer hotels in this place.

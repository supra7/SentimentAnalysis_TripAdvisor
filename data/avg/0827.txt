Although we got a great rate ($129) through Priceline for a last minute room on a Saturday night in June, I would never pay the average full price for rooms here (about $229 a night). The bathrooms leave something to be desired--something I judge a room by strongly. Room 1155 is right by the elevators which ding each time they stop at the floor. Understandably we were probably put in a "value" room since we booked through Priceline but I expected more from the Westin brand of hotels. The room also had an odd odor to it. The views are probably pretty fabulous the higher up you go and the room layout makes it so the beds face outward- a big plus at nighttime. Our tower had 44 floors, we were on the 11th. The room and hotel itself was good but I was surprised there wasn't more luxury to the rooms here.

I went to the Palmer House with my sales team for a convention in Chicago. Upon arriving in the lobby the hotel seemed impressive and grand. The Lockwood (in the lobby) was great the night I arrived and full of people wanting to see and be seen. Check in was a little slow and there is a special line for Hilton Honors members. I am a member but since there was no one in the main line I thought I would just go there, this was a mistake. As people would walk up to the other line they would take them first, I ended up getting up to the front after four people walked up to the other line. While I was there I heard other people very annoyed at this also. The rooms are clean and nice enough but old and a little creepy. The hotel is huge and the halls are serpentine. Everyone I was there with went the wrong way at least once trying to find their rooms. Also- each us had an issue of having thin walls, or a vent that you could hear clearly what was going on in other rooms. The bed was very comfortable though and the maid service was great. I never made it into Potters bar, as they were closed every time I tried to go in for a drink. On Friday night at 11:00 they were already closed! We did have a meeting at the hotel which was nice, and all the food I had while there was very good- this included two meals at Lockwood. The big pro was the people; almost everyone I spoke with at the hotel was very helpful, from catering staff, the Lockwood Staff and the street level bellmen and security. The other wow factor is the lobby which is historic and worth seeing. The last pro was the executive level. This was well worth it if you are there on business, the breakfast was nice and the afternoon appetizers were fantastic. The con is that it is a very old hotel and the rooms dont do enough to conceal this. If I go back I might stop in for a drink in the lobby, but I would much rather stay in a hotel with nice rooms.

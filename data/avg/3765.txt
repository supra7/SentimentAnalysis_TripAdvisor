The positives on this hotel are its cheap price and its location (depending on your destination in Dallas). The room was clean and the maid service was good. The room included a sitting area with coffee pot and microwave. The sheets were not high quality and the bed was so-so, but it was quiet and hey! It was cheap! Breakfast is powdered scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, white bread, cereals, and juice. Not great but it is provided and adequate. An IHOP is right up the street! The internet service was very spotty, and during one 24 hour period I had to ask them to reboot the router 4 times. I think others have complained about that. Front desk personnel were helpful and helped me print a boarding pass in the back office. Bottom line: It's a cheap price and an economy hotel. It delivers on what it promises, but don't expect the Ritz Carlton.

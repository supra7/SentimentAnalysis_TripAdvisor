This was the third Westin I had stayed in within a week (please see my other reviews for the ones in Columbus, Ohio and San Francisco), and it was not up to the Westin standard. First impressions count - and the rugs in the lobby were fraying along the edges. Front desk staff was amenable, but nothing above and beyond, considering the price tag. My room was clean and everything in working order, but I think it was smaller than an average hotel room - this may have been an optical illusion, as the hotel tower is rounded, so the rooms are round, rather than rectangular along the outside. It could be a really neat effect, but I don't think the room was oriented to make that happen. Room service breakfast was good, but overpriced (even for a Westin). When reading previous reviews of this hotel, I noticed that one reviewer mentioned that the thread count on the sheets was not up to Heavenly Bed standards - I almost brushed it off, but then I got into bed - and the reviewer was absolutely right! Having just come from two nights at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco, the sheet texture was totally different and not as smooth. Don't get me wrong - the hotel is still better than your average hotel, and has all the amenities of a Westin. I just think that there is room to improve, especially given the $200+ price tag for the average business traveler. But one odd compliment - for a hotel with nearly 40 stories, I never had to wait long for an elevator!

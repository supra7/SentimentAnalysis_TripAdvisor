after traveling all night we were lucky to be able to get an early check in at the raval. the pink lights all around make the hotel appear to be modern and fun. the problem began when we turned on the lights in our room. the lights over the beds are either dark pink or green. other lights are normal but it's tough to read in bed without feeling like you're in a pink light district, which actually you are. i read reviews saying not to turn right out of the hotel and they were right. we really did see hookers. the neighborhood feels oddly sketchy. while it's a short walk to the ramblas, getting there and back at night never felt really secure. but the full-time security guards in the lobby made us feel safe inside. the rooms are average size for europe and the showers are great. beware - you share a toilet with a closet, well not really share but the two have a common wall and sliding door so if someone is on the pot and someone else needs to get into the closet, beware! breakfast was pretty good but way over priced. front desk help was very helpful with directions, helping make train reservations and dinner suggestions.

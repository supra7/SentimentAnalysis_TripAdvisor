This hotel had so many good points but so many bad ones as well. Firstly good; It was located about a 5-10 minute walk from the train station so as we travelled by train this was really easy for us. The Coloseum was also close however the vatican, spanish steps etc was a little walk - we ended up getting a taxi to the vatican which was really easy and didn't cost too much. The rooms were big and clean however the bed was a little hard - otherwise the rooms were perfect. Great internet cafe/laundry-mat nearby called undablu. Bad points; Staff in my opinion were not very friendly, didn't offer a map like all other hotels I had been to on my trip had so we had to find one and work out were things were on our own, the free internet was slow and didn't work properly, they didn't allow acces to hotmail which was unlucky for me as all our european trip details were on my hotmail. We purchased a nice bottle of wine to enjoy in our room from a lovely shop around the corner, but when I called reception for a corkscrew and ice they told me I had to go to the bar, we went to the bar and they said that they had no ice (!!!) and that we had to bring the bottle down so he could open it - it was all just too hard. Also, I think this hotel offered the worst breakfast that I have had in a hotel. There was heaps of food but nothing good - it was quantity not quality. Overall I think it was ok - clean and safe but it could be so much better it has potential.

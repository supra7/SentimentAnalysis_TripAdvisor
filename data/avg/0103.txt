Just returned from 4 nights at the Inn at the Market with my spouse and teenage son. I had reserved a waterview room, and needed a rollaway bed for my son. Room was nice, but 3rd floor view of water included the roof of the next door building (not picturesque). We inquired if a larger room might be available, and were told that all rooms were the same size. Therefore I'm confused as to other reviews which discuss "huge" rooms. Location is wonderful, but room and staff were not at all as impressive. As one other reviewer mentioned awhile back, the water pressure in shower is awful, the tub is tiny so that a shower always involved the curtain sticking to me, our sink drained so slowly it was rather unpleasant to look at! Also, the air conditioner is very noisy when it goes on/off during the night, often waking us up. The queen bed was comfortable, but awfully squeaky. I'm not usually one to complain, but I feel that I had to add this review to counter all the wonderful ones I read before booking this hotel. Staff was nice enough, but not at all helpful - in fact, the only restaurant that was ever recommended to us was Cutters down the street - we wondered if they were getting paid to do this! (Cutters is ok, but nothing to rave about). When I asked for another casual restaurant for salads/sandwiches, one young man at the desk even said there weren't restaurants like that in Seattle.... something I find hard to believe. Everyone on staff seemed more like college kids in summer jobs, not professionals who know the city. Sorry to burst any bubbles, but other than the location near the market, this hotel is not one I would recommend.

I had some mixed feelings about Palmer House before I checked in after reading the reviews. And given the fact that I'd won the room through Priceline's Name your Price option, I wasn't expecting much. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby, as others have reported, is gorgeous. There's a lovely old fashioned hum all around that makes you want to get dressed up in a 1930's style dress with your best pearls and have tea. When I checked in, the staff was pleasant and accommodating with my request for a room on one of the higher floors so I was not bothered by the noise of the elevated train despite my room being on that side of the street. I could hear people in the hallway pretty well but experienced no problems with noisy neighbors. And the room, although not huge, was roomier than I had expected. The bed and pillows were comfortable and with ear plugs I enjoyed a good nights sleep. Yes, there was no flat screen TV but as I'm one of the few who doesn't have one at home i wasn't bothered by it. Channel selection was a bit limited but adequate. Where the Palmer House is showing its age is in the upkeep. When I opened the door, the overall impression is pleasing but after a few minutes things start to become obvious like scratches and gouges in the furniture, missing paint on the windowsill, badly repaired bathtub area and jam on the carpeting. Overall, a nice enough stay but there's the feeling that this would be one of the better hotels with a little more TLC.

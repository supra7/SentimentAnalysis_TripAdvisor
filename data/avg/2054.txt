Stayed in an apartment situated on the 2nd floor for two nights (4 adults). The apartments are situated just of fleet street and an ideal location for exploring London a short and safe walk to covent garden. The apartments are clean and tidy but a little worn in places ie flooring scuffed, bathroom in need of TLC. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again but mainly because of the location as we do not spend that much time in our acfommodation anyway. Down side to the apartment at the moment is that there is lots of building work going on all around and you get woken up at 6.30am due to the noise also not enough hot water generated from the boiler only 1 person had the luxury of a hot shower when all four people getting ready in a morning

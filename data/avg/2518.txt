Our king room was on the small side, but we were here only 1 night so it didn't matter a lot. The bed was comfy, and the noise from the airport was minimal and not an issue for us at all. Many of the guests are military personnel or business people with business with the Navy. Breakfast was good with an omelet bar and plenty of choices for all tastes. It was slow only because we arrived for breakfast just as the working people's rush was ending. The location was very convenient for us and easy to find. There's a park (and playground) and walking path behind the hotel for those who need to stretch their legs, or with small kids who need a run.

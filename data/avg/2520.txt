We stayed here during a Sea World weekend trip. We were in rooms #337 and #339. Both rooms were clean and had a nice view. The only downside was the noise coming from upstairs. The people upstairs slammed doors and moved furniture (my best guess) until 1AM and started up again at 6AM. Upon check out, I let the front desk know and they apologized and told me I should've called them. Unfortunately, I did not have the energy after a long day at Sea World. In the future, I would either request a room on the top floor, or for light sleepers, try a different hotel.

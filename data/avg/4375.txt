Most of the reviews are accurate. Rooms are still a little run down. We were on the 3rd floor. The windows are very thin. Had to turn on the heat till 74 to get warm there is a large draft from the window. The noise from the street is unbelievably loud! We did get an upgrade when checking in. Hate to see what we would have originally gotten without the upgrade. Also, didn't get the safest feeling overall. If you get on priceline great! But for the price stay at the Marriott or the Westin.

I stayed at The Avenue Hotel Crowne Plaza two nights for a business conference. The hotel has a prime location, close to the Magnificent Mile, Ginos East and Navy Pier, which allowed me to get a good feel of downtown Chicago during my limited free time. My room was very spacious, clean and comfortable, and the conference facilities were adequate for my group. I greatly appreciated the free wifi. Things to note: 1) The elevators are slow. I was forced to take the stairs at one point, and the empty, cement area was a little unnerving. 2) The food at our conference was terrible. I had colleagues choosing to skip lunch rather than eat the prepared meal. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again since it offered a good value for its location.

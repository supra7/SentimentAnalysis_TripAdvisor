The hotel is undergoing a major renovation, so I'm sure it will look fabulous once the new lobby is completed. Location is great, right beside the aquarium and close to some of the best restaurants around. I experienced excellent service here, with every staff member going out of their way to help out. Good thing too, because I was probably a bit of an annoying guest on this stay. The first room they gave me was near the elevator, which I could hear banging up and down the track every minute or so. I asked to be moved, and the only room they had available was an interior room with no windows. I stayed there, but asked to be moved the next morning to a now available exterior room. Unfortunately the heat wasn't working properly in that room, and after an discussion where the engineering staff didn't quite understand that while I had it set to 72 it was showing 64, I again asked to change rooms. My fourth and final room at the hotel was fine. Again, everyone was helpful and I was probably a challenging customer. But there's not much that even the most helpful staff can do to help with rooms that are just plain not comfortable for me.

The Good Bits first: comfortable bed staff very much leave you to get on with it shower and bath OK The Could do Better: still cleaning rooms very late in the afternoon (our room still not done around 3pm) very noisy if staying on lower floors (I needed ear plugs) two dim bedside lamps, and that is it. Very dim. breakfast is fun the first day, but youth hostelly if staying longer. Paper dishes and plastic cutlery - come on!! staff very out of the way - friendly, but ineffectual. When I complained about the noise from a nearby bar, the guy on the desk seemed surprised. and finally the glass wall of the bathroom - I can see what they are trying to get in terms of borrowed light, but its just crumby design In short, would not recommend this hotel - it is like a made up hotel from someone who has read a "how to make a boutique hotel" manual. No heart or soul at all!

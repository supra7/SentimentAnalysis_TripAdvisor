The Hotel Max is an "art" hotel so just a warning, there is a life-sized nude woman right when you walk in the lobby. We had our 7 year old with us and weren't quite prepared but thankfully, we're also not squeamish about nudity and we just told her it was art and that nudity is nothing to be ashamed of. Lucky for us, she was mature about it too. Beyond that, the rooms are very small but that is normal I think for city hotels. The hotel staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The big flat screen TVs were a nice surprise. The Pike Place Market is about a 10 minute walk, as is the Space Needle and most major points downtown. We had a great stay and the price was good too. I would recommend this hotel to people traveling to Seattle.

Wow - beautiful property. Excellent location. Very friendly, helpful and informative staff. The rooms are fabulous but very, yes as others have stated, very small. The only place to pass by your roomate somewhat comfortably is out in the hallway, and that's iffy if one of you don't turn sideways :-). Bathroom reminiscent of below decks ship bathroom - i.e. I"m not large by any means and had to remove the TP roll to sit more straight on the toilet. Shower is maybe 2'x2' where the curtain is always sucking/sticking to you and all that. As with most older hotels, late night revelers returning loudly to their rooms were easily heard and even understood after being woken up. There are many, many options in downtown Seattle and it is really a shame this property probably had to be engineered with such small quarters. As much as we generally liked the place, we wouldn't stay again nor recommend to others. :: The hotel's management responds very quickly and mentioned to me they have 9 different floor plans so you may just need to make that inquiry before firming up reservations.

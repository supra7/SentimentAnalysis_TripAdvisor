Pros: This hotel is in an excellent location in old town, within 5-10 minutes of the major sites and on a street with great restaurants. Decent breakfast included in rate. Cons: Small rooms in US standards, on par with some small European hotels, and bathroom is tiny! Sign posted in bathroom advises to not drink the water, but no free bottled water provided. I could not get the internet to work and the staff said they'd request help "tomorrow." Hotel arranged VIP airport transfers. Worked well coming in but on the way out, the driver picked us up in too small a car (had to hold luggage on lap) and then proceeded to drive us to the wrong airport and we almost missed our flight. Air conditioning runs but doesn't blow cold air. On a noisy street, the downside of the convenient location.

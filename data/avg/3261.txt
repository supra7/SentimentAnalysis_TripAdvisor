Very modern I have just stayed for 4 nights at the OUtrigger Seminyak. On the website it is saying it is not open but it is. This apartments are VERY modern and lack any Bali feel but being new it is very clean. It is built on a small amount of land so there is no gardens just lots of conctrete. It has absolutely NO PRIVACY as there are many units built in high rise style and lots of windows. We had to always have the blinds down as u could see straight in our 1 bed suite. This was actually one room but there were others that had the bedroom separate. Our room got morning and afternoon sun and only had one small A/C so the room was always hot. All rooms are self contained with either a full kitchen ofr kitchenette. There are some very poor fittings as it was a rush job to get the hotel finished. Our verandah door did not meet so the A/C just went straight out. We had a huge verandah with a spa so that was nice for outdoor entertaining. If you did not want to lie around the pool and get sun you could do it from your balcony and then just go down to the pool. The Pool area has limited seating and if it was full occupancy you would not get a seat. It is also VERY slippery so not great for young kids. The staff are lovely and are trying very hard but as it is all new there is still a lot of training that will be required. Breakfast was included and it was very nice. There is a great rooftop bar that overlooks the beach and when they have the official opening I'm sure this will be a huge hit. I think this hotel will be very popular with those who dont care about getting a Balinese experience. Some of the suites are huge so good for large groups/families if they will let u put extra beds in. Overall it is a nice, clean modern hotel.

You can't beat this hotel's location. Very central to the top attractions/restaurants/things to do in Boston. However, it is a VERY large hotel, so if you're not lucky, you may end up needing a lot of time to check in. Also, their room service is not the greatest. It took forever for them to deliver fresh towels to our room (~50 minutes from the first call). I stayed at the Towers level, and it was great to have breakfast and the space, but the staff in the lounge isn't the friendliest. The hotel/rooms are also a bit outdated, though, if you look at the pictures before you book (on TripAdvisor), then you shouldn't be in for any surprises. I'm undecided on whether or not I'd stay here again. It is SUPER convenient in terms of location, and if I was able to book a room at a good price, then maybe. Otherwise, I'd think about some of the other hotels in the vicinity that are on par or nicer.

I will start with the good things: The location is just great: 3-4 min. walk to Placa catalunya and then the Ramblas, 1 min. walk from Casa Batlio and about 15-20 min. of (lazy) walk to the Segrada Familia. It's close to everything. The service was ok, and breakfast was good. There's a free WiFi everywhere in the hotel, and that's a big plus. The bad thing is that the stylish design is not backed up with actual thinking about the costumer who's using the room. The hot water in the shower came about 10 min. after I caved in and started a cold (and terrible) shower. I was with a group on business trip, and some complained about the same thing but some didn't, so it depends on the room. Also, the TV didn't work, and the A/C I tried to chancge from cool to heat didn't manage to do so, so I frozed a little. I had no street view. Personally, I think that the idea of an open bathroom with no walls and door in the middle of the room is horrible, but I didn't have it in my room - be careful to ask about it when you order. The tiny sinks maby cute, but not comfortable, and have a shelf right above them so you have to stick your head in to wash your face... the lamps by the bed are tiny spots of light. So what's I'm saying is this: a) The design is not something to count on. b) It really depends on wich room you get, because they are all different. c) Is the location worth it? I havn't decided yet.

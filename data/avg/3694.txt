Used to love, love, love this hotel. We stayed there annually and told everyone how great it was. This year, their reservation service was unhelpful and unresponsive. We also notice that the vaunted "cookie reception" is skimpier every year. A few years ago, it included tiny brownies and four different kinds of cookies plus regular milk, low-fat milk and chocolate milk. This year, they were down to two kinds of cookies and regular milk. Period. And the entire setup was cleared from the lounge roughly an hour before the time it was scheduled to end! The rooms as always are quite dark. Fine for sleeping or watching TV, not so great for reading, writing, etc. - you know, the normal "business traveler" activities. When everything else was great, we overlooked this. Now that the rest of the experience seems to have slipped, it's actually pretty annoying.

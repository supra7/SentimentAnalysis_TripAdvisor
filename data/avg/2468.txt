We were unlucky to stay at a time when road works were being carried out on the road directly outside the room and building works were being carried out inside the hotel! The building works did not cause any problems and seemed very well organised but being a hot weekend and needing the window open, we didn't get much sleep during the night due to the road works - not anything the hotel could foresee. The only niggle about the hotel would be not having latches on the windows and with being on the ground floor we were reluctant to leave the windows open whilst not in the rooms. Having said that the staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was fine with plenty of choice and the room we stayed in was clean and tidy if a little cosy. A short walk was required to get to the tube station but the buses run regularly from close by. The all important comment is I would stay here again.

This property isn't anything fancy but for the price we got a large clean suite. Our room contained a bedroom, bathroom, small laundry area, and kitchen area. We had a garden view and were within walking distance of one of the 3 on property pools. The hotel is in a great location. You are right near the black rock area to snorkle in and they have a nice beachhouse where you can get towels and chairs. You have a short walk across the golf course to get there but I saw them take some of the elderly guests over by golf cart. We walked one night to the Luau next door and had a really fun experience there. There is a trolley that runs into downtown Lahaina that picks up by the hotel but we traveled by rental car. There are a lot of snorkle trips that leave out of Lahaina and we took advantage of those. We also drove to see the volcano and Hana, neither are very close to the hotel but we didn't mind the drive.

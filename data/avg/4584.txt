Centerfolds is a strip bar in the red light district. Boston abounds with many venues around and near this hotel. Fenuil Hall, Quincy Market, the Freedom Trail, Parks, and other venus worth seeing and doing. I disagree with your assesment of this hotel. If it took 1 hour for you luggage to arrive, did you take the time and call anyone after 15 minutes had elapsed. I have stayed at many Hyatt hotels, I find this assesment to be completly out of focus. Having stayed overinght many times at this location, I have never been woken up by food service carts rolling by, nor the 'thin walls" as the author stated. Perhaps a pair of earplugs would be helpful. On the contrary, I have found the rooms to be clean, beds were comfortable, and the only noise that I head was fire trucks going by one time. As for the location, sure its downtown, but it is central to most places to go. I and my wife have attended concerts in the park until 11PM and have never had a problem walking back, or for that matter, walking to chinatown late at nite for a bite to eat. For the $12 USD you have to pay tor a movie, nextime watch HBO for free or go to the Lowe's Cinima around the corner and pay more.

I had hoped for much more from a Marriott property. The room was clean, and the bed very comfortable. The location was central to many Boston attractions, but the noise levels outside during the late evening and early morning hours certainly made you wish you made a different choice in location. The breakfast buffet was excellent, but very pricey. Internet access was an additional charge - in a time when wifi is free in so many places, parking -out of site - all this when you are paying top dollar for the room. Also note, you can not rely on hours posted for the Starbucks coffee stand as I went to get a drink 45 minutes prior to close and was told in an unpleasent voice by their staff "We are closed".

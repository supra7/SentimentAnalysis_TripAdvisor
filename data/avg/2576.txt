If I paid that price anywhere else, I'd still be in shock but that's what's being charged around the vastly improved St Pancras/Euston area, probably because of the new International Terminal. Travelodges are basic but adequate, we all expect that but it's a shame to see a Rynair type policy of charging for everything, such as shower gel, although using the toilet is still free. However, I'd stop here again, the hotel is reasonably new, it's clean, functional, got lifts, the logistics of it are amazing and although you don't see many staff, apart from reception, they seemed helpful. I was worried about street noise, it's a potential problem at all hotels round there, I always carry earplugs as a travel accessory but didn't need them, although we were round the back facing onto a quiet lane and although London was freezing when we were there, the heating worked fine.

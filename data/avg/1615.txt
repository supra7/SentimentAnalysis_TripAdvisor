Stunning resort like everyone says. Perfect in every way. One prob, went there for a wedding and myself and one other friend/guest had items go missing from our room. His shirt and shoes of all things. He complained to security and hey look what shows up the next day. They said his shoes and shirt must have gotten mixed up i the towels... Riiiight.. My tiems where two leather bracelets (which I bought i Mexico) and a pendant that was passed down to me. My items never re-appeared.... I know this happens all over the place but I thought the security would be tighter at a resort like this... Also, this doest necessarily mean it's the maids. Just take note of EVERYTHIG you brought. Resort gets a 4.5 Thieves get the gallows poll. If they are going to steal they should at least target those who dont tip. Our party was very generous. Get rid of your thieves Derado. I guarantee security knows exactly whats going there. Also, I dont wat to take away form all the lovely ppl workig there. Really top notch service. Just a few bad apples. How may, we'll ever know.

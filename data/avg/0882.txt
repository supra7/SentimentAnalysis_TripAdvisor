I stayed at the Westin with my wife and 4-year-old son as we took a few days to explore the Seattle downtown area. I chose the Westin based mainly on its location and the fact that it offered a pull-out couch in the King rooms for my son to sleep on (I booked only a week before our trip, and most other hotels that could accomodate us were only offering double-double rooms). I also decided to spend a little more than I normally would for lodging, because we'd only be there a few days and wanted it to be special. Yes, I did spend more than I would have at the other nearby hotels I was looking at, but there was definitely nothing special about the Westin. In fact, it was very standard and like most other hotels I've stayed in. I should've saved $50 a night somewhere else or save $100 by using a bidding site. The location is very good. Right on the edge of Belltown and Downtown, next to the Monorail, and within easy walking distance of Pike Place. Everything was clean, though the carpets were worn and dated. Elevator service was awful, as there were only two per tower and waits were excessive (we actually almost missed our shuttle to the airport because of the elevators). Charges for internet would have been extreme, but I chose to utilize the free Wi-Fi at nearby coffee shops and cafes. Bottom line: The extra money you spend for a room at the Westin is a waste.

Stayed 6 nights during Jazzfest 2010. Paid $200 per night for a standard room only a few days in advance of arrival, which was the cheapest place I could find within reasonable distance of the French Quarter. At any other time of year I would expect to pay about $100 per night for what I got. Jazzfest was great though! Pros - The room was clean and well furnished, with excellent free wifi. - Complementary breakfast which included decent range of food (bacon, eggs, cereal, pastries and fruit). This positive was somewhat reduced by having to eat from tacky styrofome plates, bowls and cups. - Access to business centre with printer, etc. - Staff were polite and fairly efficient. - Elevators were ssssssllllllllloooooooooowwwwwwww - Decent location on Canal Street within walking distance to the French Quarter and River. If you find the distance too far to walk you can take street cars or buses which stop along the street. Cons - Surrounding area can feel a bit unsafe as the location is further north along Canal Street than most other hotels, and there are fewer tourists to blend in with. I passed by large groups of 'homeboys' on my way out and way back to the hotel every day and usually felt unsafe. - Shower in my room had a slippery floor that was dangerous. - The conceirge peddles timeshare presentations. I was foolish enough to accept and was given the wrong time to arrive and misled about how long I would need to stay. In the end I received 2 free tours valued at $100, but I think I would have preferred to spend the money and have more time to explore the city.

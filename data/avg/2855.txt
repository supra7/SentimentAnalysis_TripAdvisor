Room was fine, no complaints there. We had major issues with people stomping around upstairs and a group of kids that ran up and down the halls all night long. Nothing was ever done about them. Area around the hotel isn't that great. I had a very uneasy feeling the whole time. Hotel was easy to find, a few decent places to eat nearby. Hotel did have free wi-fi that was good. While we had no overall problems with our actual room or the staff itself, I probably wouldn't stay here again, just for the location.

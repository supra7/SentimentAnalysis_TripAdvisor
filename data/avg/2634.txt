I was not a guest at this hotel BUT I went to visit/pick up a friend who was a guest at this hotel. We were not able to dine elsewhere, therefore decided to dine and "catch up" at the hotel's main restaurant for dinner. The food was tasty and light; a bit expensive but you are in Miami. We paid for dinner and a SHOW! The two male servers found it okay to fight and argue candidly on the restaurant floor in front of guests! Although the restaurant wasn't full, these two (male) servers received half the attention of the restaurant for their yelling, shoving, and facial gestures! No supervisor on duty to stop the altercation but, although, it was entertaining for us I hope the human resources dept. of this hotel will take some disciplinary action for their shameful behavior. Drinks at the lounge afterwards to finish our conversation and service was better. My friend had been here for a few days and was happy with her stay and amenities even with the "show". Ok, decent hotel she says.

The hotel is acceptable. Remember, this is La Quinta, not the Ritz. It feels safe, which is important to me. Room needs updating, tile is cracked, closet door doesnt open quite right, but the room is clean. Internet went down tonight, which is a big problem for me. Front desk has been fantastic. You are centrally located, very close to Galleria and about 100 awesome restaurants  but this is not a fine hotel, its a hotel that needs renovating, has a few glitches, but if you can deal with that is a good value.

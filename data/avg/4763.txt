I stayed at this hotel from March 21 until March 24th for business. The hotel was adequate--nothing special. The rooms, even though they are 'suites' are cut up with small bathrooms. The front desk staff were lovely and the concierge on Monday and Tuesday was most helpful. The man on the concierge desk on Sunday, was not great. I felt I was putting him out by asking questions. The restaurant 676 was great for breakfast. I did order room service one morning, --very small breakfast room service menu--and costly. If you are looking for a basic hotel, on the Magnificent Mile, this is ok. I would much rather stay at the Intercontinental or the Ritz for a similar price.

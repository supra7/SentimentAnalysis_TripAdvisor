We stayed at this hilton on part of a package deal.Its a nice hotel, clean 2 bathrooms in our room, but The extras you have to pay are far too high. Parking $45 per day, $7.00 for a bottle of water!!!! $12 for internet!! The pool was closed for maintanance so asked if we could have a reduction on parking. We were just laughed at!

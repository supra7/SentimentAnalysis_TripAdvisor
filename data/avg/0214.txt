The location and price make this Older Hotel a good choice. The staff are very friendly. If you are looking for a modern place this is not for you. This is an old studio apartment building that is now run as a hotel. In a great neighborhood close to great local resturants. The hotel does not have a sterile tourist feeling that most of the newer mid range hotels have. It feels more like a small European Hotel. Yes, the rooms could use a little moderizing, but one must compermise. We just made reservations for another stay

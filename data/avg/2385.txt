Stayed here for two nights in a business trip and was booked for me by the company. Hotel was well located for the kwun tong area but not if you want to head to Kowloon or hong kong island. Hotel is clean, good breakfast, provides a shuttle service to and from hotel and airport and also a shuttle bus to main office buildings in the kwun tong area.

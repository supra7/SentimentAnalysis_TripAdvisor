Overall our stay at Hotel 91 was fine. The hotel was clean and new, and the bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in away from home. The staff were friendly, and check-out was easy. My husband arrived before me and said that there was a problem with the key card when he first went to the room (three trips down to the reception on the second floor before it was correctly programmed), but aside from that there were no problems with check-in either. I had asked for a room away from the side of the hotel that the trains were on, and this request was granted. What we hadn't expected was that the room had no window! There was a skylight, but due to vandalism this had been covered over, and so the room was dark unless the lights were on. This wasn't a major problem for me, as we only wanted to sleep and shower at the hotel, but it was still quite a surprise. We could still hear the trains, so I can't imagine how loud they must have been on the 'train side' of the hotel! My only real problem with the hotel was the shower. We were on the 7th floor, and the water pressure was so low that there was just a trickle of water really. It took about 5 minutes to heat up, so we had to be quite patient. I would still recommend this hotel as it was good value for money, and had nothing majorly wrong with it, but if you are looking for luxury, or are a light sleeper, I would definitely look elsewhere.

My best friend choose our lodging this trip, she watches and enjoys The Apprentice. So she was excited to stay at the Trump Hotel for our trip to Las Vegas. I thought it would be a great experience and would enjoy it. I was left feeling a little disappointed. I expected the Trump Hotel to give me the overwhelming WOW factor. I can honestly say, it did not. It's a nice hotel, don't get me wrong, it just didn't WOW me. The little details that you expect from the Trump Hotel were what was missing. The jacuzzi tub was able to be filled to the brim with as much hot water as I could fill it with; the next day I was lucky to get enough hot water (luke warm water) to wash my hair.

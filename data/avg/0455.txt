Typical big city, downtown hotel: elegant exterior, good location but with Comfort Inn-style quality--certainly nothing special to justify the $200+ room rate. A few blocks from water and new light rail system. Rental car kiosk is the first thing you see when you enter the hotel--pretty awkward and tacky. Elevators are really strange and slow. Room was comfortable, but bathroom way too small. The desk staff appeared to be overwhelmed, inexperienced, confused at times. Hidden--i.e., not advertised--$30/day parking fee. Warning: Room service is a COMPLETE rip-off!! They tack on a ridiculously high "delivery charge" IN ADDITION to the food price, tax, and tip you already expect to pay for a meal. I ended up having to pay something like $30 for a small salad listed as about $8.00 on the menu. The poor schmuck who delivered the meal was so embarrassed by the ridiculously high tab, he even apologized to me (BTW, he also works as a cook in the hotel bar/restaurant downstairs). I guess I should have expected this in a hotel that charges $8 for a bag of peanuts and charges for use of the so-called business center computer. Warning #2: Hotel overlooks a plaza with a new bar/restaurant that plays loud outdoor music to late at night. Nice restaurant on top floor but its only open to the scruffy masses for breakfast, lunch. Breakfast resembled a cattle-call with people/kids racing for the buffet bar. Apparently, dinner use is reserved for "special guests/members," whatever that means (probably snobby rich people dumb enough to throw away their $$ to maintain their delusion of elitism).

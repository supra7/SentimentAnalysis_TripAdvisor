They let me check in very early (about 10:30am), which was very nice of the front desk staff. For this reason alone I would probably book this hotel again. Although it may not always be an option. Parking - is something around 40 dollars, which seems kind of crazy. They have open lots across the street, but we didn't want to lug our stuff across the road. I think those lots will run you around 10 bucks for 24 hours on the weekends. There is a lot which connects to the Westins second floor and you can park 24 hours for 25 Bucks (it was 18 the last time i stayed here, but it's gone up). Wifi - 10 bucks per connection! Passed on it Minibar - prices are crazy (as usual for a hotel mini-bar). 7.50 for a liter of water. I also read in other reviews that if you move the stuff around and use it for your own stuff, you get charged 7 or 8 bucks Room - Kinda old. Carpet had lots of stains. This one i couldn't believe, at a hotel with rates about 200 a night. They had flatscreen TVs with no Hi Def! Yikes, even my Best Western the night before had hi-def. Bed and pillows were pretty nice. Good blackout curtains as well. Bathroom - Toilet was not mounted right and felt like it was going to fall over. No Fan in the bathroom? Weird. Pool/ Hot Tub - Monday morning there was no one there, so it was outstanding. It has a glass roof so you can see a lot outside. Very nice. Free lockers (about the only thing they don't charge for at this hotel) I got a deal on this place with priceline, so for the price i paid, I was satisfied. If I paid the standard rate, i'd probably be a little pissed off. All in all, if I ended up with this place when bidding on priceline again, I would just find cheaper parking. Hopefully.

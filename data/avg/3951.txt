We had stayed in this rv park several years ago, and while it isn't very glamorous, we did enjoy being right next to the water, could sit by the big windows & see all the water birds in the morning. It cost a little more, but we felt it was worth it. Here's what you should check out ahead of time. When I called back about a month ago to reserve a spot for next winter, we were told we could not, under any circumstances, pull our motor home into a "bay view" space - had to back in. This would put our bedroom next to the bay - not much view there. We should pay extra for that?????? Found another park next to the water that is more flexible. And, for a 5th wheel it would probably be fine. The best thing about it is the location in relation to all the attractions in San Diego. Very east to get to anything.

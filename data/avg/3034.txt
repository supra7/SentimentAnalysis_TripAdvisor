This unassuming hotel has the location, with St Marks about 5 minutes stroll away. It's not too difficult to find if you have the street number  so keep it to hand when you arrive. My room also had the added bonus of a balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. On the negative side, the walls were thin. I could hear people arrive and leave, talking with the receptionist and alarm clocks going off  all of which were quite annoying. Breakfast was of a lower than average standard, with two types of cereal, two types of meat, cheese, yoghurt, pre-packed snacks, small bread rolls and croissants the only things available. Plus breakfast was served in a cramped dining room containing five tables only large enough for two. I felt sorry for the lady serving the day the whole hotel seemed to come for breakfast at the same time, as she ended up serving people in their rooms. Even the amount of bread was sporadic, as one day I received two rolls and a croissant, the next was two rolls and two croissants, and the final day was one roll and one croissant. Another annoying system is that you have to leave your key with the front desk each time you leave, which is fine, but it will only work if there is someone at the desk! On numerous occasions I went down to find people ambling about the lobby not knowing what to do. Overall; great location, just don't expect anything special.

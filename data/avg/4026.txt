This hotel is in a great spot in Boston Copley square. It is attached to shopping by glass hallway which is great for all types of weather. I did like that they gave us "connecting" rooms, we had come in overnight for my daughters 16th birthday so it was great in the sense that the girls could shop (though very expensive shops here) and did not have to go outside, this is a very upscale mall and very safe. The only resturant is Champs - a SPORTS bar - so sick of sports bars - NO nice restuarant attached but plenty in the area. The lounge at this hotel use to be unbelievable, they had some of the best bands - I know four couples who actually booked bands that they had seen from this hotel. It was a very classy upscale place to come as couples but that is gone - sports bar took over most of that floor and wireless cafe for Starbucks coffee drinkers - so sad - NO entertainment -. If traveling on business stay here. If coming with girl friends go somewhere where they are closer to bars/resturants w/music, there's Copley Hotel accross the street, the Lenox not far. Sad - so much gone from the area. The Palm resturant was just gone, the Fairmont Copley restaurant closed for renocvations, Morton's Back Bay closed the week we went for good - you would have to go down to the Sea Port area for that. If coming to Boston the SeaPort area is the new and upcoming end of town, Mortons, Delfrisco's, Legal Seafood test kitchen, etc.. in the spring/summer that end is where the concerts are at the outside Pravilion.

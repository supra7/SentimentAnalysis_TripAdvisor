We stayed at the Travelodge London Euston for 1 night in July 2011 to allow for an early Eurostar connection the next morning. We decided on this particular Travelodge after looking at the other hotels on their website, deciding that this looked the best/most up to date in the area. The location was excellent, yards from London Euston train station and a 10 minute walk from St. Pancras International. There are also lots of pubs and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Check in was quick and simple and staff were pleasant. The room was basic (but thats what you expect from a Travelodge) but clean. The bed wasnt the comfiest and the room was surprisingly noisy considering that we were 3 floors up on the back of the hotel overlooking a courtyard. It fulfilled our needs but one night was definitely enough... a convenient stop-over point to break up a long journey but nothing more.

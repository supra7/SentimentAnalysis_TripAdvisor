This is a nice hotel room was spacious, clean, the pool is lovely area, the only down side is the only bar is at the pool area, there are no restaurants in the hotel, when we arrived we asked where were the restaurants and bars located, a few seats in the corner of the lobby for a bistro area, we went out for breakfast each day. only two minutes walk from International drive, very good location, staff were very helpful overall a very enjoyable stay. try to get a room overlooking the pool area otherwise you have no view

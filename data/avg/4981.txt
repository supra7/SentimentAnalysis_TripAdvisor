I spent 2 nights at the Palmer House Hilton. A famiily member was staying there for a business conference so it was a good time to check the place out. Unfortunately we stayed in one of the older rooms (apparently there are some newly remodeled ones) Our room was small, but did include 2 double beds, desk, chair, tv and average sized bathroom. The room however had an old smell to it, musty and caused sinus congestion every morning. So if you have allergies or sinus problems I would suggest requesting a newer room. The Lobby on the other hand was beautiful! Living up to its historical significance, and seeing why famous visitors such as Ulysses S. Grant and Charles Dickens stopped in. But overall I wasn't too impressed. There was a not so exciting small gift shop and restaurant/bar on the ground floor. However, there is a Corner Bakery, CVS, Walgreens and White Hen close by for quick breakfasts and coffee. The hotel is located in a great location if you plan to go to the theater, or shopping on State Street. It is close to restaurants too. There are plenty of taxi's and its along the bus routes. Easy walking distance to Millenium Park. Note however, that on Sundays a lot of the small food joints and shops in the loop area are closed, including some Walgreens. For being a Hilton, I was disappointed in the quality of the room, especially for the price, but the location is great depending on the types of activities you plan to do in Chicago.

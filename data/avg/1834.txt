We stayed at the Hyatt for a week with 2 oceanfront rooms in the Regency Club with our 2 teenage kids. The views were spectacular and the family had a fun stay on the island. As for the hotel, we expected better and came away disappointed overall. On the positive side, the staff, food, and pool were all A plus. The disappointment with the facility starts with the broken elevators, under maitenance the entire week with and apology framed on a table so I guess its lasted awile. It continued when we walked into our starkly decorated aged and beat up room which supposedly is the best of the house. Th bathroom was ridiculously tiny, the TV 15 years old, and all the places where wood can be dinged up were _ a good 20 years worth. For what they charge, this is illogical. The disappontment continued when we opened our sliding doors to the construction area by the pool below- an eyesore. Then the smell of pot filled the room from the balcony below, which we reported to the staff and assume they took care of . Maui is great- the hotel not so much..

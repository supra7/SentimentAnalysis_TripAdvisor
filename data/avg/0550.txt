I booked this hotel because a friend told me it was in a great location. The location was very very good, good walking distance to everything. The hotel has a very nice large lobby that is brand new. Once I got out of the cab I knew that service would be an issue. The guy could of not cared that I was coming to stay no hello or how can I help you, I thought that at least he would help with the bags. When it came to check in it was the same service. They charge $10 day for internet and it was so slow, I've lived in 3rd world countries with better speed, for $10 I would want the internet to work well.

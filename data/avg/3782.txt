Beautiful View We stayed at the Lexington when we went to the State Fair. They were remodeling so we got a great rate. The room we stayed in had not been remodeled yet I really liked it. It was totally retro. It was very clean, comfortable, roomy, and had an increadalbe view. It is also very convient to downtown. I can't wait to see the remodeled rooms!! The lobby was beautiful. I felt we got a good deal for our money spent.

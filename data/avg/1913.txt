TThe ocean front rooms are most expensive, gorgeous, right overlooking the water...but watch out for the smoker's paradise that may engulf you while you sit on the lanai of your NON-SMOKING room. The hotel allows smoking in the Kauai bldg on the first and sixth floors--so any floor in between is sandwiched in smoke, unless you keep your lanai doors closed and do not actually use your lanai. If you want a truly non-smoking room and lanai, you will need to stay in the Molokai bldg, which is less well appointed: only three floors high; no elevator, only stairs; and no bathtubs, only showers. Why the management penalizes non-smokers in this way I do not understand. I guess because smokers can't climb stairs?? Why should we have to drag our beach equipment and a toddler up three flights to preserve basic health? According to the front desk, it is because many of the people who stay in this resort are smokers. I much prefer the smell of the ocean and the tropical flowers to the smell of cigarettes, and with a child with asthma, a smoking environment doesn't just stink, it is dangerous. Native Hawaiians didn't smoke tobacco, or suffer most addictions of modern society, so I would urge this "most Hawaiian hotel" to reconsider their smoker-friendly policy. Despite their great location, they have lost our business.

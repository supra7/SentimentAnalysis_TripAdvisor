We stayed here for the 4th of July weekend. We booked through expedia and we got a good rate. I must admit I was a bit disappointed in the overall stay. Front desk checknin staff was not cordial or hospitable at all. Our room was small unlike other reviews. We were on the 22 fl but no corner, so be aware all the rooms are not spacious. Location was good as we walked almost everywhere. So to sum this all up, this stay was just ok, nothing special. We would not stay here again, but liking or not liking this hotel really depend on your individual expectations in a hotel.

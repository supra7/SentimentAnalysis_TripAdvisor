The loaction of this hotel is fantastic. Stafff service is a 'could do better'. THe valet parking is laughable $48 for overnight adn the service, well lets say I could've got the car myself a lot quicker, and there was no instructions to how to get the staffs attention! Room spacious and had minibar but no prices given! And no matter how much you take out it did advise there is a $25 refill charge. Overall view this hotel as over priced, definitely paying for location only.

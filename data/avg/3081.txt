I stayed in this hotel as a weekend getaway. Wanted a great place to sleep in, that had a great bath and just do nothing for two days. Unfortunately that was not the case. The hotel is beautiful and the price is as I would expect for the this class of hotel, the lobby is grand and inviting although the floor lights at the check in desk are absolutely blinding and should have been done with a frosted glass instead of the clear lenses that they used. I had to place my luggage on them so that I could see across the desk. My room (deluxe) was stunning, great linens, and the the tub for two is a perfect way to spend a few hours on a cold Vancouver day. As far as the room itself there are only two things I would change, first the tv is a little small for a room his size so watching movies in bed is a little tough. And the reading lights on the bed don't work so you can't sty up and read without disturbing the person next to you. The teeny flaws in the room could easily be overlooked if it wasn't for how loud this hotel is. Even with the windows closed you could here all of the street noise which might not have been so bad if the Occupy Vancouver protest wasn't going on. I barely slept and when I did was woken up early to the sound of drums. I stay in Vancouver often and always like to try new hotels in the downtown but don't remember any of them being as loud as this one.

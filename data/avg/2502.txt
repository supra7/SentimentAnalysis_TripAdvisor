I read promising reviews on Trip Advisor and when looking for an overnight stay close to the airport after a recent business trip in Montreal, I booked at A loft. Being a Thursday night and having meetings the next morning, I was looking forward to a good night sleep. While the room was comfortable, with that funky edge that Aloft does, I had no idea the sound proofing from the lobby bar to the rooms was so poor. I was located on the second floor and could hear every last note of the very loud music and voices coming from the lobby bar below! I may rethink things if staying on the weekend where a quiet night sleep is not so important, but I will certainly pass on Aloft on my next business trip!

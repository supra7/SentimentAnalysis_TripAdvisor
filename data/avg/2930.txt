Stayed at The Avenue from 12/30/08 through 1/3/09, and honestly I would rate this hotel as just 'ok'. It wasn't bad, but there wasn't anything special about it. We stayed on the 26th floor, and the room was clean enough and roomy enough for two. One drawback was that the hotel is right next to a hospital, so you do hear sirens all night, even being up that many stories high. Obviously not the hotel's fault, but still a minor annoyance. The beds were the best part of the room; they were super soft and we wanted to bring them home with us! Some other flaws with the room: the bathtub didn't drain, so you had to take a quick shower to avoid the tub filling up fast. And second, the hooks on the back of the bathroom doors fell right off if you put anything on them, so there was nowhere to hang clothing or towels. Actually, this bathroom had the least amount of places to put things than any hotel I've ever been in! So that's one suggestion I would make to the management staff at the hotel; a lot of people like it when the bathrooms have some small shelving or places to hang things. One good point about the staff...when we asked for something, they came with it right away. The concierge was also helpful in making calls to find us a restaurant of our liking. Other things worth mentioning: There was no mini fridge in the room, and that was $20 extra if you requested one. We would have liked to have one, but we didn't want to spend the extra money. Also, anything that you take from the snack fridge provided was $20 to replace, so that $4 pack of cookies could potentially turn pretty expensive! We found a corner store nearby to get water and snacks at a much more reasonable rate.

Nice hotel apartment, with kichnette. oven, fridge, washing machine, gas stove and lcd tv make our stay comfortable. but i dosnt like the smell inside room. i use a full bottle of my deodrent to get rid of smell. room and bathroom quite comfortable but location is not that good. remote area and u have to walk 400 mtr to get some nice resturants.

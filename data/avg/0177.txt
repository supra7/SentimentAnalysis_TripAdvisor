Stayed for 3 nights post cruise with my parents. Had reserved a one bedroom suite, changed booking for same type of room on club floor when rate went down. Included free internet, continental breakfast and early evening snacks - these were all good. Room was a little tired - sofa bed cushions very stained, carpet tatty in places, bathroom a little out dataed. Had to call housekeeping twice to get sofa bed made up. All little things but add up. Hotel busy with a conference so lots of people around and difficult to find conceirege to get advice on local restaurants etc. Front desk good. Fabulous view of the city from picture windows. Overall average.

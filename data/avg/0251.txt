LOCATION Couldn't have been better. A few blocks from almost everything - including two of the best restaurants we visited (Serious Pie & Dahlia Lounge), Pike Place Market, the monorail to the city centre and downtown. Some shouting and sirens at night on the weekend. ROOMS Super basic rooms take this hotel from great to average. The room itself is a good size with enough closet space and drawers. Linens were clean. There is no heater in the room - when we went it wasn't too cold though I'd imagine in the dead of winter this could be an issue. We only had one night stand which was kind of annoying. The bathroom is tiny - REALLY TINY. Impossible to take a shower - it's so narrow that when you turn the shower on, the water sprays clear past the curtain. STAFF Friendly and helpful.

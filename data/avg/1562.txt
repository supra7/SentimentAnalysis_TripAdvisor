My wife and I decided to take a quick overnighter to Baltimore for a getaway weekend and chose to try the Hilton Garden Inn at Inner Harbor since she enjoys her stays at every other Garden Inn. The hotel is located in a nice area of Inner Harbor with a lot of restaurants and entertainment within walking distance. We checked in without a problem but as my wife entered the room, it was already occupied. Now I don't want to blame the staff because he was VERY apologetic and switched us immediately and asked several questions because no one was supposed to be in that room. The price was reasonable compared to the surrounding hotels. The only issue we had was the bed. Firm is an understatement and we were both not comfortable at all. I did change the setting on the mattress, if that did anything, it wasn't noticeable. All in all, this Hilton Garden Inn has very convenient and reasonable accommodations.

An okay experience. Well, the hotel really doesn look like the photos that are included with the description. I say the hotel is now a little worse for wear even though it is going through enovations? There was a sign indicating that the hotel is under new management so it remains to be seen as to whether the name changes or not. Unfortunately, Priceline didn tell us that the lounge and restaurant were closed because of the renovations which meant we had to travel by car in order to get anything to eat or drink. The pool, however, was up and running. On the plus side, the hotel is in a fairly decent location (it light industry), the rooms have new mattresses, the staff is super friendly and very helpful, and it not as bad as some would make it out. However, on the down-side ?the upholstery in our room was in desperate need of a good cleaning (it was so stained that we put plastic down before we put anything on the chair or bench). The continental breakfast consisted of dry cereal and coffee but not much else. The rooms all faced a central corridor which is a good safety feature (even though the card readers weren activated which meant anyone could walk in at any time day or night), but this central corridor feature, coupled with the lower ceilings meant that when some rude guests awoke at 6:00 am and started slamming their doors and yelling to each other down the hall, we could hear everything quite clearly in our room. Would I stay there again? Maybe ... but I would check around first..

A very hip hotel. Rooms are cool but small. It was a challenge to sleep each night as the rooms are very hot and when you turn the AC on its loud enough to keep you awake. Otherwise the hotel represents good value and and is in a good location, close enough to Las Ramblas without being on top of it.

After spending 5 nights at the Fairmont in Wailea and a night in Hana, Lahaina area is my least favorite. We spent two nights at the Hyatt for our honeymoon. The construction of the original front desk area made it very inconvenient to check in. The front desk lady was nice offering us room upgrade to ocean view and 150 bucks for our dinner since our room wasn't ready by 4pm. We were a bit disappointed with the ocean view because the construction was right below our room and it's facing the pool area (lots of loud people, too). The construction wasn't such a big deal, but our room was also right around The Japengo restaurant so we can hear live music for a good part of the night. If you want peace and quiet, Hyatt isn't the place for you. Trying to get to our room from the parking lot was quite inconvenient. The layout of the hotel did make us do a lot of walking, especially when you have luggage to check in and out. Although, the food at Japengo was delicious, the breakfast buffet was just okay. The line can be long if you wake up late. Overall, we probably won't be back at the Hyatt. For honeymooners who are looking to get away from the crowd and kids, go stay in Wailea or Hana for relaxing and quiet time.

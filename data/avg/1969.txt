Stayed here for 5 nights in July '04 for my honeymoon. I recommend staying in one of the renovated wings of the hotel. Was originally put in an old wing and asked to move because of old carpets, furnishings, damp feeling...etc., was moved next morning. The newer wings are much nicer and just feel cleaner and brighter. You can't beat the location of this hotel, great beach, snorkeling, walking distance to shopping. The view is spectacular from the ocean facing lanai. The hotel has huge grounds that are nice and well maintained, the pool is simple (didn't care anyway because wasn't in Hawaii to sit by a pool). They have parking but the spaces are very tight, not a big issue. Hotel puts on a show every evening with singing and dancing which is a nice touch. They also have many vacation packages that should be taken advantage of. The Mixed Plate has food you would expect to get at any buffet. Since I am not picky in what I eat I liked everything but I can see some people not being impressed (we only ate breakfast there, can't speak for other meals). The restaurant at the hotel is good, not great. The menu has a lot to offer as well as many specials. We ate outside during the evening show and really enjoyed it. Overall the hotel offers everything a vacationer needs. Don't expect an expensive resort with the spectacular pools and fancy architecture. I feel it is well worth the value. I would recommend staying here and will go again.

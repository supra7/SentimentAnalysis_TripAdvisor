Location is close to ideal: Across the street to the Prudential Center entrance (via Sheraton) and a short walk to Hynes Convention Center Subway station as well as an even shorter walk to Newbury Street with all its Restaurants and Specialty stores. Lobby is somewhat small but all common areas were clean and updated. Service was friendly and professional. Two free computer terminals are available in the lobby for brief internet access and boarding pass printing. Rooms were clean, updated and our kingsize bedroom size was acceptable. Bathrooms are a bit small but updated and clean. No complaints about the Roomservice. Wireless internet access is available for $13/24hrs. Pod-style coffee machines and ceramic mugs were very welcomed. Now for two somewhat serious detractors which might have to do with the location of our room ( 7th floor on the south side, room 713) 1. you can constantly hear the elevators skating up and down. The sound seems to reverberate through the room, -- not loud at all, but still noticeable. I suspect that the rooms to the north side might have less of this problem since they are not adjacent to the back wall of the elevators. Perhaps even rooms further up would experience less of this noise. 2. somehow cigarette smoke was occasionally coming into the room through the bathroom vent . It was not visible, but it was definitely very noticeable. We could not determine if the adjacent room neighbor was smoking in his/her bathroom or if it was coming from the 8th floor which apparently is the smoking floor. There was no active exhaust action happening in the vent from what I could tell, rather, air was coming into the bathroom from the vent. Either way, the bathroom venting seemed inadequate to keep this from being rather annoying. Again, perhaps rooms on higher floors would not have this issue due to the greater distance from the smoking floor. Without these two items, I would have definitely rated this hotel above average.

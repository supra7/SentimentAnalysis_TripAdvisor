To be fair, we had just spent three days at the Weston Resort in Cancun which is right on the Caribbean. I thought I understood that the Casa was on the beach. When we finally found it and pulled up in front, my partner wanted me to change the reservation. I thought I had 24 hours to change it, so I asked if we could delete the last day. They had charged my credit card as soon as we walked in the door, or possibly before that, and would not let us out of the reservation. The person the receptionist called said I had made the reservation 4 months previous. Not so. I made it two days before we left for Cancun. We got our ticket for the beach since we could not check in right away. It poured down rain as we walked to the beach. We never did find the place they told us to go to. Our room was right on the court where people smoke and socialize. There is a very small pool there. The rooftop breakfast was very nice even though the wind was blowing everything about. The three block walk to the shopping area was safe, but I would not try it late at night. I stay in hostels when I travel to Europe alone, and thought of this as an upscale hostel. My partner hated this place. The staff is very pleasant and not their fault it is not on the beach and there is not a jaquzi in the room. The only bad thing were the bites on my legs which I recognized as bedbugs dining on me as I slept. These ubiqutous creatures are a fact of life, especially in Mexico. But extra care in cleaning can rid a room of them. I read all the other reviews and agree this is a good place to stay since many ruins and theme parks are close by.

I spent one night at the Boston Park Plaza. The hotel looks very beautiful from the outside and takes up an entire city block. The lobby is very nice, with old architecture that beautiful. The staff is not very welcoming, we were not greeted even when we checked in. The concierge was great, he was a young man & looked irish(Red hair/Green eyes). He was very helpful and provided us with a map on which he drew out a walking tour of Boston. When you make your way from the lobby to the rooms, you will probably be disappointed. We stayed on the 8th floor. The rooms were old & were in desperate need of a paint job. The bathroom sinks were very old & the bathrooms were not clean. We found long pieces of hair all over. We are not very picky people, but, were really disgusted by it. Our room had already been serviced according to the maid in the hallway. If you are on a budget, then this hotel is fine & has an excellent location. But, just up the street is the Ritz Carlton, were the doormen happily greets you as you pass them on the street. The location of the Boston Park Plaza is perfect, but, the rooms are old and dirty. Definitely bring a pair of slippers to walk around in the room.

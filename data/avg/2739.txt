We just got back from this hotel and here are my thoughts: It is in the middle of Chinatown. The area is pretty flithy and somewhat smelly. There is no place to grab a drink before going in at the end of the night. I have read on here that the windows didn't open, ours did and it was both a good and bad thing. The room was too hot. There was a control for the air conditioner unit in the room but it didn't work. We weren't really told anything when we reported it, just sort of stared at. So we opened the window for some air but the noise was the worst I have ever experienced. EVER. The room was clean and small. The bathroom is roomy with lots of hot water. The price was great. We bought ear plugs for the second night and that helped a great deal. The F train is fairly close -- but it takes a while to get to midtown. Little Italy being so close was fun and we got some great pictures of the Manhattan bridge. The people that stayed in the hotel were quiet, which sort of surprised me since they were so young. I was concerned about security. I wanted to make a pit stop just to check on our things. But it just isn't the kind of place to you want to stop back by to recharge, we stayed out the whole time and risked it.

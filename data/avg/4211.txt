From the outside, the place looked marvelous.But, it was a different story when we headed to our room. Our bathroom didn't lock, the drain in the tub didn't drain...etc..The concierge was nice enough to get into a vacant room, which was a mirror image of the previous room. Thank Goodness we weren't there to just hang out in the room, but only used our hotel room as a base camp as we traveled other surrounding states.

We have been staying at the SeaTac Marriott for several decades. The staff is the best as are the rooms,service and cleanliness. The 'music' environement however in the lobby, resteraunt and entrance is not becoming to this professioanal facility. One would assume they were in a disco bar. We and others [customers] have commented previously with no response from management. This hotel, especially for the prices, can 'do better' since it deserves better. I would have a difficult time recommending the SeaTac Marriott until the business environment improves and that is too bad since the staff is great. Tom Evans

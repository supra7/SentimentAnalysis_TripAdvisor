We were in Dallas for a wedding in which rooms had been arranged for at the Magnolia. The hotel itself is a beautiful piece of Dallas history and overall the staff did a tremendous job. The breakfast buffet was very good and if that wasn't enough food for somebody, an omelet bar was available for an additional $4.95. However, we had one wash rag in our room and when calling for extra, we were brought towels but no wash rags. Also, our room faced an outdoor bar, complete with DJ, that was very loud. We would probably not stay here again.

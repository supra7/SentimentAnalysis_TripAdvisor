First off, the positives: The Palmer House Hilton is well-located in the Loop, particularly if you're going to be using transit. It's on Monroe between State and Wabash in the heart of the Loop, with the Monroe Red Line El stop directly outside its State St. entrance, and the Adams/Wabash el stop outside its Wabash entrance (Green, Orange, Brown, Purple & Pink lines). The Monroe blue line stop is a block west. The old world lobby is gaudy and grand, and perpetually busy. The staff is for the most part very friendly. There's a Starbucks one level below the lobby (caveat: The prices are higher than at a non-hotel 'Bucks). The cozy rooms are clean if uninteresting, with the standard Hilton decor. Housekeeping was excellent.The hotel, despite being older, features a pool and health club. BUT....... Again, the rooms are small, and the bathrooms are TEENY (as in moderate-price London hotel bathroom small). Also, the in-room televisions are dated. (Get with the flat-screen program, people.) Waiting on the elevators at check-out time on a Sunday will test your sanity. For the $62 per night rate I got on Priceline, the Palmer House was more than fine. I didn't spend a great deal of time in the room anyway, so the small rooms didn't bug me that much. That said, I wouldn't pay the rack rate for this hote.

We spend 2 nights in February at the Edgewater Hotel. Good part , staff are very nice and helpful they have a shuttle service you drop you downtown, our room was nice with a Santa Fee western style, I was surprise to have a shower but no tub.The location at night is a bit off the way. The bad part, corridor need a good coat of paint and new carpet after all they are suppose to be a 4 stars. They don't mention the train who come every half hour, day and NIGHT so if you are a light sleeper to bad. The city side is more a parking side with no vue and finally the parking $ 49.00 a night................We come to Seattle twice a year and like to try differente Hotel for sure we won't come back to this one

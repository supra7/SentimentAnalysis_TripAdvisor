We stayed for 2 nights at Pera Tulip in sept. They upgraded us to an executive room so that was great. The rooms are small to say the least but hotels in Europe are small as compared to Asia. The executive room has a balcony which is big and nice to sit if not cold outside. The room is well furnished with a flat screen TV but the airconditioning is weak. As written by other reviewers, the toilet has a glass door which is not entirely private. The breakfast is good with decent spread. The time to Sultanahmed by taxi is 10-15 min and taxis are not cheap plus they are not reliable.. every time i came back, the taxi took another route and bill was very high. For tourists visiting Istanbul for few days, I strongly recommend staying in Sultanahmed. There is a good market and many nice resturants near Pera Tulip.. we tried quite a few and liked them. But you get good resturants everywhere including Sultanahmed.. Good place to stay but quite a distance from the tourist centre. I also did not find the hotel reception staff very responsive and freindly.

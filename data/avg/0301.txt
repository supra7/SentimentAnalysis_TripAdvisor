Went down for a football game and some site seeing with my husband and another couple. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny. Service was ok, there is no resturant in the hotel, there is a little coffee shop though. This hotel is extremly loud! We listened to the elevator go up and down all night (and we were far away from it) you can hear everyone talking in the rooms beside you and toiletts flushing! I would never stay there again. They also didn't honour or even know about the promotions they were offering.

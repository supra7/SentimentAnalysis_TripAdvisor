The Palmer House Hilton hotel is stunning in appearance. The lobby and ballroom are stunning. The location is excellent and it's only 2 blocks from the Monroe stop (blue line from O'Hare Airport). The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. The beds were quite comfortable. However: 1. Internet options, based on speed, range from $15 - $20/day 2. The fitness facilities cost $18/day 3. The bathroom is tiny 4. The water pressure wasn't the best (I had to hold the flush lever for several minutes for the toilet to entirely flush) 5. The drain in my tub was clogged so my first shower at the hotel consisted of me standing in 2 inches of dirty water. However, maintenance was called and came very quickly to fix the problem. 6. Parking is $51/day 7. The room had no coffee/tea maker and no refrigerator The perks are staff & location, but overall it wasn't worth the amount paid.

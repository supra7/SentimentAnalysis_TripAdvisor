I got a great rate for a 2 night stay in August 2007 on Priceline....$159 a night!!! Then I get my bill and I was charged $39 a day for parking. I felt this was a little excessive, but idk...seemed they jacked my bill up with that.......also the pool was awful. No steps for little ones, very small and in a air tight room where the chlorine smell knocked us down! If you are loooking for a nice pool for little ones, check the Sheraton across the street.........pool was a lot bigger and had a sliding roof which opened to let the sun in. Looked fabulous from our room window.

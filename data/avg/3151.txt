I have stayed here several times on business , the hotel is quite straight forward, clean newer rooms, free wifi. strong breakfast buffet ( a bit pricey @22 euro) The only objection is evening meals or room service, food quality is generally good when it arrives. I have waited 1 hr cor room service, also received the wrong order, and had major items missing( ie main). Thinking this was a room service issue similar things happened when I ate in restaurant - were wifi doesn't work. But overall good value.

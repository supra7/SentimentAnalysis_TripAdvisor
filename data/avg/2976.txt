We stayed for 5 days in this hotel. Rooms are of reasonable size with good bathroom,full tub.LCD TV ( Only 2 english channel) ,coffee maker but no minifridge. Soap+shampoo through dispenser no other toiletaries.It is a business hotel with limited services. Breakfast is included in room and has sufficient choice for vegetarians ,bur no hot items. Reception is the only source for services and are helpful if not busy.Services like A.C./Telephone repair takes a day or so and general advise from reception is to change rooms. No restaurent on premises but good eating places on Rambla Plabneu .5 minutes walk. Beach ( Icarus) is 20 minutes walk on this street. Public transport ( metro) is within 10-15 minutes. About 4 Km from main Rambala amd port. check for airconditioning in the rooms as it may not be working properly. Overall good value for money

My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights before our Alaskan cruise. Great Hotel,,walking distance to it all. Pikes market was 2 blocks away.The Tram was right across the street.It takes you to the space needle. But tha cab is cheaper. Beds are soft. The rooms are slightly outdated and could use a revamping. But overall its a good hotel.

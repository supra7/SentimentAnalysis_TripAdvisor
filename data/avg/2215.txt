We decided to try this hotel as it was a 5* suite and seemed good value for the price. The service in this place was TERRIBLE, the staff on the front desk in particular were very unhelpful, miserable and did not listen to what we were saying. The photos on the website are not true to the actual suites, I think the photos are of the corner suites that they try and sell you an upgrade to when you check-in. The rooms were standard, smaller than we expected and very plain, boring decor, no character to the room whatsoever. The kitchenette was tiny but did the job for breakfast although there was nothing to really cook with, we called house-keeping for a frying pan which they did bring us eventually. The bathroom was nice. Location is off the strip which was fine during the day as you can cut through the fashion mall which was very nice. The mall closes at 10pm so it is worth getting a taxi back after that to the hotel as it quite a long walk from the strip and the street the hotel is located on is not very well lit. For a 5* suite I would recommend the Signature over the Trump any day. We will not stay here again.

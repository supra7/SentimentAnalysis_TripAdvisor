decent for the price I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in April. The location is quiet and industrial, but less than 10 minute drive to downtown Seattle, and only about 5 minutes to the airport. I had their breakfast buffet one morning. It is no longer free, but the quality/selection was decent for a buffet( I normally find breakfast buffets to be inedible, especially in Vegas). Another concern I had was that I wanted to be able to use the wi-fi with my laptop. After some initial confusion and misinformation, I found out that the free wi-fi was not available in the Express King rooms. Fortunately, I was able to change my reservation to a standard room. If you want internet in the expresss king. you are limited to webTV, which has a charge of $10 a day. The standard room with free wi-fi was only $8 more per night than the express, so it was a no brainer. Not a concern if you don't plan on using the internet on your stay. The beds were a little on the hard side, but I had no problem sleeping, The service and amenities were on par with what i would expect from Red LIon, which is normally a 3+ hotel in most of its locations, the soap/shampoo was 'Bath and Body Works', or something similar. My room was clean and well maintained. Also, I appreciated free parking, since so many hotels are charging $10 -$20 a night just for a parking pass. Bottom line, if you are looking for a decent cheap hotel in Seattle and will have a rental car, I would highly recommend this hotel, assuming you can get a rate of 45-55 a night or so. It was everything I would expect from an older hotel with a decent brand name to support it.

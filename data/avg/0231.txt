The hotel was lovely. Our room was small but adequate. My biggest disappointment came after we checked out. The following morning, I realized I had left my coat in the closet in the room. My husband contacted the hotel the by phone and e-mail. Received a reply the following day -nothing was found. I have now talked to the hotel three times. They continue to say housekeeping found nothing. Since I am more than 100% sure that's where it was - I will assume someone took it for themselves. Very disappointed that staff cannot be trusted to turn in left behind items. Someone got a very nice Columbia coat.

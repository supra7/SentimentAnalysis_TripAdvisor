What I enjoyed most about my stay was the bathtub - it was big enough to swim in almost! I stayed in a Studio King and it was quite roomy for one person. The windows opened, which was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable. I also appreciated the valet parking, although I never saw where the car was parked or who exactly was the valet attendant. What I found disappointing was the lady who was working the front desk in the evening. Compared to the two ladies who checked me in earlier in the afternoon, this employee I felt could use some help with customer service. First, I inquired about a good place to eat and she suggested a place about 7 blocks away. When I wondered about needing reservations she said she'd call over and find out what their wait time was and then ring my room. I never heard anything from her so I made arrangements to go somewhere else for dinner. (Griffins at the Fairmont Hotel was excellent!) Secondly, when I came back to the desk to advise them my schedule had changed and I wouldn't be staying for as long as I had anticipated, she ignored me for well over 5 minutes as she played with the dog who belonged to either residents or guests booked at the hotel. Working in tourism myself, a common courtesy would have been to acknowledge another guest and let them know you'll be with them in a moment. It doesn't take much. I was also disappointed that there was no doorman or bell hop, no assistance with luggage and the internet cable in the room was by the bed. Now maybe you could move the furniture and unplug the device and crawl under the desk to reinstall it, where it should have been, but after a long day of meetings, I shouldn't have to crawl around behind furniture to get an internet connection!

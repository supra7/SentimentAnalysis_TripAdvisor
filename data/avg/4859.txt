We stayed at the Palmer House this weekend for the first time in a long time. The hotel is a grand old lady with great architecture and art but the staff lacks a lot. Our room was not supplied well, we had to request soap the second day, they wanted $10 to use the fitness center, internet access was $20 per day, the concierge argued with me and the executive lounge was crowded, filled with kids, the food stuck in a small room and crowded with people. I booked my room through Price line and even though I'm a Diamond in the Hilton Honors program everyone took great pride in telling me how thatdidnt do anything for me when I booked my room through them. They wouldn't even allow me to get credit for any incidentals. It was great incentive to not spend a dime in the hotel I didn't have to spend. All in all I can tell you that given a choice I will not stay at the Palmer House again. I wouldn't recommend anyone else stay there either. There are plenty of other great hotels in Chicago.

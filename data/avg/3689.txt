The Magnolia was a perfectly so-so hotel experience, so I was surprised by how much other reviewers raved about it. There is a cool fireplace/lounge on the 2nd floor that we loved, and our room was quiet and sunny. Our room was spacious and had a nice view, but most of the blinds didn't work properly, and one set of them did not open at all. The bathroom was lovely, but had TONS of cobwebs in the window. I was given incorrect information by the front desk when asking if their on-site Starbucks was open (they said no, I trekked out for coffee, upon coming back I noticed that their Starbucks was in fact open). The guys in valet were quick to offer strong recommendations for lunch, and when we returned after checking one out to get our car and go elsewhere, he made jokes about how indecisive women are. Apparently because we didn't like his recommendation. Lastly, we requested non-down pillows. They turned out to be absolutely unusable they were so giantic and uncomfortable. We asked for different non-down pillows the next night, which were exactly as huge and uncomfortable. Our last night we accepted defeat and just slept pillow-free.

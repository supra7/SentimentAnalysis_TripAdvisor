We took a room at the Moore when it seemed that all rooms in Seattle were taken. It has both good and bad features. The accommodations are Spartan but clean and spacious. The location is great except for the drug and alcohol recovery center next door, which results in individuals of questionable character loitering on the street day and night. (These folks can be avoided by walking on 3rd St. or on the west side of 2nd St.) We appreciated the kitchenette, but had to request a microwave, which was provided. There were very few cooking utensils, but nice tableware. There were no knobs on the cooktop, and none could be found by the staff. Electrical wiring was stapled to the walls, and there was no clock or clock radio. We were on the street side, 2nd floor, and there was considerable street noise (much of it from the rehab folks next door.) Free wi-fi worked well. Would we stay here again? Probably. If you limit your expectations, the Moore provides acceptable, spacious, but spartan accommodations.

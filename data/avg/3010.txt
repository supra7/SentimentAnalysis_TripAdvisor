I stayed in this hotel for 8 nights this September. The hotel is in Prenzlauerberg , the hottest spot of Berlin these days. It is also just opposite a metro station (u-bahn). For sure the location is excellent since the neighbourhood is truly vivid, with restaurants, bars, cafes, and people in the streets until early in the morning. Also in the area there is a perfect connection with metro, trams and busses. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, I must admit that it is an average 3 star hotel. The hotel has renovated bathrooms and big rooms. Also it is daily cleaned. Still I have to say that our sheets were not changed not even once during the whole week we stayed. Also the room is covered with a carpet which is dusty and smells. Not to mention the out dated furniture and posters of the room. Overall if you can book it for 80 Euros per night, then is a fair deal. If it costs more you can find better hotel room in an other area. Still if you are determined to stay in Prenzlauer then is your only choice as the rest of the hotels in the area are hostels or 2 star hotels.

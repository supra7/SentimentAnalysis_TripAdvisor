We stayed at the Hyatt Maui Apr 12-18/08; had a lovely room with a beautiful view and an Ultra-soft bed (too soft for the husband). I concur with many of the other reviews, however the beach was a disappointment. Great for beachcombing for Kukui Nuts but otherwise not good for swimming, wading or snorkelling. Lots of seaweed & rolling waves made snorkelling uninspiring and there was a $10 and up charge for lounge chairs & umbrellas in front ot the spa. We spent most afternoons further up Kaanapali beach nearer to the Sheraton at Black Rock snorkelling with turtles. Lounge chairs by the pool seemed to always be occupied by 9am. Windy days meant garbage of all types blowing by and into the pool (drink cups, plastic bottles, pineapple spears etc). We hoped there would be a hospitality suite (such as at the Fairmont Kea Lani in Wailea) to freshen up prior to our late departure but were instead directed to the cramped and unsanitary locker/showers adjacent to the pool where only 1 of the 2 showers were operable. The small ceiling fan did nothing to cool down the room and I left feeling hot & sweaty. Daily 'Resort fee' of $15 is unacceptable for free local calls, packages of coffee in-room, one hour of tennis court time and entrance to the Fitness Room. This fee should immediately become part of the room fee. And no, this fee does not include valet parking. Parking is another issue, especially just prior to the 5pm Luau.

We stayed at this hotel with our 1yo daughter for two nights. It was very conveniently located 5min walk from MRT Lavender station. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful, breakfast area is nice and clean. Rooms are small but that's the case everywhere in Singapore. Very simple and spartan interior, definitely not a cozy and pleasant type of room. It is a three star hotel but we stayed at a better two stars hotel in Singapore. SImple, definitely not three stars, budget hotel. Okay for two nights but wouldn't stay here again.

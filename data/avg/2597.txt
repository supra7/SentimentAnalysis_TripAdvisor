Stayed here over the weekend. I really liked the location...next to Eately, shake shack and was relatively quiet. The lobby, if you even want to call it a lobby, had a weird set-up, was teeny tiny, barely fit a few people and just felt strange. The rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, service was very good but don't expect anything fancy. if your looking for a deal, this is your place but next time I think I will spend a little more to stay at a nicer hotel.

We stayed at the Palmer House over the Labour Day long weekend for 4 nights in a standard room on the 16th floor. Overall, the stay was descent -- what we expected from an historic building and from reading previous reviews. Pros: - great staff, extremely helpful; - very elegantly decorated lobby/main area; - great location, we parked and walked everywhere... ...within 500m to Millennium Park; ...within 1km to Buckingham Fountain in one direction, and the Willis Tower in the other; ...within 2.5km to the north end of Michigan Ave (Magnificent Mile/John Hancock Center); ...within 3.0km to Soldier Field / Shedd Aquarium / Field Museum; ...close to the subway line/bus system; - comfortable bed; Cons: - not all rooms are nicely renovated/new; - room temperature was either really cold or humid, couldn't find a comfortable setting; - bathroom exhaust fan was not functioning, but we were able to hear someone else's conversations from it!; - no free wifi included; - small rooms; We would probably stay here again with the condition that we get one of the renovated rooms with a king bed! good luck!

The Palmer House is absolutely beautiful and our room was comfortable and clean. I did not appreciate having to pay extra fees for amenities that are included at less expensive hotels however. There was a charge for wifi, the fitness center, and even local phone calls. This made my stay frustrating as I am used to looking up maps and other visitor information on the internet.

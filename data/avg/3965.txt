Room is very small, but really clean Stayed at Harbour hotel for 2 nights for my staff's incentive trip to HK. A bit shock with the size of the room since it's very very small. I had a hard time in the night since my feet hit the desk. However, the hotel is pretty new and really clean. The location is good since it's only 3 blocks from Ladies' Market, where you can shop for electronics, cheap clothings and sports shoes. Also, convenient by bus and MTR. If you only need a room to sleep and not very picky about room size, it's great. If you need space, don't even think about coming here.

We picked this hotel because of its location to the airport and the indoor pool..no one told us at check in that there was a private party at the pool..when we saw signs stating it was closed, we tried to call the front desk for almost 20 min before we got someone to answer and they weren't real apologetic about the fact we couldn't use the pool..we also got charged twice for our room service but they did get that resolved..we also had neighbors who were loud all night but we never could get anyone to answer at the front desk..

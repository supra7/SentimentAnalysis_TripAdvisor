the room was very nice and comfort table. The chamber maids didn't come to clean until 4:00 pm the first night 4 of them were there and did and average cleaning, No trash can, sticky floor. 2nd night they did not remove a pile of beach towels on the floor! Which we were told that we would be charged $25. for ea towel not returned. How would they know if they never picked them up. The ice machine does not work like the door you have to LEAVE the card in the slot, we were not told this, even though went to report trouble with the ice machine. Defineately no "extras" The most positive was the location forced us to check out area, long walks. $13 cab ride into Duval St.

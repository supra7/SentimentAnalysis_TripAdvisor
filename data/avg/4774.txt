I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for four nights while in Chicago for a conference. The public spaces are beautiful, and the service is top-notch. I was so impressed with how the staff handled the check-in process, room service, valet parking, etc. My only complaint about the hotel was that my room was much smaller than I expected and a bit run-down. The desk lamp and one of the phones did not work, and the bathroom had not been thoroughly cleaned. Had the hotel not been booked solid for the conference, I would have transferred to a different room. Bottom line: This wouldn't be my first choice for a Chicago hotel, but I would stay here again if it seemed convenient.

Stayed at this hotel for 7 nights in June 2010. Overall, the rooms are small (and the room sizes in each category vary significantly), the front desk is not helpful (seems like they select which HH guests will get the bigger or smaller rooms. The hotel has over 1000 rooms (and if it didn't, it felt like it). In many ways, the staff treated guests as if you were in Las Vegas and didn't need service, just check you in, ignore you and make sure you pay for everything. The lobby restaurant was ok - don't order desserts. The service was good, but slow - really slow. And that was when there were 5 other tables occupied. Imagine what it would be like if it was packed!!! The pool is interesting and small - and will so many rooms and guests, well you get the picture. The only good thing about this hotel were the housekeeping staff. The ones you don't see do a great job of cleaning your rooms, making sure you have enough of everything and make you feel like you're getting something for all the money you're spending. Why is that? I don't get it. Shouldn't the front desk staff be the best? Overall, a terribly unmemorable stay.

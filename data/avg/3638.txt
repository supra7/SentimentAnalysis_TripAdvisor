Stayed three nights for a business conference. I don't like Dallas! Next to Vegas and Houston, it's my least favorite large city in the country. These folks help make the stay more tolerable, especially at my incredible Quikbook rate. Good quality bed, bedding and linens and relatively quiet, especially considering it's right next to a freeway. The morning breakfast is pretty good and really needed since there are no restaurants in the immediate area. Fairly close to Love Field and downtown. A good, centrally located place to base if you have business in the Metroplex. Fairly good wifi but it does get bogged down at peak periods.

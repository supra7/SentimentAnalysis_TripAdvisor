Beautiful surroundings is not all a hotel needs to be a good hotel. Housekeeping was bad (6-night stay). Little things about our stay causes me not to recommend this hotel if you want an all round good stay. From bad bar service to bad housekeeping to food not in par with price this Hilton is not our favorite. Although one good thing is they had plenty of elevators so you never had to wait long for one.

Location is wonderful, aesthetic is artsy and creative. I found the service to be superb. But be aware that the rooms and bathrooms (or at least the one we were in) are very small. They pulled it off in terms of what I called "tiny space made precious", but we had barely enough room to navigate around the queen bed. The shower size requires that you step out to dry off. The sink is a small stainless bowl with no cabinetry. Not a place to cool your heals; reminded me of a Tokyo sleeping "pod". I had read an older review regarding the noise generated by the a/c wall unit. Management responded that it was installing new units. I think ours was one of the newer ones. However, the room is so small that the unit, blowing on "low" was a major imposition on the space...making it feel even smaller. Finally, they charge $12/day for internet access. Is this common in the home of the digital revolution? I can't see treating what has become a common tool of life with the same approach as airlines charging for checked bag. It came across as arrogance...trust me, you're not that special. All told, I'll look for a comparable location next time and happily welcome a good old "non-hip" number of square feet.

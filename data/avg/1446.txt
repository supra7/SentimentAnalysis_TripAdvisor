Pros: Paid only $41 A NIGHT, On Hwy 192 where everything is, close to Disney, free breakfast, Clean, Safe, No bugs, Nice Rooms, Cons: , No park shuttles, thin walls that hear everything in halls, Not too close to Universal Studios If you're on a budget with family this is an AMAZING hotel at excellent price..only paid $41 a night..Hotel has been upgraded Rooms have flat screens, mini fridge, toaster oven, beds comfy, only shower no tub, Pool, free breakfast of pancakes, waffles, bagels, muffins, cereal, juices, free wifi, free parking. Check in they have a few airheads working desk, the girl tried to CHARGE me another stay even tho I told her I paid it already on ORBITZ..$3.50 a day resort fee although this place DEFINATELY ISNT A RESORT. Make sure they dont swipe your card if you already paid for room.. The girl at the front desk swiped my friends card twice even tho we paid in full on Orbitz. Later that day in the after going to Universal Orlando my friend just so happened to call her credit card co. and the credit card co. notified her of a charge that should not have been on her card. The front desk girl swiped $140 on my friends card even tho the rooms were PAID IN FULL, thankfully the credit card co. declined the swipe and nothing went thru, but just a warning if they swipe your card just check ur bank before you leave..as we got it taken care of but just wanted to mention it for others. There are a million restaurants shops places to see on the main Hwy off hotel..Hotel is on W Hwy 192 Off I-4. I would recommend this place if you are on a budget looking for a clean place to stay...just beware of any credit card charges that shouldnt be on your card.

We have been coming to this hotel for years, as a stayover for flights leaving and returning to Seattle airport, and over the years, the facility has seemed in worse and worse shape. It is always something, now, be it the towel hook is falling off the bathroom door, the shower curtain bar is drooping, the toilet flush a little lame, or the hot water a little unpredictable. The staff have always been, and remain, fantastic, which is why we keep coming back. But I think it has reached the point now that we are going to look for somewhere else to lay over before and after flights.

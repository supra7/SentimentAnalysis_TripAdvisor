Beach is nice. Family oriented. Very friendly staff. Facility is dated. No workout facility. Pillows are the worst, bed is ok. I have seen staff replacing mattresses everyday...so that will hopefully be less of an issue. Less expensive than other properties around. We did not have lofty expectations so it is about what we expected.

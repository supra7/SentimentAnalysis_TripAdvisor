Modern rooms, large bed Booking through their website was easy and after registration I got 1000 points worth 1000 Yen that could be use for the first booking. Booked four nights, two months before my travel, if you want a no smoking room you should book well ahead. Average price for a superior single was 8600 Yen. Arrived around noon and could leave my suitcase there after I payed for the stay.The hotel is at a very busy street, lots of traffic throughout the night.Also the walls are very thin, you will hear every sound from the room next to you. So if you are noise sensitive bring your earplugs.8600 yen is not a bargain for this part of town and while the rooms are small the bed was extra large for one person making it hard to store your luggage. No closet, just two hooks an the wall.Nice bath with large bathtub and heated toilet seat ;)TV had no international channels, but some movies where in english with subtitles. Taito-ku is my preferred part of Tokyo, you will not find any upscale Hotels here but if you like a downtown atmosphere and easy excess to all parts of town look for a hotel in this area.

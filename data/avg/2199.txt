I stayed one night at the Trump with my wife for our anniversary and I was very surprised by the poor service. The hotel itself along with the room were beautiful, and basically what I would have expected. When I arrived and looked over the room, I noticed there were no wine or champagne glasses. When the bellman brought up our luggage I asked if he could have some sent up along with a wine bottle cooler (metal bucket with ice). He said it would be brought right up. 30 minutes later someone brought up an empty plastic bucket, that's all. I asked for the ice along with the glasses again. 30 minutes later nothing. I called housekeeping and they said they would send it right up. another 30 minutes and still nothing. I then called the front desk and they said it would be right up. Still nothing after another 30 minutes. After talking to 4 different people from 4 different departments all promising but not delivering I was extremely disappointed. All I wanted to do was have some wine and champagne with my wife. I would expect better service from a hotel of this calibur. Overall the place is nice but they need to work on their customer service.

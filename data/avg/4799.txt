We stayed here at the end of summer 2011 with another couple. Since we were only staying one night, we only booked one room. We asked for a room with two beds. We actually called three times to confirm we had two beds and were old each time, "Yes, you have a room with two beds". Well, upon check in, we were told we had a room with one king bed. Nothing could be done since the hotel was completely booked. So, one couple got stuck sleeping on a roll away....which they tried to charge us $48 for, even though it was their error that caused us to need the roll away. The room was a little small, but would have been sufficient for one couple (which is what it's meant for). The tv was a small tube tv. The lobby is gorgeous and historic. The elevators take some time, but it's a large, old building, so it's to be expected. The location is decent, but about a twenty minute walk from downtown, especially if you plan to visit the Mag. Mile or Navy Pier. Staff was mostly rude and unhelpful. One upside is after 9:00 pm you are not permitted into the hotel without showing your room key. That made me feel safe once inside. Also, there's not too many restaurants on this block, so you're stuck walking a bit or eating at the hotel itself. Overall, just an ok visit.

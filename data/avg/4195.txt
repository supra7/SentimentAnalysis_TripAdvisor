For a medium budget city centre hotel the Plaza is pretty much exactly what you'd expect. The big plus is the location. Convenient for the subway and also for walking into the city centre. We had no need to contact the staff beyond checking in and out, the room was fine and we had no problems. We didn't eat in the hotel, so I can't comment on that. Overall it was, as I say, exactly what I expected from a slightly tired, large city centre hotel. I've stayed in many similar hotels in similar cities and would do so again.

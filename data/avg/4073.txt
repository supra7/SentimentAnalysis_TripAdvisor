I stay in Marriott hotels almost exclusively, and I find this hotel to be inferior in almost every regard. Granted, the location is excellent and the Champion restaurant and sports bar is very good, but there are many aspects of this hotel that are unacceptable for such a costly property. There are extra fees for everything. If you arrive at night, the valet parking ($40.00) will most likely be filled and you will be forced to park in the Copley Place mall parking. There is an hourly rate for that parking structure and can cost well in excess of $50.00 per day if you take your car out even once. The hotel fails to tell you that you can get a validation in the mall that will reduce the cost (albeit slightly). The internet charge is $12.95/day and if you want to use your computer in the restaurant or other areas of the hotel, you have to pay an additional charge or go to the Sheraton where it is free (according to Marriott personnel). We took a red eye flight from California and they could not accommodate an early check-in, but assured us that they would call us as soon as a room became available...let me say that the call never came. I didn't find most of the concierge staff to be friendly although they were, in general, competent. In addition, the hotel is in need of renovation. The carpet was stained, the furniture nicked and the "grips" in the bathtub were dark and in general looked unclean. The furnishings are very plain and the room was not particularly attractive. In general, this hotel is neither typical of the quality I expect from Marriott nor worth the cost. I don't understand why this hotel has received such high ratings...this hotel has only one thing going for it...location, location, location.

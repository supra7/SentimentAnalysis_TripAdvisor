Stayed for three nights with my wife. Automated easy check in. The room was clean and tidy typical travel lodge. We stayed in room 207 on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday it was very noisy till the early hours and again early in the morning. It felt like the window was open. At times you could hear the traffic very loud. We should have probably asked to change rooms but didn't. Having said that we had a great time and only struggled to sleep one night. The continental breakfast was ok. But if I went again I would make sure I didn't have a room facing the station.

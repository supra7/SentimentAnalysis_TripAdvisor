More than once the keys to our room failed to work and had to be reprogrammed. At one point the hotel staff gave us a lesson on electronic keys as if they were talking to five year olds. The bathtub was dirty. There were used toiletries in the tub, complete with someone else's hair stuck to them and the bottom of the tub. When housekeeping arrived to take care of the issue she didn't knock when entering the room and then proceeded to tell us she had already cleaned the bathroom. She then removed the used items, after they were pointed out, and simply rinsed the hair out of the tub. That is not cleaning. The location of this hotel is decent. It's walking distance to just about everything downtown has to offer and if you can't walk there it puts you a short distance from all public transportation. We did have a great view of the Space Needle, but even that isn't enough to make up for poor customer service and lack of cleanliness. I debated chaning hotels all together, but there were several big events in Seattle that weekend and I wasn't going to be able to get another room on such short notice.

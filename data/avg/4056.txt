If you want the feel of staying in a shopping mall, this is the place for you "Just OK" was used in an earlier review and that was our reaction after two nights here over President's Day Weekend. Not bad but not as nice as other Marriott's in which we have stayed. Location is great - nice walk over Newbury Street to the Commons, close to three T stops. The staff was helpful and pleasant. Room was small but had a nice view of the Charles River. BUT - having a drink at the bar is hardly relaxing when you are among crowds of shoppers coming through from adjacent Copley Place and there are uniformed security gaurds patrolling the area. It was like having a drink in the atrium of a large mall. If you want coffee and the Starbucks on the 2nd floor is not open, you're out of luck - no coffeemakers in the room or the lobby. And while the room rate was good, some of the prices were outrageous, such as $44 per night for valet parking and the cost of breakfast. With tax/tip included the basic "healthy start" breakfast of juice, coffee and cereal would have cost almost what we paid for two full-sized breakfasts at a nearby insitution, Charlie's, on Columbus Avenue. There was a charge to use the computers - a service that budget chains usually provide free. The hotel gift shop - which sells the local paper - was not open when it was supposed to be.

In the middle of bustling Chinatown is Hotel 91. Immediately surprised by its cleanliness and comfortable beds! The property has a very "fresh" feel. Our room had 2 double beds (they reminded us of the Westin's "Heavenly Beds". A/C was very quiet and efficient, plenty of hot water, free high speed ethernet, flat screen tv. Overall room size was a bit small, the window view on the 6th floor was the traffic/train of the Manhattan Bridge (almost touching distance!). A bit noisy, but the double-paned windows helped and it didn't interrupt sleep. No fridge, We only saw Chinese food nearby (Starbucks about 1/2 mile away). "Complimentary coffee and tea" on 2nd floor was a hot pot with instant Folgers or tea bags. Walking distance to the Brooklyn Bridge, Ground Zero. Good value for money. Nice and helpful staff. Parking at $32/day on Henry St (near the backdoor entrance to hotel).

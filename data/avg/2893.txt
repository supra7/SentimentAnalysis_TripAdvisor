Indeed the hotel is at a great location, at the end of Castillana avenue, close to all urban highways, 30 floors of marble and glass, very clean, large rooms, all possible amenities but... to deserve 5 stars an hotel has to give you a special feeling, something that you do not retrieve somewhere else, that makes you remember the place. For me, it will not be the case of Eurostar tower !

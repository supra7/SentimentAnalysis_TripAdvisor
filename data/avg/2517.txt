This hotel is in a very nice setting, right on the water next to a well-used path. The rooms are well-designed; they are beautiful to look out and easy to "live in." Also, everything was clean, in the room and around the hotel. The pool was clean, the perfect temperature and an OK size. Most things are really perfect about this hotel, except the noisy hallways. On both Friday and Saturday night, we were kept up by people being quite loud in the hall. Also, on Sunday morning, we were roused by a fire alarm at about 5:00. It appeared that an employee in the cafe burned something, causing all the hotel guests to be evacuated. I wonder what they can do about the noise. I want them to do something because I would love to return to this lovely hotel.

A friend booked the hotel rooms for our conference and after reading all of the negatives I was really worried. But after spending 5 nights, I have to say that really was just an average hotel experience. Small rooms, but that's to be expected from an old hotel. I was fortunate to have one of the remodeled queen size rooms. Bathroom had a great deep tub that was much appreciated after 8 hours of flying. Rooms were clean, housekeeping staff very friendly. I had a lovely dinner at McCormick & Schmicks, but since they lease the space, I don't know that I'd weigh my review in the hotel's favor. Room service was prompt, but the food was rather unexceptional. Wouldn't stay there again, despite the great location.

Jewelry was stolen out of my wife's luggage upon check in. The hotel management and security have been less than helpful, professional or compassionate. Upon arrival, we were instructed to leave our luggage with hotel staff at the front of the hotel. We were transported to "preferred" check in. An hour later, when we got to our room, we waited about 20 minutes for the luggage to arrive. At that time, we discovered that a small jewelry bag had been removed from my wife's baggage. The property manager, Rafael, just wants to smile and hope we have a nice stay. He promised that he would get back to us with a report the following day (Friday). We never heard from him. The following day, Saturday, we kept "missing him." Finally, at 5pm, we caught up with him. He was condescending and throwing around a fake smile. Every time we talk to him, we get a different story. You can get a police report. You can not get a police report. We will take you. We won't take you. They promised to take us and then at the last minute, told us that something came up. We highly advise against any American to stay at this resort. While the beach is lovely, the food is mediocre, and the rooms are dated and stale. If you want an All-inclusive, we highly recommend Excellence Playa Mujeres. We went there twice last year and regret we didn't make it a third time.

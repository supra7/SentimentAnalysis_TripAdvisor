I had a very long drive from Las Vegas that took 5.5 hours and all I wanted to do was to sit by the pool for an hour...the pool was closed and the clerk said it was a 20 min drive to Santa Monica beach - one hour and fifteen mins later I arrived at the beach - it took another hour and a half to get back to the hotel -DONT TRUST THEIR TIMING!!! Hotel was ok for position for Hollywood Walk of Fame and Chinese Theatre. Clean and fairly comfortable.

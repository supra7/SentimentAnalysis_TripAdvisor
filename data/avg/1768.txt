In terms of staff and amenities, the Maui Resort is up to the kind of Hyatt quality you'd expect. However, there are a couple of caveats. If you opt for an ocean facing room, expect a lot of noise from the live music in the central court area or from the nightly luaus at the south end of the property. The live music can run from 4 - 11 and when they brought in a large band, conversation or watching TV in our 9th floor room was almost impossible. Also, unless you choose to partake of the hotel's rather limited (and very pricey menu), you'll need to drive or take a fairly long walk to the nearest convenience store or small restaurant that offers light meals. The hotel's own small sundry store only offers candy, cookie and potato chips for snacks. We were also a bit offended by the electronically monitored snack tray ($3 candy bars!?). If you touch it, you've bought it. We generally like Hyatt when traveling, but this will not be a resort we'll return to.

Overall the property is very nice. Upgraded from a studio to a 1 bedroom suite at an additional $50.00 per night. The suite is twice the size of the studio. Suite was nicely furnished with a L shaped sectional that converts into a bed. My roommate slept in it, but I found it very uncomfortable. Very thin mattress, but my roommate seemed to enjoy it as he slept for 8 hours every day. Called housekeeping to make up the pull up at 2:00am and they were very accomodating. As I stated overall the hotel is fine, but there were a few small things that didn't get done. One day houskeeping didn't clean our room even though we had the indicator on. I woke up early and asked to have the wake up call cancelled, but it still rang. Found small pieces of broken plastic in the bathroom and in the carpet of the bedroom. Things like this I expect to be taken care of at a 5 star hotel. The train didn't wake me up, but i did notice it when I was awake. ?? Did not use any of the facilities of the hotel. Did order room service though. $5.00 service charge for delivery and addional 18% gratuity and taxes added to the bill. $17.00 trump burger turns into $27.27.

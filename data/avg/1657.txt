The Hilton San Diego Bayfront is a perfect location! It's in downtown near the Gaslamp District and oceanfront. Petco Park is easy access with a walking bridge from hotel over the street. The room was standard size, certainly not large. It actually felt small for two adults and two teenagers. Luckily we were only there for one night. I booked through Expedia and had a special rate that included self-parking (reg. $26) and a $35 resort fee which we used to cover part of our breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, we were not impressed. The atmosphere was nice but the food was nothing special. I would have enjoyed breakfast at Denny's more....and for a lot less money! Overall, the hotel is newer and has nice decor in the lobby but would just give an average rating to the room. Location is great!

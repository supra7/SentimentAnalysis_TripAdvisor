A nice informal hotel in a great spot in Singapore. Away from the city but surrounded by restaurants and bars of Bukit Timah and Sixth Avenue. The rooms are clean and fairly comfortable, albeit a little basic, but given the room rate is fair, no problem. My only real gripe is the breakfast which borders on inedible. Tea ran out, although told 2 minutes, which after 15 minutes never appeared. I asked for a tea bag so i could make my own - no joy - no tea. Friday's breakfast offerings - Curried beans, something I can describe as left-over soggy pasta mixed with tuna?, deep fried chicken nuggests, soggy french toast and overcooked boiled eggs. Still, good for the diet eh? My advice, ask for a $10 discount on the room in return for no breakfast and walk the 20 metres to Picotin and buy breakfast there. Given I stay in alot of hotels in Singpare, it's a shame as I was feeling good about the lodge but the breakfast really blows. Still, on balance good to stay at with just a poor breakfast letting it down.

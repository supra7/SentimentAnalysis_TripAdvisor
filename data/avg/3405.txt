We picked this hotel for a 14-hour stopover in Singapore. We arrived into Terminal 3 and the hotel is right there. Our room was comfortable and spacious. The only issue I had was the noise. Some TA reviews said noise problem was minimal, not in our case. Our room faced the runway side, you actually see planes landing and taking off. It was not gentle humming, rather it sounded like a fighter jet just flew past your window. And the take off noise lasted well past midnight, and began around 6 am in the morning. We had Room 908 which I believe is on the top floor, the worst part was that it was at a corner i.e. no neighboring room on one side - that probably aggravated the noise problem. Guess it might be quieter if we were in a sandwiched room on a lower floor? The hotel is ok but quite over-priced in my opinion.

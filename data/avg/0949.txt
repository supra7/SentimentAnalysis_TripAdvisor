Three of us shared a room for one night while in town to attend a Seattle Seahawks game. We basically just needed a place to sleep, and that's why we chose this property. They asked us at check in which floor we would rather have - we said the ground floor, but when we discovered that the pool was right outside our window, we opted for the third floor overlooking an alley. Plus, you could really smell the chlorine. Our second attempt was much better, the room did not smell, and it was very tidy. There was a small in-room safe, but no fridge. The bathroom was small - we did have a tub - and one of the outlets in our room was not working, but overall the condition of the room was what I expected for a $70 a night hotel in the downtown area of a major city. There was a shuttle to and from the game for $2.50 each way and a complimentary Sunday paper. The continental breakfast included toast, pastries, bagels and muffins and the usual breakfast beverages. We chose bagels, but they did not taste good at all, so we just popped over to the Starbucks a block away. The major complaint that I would have about this property is that they need to do renovations in their bathrooms. The fan in the bathroom was not working well, and with three women, we needed a little more room and a little less humidity. From the other reviews I've read, it sounds as though the comfort of your stay might depend on which room you are given, as they don't have standard amenities in every room (no tubs or fridges in some). A good hotel for the price and if you just need a place to sleep, but I would not recommend this hotel for lengthy stays.

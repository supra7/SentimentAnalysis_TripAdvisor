They've recently renovated the lobby, and it shows. It has a "modern Dutch design" feel complete with molded plastic furniture and bright green tones. The restaurant and breakfast buffet are also very nice (which is good, because there's very little else around). Fortunately, the Metro is close, and you can get to the city in a flash, as well as connect to trains all over. But the room, while not bad, had a constant smell of mold (from the bathroom) and barely room to store our suticases. The bed was one of the hardest I've ever slept in (a plus if you like a hard bed, but I don't). Keep in mind, this was one of the more expensive rooms in the property. We tried to spend as much time as possible outside of our room, since the mold aggravated my allergies. I was happy for the free wi-fi; however, it went out quite often - once, we had to ask the staff to correct it 3 times before they got it to work again.

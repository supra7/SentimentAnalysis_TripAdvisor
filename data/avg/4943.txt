I was impressed upon arrival. The hotel is very grand and the rooms are appointed very nicely. However, I had a very difficult time getting any real sleep here for two reasons... 1. My bed was within inches of my room's door, which is turn was right next to two other room doors. One of my neighbors came and went all night long, with the doors slamming just a foot or so from my head waking me each and every time. 2. My room was located above a train station and the trains ran all night long. One final complaint... the room service menu was very limited although the food was delivered quickly. I'll be looking elsewhere for my next stay.

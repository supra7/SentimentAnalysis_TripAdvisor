This is a functional but comfortable hotel on a busy dual carriageway in the Brent Cross area of north London. I was given a double room on the ground floor at the back of the hotel (the front was covered in scaffolding and polythene sheet). The room was large, comfortable and well-equipped, as well as being away from the traffic noise; scuffed here and there and some cheapish fittings, but everything worked properly and the bathroom included a 3/4 bath as well as a shower. My only real complaint was the lack of sound insulation from other rooms: TVs on until midnight, then the first people leaving at 5.30. The restaurant wasn't serving dinner, but the receptionist organised a take-away and provided plates, cutlery etc - in fact the service overall was excellent. I didn't use the parking but it seemed quite limited and I noticed a guest arguing with the receptionist because she had been blocked in by someone else.

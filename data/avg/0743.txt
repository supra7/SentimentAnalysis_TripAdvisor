Hmmm....I am unsure exactly how I would sum up my stay at the Edgewater. I stayed for a night with my girlfriend in March so we could go out downtown and catch Martin Lawrence while he was in town. I got the room on priceline for $65 ($80 after taxes) so I was pretty happy heading into the evening. Like another poster mentioned, there is a parking garage across the street that you can park overnight in for $18...I just pulled right up to the valet and dropped my girlfriend off and then went and parked the car. Took about 2 minutes. Honestly though, I just don't get why this hotel has such a fancy rep? The people working the desk were not very friendly (they weren't unfriendly) but barely took the time to smile or greet me upon check in. Our room was up a few levels and towards the street although we kind of liked the train sound. It wasn't obnoxious and I like the background noise instead of listening to other guests thru the walls. Shower/bathroom were very nice; fireplace in the room was also cool. Ordered room service in the morning and was told it would be 1/2 hour....45 minutes to an hour later we were still waiting. Pancakes and a side of bacon and the bill was $23! Oh well. Neither of us liked the bed, we woke up at 7 am with aches all over although we should probably attribute that to the bottles of wine we drank the night before. Overall, the hotel is ok for the price I paid. I am a little scared to priceline another hotel though next week for the John Mayer concert b/c I am worried I may get the Edgewater again....what does that tell you? I wouldn't stay here again by choice; if I get hooked up again for cheap thru priceline I won't be too disappointed although I hope I don't! Last thought; paying for wireless sucks and I know that most hotels do this but come on.....

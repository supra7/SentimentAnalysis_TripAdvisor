Ok hotel, terrible breakfast We stayed at the hotel for one night because of the close location to the airport. The hotel was ok for this price, the service was good and the room was clean. They had a swimmingpool, but it was inside and not like in the pictures in the hotel information in the room (with a jacuzi). The breakfast was not included. It cost 15 euros and was NOT worth the money. They did not have fresh bread and everyting else tasted bad. The location is 10 min away from the airport. I dont know if there is a bus, we had a rental car. The area around has a few bars etc., but not any good restaurants. I would not stay there again.

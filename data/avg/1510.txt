This is a factual account of my experience at the resort and I can understand how there are extreme differences of opinion on this resort, which I chaulk up to its all-inclusive nature. To start I must say that this was my first stay at an all-inclusive property. The experience is not for me, so understand that in viewing my comments. Location - This region of the Rivera Maya is really great. The beach is truly spectacular. Property - The resort is clean and in extremely nice/new condition. Pool - The pool is large and well designed. Another plus. The pool chair reserving is out of control and can really be a nuisance. Beware if you brush off such talk. Food - I really cannot understand the many comments about the "great" food. Really? Come on now, really? What does it say that the breakfastfood is the best of the three meals. The breakfast is pretty good. But the sit down meals are average to bad. For anyone to suggest otherwise really must have low expectations. Beverage - No qualms on the drink, except bring your own wine unless you want to have their slop. The beer and mixed drinks are quite fine. Service - The service is probably a little above average. The effort is there, but the property and number of rooms are so large that top notch service is not reasonable to expect. Fitness Center - An F. Not a C or a D. An F. All-inclusive Aspect - Not for me. I like great food, relaxation, small crowds, intimate setting and a low employee/guest ratio.

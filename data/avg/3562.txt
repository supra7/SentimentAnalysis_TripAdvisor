The hotel is exactly what it claims to be, a 2 star hotel. It was clean but basic. The furniture was clean and in good shape but had that "cheap" look to them. The air worked fine and I had no problem with leaks or oders. The bed was of average comfort but the sheets were on the rough side. I used the self serve laundry facilities. They have one washer and one dryer and it costs $1 each to use them. You can get detergent and softener at the front desk for $1. The breakfast in the AM consisted of scrambled eggs, sausage, make it yourself waffles, pastries, cereals etc. It was very crowded and they ran out of plates. They have one waffle maker. They also have the slowest elevators I have ever seen. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is just off the interstate and easily accesible to downtown. It is in a safe area and the hotel clientele were mainly tourists. I stayed here for two nights using my Hyatt gold points. I would not stay here again unless it were free but I am partial to "nicer" hotels.

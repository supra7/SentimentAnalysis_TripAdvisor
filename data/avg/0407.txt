Be sure to ask for a room on the West side of the hotel. The East side faces the highway and can be pretty noisy. The room was nice, clean and spacious enough. All dining and attractions were located at least several blocks away if not more, all downhill. That sounds great until you have to hike back up. The $30/night parking was steep, but this is a city. Next time I will stay closer in town to, believe it or not, avoid noise and be closer to the attractions.

We stayed at Hotel Opera for 3 nights in October. We primarily stayed there because of the price, and it was a decent hotel. Rooms were the smallest we encountered in our 2 weeks of Italy, but clean. The bathroom was also the smallest we encountered, but also clean. It was hard to manuever in the shower without hitting your elbow. The breakfast was ok (cheeses, meats, pastries, hard boiled eggs, made to order cappuchino). Internet was free, which was nice. The location was fine for us, but not ideal. About 6 blocks from the train station, and a 20 minute walk from most of the historic sites.

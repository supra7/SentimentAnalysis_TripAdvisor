We stayed at Hotel Max over Thanksgiving. Pros: 1. Location - we were within walking distance of just about everything we wanted to do in Seattle - the Aquarium, Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle, the Experience Music Project/Scifi Museum, and countless little shops and restaurants. 2. Style/Aesthetics - this is a very hip little hotel, great decor, artwork and ambiance (including the music in the lobby). We also had a nice view of downtown from the 10th floor. 3. Service - the attendants at the front desk were helpful and polite. 4. Sushi Restaurant - the restaurant/bar attached to the hotel was oustanding - excellent food and drink at good prices. They have a great happy hour from 4-6 every day. Cons: 1. Size - the rooms are not big at all, and the bathroom and shower are pretty tiny. Really, the rooms are about the size you'd typically find on a cruise ship. My wife typically gets ready for the day before I do, which is fortunate because we would not have been able to at the same time due to limited bathroom/counter space. 2. Wi-Fi - costs about $12 per 24 hours. 3. Clutter - it's such a small room to begin with, and way too much space is taken up by food/drink/t-shirts that Hotel Max is trying to sell you. The refrigerator was completely full - since we had our own food and drinks from Pike's Place Market, we had to empty the fridge first. The bedside table also had a tray of these items, which we just moved under the desk. 4. Phone - Local phone calls are a dollar - is that normal for hotels in Seattle? Overall, we enjoyed our stay although I think if we return to Seattle we might try our luck with one of the other hotels in the area. I would recommend Hotel Max to some couples we know who would not mind the close quarters and would appreciate the location and decor.

There are a few issues but ultimately if you are on a budget, for the money, this place is worth it. I was concerned about the few negative reviews but it turned out to be okay and nice in many ways. Pros: Location Beach Garden Security managed to retrieve our back pack (had been stolen at the beach) with most of the contents Staff is nice Kauai Room 476 has a lovely view Cons: Balcony railing wobbled Bathroom needs a new shower curtain and toilet, bathroom floor and shower curtain rod need deep cleaning and water does not drain from tub fast enough No free wifi No free parking Other notes: If you don't have much time, I would go to either Hana or Haleakala but not both. We only had 5 full days so in hindsight I'd only give up one beach day to do a lot of driving. Drive up and down the coast to other snorkeling beaches instead. Also, be sure to look at the Banyan tree in old Lahaina, wow! Going to costco is okay but we ended up with too much of some stuff and Safeway is actually more practical with similar prices. Rent boogie boards and snorkel gear much cheaper than at the hotel down front street or next to cannery mall. If you need gifts get them at Longs and in Cannery Mall, where you can get t-shirts 4 for 20 bucks.There is also a cheap food court there. Also, next time I'd go to Molokini for a 2 hour 25 dollar snorkeling tour. The Royal Lahaina Luau is fantastic but there are cheaper ones that are probably also good.

Although the location of the Palmer House is great is was downhill from there. On the day my husband and I arrived there were massive lines to check in on a boiling hot day when we had just arrived from the airport. A nice touch was the small bottle of water the staff provided while waiting. The room was especially disappointing, small and lacking in facilities, i.e. no minibar or tea/coffee making equipment. My husband is a member of Hilton Honors but even if he weren't we would have expected better. Compared to other Hilton hotels we have stayed in this was a serious let down.

Some things were very nice-some horrible. I think the valet doing a walk around to mark all the dents and scratches on your vehicle so that you don't accuse them of damage to the car should happen after they have assisted you with your bags-not instead of helping. Check in was quick. We were upgraded to a higher floor-gratis. The room was comfortable and clean. Then we went to the restaurant-during brunch hours. The menu was very limited-and horribly overpriced. I ordered the chefs special. $14 for 3 small pancakes. They were not cooked! My husband ordered a basic sausage, egg, potatoes-which I believe was $18. The potatoes and toast were black. The waitress never returned to the table to check on us. When she did finally come back we told her of our displeasure and they took off one meal. We would NOT recommend this restaurant. The hotel has a great location. Parking is now $44 per night. I did get a great rate for the hotel. We would stay again-but eat elsewhere.

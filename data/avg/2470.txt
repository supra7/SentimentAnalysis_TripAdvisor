We knew this hotel was being upgraded. It's covered in scaffolding and smells of paint. Most alarmingly - ALL FIRE DOORS WEDGED OPEN AND SMOKE DETECTORS IN RESTAURANT COVERED WITH FOIL. Pointed this out to reception who didnt seem concerned. Booked a refurbished room, for which you pay a bit extra. Beautiful high quality fittings and lovely ideas, but must have got cowboys to do it. Very tatty work. Blind too short for window, quilt too small for bed. No drawers in room, awkward place to plug in kettle under the desk, only 1 mirror and 1 bin - in bathroom. No biscuits, no body lotion, tissues etc. Breakfast was average. SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, VERY FRIENDLY AND EFFICIENT. About 20 mins walk to tube at Golders Green, bit of a dodgy area at night?? Hotel is also on a very busy/noisy road, would benefit from triple glazing to the front. Hope it will all be finished off properly as could be really lovely, and was good value for what we wanted it for. Would stay again if the Fire Officer has been!

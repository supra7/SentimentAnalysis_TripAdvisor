We arrived at the Hyatt Regency around midday from Australia for a 6 day stay for our honeymoon. We has spent a huge amount of money for this 'honeymoon destination' but we are very disappointed!!! We were told our room would be ready within a number of minutes, we went and waited and ate lunch by the pool for an hour then headed back to reception and were told by another receptionist that our room wouldn't be ready until 4pm (another 3 hours), I told the receptionist I wasn't feeling too well and asked if there was anywhere I could sit out of the cold and wind- she said she didn't know. When we got to our room luggage department had misplaced our luggage because reception had taken our luggage ticket. We paid more in our package for breakfast- not worth it! There was bird faesces on our plates and finches flying all through the dining area. Our mini-bar wouldn't unlock and staff did nothing for 3 days (even after I had called 4 times about it), maintenance finally came to fix it. Our balcony door wouldn't open and when I inquired about it they said maintenance would fix it- they didn't. This has been the least special honeymoon possible- thanks to rude and ignorant staff at the Hyatt that left me in tears!

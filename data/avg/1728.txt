I stayed here for 6 days as part of a work conference. We had a hard time finding the hotel as the hotel signage is quite inconspicuous. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was quite spacious and clean. The gym/tennis facilities were excellent. I had a lot of trouble with the wireless and I wasted over an hour on the phone with technical support to try to fix it but no luck. The front desk manager said she would send someone to my room to fix it within 10 minutes. I waited over an hour and no one came. I gave up and just used the wireless in the lobby which worked very well. I tried to get a 1 pm checkout but was told it was impossible. Oh well. Anyway, it was a nice stay overall.

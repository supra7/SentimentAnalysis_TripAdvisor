I was reconciled to paying big bucks to be in Copley Square, Boston, which is convenient to Newberry St. shopping, Fenway Park, and art museums. For the $300+/night price tag, though, I expected FREE wi-fi and a complimentary breakfast. Had a king bed room and a comfy chaise longue. The room was quiet (10th floor, facing a pedestrian way, so no vehicular traffic). No shampoo -- probably an oversight that housekeeping would have gladly furnished. But at these prices, it should not have been overlooked in the first place. The heating/cooling thermostat was not intuitive and took a long time to figure out. A 7-min. walk to Fenway, across the street from the Prudential Center and Legal Sea Food, and a few blocks walk to the art museums make the location ideal for touring the west side of the City. An MTA station was close by.

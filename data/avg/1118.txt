Booked through a price-it yourself-online site. Got a great deal of less than $75/night. We stayed for one night. Had to use their valet parking service at an expensive $30 for the overnight. There is a public outside lot directly across the street which I would have used but they require you to move the car by 6 AM; it was only $15-20, I think. The room was small, although they gave us a room overlooking the Space Needle. We were on an odd-numbered floor and they only have ice machines on the even numbers. Had to go down to the check-in desk to find out. The phone in our room never worked either. It would give the dial tone but wouldn't dial whether you used the instant buttons (front desk, concierge, etc.) or the ext. listed... All in all, an average experience that was doable only because of the great deal we got.

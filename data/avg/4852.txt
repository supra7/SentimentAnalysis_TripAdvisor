This property is no longer a 4 star hotel. While the lobby remains grand, the rooms are very small and in need of a makeover. The carpet was frayed, wallpaper was peeling off and doors and door frames are beat up. You can barely turn around in the bathroom, and when the closet door is open you cannot get to the bathroom or bed. The TV's are ancient, and there is no coffeemaker nor refrigerator in the room. The front desk clerk was rude to my wife when she checked in. The hotel charges a fee of $10 per person per day to use the fitness facilities and another fee to access the internet. Valet parking is over $60 per night. Could Hilton possibly nick us for any more fees? They are worse than the airlines. The only reason we stayed here was that all the other downtown hotels were booked up. In the future that would be the only reason we would ever stay here again.

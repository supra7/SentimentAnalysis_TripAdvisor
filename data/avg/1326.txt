I stayed here on my last day in Seattle since it was closer to the aiport for my 5am flight. Even though it was a bit hidden toward the back I was very suprised at how nicely done the entrance was. I walked it and you are greeted with a lodge type setting with nice comfy looking couches welcoming you in. Instead of a check in desk there were 3 small stations that you can check into the hotel. It was nicely done and made me feel very homely. The way to the room was a bit awkward since the floor was U shaped you had to walk all the way around to reach your room. I utilized the pool and it was a nice pool with Adult hours if you don't like sharing with kids and with two jacuzzi's available. The room was clean but the one i stayed in was a special for disabled people. So I was a little put off that the disabled shower chair was still in the bathroom that was a little weathered with yellow color tone to it. I wish they would have taken it out to fit the clientele that will be staying in it. But it was nice that the hotel accomodates for this. Check out was easy and the rooms was pretty nice. I loved the comfy beds, pillows, and the airport shuttle! Since I needed a ride to the airport the shuttle was most convenient! You can view their webpage to check out the entrance to the hotel.

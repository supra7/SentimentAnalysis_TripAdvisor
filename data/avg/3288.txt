Stayed there for one night with my family. It is in walking distance of Friedrichstrasse, and the subway. Which is very good. It all seems very new and exotic, although our room was very small, and the view from the window was over a construction site, so not exactly exciting. The pillows were the same German giant pillows that I hate, but I knew that before going. Beds were comfortable and the room and bathroom were clean and nice. We only stayed there over night so the view(or lack there of) didn't bother us so much. Parking place was pretty expensive, but at least they had it, somewhere in the back with staff parking. Not vey easy to find and park. Staff was friendly and helpful. Lobby was not so exciting, but did its job.

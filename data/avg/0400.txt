We booked our one night stay on Priceline after winning a bid for $75.00 for the night. Priceline says this hotel is a 4 star property, but it is not in my opinion. I would put it at a 3 or possily 3.5 star. Here is why... The room furniture was scratched and had gouges in the surface. The tiles in the shower were cracked. There were scuff marks on painted surfaces. To me 4 star is attention to those details. So the room itself was more like a 3. The service was a little better. When we arrived I had mentioned we were there for my wife's birthday, and they asked me if we liked Wine or Beer. I said I liked Beer but my wife doesn't drink. When we returned from dinner they had placed two bottles of beer and a bottle of sparkling cider on ice in the room. Very cool. That service bumped me up to probably a 3.5 overall. The pool and hot tub were nice we spent a couple of hours there. Didn't try any of their lounges or restaurants. As far as noise goes, I do have to say you can hear things pretty easily. Heard a vaccum running in the morning, toilets flushing, heavy doors shutting, hotel itself creeking in the wind, and occasionally voices. Have to say the residants in the condos across the way are very entertaining and some even seem to enjoy putting on a show if you know what I mean. The parking underneath is tight. Hard to navigate and didn't appear to be enough. We came back around midnight or so and had to go all the way down. Overall, I can't complain for the price we paid. I'd stay again for that rate, but wouldn't pay full fare to stay here.

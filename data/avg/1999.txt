Exactly as the title, this hotel was very over priced for what it was. The staff were lovely but you literally could not swing a cat in this hotel it was one of the most cramped places I have ever stayed at. The hotels pictures are thoroughly mis leading, imagine a very narrow tiny house, that what this hotel is. everything is cramped and squashed from the moment you get in. I left in the end and stayed at the 4 seasons, which although is double the price, you get some breathing space. Location of this hotel wasnt bad, very close to all the main attractions in Sultanahmet, and the staff were very nice. In terms of the food, it was awful, at breakfast the juice was all from diluted concentrates, and there was a very limited range of food. Lots of the food I had for some reason had hairs in it. There was no ambience for the price you paid, it was just all squashed up cramped living, at breakfast every time someone moved their chair would grind against the floor and make the worst noises. I would not ever expect to pay this kind of money for a hotel like this again...

This is the ideal hotel if you book it through Priceline, Hotwire or one of the other discount booking sites. You'll get it for alot less than booking through the hotel directly, which will cause you to be a little more tolerant of dated decor, small rooms and the constant noises coming from the on-going remodeling of the hotel. The Palmer House is ideally located just south of the river and just inside the Loop very close to the El and blue and red metro lines. You're close to all the shopping and major attractions Chicago has to offer. The decor of this hotel has a definite 80's, floral patterned, faux-renaissance look to it. In this day and age of hip, boutique hotels with neutral colors and sleek lines, the Palmer House is a fossil. When I mentioned small rooms, I must admit, I was fortunate enough to get a room on the 17th floor that at an earlier time had been two rooms (I viewed a few rooms being cleaned, and the bed took up ALOT of space). It was simple to tell my room had been two separate rooms because it was easy to determine where the extra wall had once been and there were two, identical bathrooms on either side of the room. You may luck out and get a room that is not near the current area of remodeling, but just in case bring earplugs. I was awakened at 6 a.m. on a Friday by the drilling and banging. After calling down to the front desk, I was informed that that was the hour working began during the week. Weekends (yes, Sunday too) aren't much better; they get started at 7 a.m. All in all, it was worth the money spent (thanks to Priceline). If you are looking for a clean, centrally located hotel in a great city, then this is it.

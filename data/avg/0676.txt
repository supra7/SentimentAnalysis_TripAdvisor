We stayed at the Hotel Andra for 2 nights before heading to Vancouver. The hotel looks like a great European Boutique hotel, which we liked. The area seems to be quiet and sweetjust watch which way you walk. There are many vagrants wandering the streets as you get closer to Pike Place Market. The hotel itself is nice. The staff could just use a bit of a pep talk. When we checked in, the front desk attendant tried to change the price of one of the 2 nights of our original reservation. Then when my husband asked for an itemized receipt to verify upon checkout, another clerk seemed as if he couldnt be bothered. The room was comfortable, two cozy Queen beds, a sofa and table, desk, large marble-top bar area, and a huge walk in closet that was great for storing luggage. The bathroom was a little small. My biggest complaint about the room is the lighting. All light in the room comes from small lamps except for the light over the bar. The hotel is romantic, but not the best for familyalso there is no pool. Internet access is not free, and there was no water in the fitness center just FYI. The restaurant LOLA was good for brunch. The food and service were great, but its a bit expensive ($200 for 3 of us). Make sure, though, that you have the made to order doughnuts as an appetizer for your table! YUM!!! Hotel Andra is located close to the monorail that takes you to the Space Needle, as well as to buses and trains that get to other points of interest in Seattle. SIde note: I would totally recommend a few hours at the Museum of Flight.

This hotel is a Chicago landmark I guess. It has an amazing lobby, kind of reminds me of the Waldorf in New York, but smaller. The staff is friendly. I am here for business, and as the hotel is located right in the loop - it is really well located. I imagine that if you are here for tourism it's also well located because it is near Millenium Park and things. But the rooms are old and strange. In the room I had, the TV was 5 meters away from the bed. There was a big empty space in the middle of the room. The bathroom was very cramped with no space to put my things. The furniture was worn.

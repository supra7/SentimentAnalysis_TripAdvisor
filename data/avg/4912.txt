The Palmer House Hilton is such a historic hotel. From the moment you walk through the front doors and walk up to the lobby, the view is amazing! It was really nice to walk into the lobby, see everyone enjoying themselves at the bar or just lounging around, and looking up and seeing the detail in the ceiling. Its truly a spectacular sight. This is a very large hotel. There are different elevators that go to different floors, so be mindful of which floor youre going to. Once youre on the floor, its almost like a maze to find your room. There are a lot of signs to tell you where to go, so that helps out. Once in the room, it is very spacious. We had a double room with two queen beds, and the beds felt like all other Hilton beds. The bathroom was a bit cramped, but it was usable. There were a lot of towels in the hotel, which I liked. One strange aspect about our hotel room was the large walk-in closet. It had a safe and ironing board, and it was a good place to store all luggage. Our view from the hotel was just to another hotel room, so be sure your drapes are closed so no one can peek into your room. Overall the hotel was great. The location is nice because the bottom floor opens out to the L at Adams. I didnt interact much with the hotel staff because there were so many other people in the hotel. This is definitely a family hotel since everywhere we turned, there were kids everywhere.

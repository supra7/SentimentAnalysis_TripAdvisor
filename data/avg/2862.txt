This hotel was okay for the night. Walls are very thin, as I think our neighbors left their tv on all night. I slept pretty good though. Bed was comfortable. Was fairly easy to find. Nice and close to the BBQ restaurant we went to for dinner. Staff was very friendly and quite helpful in giving us directions to Beale St.

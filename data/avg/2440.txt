I stayed here for two nights over a weekend. Check in went smoothly, staff was very nice. Above and beyond, printing me mapquest directions to places to eat. Room was nice and clean upon check in. But Sunday, the maid knocked in the door around 8:00 am. I was still in bed so I told her to come back later. I was gone from about 10:00 am until well after midnight. When I returned, my room had not been touched by maid service. Monday morning, I woke up early to go for a swim. The hot tub was chilly, nearly the same temperature of the pool. I returned to my room around 7:00 am dripping just in time to see the maid letting herself into my room. Nope, sorry, just swam and I need to shower. After showering, I went down for breakfast. Was good for a free continental breakfast. Checked out about 11:00 am. All in all an ok stay. I will also note there was no do not disturb sign in my room. I dont know weather the last guest just stole it or if theyre not in any rooms. But that would be one way to prevent the maids from waking people up early in the morning. I sent these comments via the Marriott website, got the automated message that it was being forwarded to the hotel. Never got a direct response.

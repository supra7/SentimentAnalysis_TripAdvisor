Me and my husband had stayed at this hotel to get away for the long weekend. We are from NH and are familiar with Boston. The location of the hotel was great, close to Newbury street, Boston Commons, Faneuil Hall and Downtown crossings (these are a bit of a walk, but great on a nice day and if you don't mind walking). I read the reviews before staying and a lot of them had complained about the small rooms. We had stayed in the King size bedroom, and it was fine. The bathrooms were small and cold and the toilet looked like a public toilet which was unattractive but we weren't in the room a lot, so it was ok for us to stay here. The walls are very thin, you can hear everything in the hallway, kids were running up and down, the maid you could hear talking. You can hear everything, however in the night it was quiet. We stayed on a Sunday -Monday, so maybe it was more quiet than usual. The service was great. We were able to check in early and check out late and the bellman held our bags after we checked out so we could go back into the city. We got the package where the valet parking was including-great deal and were able to leave our car there till 4pm the next day. I would recommend this hotel, it's a nice stay if you aren't going to be in the room a lot. You can hear everything that would be the only complaint, but the location is great.

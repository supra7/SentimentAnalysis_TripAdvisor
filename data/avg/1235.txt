This hotel is fine if you book on priceline. I got it for $65/night including taxes, but if I had paid full price I would've been bummed. The shuttle bus takes quite a while in both directions. When I got to the hotel there were only two people at the desk and the airline folks checking in got first priority. Luckily, I was first in line, but if I hadn't been check-in would have taken a long time. My room was super far away, which I expected as a Priceline traveler, but since I only had a carryon it wasn't that big of a deal. When I went to crawl into bed, there were black hairs in the sheets. Fortunately, there was another bed in my room which was hair-free. When I went to turn out the light there was a long blond hair hanging from the lamp. They could do a bit more cleaning to say the least. Breakfast buffet was decent, and I don't like buffets. The service in the restaurant was great. Also on the plus side--this hotel is really quiet. I was bummed to see that they let the shuttle bus idle for 20 minutes while passengers load. Definitely not a green nor a sustainable practice! Book on priceline, but don't have high hopes. I'd stay there again for an overnight, but not for longer--two stars at most.

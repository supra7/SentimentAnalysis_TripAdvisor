Hotel was great, really nice fitout, fast check in and check out. only downside was no free internet, food took ages to come when we went to the restaurant and the concierge whos name i cant remember but it started with a H - had an attitude and a half. other than that, it was so easily accessible and close to everything. i good option if you are leaving on an early/late flight like us. U cant hear any planes from your room which is goo. Bit pricey but.

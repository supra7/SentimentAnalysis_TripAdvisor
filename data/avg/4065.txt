I was at this hotel for a conference. When I checked in at 4:30, they had no rooms available. After waiting a half hour, I finally got a room on a low floor. The view wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The room was OK but nothing spectacular, noise from the hallway was pretty loud though. Location is great if your event is at the Hynes Center but it's really awful if you're at the Boston Convention Center. The charge of $12.95 a night for Internet is ridiculous. I probably would not stay here again as there as plenty of other good hotels in the area.

My associate and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton on Saturday, August 16th, 2008. Upon checking in at approximately 4:00 P.M., I was advised that the only two bed rooms available were on a smoking floor. I reluctantly agreed to this unfortunate situation, so it was my choice, but I have to say that it is rather disappointing to be hornswaggled into a smoking room just to get two beds. Other than that, the place is beautiful, the location is perfect, and I found it to be well appointed in general. My advice to anyone staying at the Palmer House who has booked on Priceline or Hotwire is to check in as early as possible. It is possible that travelers who book via the discount websites would appear to fall at the bottom of the priority list in terms of room choices.

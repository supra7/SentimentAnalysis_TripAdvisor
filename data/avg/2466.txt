We stayed as a friends funeral was taking place nearby. I found this place on the internet and the pictures and reviews looked good. Unfortunately we had a few problems, the place is just about finished after a complete refurb and so looks fantastic. However we had issues like lamps and tv's not working, bathroom doors jamming shut, windows which are sealed shut and only hot air available from the aircon. Although these aren't huge problems, and are down to snagging needing done on the refurb work, I was dissapointed. The one member of staff who seemed to be doing everything while we were there was helpful enough, but he couldn't fix everything for us. All in all I was disappointed as I hadn't paid a particularly price for the hotel and had been charged 35 for asking for an extra 2 hours on checkout to allow us to arrive at the funeral on time. On check out we were too focussed on the funeral to go through all our gripes so I decided to email when I got home. This is where I have to say that I was mightily impressed with the managers response. The response was almost instant offering me an apology and a number of options to make up for my problems. I was very happy with how the matter was resolved and can only praise this kind of fantastic customer service. On reflection I can say that I hope all the snags with the refurb will be picked up quickly, which will mean that this hotel will be a very attractive prospect. And well done management, I know a lot of 'top end' places that could learn a few lessons from your excellent after sales service!

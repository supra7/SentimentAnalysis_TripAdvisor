Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of August. The location is good if you are visiting the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, monorail) and you are just a short bus ride (stops right out front) into downtown and Pike Place Market. We had one of the larger rooms on the 5th floor. While it was nice to have more space, not sure it was worth the extra money. The carpet was in need of a good cleaning or replaced. I would not walk barefoot on it. The bed was ok. The bathroom looked like it had been updated not long ago. We did find ants in the room on our last night but did not bother to complain since it was getting late and we would be checking out early in the morning. The breakfast was your typical free hotel breakfast, nothing fancy but was very crowded. The pool & hottub were great to have and to pass a couple of hours in the evening since it was raining during our stay. We found the front desk staff to be very helpful and answered all our questions. We didn't have any issues with noise coming from the busy street below but that might be because we were on the top floor. Would we stay here again, maybe if we could get a better price and they did some updating.

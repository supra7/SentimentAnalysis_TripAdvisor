Outrigger Maui Eldorado My wife and I have visited Maui numerous times but the Maui Eldorado was the first place we stayed at. If you are looking for value and are planning to be outdoors a lot, definitely consider staying at this condo. Pros: If you plan to travel with a family and want to save money by making sandwiches or cooking a few meals during your stay (there is a Costco near the Airport), there is a kitchen and a fridge available. Reasonably priced rooms. Its near Kaanapali and close to the golf courses. Cons: The walk to Kaanapali beach may be challenging for people who are a little older. Parking can get bad if you return late at night. Rooms were a little outdated. Places to Eat Around the Area: Aloha Mixed Plate - Cheap and good eats. Kimos - Make a reservation just before sunset and request second floor and enjoy the view while you sip a Lava Flow! Hula Grill - Over rated based on the reviews you see online. But the food is still good. Sansei - Great value for really good sushi! Activities: Road to Hana - Only got to the Black Sand Beach at Waianapanapa State Park. Whale Watching - Fun but if you do any snorkeling excursions, most of the outfitters slow down to view the whales, so dont need to do this. Old Lahaina Luau - Best on the island. The food is good traditional Hawaiian fare, take advantage of the all you can drink mixed drinks. Last Tip: Dont upgrade to an Ocean View a little too far to really enjoy it.

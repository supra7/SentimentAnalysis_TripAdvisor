I remember having my high school prom at the Park Plaza and thinking it was the most elegant hotel ever. But now, 25 years later, the gilding is off the lily. It's still lovely but the rooms are very small and it's in need of some modernizing. The bathroom is tiny with only enough room for one person (which is fine since I am here visiting my mom on my own) and there is room for a double bed in the room. The closet is miniscule and the door to the bathroom does not open fully into the room with room to get around the desk. So it's a tight squeeze. Additionally, the heat could not be turned off so the room was literally 79 which is not quite comfy at night. But that said, there is a grand elegance to the golden swans on the curved elevator doors, the chandeliers in the lobby and the flower arrangements which harkens back to the age of elegance that the Park Plaza comes from. And no matter how cramped the room is, there is something nice about staying in an historic hotel.

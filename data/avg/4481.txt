I travel on business a lot, and I usually try to stay at the Hilton because they're good. This time, I'm on a vacation with my wife and two teenage kids. We got a room with two double, plus a roll-away bed (extra $20 per night, which is pretty excessive!). We ordered an extra large room, but to be honest, we didn't notice. We were on the HHonours floor, right over the main entrance. So first the good. The location is fantastic. A quick walk across to the Prudenial centre, and close to public transport. The room was clean, with a small balcony (maybe 1x1 meters). There's two free to use computers in the lobby with internet capabilities and printer. Staff were helpful. The bar was nice too, but I didn't eat there. The pool was small, but OK. The Jacuzzi was good and hot. There's no real bad, just a list of small niggles that add up. For example, when we entered the room initially, we were literally overpowered by the smell of chemical cleaner - maybe a carpet cleaner? While the room was clean, it was old and showed in places. Being above the front entrance was a real pain, cos the porter kept whistling for cabs all the time. A shrill high-pitched whistle, which woke us up at 7am one morning. I think the $20 rollaway charge is steep, and I don't think it's worth paying any extra (like me) for an extra size room - I certainly didn't notice any difference. Would I go there again? Actually, probably not. In my opinion, it's just not up to the standard of other Hiltons!

Having read numerous other reviews of the Palmer House Hilton, I was inclined to agree with those who said "How much can you complain about a $79 room?" But that was before I saw our actual room. The hotel and lobby were bustling and absolutely lovely, mind you. Not in my taste, preferring modern architecture, but it was really stunning. I called the hotel 10 days before arrival requesting a king bed. They said they would "do their best" but couldn't guarantee it. Upon arrival, we learned that not only did we not get a king, or queen, but we got ONE double bed. Not TWO double beds, as every other lesser facility in the country might've had, but ONE. The reason being only ONE double bed could fit in our room - how I wish I was kidding. Our room was the size of a postage stamp. Don't get me wrong - having asked for a rennovated room, our room was incredibly stylish. But when two adults are squeezed into a double bed... it's like being in college again. Neither of us could actually open our suitcases in the room (except on the bed) because the floor space simply wouldn't allow it. Mine had to go in the closet & his stood up on end (the only way it would fit). We don't typically use the dresser in a hotel when only staying overnight - why unpack only to repack? We had, quite literally, only one foot of walking room between the bed and the chest of drawers (left side), one foot to the wall/closet (center), and one foot to the desk/window area (right side). Having to strategically open/close certain doors to stand behind them to move around means a room is TOO SMALL, renovated or not. I can only really recommend this hotel if you either a) don't care about these things or b) are willing to pay full price to get what you want. I've used several discount websites to book facilities before and NEVER wound up in a room so tiny. It was really laugable.

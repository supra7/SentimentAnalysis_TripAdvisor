I'm keeping this short and sweet. I liked the hotel, i think the taxi hotel transfer is a rip of, your better of getting a taxi from the airport for 40 euro or a coach to the termini and getting the 84 or the 90 to the hotel, a little well hidden especially at night. The room was ok, small but clean, the bathroom was very clean and i had good showers there. The tv channels could of been a little more variety, for english speakers, but oh well. The customer services is really good, especially the lady, she's sooooo sweet. All in all i would stay in this hotel if it was central. The breakfast was ok, i was stuffed. Rome Italy is one of the best cities i've ever been too, so enjoy xxx

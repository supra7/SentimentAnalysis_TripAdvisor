I stayed here for one night with colleagues last week, and would happily stay here again. The hotel is two minutes from Euston station and is a relatively new Travelodge, so the decor is all nice and modern, unlike older ones in their chain! I arrived at 2.30 but was allowed to check in (meant to be 3pm) and my room was on the quiet side of the hotel, literally facing a wall - there was no view from my window, just a wall 3ft away. However, one of my colleagues was on the side facing the road and had to ask to be moved as it was very noisy. I had a small hole in my pillow case (which looked like a cigarette burn) but everything else was pristeen. No bath mat, so the floor of the bathroom got rather wet. My one irritation with this hotel, as with all Travelodges, is that there is no hairdryer provided and I always forget about this until I get out of the shower. However, this is my problem, not theirs...!

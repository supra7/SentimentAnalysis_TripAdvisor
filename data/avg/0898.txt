We loved the location, very central, and easy to access many of Seattle's best sites! Rooms are average. Would have appreciated one more bar of soap so we did not have to keep swapping the soap between the sink and bath. Two wine glasses in the room, given there is wine in the bar, would be great and at least four water glasses..two int he washroom and tow in the main room would have been better. Coffee was replaced after having room coffee BUT no stir sticks the second night. My pen is not the best stir stick....ugh! Parking fees per nigh @ 38.00 is outrageous.

The hotel and lobby were very elegant when you enter but not exactly "kid friendly" The location was excellent for our first time visit to Chicago. The price of everything was very high and i am still having issues with my credit card payment getting settled. Also the room was VERY small for 4 people, and we listened to the shower drip all day and all night for 2 days! The black hairs all over the bathroom when we arrived was not appealing. I will say the conceierge desk was soooo helpful at answering my questions and helping us with directions.

We always pay extra for the club room we arrived early after long flight saw the couple in front grom the same flight number as ours bring given keys to room on 7th floor yet we were reminded check in was at 2 pm then I guess they realised we were club members and we were allowed to sit and wait for lounge to open and wait for a room. Seems a lot has been tightened up here and not in a good way... Given close proximity to the airport maybe an early check in and late check out for half price of a room could be something for management to consider for these loyal Australian customers.

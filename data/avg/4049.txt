Overall, the hotel is nice. We only saw the lobby and our room, but it was clean and nice. The hotel is attached to a mall, and has a walkway over to the Prudential Center (and another mall). Lots of great restaurants within a few blocks. The T stops within two blocks as well. The first thing I wasn't impressed with was that they charge $12/day to use the internet in your room - NOT WIRELESS. There is wireless internet in the lobby, thanks to Starbucks, but not nearly as convenient. Issue two - the mattresses on the beds are either never rotated or not changed out often enough. The side towards the side table had a huge dip. I kept rolling into it even when I tried to sleep where the mattress was not worn out. Issue three - the air conditioner would not stop running after the second day there. Maintenance would have fixed it but we were leaving the next morning anyway and didn't want to bother with it. Issue four - when I reported the mattresses and the air conditioning, the response I got was "Oh, sorry about that. Hope your stay is better next time." ARE YOU SERIOUS? With that kind of response, there won't be a next time! Issue five - when leaving the hotel, we clearly needed some assistance. There were no less than four people in SUITS (one I'm sure was the manager) standing right in front of us. We stopped, looked around, looked at them...no one said a word to us. Seems to me that if you have a guest looking lost or like they need help and you are just standing there not busy, you should at least ASK if they need help. Especially if they are standing right in front of you. We finally had to ask the concierge for help. Not one of the suits could be bothered to stop their personal conversations. Overall, great location and nice enough hotel. But if it were me, I'd go across the bridge to the Marriott over there (Long Wharf) - much nicer! And there the T stop is at the front of that hotel.

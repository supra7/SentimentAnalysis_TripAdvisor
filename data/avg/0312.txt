My wife and I recently stayed at the Executive Pacific and had a nice stay. The other reviews were correct in that the rooms are small (but not tiny), the bathrooms are small and the configuration is weird (don't care for the autoflush toilet)) and there was a bit of an odor from the room being both old and am sure smoking was allowed in years past. The elevators were not functioning properly so there was a bit of a wait for the one elevator that worked, was never a big problem for us as we were in no rush. The location was good, convenient to most things downtown and very close to the University Street Station for the light rail which worked out very good for us. Our room location was nice as it faced 4th street. Overall it was a good place to stay for the money compared to the prices being charged for the higher rated hotels. I would consider staying here again.

We stayed here to attend our friend's wedding. We stayed in the north tower on the 29th floor and got amazing view of the water. The carpets in the hotel needs updating, however, we did notice that they are renovating the lower floors. No issues with noise. This hotel used to be westin headquarters in north america. No free wifi in rooms, only free wifi in the lobby. Valet parking is 43$. Self Parking is 41$. However, if you self park in an adjacent building which has a skywalk that connects to the hotel it's only 25$. This $25 self park garage supposedly was the employee parking garage for westin's headquarters back in the days! Asked if it was security monitored and it is. Also, there were cameras where we parked our car. No fridge in the rooms. If you move any drinks in the minibar, you will be charged so be aware! Stayed here with our kids. Washroom size was a bit tight. My husband's bed was really soft and he woke up with a sore back. My bed was comfortable and fine. Location is awesome. Right downtown by nordstrom, bartel's pharmacy, macy's, westlake shopping centre... We had a pleasant stay however, the hotel needs updating for sure. Once the renos are done I think the hotel will be much better value for the price you pay.

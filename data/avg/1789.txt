We spent a total of 1 week in Maui. The first 5 days were spent at the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua and the last 3 at the Hyatt. I had not been to this hotel in 10 years and it is definitely tired. The lobby, while beautiful, is outdated. The rooms are in very bad condition. However, the worst part was the crowdedness. The pool is lovely but you can barely find a chair and when you do, you're practically on top of people! Plus, the price of our room, drinks, food, etc. were just as expensive as they were at the Ritz Carlton. If you have children, this is a great place to stay. Another plus was that part of our package allowed us to eat free breakfast every morning ($30 value pp). If you are a couple looking for quiet and romance, stay in Wailea or at the Ritz Carlton. I'm guessing the hotel will be in better shape after the renovation. Its a shame, because Kaanapali is a wonderful beach!

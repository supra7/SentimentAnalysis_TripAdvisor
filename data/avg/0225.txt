The MarQueen Hotel is The hotel in the Lower Queen Anne district. I love the area because of its bohemian up-market flair and walking distance to the Seattle Center and performing arts district. I often select hotels like the MarQueen for their unique style, history and charm. I have stayed before and had a pleasant visit. This time, when I walked into my room, I immediately went to open a window, taking advantage of the clear Seattle fresh air. Of the several windows in my room, none were functional. The windows have been covered up with a clear storm window, providing excellent insulation and noise abatement, but making it impossible to open any window. When I enquired at the front desk, I was told that all windows in the hotel had received this treatment. No where does the hotel say that they have "hermatically sealed" every window. Old, charming hotels like the MarQueen need fresh air. Otherwise, we are back to the tall highrise hotels that I avoid for this very reason. If having the window open when you sleep is an important facet of your hotel selection and stay, then, regretfully, the MarQueen is not the place. I hope management reconsiders this decision and makes a few rooms accessible to the fresh air, which Seattle has in unlimitted supply.

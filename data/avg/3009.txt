We stayed at the Ruzzini Palace for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon. Booked online through a website for a prepaid deal, paying about EUR235 a night. The good bits first. Location is excellent, 5 minute walk from everything. Erm, thats about it. The not so good bits: this might just have been the room we were given as we had prepaid and so couldnt change but here are some things to be aware of. When is the last time you had a 4* hotel room without a shower? Nice bath, but when I asked about the shower, was informed that only the junior suites had those! They have a hand held thing, buts its so short and the ceiling so low, you have to squat in the bath to use it. Air conditioning. The evenings and nights were warm but not hot - mid to high 20s. The air con was set to 16 or 17 degrees but the room temperature didnt drop below 22 degrees! When I asked about this at reception, I was informed that their air con units will only lower the temperature by about 3 degrees from that outside. We sweated our way through the nights sleeping under only a sheet. Breakfast. Only meal we ate there. Very ordinary. Burnt pastries both days, fruit salad covered in fruit flies. We drank coffee and left it at that. Staff. Hmm. Probably best described as polite. Now, we arent snobs, we arent too fussy. We are mid 30s europeans who have travelled extensively, everything from camping though to business travel, we know what to expect. This hotel was NOT up to standard expected. If you get a good room, it might be better, but maybe it was just ours that was poor.

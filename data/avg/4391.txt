My husband's company selected this hotel for a meeting. The kids and I went along to do a whirlwind tour of Boston. The have shuttle times to Harvard Square, Copley & the Aquarium in am and pm- but nothing in the middle of the day. Walkable distance to Central Square to catch the red line(about 15 min)... and there's even a Trader Joe's across the river on Memorial Drive. If you want to be in the heart of Boston or Cambridge - this may not be the hotel for you. But pricing, suite type rooms- with fridge, shuttle and makes it affordable... and warm cookies at check-in. No breakfast was included and restaurant was pretty pricey. Only negative- pull out sleep sofa... mattress was ultra thin. not so comfy. but twin beds my daughters slept in were just fine. Go figure.

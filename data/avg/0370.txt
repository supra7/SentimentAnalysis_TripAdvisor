This Marriott hotel has a gym and a decent coffee shop, but it is farther from the city center shopping area and Pike Place Market than many other hotels. Wi-fi is available in the lobby, but guests are charged $12.95 per day for access from their rooms. Given the hotel's location and surcharges for Internet access, I will try another hotel during my next visit to Seattle.

I booked 10 days through Hotwire in April 2011. The property is alright. I did not like the pool too much but it's only me. The pool is close to a parking and I personally don't like it. The staff members are great. There is a great bar in the lobby. The hotel provides a free shuttle service to the mall nearby. You call when you are done and they pick you up free of charge. I stayed with the wifey and the 2 kids. No problem. If you like to be in the centre of everything, don't book there though or make sure you rent a car.

I attended a convention at the Boston Park Plaza, and stayed there for 3 nights. I am originally from Boston, and I was very excited to stay there. As another reviewer wrote, I was excited because the lobby is so grand and beautiful. But I was greatly dissappointed by the size of my room and bathroom. There were no "extra" amenities, ie. breakfast incl. in price, wireless (or even free) internet access, robes., minibar, etc. I can't even remember if shampoo was supplied. Luckily I got a "good rate" on the room for being in downtown Boston. On the more positive side, the hotel staff was very friendly and efficient, especially the wait-staff during our convention luncheons and banquet. And the location can't be beat. Close to *everything*.

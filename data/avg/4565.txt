The location is great: a few small blocks from Chinatown, and all the historical, touristy stuff. 20 minutes walk to North End and Back Bay areas, if you can navigate the confusing streets of old Boston. Two irritations: There's no way to get to the street level by stairs. You have to take an elevator from street to lobby and then another elevator from the lobby to the rooms. Same deal if you have a car from the garage. Second: Avoid a room with interior doors separating it and another. The sound insulation is horrible through the thin door. We had this family with musical kids staying a few days. It's not anyone's fault for noisy kids (that's their nature and they're also on vacation). But hotel guests should not be subjected to personal sounds from adjacent rooms; that's just wrong.

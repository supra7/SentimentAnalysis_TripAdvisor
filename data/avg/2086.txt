Major service-teething problems Nice hotel in very good location of Frankfurt. Since it calls itself a deluxe hotel, one would expect big rooms etc and the hotel doesn't disappoint.The terrace is fantastic, it only lacks friendly and efficient service. We went for a snack and a drink. Waitress 1 was busy preparing the breakfast area and couldn't be bothered with customers, waitress 2 was behind the bar and kept ignoring customers, waiter 1 was overburdended but still had sufficient time to polish the cutlery. We waited for over 10 minutes for the menu. While the reception had informed us that dinner was served till 11pm and we got there around 10pm, the waiter told us that the kitchen was closed and only barfood available, for which we settled. 30 minutes later we leave without anything to drink or eat.After desperatley looking for food, we came back to the hotel before 1am only to realize that they had started working on the floor above us. The constant hammering wasn't particularly conducive to sleep and despite repeated calls to the concierge as well as going back down to the concierge it didn't stop.At breakfast, we complaint to the manger who at least reduced the rate for the room but still this couldn't disguise the fact that we've hardly ever have encoutered such a service nightmare in a 'deluxe' hotel.

We used our Groupon for a corner suite and only paid $120 versus the regular $250+ rate. I would never pay the regular rate for this room and would have been extremely disappointed if we had. Their website says this is a "urban boutique" ... it's not, in any way. But it's a perfectly fine $120/night hotel. Upon arriving, valet was not very helpful - I had to unpack the car by myself (and I'm 8 months pregnant). The lobby is very utilitarian and could use an update. The room was nice in regards to that it was a suite and we were traveling with a toddler so we appreciated the extra room. The rooms were big but could really use an update. Bed was comfy. The big desk chair sits awkwardly in front of the TV. Room service was mediocre and the girl that answered my call was very unknowledgeable about the menu. My biggest complaint is that I called valet to bring the car around as I needed to grab some forgotten things only to find that when I went downstairs the valet guy WALKED me to my car ... I'm in heels, very pregnant and am walking up (and then back down) a steep concrete ramp to my car only to have him say "hope you don't mind the exercise." We also had a problem with the card key and after making two trips to the front desk someone came up to let us in - an apparent problem with the lock. When I called valet to bring the car around the next morning, I was asked if we were checking out ... but never asked if someone could help us with our bags. This would have been nice. Also, when outside the valet guys were making fun of a homeless guy, which I found to be very tasteless. Location is perfect, but this isn't the type of hotel you "enjoy" visiting. Next time I'd rather pay a bit more money to stay somewhere a little nicer and more hospitable.

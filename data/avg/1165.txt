Just a warning before you go. The parking was 40 dollars a day for parking, and the attendant couldn't even tell me where my car would be. The art work was very cool and fun to look at, but that is really the only upside. My husband couldn't put up the toilet seat because it hit the toilet paper holder and kept it from going up. This is sort of and indication of just how small the bathroom was. I am 5'1, 120 pounds I barely fit in the shower. The room itself is just as small. I've stayed in Seattle quite a bit, and this is not worth the money!!!

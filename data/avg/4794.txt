i love the history of the hotel and i'm glad that the property shows off the building's original woodwork and also highlights photos of the many stars that performed here in its hey day. the spa was an excellent spa - top notch service but oddly it looked completely unlike anything else in the hotel. the spa is ultra-modern and slick looking, while the rest of the hotel looks very ornate and historic. the business experience left much to be desired and the wi-fi could not be relied on. the hotel would benefit from a major renovation.

We stayed here for the price and location. The room was very outdated but we only slept there. We had the great fortune of looking out at the adult store from our window but that didn't bother us. We were only a short walk away from the shopping center and city tram which we took to the Space Needle even though we could have walked there. Once at the shopping center, we took a carriage ride which was cool. We were within walking distance to Pike Market and restaurants and bars. We would stay here again!

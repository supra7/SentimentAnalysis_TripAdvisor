We had to stay at this hotel because we were invited to a family wedding and all our immediate family members were staying here. The entrance is right under the elevated train and the immediate feeling is one of chaos. That feeling continues into the lobby where there were hoards of people milling around and waiting to check in. The lobby is grand and beautiful though with a ceiling that one can stare at and admire for hours. Our room was on the executive level which needed a special key for the elevator which meant that every time we had guests who were not on that floor, we had to accompany them. Also if we wanted to visit guests not in that area we had to descend to the lobby and take a different elevator to reach their floor. We had dinner in the private dining room and the service was fantastic as was the food. Our room had a huge living room and dining area that was separate from the bedroom. There were also two full baths which my husband and I really appreciated since they were each very tiny. It's a grand old hotel and the decor matches that. The location is wonderful. It's only a short walk to the Art Institute and the shoreline with all it's beautiful walkways and parks.

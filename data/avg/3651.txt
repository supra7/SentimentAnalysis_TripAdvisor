As a business hotel that is accessible, can accommodate a large group and is located close to many restaurant options, I would say this is a decent spot. Ultimately, after they have gone through their extensive renovation, it will be very good. Wonderful staff makes up for the minimal dining choices inside. It was a good value and very adequate for what we needed.

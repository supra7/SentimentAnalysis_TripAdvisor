This is a pretty normal hotel for downtown and the price - nice amenities - pool, bar, cafe, resturant. Beware- it is easily accessible from Interstate 5 but on a very steep hill - do not plan to walk anywhere from the hotel. There is downtown bus - be sure to ask since no one will give you the information. No breakfast, no coffee included - be prepared to pay for everything including overpriced Starbucks ( my husband loves Satrbucks - your card is no good and the prices are very high)

Okay, I always thought of the Westin as a hotel I could trust for everything I wanted. Let me first say the room itself was awesome! Great space, amazing view, comfy bed, nice bathroom. It did have everything I need. The front desk and valet employees were also very nice. There were a few cons. First, the hotel really nickel and dimes you by charging $39/day for valet parking/$22 per day for reg parking (a charge you don't find out about till you get there) and I was even charged for 2 calls I made to room service during my stay. I mean, I can see charging for phone calls, but calls within the hotel?? give me a break! I also had to call the hotel a couple of times; once on questions about getting food after the restaurant was closed, another about a question regarding my receipt.. Both times I found the help on the other end of the line to be rather cold and apathetic. Not something that I would expect from a 4 star hotel. Finally, the elevators in this building are creepy! It seemed like everyone in the elevators with me was kind of nervous. they just seem really old, really dirty, and like they haven't been serviced in a long, long time. the ride up and down is really bumpy. it just doesn't feel right. I mean, it's probably okay in all honesty. But again, $160+ per night for a room and they still have crappy old elevators from the 1970's? not to mention, they are totally worn down and dirty? it was odd. Okay one last thing, they do have really nice workout facilities but if you are planning on working out., try to stay in the same tower as the gym. otherwise, you have to go down, across a sky bridge and then up to the 5th floor of the other tower.

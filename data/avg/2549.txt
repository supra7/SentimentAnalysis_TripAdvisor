The hotel is in a great location for an overnight stop if journeying on the nearby eurostar. The rooms are clean and adequately equipped. However, we found that the window blind does not come completely down, so be prepared to wake at sunrise. The bed was not particularly comfortable, with the mrs and I finding ourselves continually rolling towards the centre. Finally, the shower did not drain properly, leaving very little time to wash before the floor flooded.

I have no idea how this hotel is rated #5 in Dallas. It's a fairly decent hotel, but for the price you expect a lot more. Let's start with the good - Large rooms. Decent toiletries. Helpful front desk staff. Free breakfast, happy hour, and cookies in the evening. Guest services responded to a noise complaint quickly (the hotel was overrun by rambunctious teenage cheerleaders in town for a competition). The not-so good - Elevators are old and very slow. Rooms are very dark with minimal lighting. An empty shampoo bottle was replaced with a half full bottle, clearly a leftover from a different room. There were no towels in the gym and when I asked a staff member, she suggested I grab one from my room. When I declined, she said she'd send housekeeping to the gym with more towels, but this didn't happen within the next 20 minutes while I finished my workout.

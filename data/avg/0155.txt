This hotel choice was a luck of the draw from a discount website. We stayed for one night at the tail end of a trip and wanted to explore Seattle. The hotel has a tiny lobby, and feels like a hotel with far fewer stars than it was rated. Our room was large, the beds were comfortable. I appreciated the earplugs, eye mask, lavender linen spray and curtain clip. These were all a part of the hotel's effort to ensure you get a good sleep. Jet-lag and an extended travel day ensured I slept fairly well. The earplugs were necessary because the A/C unit in the room was extremely loud. I actually got up in the night to increase the thermostat just so the A/C would turn off for a while. The room got stuffy, but at least it was quiet. The hotel appeared to have been built in the 60's or 70's and updated in the 90's or early 00's. It felt every year of it's age and the updating looked like a bad facelift which makes obvious that 'work' had been done. We stayed at a Super 8 in rural Alberta a year ago that seemed to share the same decorator. The staff was average in courtesy and hospitality. I will say, however, that the housekeeping was excellent. Our room was immaculate. I noticed many flight crew stayed at this hotel, and as a stop over on a trip, this hotel would serve well (at the discount rate only!). I would not recommend staying here for any sort of a romantic occasion. If traveling with a family, there was ample space in the room to set up a travel crib. Another oddity was the absence of Wi-Fi in the rooms. For the price they charge, this should be an included service. There was a business center with internet access, but that is hardly convenient. My husband managed to find an unsecured Wi-Fi access point from a nearby business if he sat next to our rooms window.

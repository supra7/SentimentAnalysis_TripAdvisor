The location of the hotel is great, right by Newbury street and the Mall if you want to go shopping, easy to get to Fenway by taking the T. However, the restaurant Xhale was nothing to speak of, our service was terrible and the food wasn't great either. The rooms are small and the layout is unique but it is a boutique. Very clean hotel.

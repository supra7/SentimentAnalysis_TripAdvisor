My wife and I have just returned from a 2 night stay in the Emine Sultan where we had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is located amongst some narrow streets in the heart of the Sultanamat district of the city. It is in residential area with a few kids (and many cats) about. The hotel is a small 4 storey building. Just inside the entrance there is a courtesy laptop for going online with a pretty good connection speed. The staff were very nice. Ozan is a lovely woman and alongside her brother and father they run the place. The rooms are nice, nothing fancy & quite clean. Bathrooms are also good, with hot water available and good shower preassure.. As a previous reviewer mentioned, The mini bar situation was never explained so we didnt use it. The room had 20inch flat screen with about 60 channels. Unfortunately the only english language ones are BBC news, BBC Prime & CNN. Breakfast: Modest fare it has to be said. There is quite limited choice but the house keeper did make us a turkish coffee which was nice of her. The stay: As mentioned, though in the heart of the old city, this area is a warren of small residential streets. The hotel has very poor noise insulation. So be warned if you are a light sleeper. I was woken on the first night by some neighbourhood cats "expressing their intimacy" outside. Traffic noise was also very noticable. The floors are wooden also so there isnt a lot of internal sound insulation either. Considering its very close proximity to the sights of instanbul I would still consider this hotel good value. Other reviewers throw the "5-dots" review like confetti, but I want to give as rounded review as possible. The staff are lovely and helpfull but the hotel has its weakpoints as I mentioned above. Therefore though competent it cannot be considered a top hotel. Personally we loved our stay, But I can see where some guests might feel dissapointed.

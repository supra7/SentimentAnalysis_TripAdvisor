I stayed here in February with my wife and 6 year old. The hotel is around 15 minutes taxi ride from Boston Logan Airport, and is in a good location in Boston. The hotel is 38 stories, with the Concierge Lounge on the 28th floor. Initially we were given a room on the 28th floor, which I requested, but when we arrived it turned out these rooms were not yet renovated, and were very tired looking. I asked for a different room and was given a much nicer, recently renovated room on the 24th floor, where we stayed for a week. The rooms are reasonably spacious, with the usual comfortable Marriott beds. I found the rooms a little noisy, with the doors between rooms letting sound through from adjoining rooms, and the window letting a bit too much noise through from the outside for my liking, despite being on the 24th floor. I spend half my life in a hotel in London and it is much quieter than this. However the staff were helpful and courteous, and the food at Champions, bar one night, was very nice. For Europeans travelling to this hotel, bear in mind that typically the US does not provide free alcohol in the Concierge Lounge, and this is no exception. The food from the Concierge Lounge was reasonable, but not exceptional. For tourists the hotel is good. The Boston bus tours stop right outside, and tickets are available from the lobby. The Concierges are helpful and highly knowledgeable of the area, perfect for Boston n00bs like us!

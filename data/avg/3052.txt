The hotel is only 100 meters from the Terimni Station, which is central for almost everything except maybe the Vatican which is a good 40 minute walk away - we got the metro line. The hotel itself is quite ok, free continental breakfast in the morning is basic, but it will set you up for the day. The issue I had with the hotel was the location, there were a lot of homeless people around, and at night in the dark, it was quite intimidating. We were two single girls, and it was a bit nerve wracking at times. The hotel is very good value for money, and the rooms while small, are very clean. The shower is great, really powerful.

Usually stay in Chicago suburbs, but my meeting schedule made it more convenient to stay in the Loop for one mid-week night. Priceline dished out the Palmer House Hilton for $69, but in these old hotels i knew what I was in for. The proverbial "closet" room. On check-in, the desk clerk tried the old "early check-in for $25" trick. I declined, and started back towards the lobby. She called me back and proffered a room without the fee. This Hilton was recently refurbed, and the lobby is truly spectacular. I had colleagues over after dinner for a drink just to sit under the wonderful turn-of-the century painted ceiling. The room was very small with a view of the airshaft. But quite a deal for $69, I thought. Bathroom could have been cleaned better, though. And these Hiltons have a stupidly high ($15) fee for internet use. I declined, and easily found a wifi connection that worked fine.

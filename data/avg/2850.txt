Arrived for an extended 3 week stay and we were very pleased with the front desk and ease of check-in. However, had to change rooms 3 times for various reasons before settling into room 300. Last room, end of hall. The major problem we had was housekeeping, which was very very lacking. Management always responded quickly and apologized, but day after day of nothing but clean towels became a common event. The next problem we had was that almost every weekend the hotel is fully booked with kids soccer teams. The lack of control of these hundreds of kids running and screaming thru the halls and stair wells aggravated us for 3 days each week. Plus the location of our room, we had the ice machine directly outside our door. 6 A.M. Saturday and Sunday mornings, parents and coaches began filling their Ice chests for the day. It was very irritating to be woken up that early 2 days a week. Joey, the general manager, and all the front staff are amazing and willing to help in any way. However, if I was planning on stating thru a weekend and was not playing soccer.... I would ask if there was a tournament that weekend. It's mayhem... Honestly!

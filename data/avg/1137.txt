This is a really fun, funky hotel in a good location in downtown Seattle. I'm a frequent business traveler and try to get out of chain hotels whenever possible as otherwise life gets really boring and I forget what city I'm in. Hotel Max is a great alternative IF you are a heavy sleeper. If you are a light sleeper, as I am forget it. I was on the 8th floor and it was as if i was sleeping on the street it was so loud. I kept getting up to check the windows all night as I was convinced one was open, but no. Apparently, the noise was just allowed in by the in window air conditioner, which I was not using. The service was good, and although the rooms are small, they are nicely decorated with lovely fresh white linens, comfy beds, and good amenities. As a frequent traveler, I would have liked to see a couple of things done differently: 1) Free wi-fi would have been a nice amenity. In this day and age, it's ridiculous that hotels feel they can charge for wi-fi. It should be a basic expectation, like cable. 2) $5 for a bottle of water? Seriously? If you charged me a reasonable price like $1.50 or $2.00 you could create a nice revenue source as travelers would actually buy it, but $5.00 just says you are trying to stick it to your guests. BTW, Red Fin the restaurant next door was excellent.

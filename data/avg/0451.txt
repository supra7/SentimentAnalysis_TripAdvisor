Checked in to a excutive 2 bed room, Upper floor facing with a City View. Hotel room was much smaller than a average hotel room, Bathroom was quite small, and agree with the reviews that if a wall was taken down, the bathroom could seem much larger with the sink and shower all in one room... Beds were comfortable, Windows did open. Flat screen TV. Wasn't much room for 2 suitcases, had to use one of the chairs as a luggage carrier. Location was great, HSBC bank right down the block, a couple of blocks from the monorail to the space needle and Pikes Place market.. Safety not a problem. No pool from what I could see, but the shearton has a indoor pool. Only issue was the room was located directly below their top floor resturant, while most of the chairs in the resturant are on carpet, there are some on a tile/marble floor. And when folks shift around in their chairs and walk around, you can hear it in your hotel room. I felt like I was staying in a apartment building rather than a Hilton hotel. Constant banging and shifting of tables and chairs, trust me it got annoying after a while. Thank god it was only 2 nights here and then I moved on. --- Also the Toilet is similar to one in a bus station with a flush handle you would flush with the bottom of your shoe and not you're hands. Once again - this in a Hilton, I've never seen it in a east coast hilton - but I was suprised nonetheless.

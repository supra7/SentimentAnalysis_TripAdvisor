I always find it a bit tough reviewing hotels of this class...no matter how good a 'deal' it is I can't give it better than an average rating since esthetically they are obviously challenged. So...IF you want a deal in one of the best locations in Seattle and don't care about esthetics (or air conditioning) then I'd highly recommend this place. I was there on one of the hottest weekends of the summer so the rooms was quite hot and stuffy without a/c but I know that's a non-issue for 80% of the rest of the year. I stayed in #210 which is right above the Dive Bar...not recommended. It was a massive room though and thank God we had our own bathroom! And they also kindly gave me a deal because of it's location - very nice of them. I hadn't realized when I booked that some rooms don't have their own bathrooms...you have to use the ones in the hallway. Again, personal preference I guess but that's a deal breaker for me. The room was clean, and that's the most important thing to me. But it's also very old and dated and we had a huge crack in the bathroom wall where part of the wall was literally peeling off. The lobby is very nice and also the only updated portion of the hotel and the front desk staff are some of the friendliest/most helpful I've met anywhere. Also, booking the reservation over the phone was a pleasure. The parking is a steal at $12/day a block away. Amazing location one block away from the market and 3 blocks from main shopping area.

I think the hotel is over priced and well not really that great. The location is pretty good and the rooms clean, they give that little funk appeal but soooo small. I really would rather stay at Hotel 1000 or the W for pretty much the same price. I would stay again only if rate were much less. I will say that the service is very good though. Nice friendly and helpful staff. I am a resort owner in a tourist town and we charge 450 for our largest room with 2 bedrooms, 2 bath, jacuzzi , fireplace, 42 inch plasmas and they are on the water so just found it hard to pay that much for just and average place.

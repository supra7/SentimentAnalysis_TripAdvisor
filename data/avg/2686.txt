My wife and I stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights pre cruising. On arrival we were greeted by the portering staff. We were made to feel very welcome indeed. On checking in I requested a Port view from our room if possible. None was available, although judging from the amount of people on the move around the lobby area over the few days we stayed there , I suspect there probably was. Our room on the 17th floor did not disappoint. We had a lovely view of the airport with planes taking off etc. Great at night time with the lights of the city sky line. The hotel seems to be located on the edge of Downtown area. I would not reccommend walking at night in this area. Day time is ok as there are plenty of people about. Breakfast was a bit pricey at $ 30.00 for 2 people. Average food, nothing special. The bar just off the lobby is nicely located for a few drinks or so. However, the service here leaves a lot to be desired. We called in for a drink about 6.30 or so. there were 2 girls working the floor and only for the intervention of a lovely old gentleman ( who was looking after the free nibbles available here) we would have died from the thirst. Eventually our drinks arrived. I should have ordered a second round there and then, because it took forever to get the attention of our server. When we were finally acknowledged by the server we relaxed. big mistake. she went off to serve someone else ( just arrived in the bar) and completely forgot us. I gave up and went over to her, demanded the bill and paid her off. This was the only event in our stay that gave a bad taste. I would use this hotel again, but next time bring my own booze ( joke)

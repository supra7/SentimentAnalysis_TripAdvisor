My wife and I spend two nights at Eliot Hotel in November. A very pretentious place: at least two people open doors for you when you enter or exit, three waiters serve you in the hotel restaurant at a time with the fourth person responsible for your bread only. A separate guy just to push the elevator button. Tiny reception area, small elevators. We had a two room suite with windows facing an ugly back yard where they stored mattresses (see photo), and where 5 huge ventilation fans were located. Those fans produced endless noise which spoiled our stay substantially. The air conditioner/heater in the room itself was so noisy that we did not use it at all. Besides mentioned above it may be considered a good hotel: perfect location, polite personnel, spacious and clean rooms, good service.

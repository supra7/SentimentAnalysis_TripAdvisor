This was the second hotel we stayed at during our ten day long visit to New York. We picked this hotel for three primary reasons. 1. It is located in Manhattan 2. For it's location, the price we paid was a bargain, with many other Manhattan hotels charging roughly 50% more than what we was paying 3.The hotel was less than a month old, and we wanted a clean room. Overall, I would say our stay was ok. Location wise, we got lost a few times trying to find the hotel as Chinatown is so chaotic and it's easy to lose your way. Getting to Midtown Manhattan (where we spent a lot of our time) proved to be more difficult than when we stayed in Long Island City where the no.7 train took us to Times Sq in less than 15 mins. So before you book, do find out where you will be spending most of your time. This hotel is good for Chinatown, Statue of Liberty, Battery park, Wall Street and of course SoHo. The hotel was clean and so were the towels. But the rooms were very small, and with basic ameneties. One criticism is the doors have very big gaps, and the windows have poor insulation which means it can be very noisy with the hotel being beside the Subway track. All in all, for what we paid, I feel we did get value for money, but Iit appears that prices have risen to $300+ per night, and this seems a tad high to me for a very basic room, which does not even have an in-room mini bar ,a safe or even a luggage stand. On the upside, there was free internet access, free coffee/tea making facility in the lobby area and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would stay at this hotel again, but only if this was the cheapest Manhattan hotel available to me at the time.

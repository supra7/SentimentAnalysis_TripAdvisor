The Palmer is a beautiful hotel and the room was comfortable. The location is convenient for downtown business. However, in terms of value, I don't give it high marks. High speed internet is extra. The breakfast buffet is mediocre and expensive. The restaurant is not worth the money at all. My room was not very clean (food on the floor, paper in the bathroom, personal products behind the bathroom sink) when I arrived and that never changed for the duration of the stay.

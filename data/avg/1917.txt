If your looking for the luxury experience--don't stay here. If you want a clean room on Ka'anapali Beach with attention to Hawaiian culture--this is your place. Rooms are dated and need to be upgraded. But they are very clean and the food and service is impeccable. Good stay for the price and I would stay here on a return visit.

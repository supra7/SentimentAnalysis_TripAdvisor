We arrived at the Executive Pacific Hotel a good three hours before our scheduled check in time but the receptionist was quite happy to allocate our room immediately, so we dumped our bags and headed straight back out to a Mariners ball game and didn't return till midnight. We therefore totally missed the complementary wine tasting offered in our deal and I forgot to enquire whether it was to be held. So, we basically used the room to sleep and for that it was ideal!!! 'Executive' to me conjures up an image of a business standard hotel that I would say the EP doesn't quite hit - the room wasn't massive, the window was broken and the bedlight was suspiciously intermittent. But for a one-night rate of 76 for a double room bang in the centre of town and two blocks from University station, I'd say it was a result!

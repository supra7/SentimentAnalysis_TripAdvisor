Good central location for sightseeing in Rome. The front desk staff were very helpful. The hotel had an Asian influence to it. The restaurant staff were all Asian and couldn't speak either English or Italian. The breakfast was not good. Stale baked goods and the coffee was cold every morning. Except for the location and the local front desk staff, we wouldn't recommend it.

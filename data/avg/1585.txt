Stayed here when attending a wedding in Barcelona over the summer. It was a bit expensive for the value but an OK place. The location is the best part. The rooms are clean and comfortable but a bit too eclectic (no bathroom doors, counter-space or outlets and no closets). Was fine for a long weekend but probably will find something a little better next time.

The hotel was easily accessible by public transportation. We liked staying there since it was a reasonable price and could accommodate three of us in one room. The shuttle was handy to go to the beach, although thirty minutes late to pick us up on the return trip. The breakfast that is included was sufficient but nothing amazing. The staff was nice, but oddly unfamiliar with some of the things we were seeking direction to go to. Lastly, the internet was annoying. It was in the lobby only and the time you purchased was only able to used within 24 hours.

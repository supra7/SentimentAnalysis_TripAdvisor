my family and i are new to the state and thought that it would be nice to drive in to seattle for the upcoming thanksgiving weekend. due to unexpected circumstances had to cancel plans. called 2 days prior to arrival date (was told i had until 6pm the day before arrival to cancel free and clear) to be told by reservations that it was too late to cancel without having to pay the one day deposit. i was referred to the front desk where i was then told that i should be able to cancel but they weren"t sure what the cancellation policy was so i had to call back in the morning to cancel. WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????does anyone know the policies? so anyway while steaming over having to deal with this another day i go the hotel website directly and found a place where you can log in and view your rez. i couldn"t log in at first. it took ten tries because they spelled my name wrong (which i never knew because they never sent me my email confirmation that i requested four times). so anyways i cancelled there but will be calling to confirm that tomorrow. it is a shame that i ahd to get a straight answer i had to go to the web (where they told me that i have until 6pm the day before to cancel) the staff seem a bit clueless theses are the first people that we speak to before we get there and they are clearly not selling this hotel like this. i hope that this is not a reflection on how other things are run there. will be reconsidering whethere to plan another stay at the crown when we make it to seatlle.

I would probably have written a more positive review if the hotel had apologised in some way for the building work when we arrived. Expecting advance warning was probably too much. Breakfast not available, and a request for suggestions was met with a gallic shrug and "beaucoup de cafes aupres d'ici". Poor impressions aside, a very good location and E100 not unreasonable value for this part of Paris. And they gave me more coathangers when I asked. Quirky rooms and decor (on our floor anyway). Good shower (bathroom the size of a phone box) and comfortable bed with real pillows - and at least 2 ft clearance at the end of the bed :)

After travelling around the islands, we were looking forward to some resort style luxury. Checkin was easy and they even offered to valet our rental car for free for the first night (there's a secondary free park yourself area). The entree and lobby were under construction and looked not very impressive, but that might get better when the construction is finished. Our room was in a tower all the way back in the hotel and was actually pretty nice. We had a comfortable Kind bed and a small seating area with a couch. Our balcony offered a view of the sea, but also of the Luau area. This means you get to enjoy the Luau every night if you happen to be in your room (and even with closed doors it's very loud). Based on the view from our balcony we were not impressed with the entertainment value of the Luau, but almost all the hotel guests seem to go there. The pool was certainly big enough, but around 12 o' clock the sunbeds seem to run short. Getting a towel with a towel card feels a bit like a hassle, especially since they require you to wear a wristband after you get your towel. There's not much of a beachfront, you have to walk over to the Marriott for a somewhat larger beach. We actually took a surfing lesson here with Royal Hawaiian and this was so much fun, so I could certainly recommend this. All in all, this was one of the few resort style hotels we could afford on Maui and I guess you get what you pay for. It's not the apex of luxury, but a decent hotel. We had a rental car, so we were free to visit different parts of the island, but if we were confined to the hotel (and Lahaina is some 5 miles distance) we'd get bored quickly. Don't go here for full blown luxury, but if you're looking for a comfortable base to visit the island it's a hotel worth considering if you can find a good deal.

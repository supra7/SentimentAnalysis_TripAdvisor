Hotel is located pretty far from Oceans Drive, however a bus stop is just around the corner for easy access to Oceans Drive. There is also a Monorail station just 50 Mts away from the hotel making it an easy acess for tourists. If you are a fan of Indian Food then there is an Indian restaurant about 500 Mts from the hotel serving good food. Overall a decent experience and pretty safe too.

The hotel looks good and my room was ok. And yes there are issues regarding noise but I did have a good sleep. But the minor point is the location. Nearest subway stop is a 10-15 minutes walk and there is nothing around the hotel. It is a somewhat deserted area altough chinatown is not very far. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel which is served by #29 with good connection to downtown Chicago and the navy pier. You won't find food shops near the hotel. The hotel has a small shop which sells drinks and snacks but it's quite expensive. There is also a deli in the hotel. Hotel staff was friendly and the lobby looks impressive. My room was spacious and there was even a small fridge. However, one of the lamps didn't work but for me it was not a big deal. A good hotel but you might opt for a hotel in downtown Chicago. I got this hotel thanks to hotwire and I paid 270$ including tax for 3 nights. You won't get this deal for a downtown hotel!

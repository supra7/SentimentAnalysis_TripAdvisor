This is a nice clean hotel with friendly helpful staff at a good price. If China town is the area you want to stay in then this is the ideal budget hotel. Less than 5 mins walk to nearest subway and less than 15 mins walk to little Italy. BUT...if this is your first time in New York, I would suggest staying somewhere closer to Times Square to reduce your time spent on the subway.

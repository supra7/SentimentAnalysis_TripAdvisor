This is my second time at the Sixth Avenue Inn, and whilst it is not a ritzy, glam hotel, it has what you need and that is a clean, comfy room. The staff at the hotel are excellent, very polite, friendly and helpful. The location is great, the restaurant has good food and my room was always cleaned well every day. One downside is that the rooms don't have double glazed windows, so you can hear the noise of the traffic.

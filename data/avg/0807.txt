We stayed at the Westin Seattle for 6 nights in September 2011. It's a very nice hotel with excellent views. Obviously this is not a cheap hotel. But I was offended to see that they charged $1.50 plus $0.14 tax on every phone call I made. And I only made local calls. The minibar prices were the highest I've ever seen. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable. I probably won't stay there again because of all the extra charges. (Like $7 charged if you use the fridge for your own items.)

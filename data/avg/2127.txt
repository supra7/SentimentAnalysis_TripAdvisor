Nothing special about this place. The room was large, the kitchen corner fully furnished. The bathroom clean and good size with a bathtube. Free parking. The mall in front (Creek) as absolutely no interest at all (a part for Pinoy maybe) Unfortunately the room was occupied before us by smoker (even if not allowed to smoke) and was very smelly. Not to mentioned the wake up in the middle of the night with fire alarm and evacuation of the building because a smoker started a detector :( ) We had to fight to get the washing machine running as they claim it was supposed to be a paid extra (while it was supposed to be included in reservation).

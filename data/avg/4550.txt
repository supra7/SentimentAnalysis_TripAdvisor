If you can get a deal on Priceline, then this is a great hotel to stay in. It's not a 4-star hotel by any means, but the fitness center and pool are top notch. Rooms are clean, service is nice and the entire place smells like gardenia (which got to be disconcerting after 3 days). Here's the biggest complaint - the elevators. You have to take two different elevators to get to your room. There's the one that gets you to the lobby, then the one that takes you to the rooms. When it's dinner time and everyone's trying to make their reservations in time, it's quite annoying trying to escape the hotel!

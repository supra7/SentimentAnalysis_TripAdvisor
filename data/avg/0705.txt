The view is wonderful but the room is so so. Be careful using the internet access you will be charged not for internet access but for each individual device you use. I used my laptop for emailing and so did my wife. After that she downloaded a book on her ereader. That resulted in three charges. Given the price of the room it should not be necessary to hike to one of coffee shops in the neighborhood that has free internet access. Upon arrival the room was 54 F and the heater could not be turned on. The heater malfunction happened again on the second day of the stay.

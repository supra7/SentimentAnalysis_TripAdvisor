We stayed in hotel 3 nights in middle November. I booked this hotel through venere.com. It was very easy to find the street i (just 2 or 3 streets from the metro Notre Dame going by Sienna (Notre Dame by the left side). We came around midnight and with welcome smile were given a key just 10 secs after I said abuot reservation. Our room was on 2 floor with a view to the street. The room is not so small as I expected after reading reviews and has 2 windows, two narrow beds together, but comfortable. It was also small table,tv, telephon, minibar and small sofa. I liked the style of the room with the fragment of dark wood everywhere. The bath room is small, but enough to turn, cleadn and light, new equipment (no curtain only).I will place some pics. It's only one concern -of this hotel if you have loud neigbours, you would hear all what they do and say. The street was not very noisy except of "garbage car" which is too loud at 7. 30 in the morning. The breakfast is very simple, but it's plenty cafes nearby. I liked location very much.It's on a quit street and very close to everything!!!

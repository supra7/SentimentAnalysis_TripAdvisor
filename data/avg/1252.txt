This hotel is about 4 miles from SEA and they do have shuttle service every half hour to the hotel. The shuttle leaves a bit to be desired as I was shuttled back and forth on a normal passenger van opposed to a mini-bus, which created issues with the amount of people it carried. Any way, upon arrival to the hotel it appears to not be a newer hotel and when you're inside it is confirmed by the somewhat dreary, or darker appearance. Upon check-in the front desk staff was excellent and the process was speedy. In fact, while my room was not ready upon my arrival, they sought me out in the restaurant personally to hand me my key when the room was ready to be occupied. The room itself was a corner suite and I found it to be acceptable but nothing extraordinary and certainly very dark. The TVs were newer flat screens but they did not offer HD service and the cable options were limited. The room service I ordered was good food, they just didn't get the order right as I received incorrect beverage and condiments. However, in the restaurant itself, all went well and the food was actually surprisingly good. The staff in the restaurant and bar area, specifically Erika and Susan were excellent. Very friendly, well attentive to the needs of the patrons and were extremely courteous. It actually was refreshing to see them interact with the guests and even laugh with them. Greg was an excellent bellman who assisted upon arrival and the waiter Gabriel was also superb, relative to his friendliness and overall service. The stay was ok, but it was made better by the staff. The hotel just seems older and outdated to me but I believe it to be one of the better options if you need to stay near Sea-Tac. My rate was $170 per night and both nights I was there, they were full. Again, this hotel is made by its staff.

I have stayed at this hotel over a 15 times, over the past 8 or 9 years. I have seen the name change from Clarion, to Amerihost, to Lexington O, and back to Clarion. The reason I like the place is that the location is in between the Superdome and Bourbon Street. The free WiFi and breakfast is a plus too. I never had issues with the noise, the people around the side streets, or the staff. But, during my last trip I had to deal with roaches in the bathroom....which was an issue for me. I saw one adult roach in the bathroom in my first room, and thank goodness I was able to move to another room. Then a day later, I saw a roach in the bathroom in that room too, which was five floors higher than the first room. Due to the hotel being at-capacity, I didn't try to move again. But, seems like I need to fine me another "crash pad" for my NOLA stays. I certainly do not need to be bringing back any critters.

We stayed here for only one day on 11/16 because of a business conference at the hotel. While we had requested a king bed, one wasn't available when we checked in around noon (check-in is at 3 pm). The bed in our original room appeared to be a double. We immediately requested another room and were given another one an hour or so later. The wait wasn't an issue as we had to go out for lunch anyway. Our new room was much larger than the first one and had a king bed. What made the room unusual is that it contained two separate full bathrooms - each one identically sized. The showers were extremely small even for my wife and me, and we're on the slim side. I'm sure that other travelers might have some serious issues with this. As others have mentioned, there is no free wifi in the room which is a mild inconvenience. One of the hotel restaurants did offer complimentary internet access, however. On the plus side, the subway (the "T") close - only one block north on Arlington. We used it to go to dinner in Cambridge the first night - the subway was very easy to use. Overall the hotel seemed to show its age. While nothing was terrible, there wasn't anything outstanding either. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants, so I cannot comment on them. Given the number of other hotels options, I would opt for one of them if traveling back to Boston.

It is a modern hotel in a great location with really funky furniture most of which isn't actually comfortable to sit on though. The hotel looks great and the staff were very friendly and helpful but it reminded me of a warehouse. It is on a main street but you can't hear anything during the night from outside all you can hear is other guests, doors opening and closing, the elevator etc... everything echoes around the corridors, very annoying. The bed was huge and very comfortable but I didn't like the bathroom at all, all open plan and nothing but a glass door between the toilet and the bed. The door did not close properly so you could hear and see everything. I wouldn't consider this a five star hotel.

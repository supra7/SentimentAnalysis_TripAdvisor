The rooms are a very good size and well equipped and this is probably worth the money because it's not expensive but when we booked a Trump hotel in Vegas we were expecting luxury. In 2006 we stayed in The Wynn and it was gorgeous. There is no casino but we didn't see that as an issue because you are not short of them and it's good to see the other hotels anyway. The big downside here is there is no self parking, it's valet all the way which means you have to keep everything in your room which you might need because you cannot get to your car unless you request it. A tip of between 15 to 18 dollars is expected each time you get your car. We like to drive around, sight see and shop but because you cannot just pop back you have to plan your day better. They also have an additional 19.95 dollar resort fee on top of the normal taxes. Nice hotel but too restricting on parking and not a fab view of the strip.

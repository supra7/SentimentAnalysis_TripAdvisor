While my room was more like a closet than a hotel room, the location made it worth enduring the lack of space. Definitely in need of some TLC (TV was ancient, closet door wouldn't stay open). The lobby is beautiful and frequented by lots of business travelers meeting and greeting. The only problem is to get to the check in area you have to walk thru the lounge areas which can be a bit of an obstacle course with luggage. Service was wonderful. I treated myself to room service both mornings and the food arrived very quickly (within 15 minutes I think). The food was good and just as I had ordered it and the servers were courteous (this coming from someone who hates everyone until I've had my morning coffee!) My view was of the other side of the building and the fire escapes, so nothing good there. They also only offer wi-fi in the lobby (not even available as a pay per use option in the room). Showers were not good. Bad water pressure and both mornings about half way thru my shower it decreased by half all of the sudden as if to tell me that i was taking too long. But again, if you can get a deal (I only paid $113 per night), the location definitely makes the small inconveniences worth putting up with.

We spent 6 nights at the Quality Inn & Suites Seattle Center on John Street. The parking was okay - not as bad as others had let us to believe by their reviews. The halls are in need of updating. The elevators are a pain - always slow. The breakfasts were hardly sufficient. What food we did get was awful & it was always overly crowded. We'd hoped for good coffee since we WERE in Seattle... but it was standard hotel coffee. The hot water in our shower didn't work one morning & when I called the office to report it, they offered to move me to another room. I couldn't do that, however, as I was in town for a competition and needed to get ready and leave by a certain time. Housekeeping failed to clean our room one day and we were gone a good part of the day. We didn't say any thing about it until the following day because we were gone in the evening & just wanted to relax and not have to deal with it. We did mention it the next day. We did tip our housekeeper every day. There was a slider that opened up to a communal patio on the roof... no view - just the highway, but better than nothing. We enjoyed the jacuzzi tub in our room. The bed was comfy except for the dip in the middle of the (king) bed, where you tended to roll. We did find a good pizza place nearby - but they didn't deliver. The Space Needle is viewable from areas of the hotel and within walking distance. The hot tub by the pool was relaxing. The high speed internet was remarkably slow. I would recommend this hotel for someone just looking for a place to crash. If you're looking for a luxurious vacay experience - keep looking.

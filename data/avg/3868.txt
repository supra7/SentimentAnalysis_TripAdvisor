We spent one night here recently while attending an Elton John concert. The room was a little over $100 with AAA discount. It was fine, nothing special. On the plus side, the hotel is on Universal Blvd. just south of Wet and Wild, and so it's away from the insanity which is International Drive. However, the set-up is weird. We opened the door to what we thought was our room, only to find a tiny foyer with two doors. To the right was the door to our room, to the left a door to another room (a one bedroom suite, as I later discovered). As I said, a little weird, in that you have to go through two doors to get into your room. Fortunately, our neighbors were pretty quiet. However, I imagine it could be a pain if the neighbors came banging in and out through those two doors with any frequency. Aside from that, the pool area was nice, complete with hot tub and poolside bar. The front desk was friendly and helpful and, as I said, the location was central without being in the midst of the craziness of International Dr. All in all, solidly average.

I chose the Hotel Burnham for my first visit to Chicago because of it's location, which did work well. I could easily walk to Millenium Park, Grant Park, the Loop sculptures, the Art Museum, the Magnificent Mile. The bed was very comfortable. The room was well appointed, but small. There was no place to put a suitcase. I set mine on a stand in the short hall between the bathroom and the bedroom. Labor Day was quiet, but Tuesday morning the construction next door (my view) started at ~7:30 am. The wine tasting was nice, but without munchies (which I need with wine) and the lobby was too small for everyone to sit. It's an interesting building architecturally, but with the small room, small lobby, no breakfast, no pool or other place to congregate, I felt it was overpriced compared to other properties I was considering. Of course I haven't stayed at those properties yet, but I will try some before returning to the Hotel Burnham.

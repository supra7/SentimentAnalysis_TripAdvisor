The hotel staff was great! The lobby and common areas are very nice and refreshed. However, the room had an "old" feel to it, and the studio style offers no privacy if you are traveling with someone. The location is VERY easy to get to and find from the highway. Would recommend to anyone as long as they're not paying full price. Breakfast was decent, lots of room to sit down and eat in the lobby area with TVs. Parking is ample and the pool always looked nice and clean (didn't have a chance to use it).

We just returned from a vacation 1/21 to 1/28. This will be part one of my review and it will be quick and simple. Do not, I repeat, do not stay here if you are not on your honeymoon or getting married. This place caters very heavily to weddings and honeymooners. Too many people in groups/packs for weddings and very hard to relax at this place. We spent a lot of money to stay here and this place is not worth it. Part two of my review will be coming shortly - stay tuned for more details.

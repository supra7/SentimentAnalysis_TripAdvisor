me, my fiancee, and my parents went to virginia beach in september, and we didn't want to go back home to PA so we decided to extend our trip up to ocean city. first we stayed at a motel for one night, i can't remember what it was called, but it kind of reminded me of the motel room on the movie vacancy. really creepy. the next 2 nights we stayed at the tides motel. its a decent sized room, especially considered to the room we stayed in the night before. the room was clean and smelled clean (i dont know what these other reviewers are talking about) we were outside on the balcony and at the pool most of the time and everytime we went outside and the maids were around they asked if we needed anything. the rooms are pretty cheap. i think we only paid $160 for 2 nights with 4 people in one room. only thing that sucked was that the pool isn't heated. but its a motel so what do you expect? but its was freezing because it was really cold the few days before we arrived so that wasn't their fault.

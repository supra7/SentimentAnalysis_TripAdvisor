We stayed @ the KBH recently, and the room was not worth it. We were put in the kauai wing, on the ground floor. The room was old, smelly, fixtures were rotted or broken. We had booked for family of four, and they gave us this room that was quite small for a family of four. Very small closet (no lights in the closet; the wing allows smoking in the balcony, so we could constantly smell cigarette smoke coming into our room from outside when we opened our balcony door. So we had to keep that door closed most of the time. We tried to make the best out of our trip, so we did not complain. Agreed that the staff is nice, but when we came back to our room every day, we did not feel good about our room. I mentioned this to the front desk person during check out, and got a blank look; I guess because we were on our way out! I will certainly look for another hotel in kaanapali for our next trip to Maui.

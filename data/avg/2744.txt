We stayed at Hotel 91 for 7 nights at the end of November/start of December. I knew that the hotel was not in a very central location for tourists, but we really wanted to stay for 7 nights and our budget would not stretch to staying in the midtown area. Some of the taxi drivers were asking us why we were staying here, as they didn't know that there was a hotel in the area. If you're just looking for a clean place to sleep and shower then this hotel is ideal. It's not fancy, but it is clean, the beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and there is plenty of hot water. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is a subway station literally 2 blocks away (E Broadway). From here you can take the F train which stops at several of the major mid-town locations most used for sight-seeing. If you are happy to accept the fact that yes, you're going to have to make the effor to ride the subway to get around and that the hotel is only for sleeping, changing and showering, then this an ideal, budget-friendly base to explore the city from.

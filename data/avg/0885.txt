I was sorely disappointed in the Westin. I thought I would be experiencing a truly rich delight, but that did not occur. First only one key worked, which is no problem, those computerized strips often do that, but when I went to the desk, the clerk was somewhat snotty stating it was the camera around my neck that did it. I did not have the key near the camera what so ever! The room was much smaller than the Sheraton and although the linens were very nice, the beds were not the heavenly comfort as described. We had to shift the chairs to fit our needs and found filth, pure filth under the chairs, not to mention a few rolling grapes. The computer table was very dusty and even when the cords were moved; there was a cloud of dust. The air vent made a dripping sound most of the night, which did not help me to sleep at all. The room service was a delight, but no jelly accompanied the toast. You would think this would be part of the condiments, since there was 4 bottles of ketchup. Lastly, the pool was crowded which was no surprise, however, they kept jumping in and the splash became irritating, especially when the pool seemed rather cold. I thought Id try the Jacuzzi to be overrun with kids swimming in there. The lockers in the womens room did not work properly and no one could get them operating. The dirty towel hamper was overflowing and could have used attention. On a bright note, the car valets were great! Maybe my experience was isolated and although the price bid was good, I will not return. The Sheraton and Renaissance were far superior to the Westin.

Second stay at a Chicago Hilton this summer. Both rooms were dark with cost saver yellow lighting; looked out at other rooms, not at the street or sky; were huge but only partially furnished; and were ice cold - even with air cond off. Lobby's nice, room's not up to par with pleasant rooms at other hotels.These rooms will make you want to go home for sure.

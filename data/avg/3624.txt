Overall this was a good hotel. Convenience to downtown and airports was very good. Rooms were very nice and up to standards. Breakfast was excellent and the evening reception was good as well. Staff were extremely attentive and great to work with. Overall though the hotel in general and the grounds were not up to the standard of Residence Inn. Grounds especially didn't seem to be kept up to very well. Outside of my room the grass was dead, their was garbage on the sidewalks, 6 cigarette butts littered outside my door, and a nearby maintenance room was leaking water through the door the entire stay and made the nearby entrance to my room wet. The other problem, which isn't the hotel's fault, but the hotel is right off the freeway and you can hear the cars all night long. I was kept up half the night by the sound of vehicles and semis going past on the freeway. Still a good hotel for the value but think twice if you are a light sleeper.

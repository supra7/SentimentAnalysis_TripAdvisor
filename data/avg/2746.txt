A slightly mixed experience. On the one hand, the room was clean, beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was well sized, and also clean. In my experience these are certainly not guaranteed in hotels! However, the location is adjacent to the Manhattan Bridge, which is excessively noisy at all times. The room was so narrow that there was barely room to walk around the end of the beds. There are smaller niggles too - the internet, though free, is wired, and the wire is so short that you had to use laptops on the bedside table - why not provide a secure wifi? The desk is very small - certainly not large enough to work from. There is no food offering, and the complimentary tea and coffee are low quality. Overall, this is fine as a place to crash, though not a hotel to spend lots of time in.

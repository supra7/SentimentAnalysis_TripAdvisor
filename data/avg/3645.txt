I've stayed here twice on business. I love Candlewoods because the rooms are comfortable - the desk in the room is perfect to work at - and the $0.25 sodas in the pantry are a nice perk. This one was looking a little worn on the inside. All of the usual Candlewood stuff is here - it's the same layout as all the other Candlewood Suites I've come across, but it is a bigger property than most. The pool is nice. In one room, there was a hole in the wall from someone opening the door too hard. In both rooms there was a fabric shower curtain that wasn't quite long enough and no vinyl liner behind it. The rooms at the front get a lot of freeway noise, so ask for a room at the back. If you need to be near downtown/market center and don't want to fight the traffic, go for this one, but if you don't mind the drive from Los Colinas, the Candlewood there is newer and nicer for about the same rate.

I went there for a night only, the restaurant was great, everything great, only during I checked in, the way they talked to me, the way they ask for my credit card,I might called it racists. but I dont care, I paid for my room, they dont even sleep in my room before. you see, when you check in at somewhere, and the front desk dont even welcome you, do you think you should stay and waste your money there? too bad I already paid by online for everything. its a big hotel, but this hotel missed something, they should ask, do you know where is the lift? do you know where's the restaurant for your dinner? they didnt. how the hell I knew where is that where is this. after I checked out, the car that fetch me went missing, so I asked the valet, if they saw any car written with the travel names in it. they look at me, and laugh so loud. and I was wondering whats that laugh about, then they simply, says " no" only no, thats it. I hope they can be more helpfull than that. again this is hyatt. it tooks me 45mins to look for the car, do you think anyone help me in the hotel? no. overall, the hotel was great. but this is hyatt, not a motel that they didnt trained their staffs, esp in manner. its sad if I remember this is hyatt. people stay here mostly they have money, and they dont care on spending their money. its not like I cant pay for my bills.

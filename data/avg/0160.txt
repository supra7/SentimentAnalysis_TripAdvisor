We had an easy check in. We had 7 rooms booked for a company/family vacation that we had booked through Priceline. Upon check in they upgraded us all to the Club Level, which is normally an additional $30 per night. It basically gave us access to a continental breakfast. The room was alright, the bed was pretty comfortable. We checked out the room service menu and the prices were pretty high for a hamburger. We lucked out because next door was a Subway. When we checked out myhusband had left his Houston Astros jacket behind and we were boarding a cruise ship so we couldn't turn back. When we got home I contacted the hotel and within a week I had a box on the doorstep with the jacket in it. I appreciated the customer service they extended to us in helping us get the jacket back. We are staying at a Crowne Plaza in Houston next weekend and can only hope for the same level of hospitality.

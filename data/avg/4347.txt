I have to say we had a great experience at the Boston Park plaza. When we arrived we were advised the the economy room we had booked was only suitable for one person this is despite the fact that expedia had let me book the room for 2. We were upgraded at no extra charge and with the minimum of fuss. The queen room we were allocated was great and v spacious. The hotel has good facilities including a number of bars restaurants / bars. We used the bars which were fine but not the restaurants as the location is so good for Back Bay, Beacon Hill and Downtown. In these areas there is lots of good restaurants. For great pizza visit the Upper Crust on Charles Street. The hotel is also well situated for seeing the sites of Boston. Beware though the internet charges as the hotel want $10 dollars for a 24 hour period. This is ok if you want to surf, all I wanted to do was quickly check email. Anyway the hotel was great, and good value for Boston, however if there are 2 of you book a queen room as the economy rooms are only for 1 person

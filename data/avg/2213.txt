Generally give fantastic reviews when I feel they're necessary. I'll make this one short and sweet. Pro: Only place close enough to strip to stay for under 21s. Con: If you are under 21, staff treat you like a 12 year old. Pro: New, clean, very OTT glamorous, great features in room. Con: Not much use to average guest in LV. Pro: Services available. Con: Have to pay for almost all of these services on top of not cheap base rate. Didn't bother with them. Pro: Late check out. Con: Left at 3am in morning on second night, had to pay for two full nights (which is fine) but was also charged the resort fee for both of these nights. Had discussed this with hotel staff upon check out. Agreed to waive fees, dismissed us very quickly and a month later, fees showed up on credit card statement. For people not accustomed to these extras fees, please note you are liable for them whether you use the pool, gym, etc. regardless. There's no real way around that. I understand a lot of this is Vegas but it was a frustrating way to end the trip. If we are going to be paying higher rates for accommodation and fees in Vegas regardless, next time we will go somewhere central, where the staff are not arrogant and treat you like 5 year olds. Disappointing way to end our trip, especially at a "5 star" hotel. Physically 5 star maybe, but service was barely a 2.

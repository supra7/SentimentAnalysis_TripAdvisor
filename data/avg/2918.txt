I booked using points from my credit card company. I arrived at the hotel at 1:00. Check in time is at 3:00. I was told that my room wasn't ready yet so I checked my luggage and went out to do some exploring. It was raining and I had a cold so I went back at 2:30 hoping my room might be ready a little bit early. Without checking, I was told that the rooms would be ready in 10 minutes. I sat and waited. A few minutes later, people started lining up to check in. I sat until the line went down. I stay at hotels frequently and have never encountered this before. I don't understand why they don't let people check in as their rooms become availalbe. The room was very nice. I played an extra $30 for a room with 2 queen beds versus the king room that I booked. The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. I would have slept like a baby except for two things: Lots of sirens all night long and we couldn't get the temperature in the room quite right. The bathroom was a nice size. Plenty of room for two people to share sink space. The second morning there, I lost hot water in the shower. It sounded like the toilet in the room next door flushed right before it happened. It quickly recoverd but a few minutes later, I lost hot water for good. Not a good way to start the day. I called the front desk and they offered to send someone up to look at it but my shower was already over. An apology was all I received. The hotel is in an awesome location. One block off of Michigan Ave and centrally located. I'm just not sure I would stay here again due to the customer service issues.

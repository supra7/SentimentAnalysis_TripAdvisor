Upon arrival first noticed hotel was under renovation (draped with brown cloth both inside and out) did not make for a very good 1st impression. Then we were given a room on the 1st floor (below lobby) for our resort view room which had not been cleaned. We were told to go out for about 2hrs and it would be cleaned upon our return - we did and it was. The bed was very uncomfortable (low to the floor and very hard with just a mattress on a board). Also the hallway, as soon as you walked off the elevator, had a very bad odor the entire 5 day stay (the doctor's office was on this floor so I do not understand how this odor was not addressed). The hotel charges an additional $25.00 resort fee per night plus $18.00 nightly for valet parking - you can park yourself but lots fill up quickly and are a distance to walk. We booked through a travel agent so I'm not sure of the cost for the room but the front desk told me approximately $325.00 nightly for the room we had (she did a great job with our hotels on Kauai & Ohau). On the positive side, grounds are beautiful (ocean front) with nice pool and bar. Swan Court Restaurant Staff was friendly and efficient - food was fantastic. Valet parking staff was also efficient and friendly upon arrival - used self parking day 2 and on. Overall interior/shops were nice if you overlooked current renovation. For our experience would not recommend.

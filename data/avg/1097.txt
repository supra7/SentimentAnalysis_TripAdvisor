Yes, it's hip. It's got funky art work everywhere and slouchy neon furniture in the lobby. There's a lot of black. But that doesn't mean it's a great place to stay. Decent location, check. Comfy beds, check. Serviceable fitness room, check. And that's about it. The hip, funky decor isn't functional - tiny desks for those of us who are also trying to work, and badly designed bathroom sinks for those of us trying to stay clean. My room was too small to be able to open the closet door enough to see the full length mirror inside, and my colleague's room was even smaller. At least I didn't have to have my desk chair pushed all the way in to walk around the bed. Just most of the way in. Several colleagues were staying just a couple of blocks away at the Andra. We were jealous.

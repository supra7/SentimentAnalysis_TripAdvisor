Originally booked to stay in Hotel Sonia, on arrival told we were staying at their new hotel across the road we were not disappointed, staff were friendly and very helpful, good location we walked to most of the attractions,but bus and metro (termini) are all near by to get to the Vatican and Colosseum. The breakfast room was very small, you had a choice of cereal,eggs,cake, yogurts,croissants,rolls and fresh fruit with tea and coffee. Recommend a great restaurant around the corner from hotel called Sapori Nuovie on via delle Fontane.

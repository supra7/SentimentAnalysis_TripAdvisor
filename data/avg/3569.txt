This hotel is right next to SMU - great if you want to be right next to SMU. It's 3 blocks from the interstate so easy access. The entrance is strange and hard to find. The place looks like an old apartment or other type residence building. The staff are great. The bartender is superb. The rooms are uncomfortable. Too much stuff in them and the space is too tight - doors bang into things when you open them etc. Breakfast is a disaster - do yourself a favor and skip it. The menu is limited - the food is below average - the service is terrible. Unless you have an hour to kill so eating microwave food seems like a good idea you'll want to eat elsewhere. I've stayed at the Palomar 3 blocks away and it is far better.

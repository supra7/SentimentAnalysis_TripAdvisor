We got a good deal on this hotel via expedia and only stayed one night. This hotel is too large and claustrophobic as well as tatty around the edges. We got a room with a faulty shower and had to switch rooms. I took forever for someone to come with the key for the new room and after we had hike down the endless corridorss and up two floors we discoverde that the key did not work. Wwe never really got an apology from anyone and were late going out for dinner which was irritating. The room appeared to be clean enough but very dark and dingey, not at all inviting. I wouldn't stay again and much preferred the Hilton on our last visit to Boston.

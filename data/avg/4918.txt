My husband and I stayed her for ou anniversary. otel was nice rooms small and bathrooms even smaller. Our last night there we were awaken at 4:30 in the morning by our neighbors fighting.... yelling... doors slamming, name calling. I waited a few mintues and it only got worse, so I called down stairs to let them know. They said they would send someone up right away. About 30 minutes later I called again, they then said they would send them up. I did hear a knock on the neighbors door, but they did not answer. I was already pretty upset and awake so my husband and I packed up and got out of there. The down staris staff said that they would give us breakfast on them...however... Breakfast does not compair to a horrible night of sleep.

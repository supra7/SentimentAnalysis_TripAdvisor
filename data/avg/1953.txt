The good 1. Good value for Money 2. The pool area was not crowded and we could always get a sun lounger 3. Rooms were very clean and spacious 4. Great location for restaurants 5. Good beach The Bad 1. we stayed 5 nights by the 3rd day the swimming pool was filthy you could not see your feet at the bottom of the pool it was that murky. 2. Everything shuts by 10pm on our last night we tried to get a drinks at 10.05pm but was told no they were closed. 3. They lost our luggage when we fist checked in and i was really annoyed by the dont care attitude it even went to the point where they denied that i had left my cases with them 4. Was annoyed they charged us for dialing free phone numbers from our room what a con 5. The nightly entertainment got a little bit much by the 5th night 6. When trying to book the shuttle to take us to the airport the girl was on the phone to one of her friends she then made we wait 15 minutes while she finished arranging her Saturday night out and outfit !!! Overall was nice but could have been better i would go Maui again at a drop of a hat but would not stay here again

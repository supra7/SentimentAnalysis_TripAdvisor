Booked myself into this hotel for two nights stop over as part of my trip to Asia and Europe. Hotel is located at the top of the hill at Outram Park - it is a good 10 mins walk to the nearest MRT station. With Singapore humidity and temperature at mid 30c, 10 mins walk under the sun is rather challenging. Check-in was swift, got a room facing the hill. Room was absolutely tiny - has 2 single beds, a desk with a LCD TV hung onto the wall. Bathroom was tiny but clean. They even give you toothbrush but it is very much a single use disposable type. The theme of the hotel and room is very 70s retro - pictures are reflective of the hotel and room. The room is so tiny that you can hardly fit two large suitcases in. Luckily I was on my own and have minimal luggage. Breakfast was included in my room booking - food at the restaurant was average. For the two days that I had stayed there, they served identical buffet breakfast. It fills you up if you put quality aside. Overall, I rate this as a cheap and cheerful hotel. Hotels at Singapore are very expensive so it is very much what you pay is what you get. Would I come back to this hotel? Probably not - location is a bit out of the way. 10mins walk is too much for me at 35c and 90% humidity. Will I recommend this hotel to anyone? Yes, this is good value for someone with tight budget.

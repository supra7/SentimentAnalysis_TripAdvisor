Stayed with my family twice on the same vacation in Florida. Unluckily we had pre-booked this overrated hotel and could not change the booking for the last day. The location is not so great except if you are going on a cruise. No shops nearby and we didn't feel safe on the street after dark because there were many homeless people. We were 6 sharing a jr. suite - and both times we stayed here we had to go down and ask for sheets for the pull-out sofa. The toilet was loose. There were only decaffeinated coffee and no spoon or anything to apply the sugar. When we asked the frontdesk were the nearest restaurant were? - they did not know any!! - Price for valet parking 28$ !! So much noise from the airplanes taking of just abowe the hotel. No free internet in rooms - no breakfast - no flatscreen - The good thing is the view from the rooms which is stunning and the pool area is very nice but unless you are going on a cruise from the cruiseport nearby I will not recommend it.

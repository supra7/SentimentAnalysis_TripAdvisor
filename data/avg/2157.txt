Stayed a Friday and Saturday night at the Trump. Loved that it did not have a casino and is smoke free. Nice suites.Restaurant and bar prices very reasonable. However, a major minus was that the hotel sits right by train tracks and the first night I was woken 7 times by freight trains passing through and 2 times the following night.Even using ear plugs the trains are very loud! So returning home the first place I went was to my bed to have a nap! Sorry, won't be back due to poor location!

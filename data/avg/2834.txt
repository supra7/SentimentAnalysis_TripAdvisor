This hotel occupies just one floor of a weird-looking building, but in itself it is new, modern and clean. The room is quite bare, but also spacious and clean. Good location, near the central station. Girl in reception was polite, but didnt really know anything about Rome. Hotel is alright, room is alright and breakfast is alright. In summary, the place is alright - nice but forgetable.

I read some of the reviews of this hotel and I have to say, it ain't that bad. The hostel is basic and the service is a bit off, but it's cheap and fairly close to town. Our room had everything you might expect, inlcuding a microwave and a fridge, and the free breakfast, whilst minimal, was a nice touch. It could do with a lick of paint and some REAL flowers to give the place a more welcoming feel. The one maajor downside is that although it is fairly close to downtown it is not easy to walk and you'll be forced to get a cab or use their $3 shuttle service. If there are 3 or 4 of you it is cheaper to get a cab, whilst for 1 or 2 I would recommend their shuttle (But don't use it to go to Graceland as there is a free bus from downtown). As for the hotel overall? Good value

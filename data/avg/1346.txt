Rooms are very nice, beds and pillows are comfortable. Busy road right next to hotel and the walls and floors are paper thin. People floor above were stomping around from midnight until 1am. This is a good place to crash for a reasonable price. Food is expensive $48 (with tax and gratuity) for 2 eggs, bacon, juice and pancakes. Room service person was very nice, but stood and waited after I signed the slip - until I asked if the gratuity was included and he said, "yes". Note gratuity is 19% + tax. This hotel does offer valet parking, which I may choose if I come here again. It's not absurdly a long walk, but it is at the complete opposites ends of a city block, with no skyway, and no automatic doors to help you through if you have a lot of luggage (which I did). Front desk person was distracted and not very friendly (might have been because it was late when I arrived)... The room has a great LCD TV, coffee maker, tea (Lipton) and a nice shower.

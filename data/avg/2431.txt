We stayed at this hotel the night before an early flight from Philadelphia Airport. The room was clean and basic, but the hotel does serve a free breakfast from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. (too early for us) and 24/7 shuttle service to the airport. There is also a Ruby Tuesday's restaurant within walking distance from the hotel. Warning: The free parking advertised on their website actually cost us $40.00 for the week. The front desk explained that this was because we used a discount (AAA) to book the room.

Booked at this hotel based on excellent TripAdvisor ratings. Positive attributes cited in reviews are spot on -- excellent location, quiet, clean, very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Room and bathroom, however, were tiny, bed was hard, air conditioner did not function properly. Having recently stayed in much better quality hotels for same price in otehr big European cities (Rome, Paris), I did not feel that this hotel was a particularly good value.

The rooms were basically what you would expect for the price. Everything is old, but perfectly clean. Just make sure a friend doesn't come and visit you or Levon will come and get you!!!! He is insane and on a power trip. If you can avoid him, everyone else there was very nice. It was a good value for ocean side property. If it wasn't for Levon, we would stay there again.

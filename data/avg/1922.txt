We liked this hotel, although it is obvious that it is aging and needs some updating, and some might not like the looks of the lobby, which is a mish-mash of different things with no particular interior decorating to speak of. The best thing was the service whenever we needed anything, and the worst thing was having no small refrigerator in the rooms to keep food or drinks cold - getting ice in a bucket was the only alternative and could only be used for beverages, so we had to throw away food that we had brought back with us to the hotel room. Otherwise, it was okay, and the staff was especially friendly and helpful.

Nothing fancy at this hotel however you can't beat the price for only being 2 miles from downtown/Beale Street. They also offer a shuttle for $3 per person going downtown. The noise from the train is loud but as long as you aren't a light sleeper it isn't too bad in the room. Again this hotel is not a fancy place to say but I personaly didn't find it as bad as other reviews. The room itself is actually pretty large.

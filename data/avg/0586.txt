My family and I stayed at the Seatown Sheraton for some Black Friday shopping. We had 3 rooms on the 20th floor; the rooms we had were not the newly reno'd ones, but we did not mind. The carpets in the rooms and halls showed some wear, but overall the rooms, bathrooms and hallways were bright and clean and appointed nicely. As is usually the case for Sheratons, their beds are the best in the business, hands down. Our floor was very quite, as well. The lobby and common areas like the pool and fitness center were typical of this level of hotel. We did not eat at any of the restaurants. The best part of the hotel is definately the location. It is right beside some good shops and restaurants and is just a short (pleasant) stroll to Fishermans and Pioneer. We were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of the valet's. We had read a lot of complaints about the valet service, but we got very good, prompt service whenever we needed our cars pulled. This was considering that everyone seems to check in and out at exactly the same time!!! As is mentioned in other posts, if you don't want your car valet'd you can park across the street at the convention centre for a cheaper price.......... We used Starwood Hotel points for our rooms so I don't know what the typical rate for the rooms would be, but I would definately pay ~ $100-120 per night for these rooms; probably more if I was assured one of the new reno'd rooms.

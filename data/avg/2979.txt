The room was compact but very clean and adequate for our family of four (children aged 12 & 5). Breakfast menu was standard Holiday Inn Express but it can get a little bit busy. The metro station is only a five minute walk away and you can get into the town centre in only 15 to 20 minutes. All in all we were happy with our stay and If you are going to spend most of your time out and about, then I would recommend this place.

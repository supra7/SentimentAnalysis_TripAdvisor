This hotel was picked based on the photos and website. it sounded like paradise for my in laws. The rooms were clean, spacious and had their own porch. The porch on the back had a sandy back area which was great for small children that love to play. The pool area was nice and clean and the pool was not overcrowded. The Pros: the rooms were spacious, clean, the bathrooms were spacious. The resort was quiet and neatly laid out. The Cons: the beach mentioned on the website does not truly exist, the housekeeping does not have very good timing (the day we were their all day, they did not clean until about 3:00). The location for going downtown for dinner is terrible, you end up paying the resort fee for parking and then parking downtown. They should have a shuttle service or something to make the resort fee worthy.

We stayed in this hotel for three nights on our way to a cruise and one night on the way back. The staff are excellent - friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The location is perfect for accessing all of Seattle's wonderful sights within walking distance, particularly Pike's Fish Market, which is so much more than just a fish market. However, the rooms smell of mildew from old carpets, The furnishings are very old and greatly need to be updated. The bathroom was basic but needs remodeling - ex. our shower pipe was extended out of the wall with a clear gap in the wall behind it. The cleaners are not good - they don't speak English very well and asking for anything extra brings little or no results. However, once they finally do clean the rooms, they are well kept, but they are very slow and obviously not motivated.

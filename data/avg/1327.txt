Stayed here on 2 separate occasions recently. One was great, the other was below average. Rooms have been renovated but found the one on our second stay to be noisy. Food is average hotel fare. Public areas can be dark. $14 a day parking in a lot far from the front desk was disappointing. Shuttle to/from the airport was on time and the drivers helpful. For the price, there has to be better options.

I stayed here with a friend from the US and her 18 year old son. We chose it as it was a good price for a 4 star hotel, although about a 20 minute tram/bus ride from the city centre. It did not feel like a 4 star and, had we known, we would have opted for a 3 star hotel nearer to the city centre. However, the hotel was clean, good (not great) service, and a good buffet breakfast. The best part was that we had a triple room with 3 proper beds, not a twin with a put-you-up.

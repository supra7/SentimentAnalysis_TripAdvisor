I stayed at this hotel last July durn the Just for Laughs festival. It was a great location, within walking distance to shops, shows and restaurants. Its a very nice, modern and clean place. The rooms were just really small and really dark, since some of the walls were black. The nice thing about this place that there is a convienience store on the main floor. Its good if you wanted to grab some snack foods of drinks. I would recommend this place if you like a little modern feel.. overall I wouldn't go back just cause you can get a bigger hotel room for for a cheaper price.

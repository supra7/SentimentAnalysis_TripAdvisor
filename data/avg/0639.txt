We stayed for one night at this hotel. We chose this based on its location - the cheapest available in the area! Location: Excellent. Five minutes to the downtown shopping district. about 15 minutes from Pike's Place Market. However there is a gentlemen's club at the back side of the hotel and the area may not be that safe to walk around late at night. Amenities: Exercise room is minimal but equipment is functional. No cleaning agent for wiping down the machines after use though. Room: Old but adequate. The bath tub is really narrow and small. Problems with dialing outside calls. Complimentary internet access but the wire (wire only, no wi-fi) is very, very short and is awkwardly located in between two beds... I couldn't put my laptop on a desk and had to kneel down to work with my lap top. very inconvenient. Like: LOCATION Dislike: Across from Gentlemen's Club, feeling a bit unsafe to talk around at night

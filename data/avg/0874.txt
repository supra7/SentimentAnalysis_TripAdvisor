I chose westin is because of the bed, they are very very comfortable.....However, the Westin in Seattle is very old, and our room is very old too. Things I like: We have a dog, and they did provide a "havenly dog bed" and dog bowls, no pet fees. To be honest the dog bed looks very comfortable as well. Things I dont like: Room is very old, the carpet has coffee stain???? TV is a big old style TV and you have to pay for internet. Swimming pool is in another building. Our room is very close to the elevator and ice machine...( this i think maybe because i booked through a 3 rd party website??) I like the Westin because of the bed, so I will stay next time if I get a good price...

I stayed two nights at this hotel on business and really cannot complain, however would not recommend it for personal trips. The pool remains mostly in the shade all day (so no sunbathing) and the hotel is located next to a very busy road so it definitely wouldn't be relaxing. The rooms are large and to a good standard and the staff are super efficient and friendly, but I would question what makes this hotel 5* because it doesn't offer the luxury you expect. The hot water also appears to be on a timer so the shower gets very cold after about 1.5 minutes! It is conveniently located near a metro station (5 mins) and the Marina mall (2 mins) and is also fairly central. Essentially not a bad experience, but I would try somewhere else next time.

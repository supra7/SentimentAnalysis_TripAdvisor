Just returned from a stay at the Boston Park Plaza and Towers and must say , the reviews and the hotel can greatly differ based on the type of travel, the traveler themselves, and the expectation level. I was lucky enough to find a rate on Hotwire.com for less than $100 a night. For a downtown hotel in the heart of Boston, near the Pablic Garden , that is nearly can't miss. The hotel is old. I'll give reviewers that point. The lobby is grand and very nice. Again, point awarded. Check in was smooth and my room was on the 10th floor. The room was small, and somewhat stuffy, but very managable. With window light and two beside tables, more than enough light. Bathroom was incredibly small, but again, managable. Only compliant i had regarding the bathroom: the shower liner (seemed to be covering an older bathtub) was ill fitting and creaked loudly when stepped on. The dual shower head more than made up for it. Bed was small , but comfortable. Plenty of pillows. Older style tv, but good quality. Overall , a suitable room for $100. Note: would i have paid $180-$200 for the same room? No, not even close. But for the money? It was worth it. Excellent location, had no problems with the staff, housekeeping was friendly and attentive. Would suggest travelers take the time to research the hotel they are staying at prior to booking. Cost makes staying here pleasant . If more for your money is what you are looking for, it'd be wise to consider other options. Not at all a slam against the Hotel. They have obviously tried to make a number of improvements where they can, and with an older building, that might be hard to accomplish.

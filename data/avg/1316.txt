Stayed here for business in late September. This is an older Marriott property, as you can tell from the low ceilings and older decor. On the plus side, it's clean, comfortable with a very nice lobby, bar/restaurant, and "tropical" atrium with pool). Service was also excellent. This is a great property if you need a hotel close to the airport. Just don't stay in the "back" of the hotel, as the garbage trucks empty the dumpsters at about 5:30 every morning.

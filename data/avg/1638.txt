Two hour late check-in. Terrible waiter service although very nice just incredibly untrained. Mexican restaurant very good..Asian..awful...Italian..mediocre. Pool cold. Room very pretty but not well cleaned in and out. Everyone is friendly just not a polished team. Maid service inadequete and late in day. Room service is not great. Drinks good if not fussy about premium liquors. No patron, grey goose and bad house wines. Overall a pretty place but construction and noise is not good for relaxing. Hated that we could only jet ski with a package combined with other activities.

The rooms were great: clean, very comfortable beds, plenty of space. Not a great view, but I'll happily give up a knock out view for a quiet, comfortable room while traveling for business. The workout room was great, nothing crazy but good for getting a run in while I was away from home. The only negative was the service throughout the hotel. The front desk wasn't able to locate a package that was left for me and sent me to the bell hop stand, who then sent me right back to the front desk, where another staff member found the package right away. Twice we went up to the concierge desk to get recommendations for dinner, and both times we were told by the person behind the desk that they were done for the day (around 6pm) and we should direct our questions to the front desk. I understand people need to get home, but we were put off by the way we were treated each time. Not to mention the front desk just pulled out a tourist map and looked at it slightly confused without offering any real assistance (or recommendations). Room service also wrote down the wrong room number and I had to go out in the hall when I heard them knocking on the wrong door for 10 minutes. The rooms were wonderful to come back to, but dealing with the staff turned out to be the headache.

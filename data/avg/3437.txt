Decided to give ourselves a treat and spend the recent public holiday at the hotel. Specified in my reservation that I needed 2 connecting rooms and got that but was not told on check in that one was a handicapped room. Did not notice anything amiss until I went to my kids' room, then I realised that amenities were different. There was no bathtub in the toilet and also no hooks to hang our clothes. There were hand rails but I wish that they would add some hooks as well. Toiletries were only provided for 1 guest per room even though reservation clearly states 2 per room. The chair in the room was stained. Our room windows overlooked the shuttle train and airport landing strip and we can hear the planes intermittently. Thank goodness, the noise was not loud. We had dinner at the chinese restaurant on the 1st level of the hotel. Felt rushed and the waiter kept pushing expensive food items. Was a bit taken aback when we got the bill and 2 bowls of soup cost S$60/- - did not find the soup anything special. The roasted pork was very good though.

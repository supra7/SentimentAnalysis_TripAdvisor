This is a good hotel for the price.. The breakfast is the best part. I have stayed in different hotels in Istanbul, but the breakfast that this hotel offers is incomparable. It close to Istiklal, but a bit far from the grand bazaar or sultanahmet, but there are good connections to various tourist places from here. There are lots of small restaurants and shops at walking distance from Titanic. Staff was very good and helpful, and rooms were very clean.We also enjoyed at the spa and swimming. If travelling from Ataturk then this hotel is not that far (taxi charges around 25 euros).. In all a very good experience..

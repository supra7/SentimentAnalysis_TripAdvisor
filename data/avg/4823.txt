My husband and I were at The Palmer House Hilton for a business meeting. The doormen started our visit on a high note. They were extremely professional and helpful. The lobby of this hotel is beyond beautiful. The ceilings and walls were something to behold. The elevator lobbies had banquets for sitting. The hallways are lined with black and white picture of all the famous people who have either stayed here or played here. The empire room was simple elegant.The concierge staff was knowledgeable,extremely helpful and friendly. Unfortunately the rooms themselves left much to be desired. Our first room was really really small. It fit a queen bed and that was about it.There was no dresser for clothes. We asked to be moved to a larger room/ We were asked if we minded going to a handicapped accessible room.That room had a huge bathroom with a wheel in shower. That shower got the floor soaking wet.The bathroom was larger but alas, still no dresser. There were two desks but no dresser. It was late by the time we got to the second room so we decided to just deal with it. We left the room very early the next morning for meetings. By 3:30 the room had not been cleaned.Even though the staff was great, and the public areas beautiful, next time I'll just take the tour and stay somewhere there is room for me and my clothing.

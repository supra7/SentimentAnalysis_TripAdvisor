The hotel is in a great nieghborhood ,close to everything . The walk to the waterfront is downhill so coming back is a chore if you are not in shape. Great area with pictureseque downtown and freeway views . My only gripe is the giftshop does not open when it says it will open . I had a splitting headache and neede some asprin. I was told the giftshop would be open at 7am it did not open till after 8am . Also the elevators are small and they can take time to get to you . Overall a nice place to stay and the staff were pretty nice . I stayed in 2651 .

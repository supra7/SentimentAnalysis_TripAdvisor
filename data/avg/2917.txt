I stayed at the Avenue for one night for a business trip. I went with a colleague to check in around 2p. Unfortunately, we were told that rooms would not be available until 3p (the check in time). We got back around 4p. I got upstairs to my room and it had an odd smell: moldy almost like someone had smoked in the room. I called to the front desk to change my room. The only room available was the kids room (colorful room with plastic toys). It was odd that management or someone from the front desk never came up to smell the room. My colleague came down and smelled the room. She too had a room with a similar scent, but not as bad. As best I can describe  the smell was like an antique cellar. I passed on the kids room and stayed put. Later in the night when I returned from a work event around 11p, I turned up my heat. By 1a it was still chilly in the room and I turned the heater up to 85 degrees.but it just got colder. By 130a I called the front desk and within 10 minutes an engineer was in my room. Now, I am happy he came so quickly and only took 20 minutes to take apart my heater and clean the filter. By 4a I had to be up for a 6a flight  only having 2 hours of decent sleep. No one at the hotel ever called to apologize or offer anythingthis was customer service at its worst. For a $300/night room rate - I expected more. Basically, this is an outdated hotel desperately in need of upgrades. The reason the heater was spitting out cold air was b/c of build up on the filter  you would think a four star hotel would be constantly monitoring for this. Pluses on this was that the person that checked me in was really helpful in looking up restaurant recommendations and addresses. In general, the staff was responsive, but never went above and beyond. Location is great, but there are so many other hotels with great location. Bed was comfortable and bathroom spacious (but again outdated). I also had a nice partial view of Magnificient Mile.

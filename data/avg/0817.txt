I was taking part in an event at the Westin, and my husband and I decided to stay here to make it easier on our twins and us. It was a little pricier than we wanted, but we thought we'd pay extra for the convenience. The location was great. 15-minute walk to the Space Needle or Pike Place Market. There was shopping all around, too. Checking in was easy, and we got two cribs for our kids easily. The bed was SUPER comfortable and the room was clean and had a stunning view. The concierge was very helpful and friendly. The room was not remarkably large and seemed less so with 2 small cribs in it and the carpet seemed well-worn. My one big problem was the feeling of being nickel-and-dimed. Internet is not free in the rooms, and if I had wanted to put my babies' bottles in the mini-fridge, it would have been $7! I also needed to make 2 toll-free phone calls, and they charged me $2 for each call! As a result of these charges, the lobby is full of internet users who don't want to pay, and I kept my babies' milk in the ice bucket. I would probably try elsewhere if I return to Seattle in the future. It was just too high for what we received.

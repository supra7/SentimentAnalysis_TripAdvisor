We stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights. Our first priority in booking a hotel was to leave the car parked at the hotel so we can walk everywhere downtown. The hotel met this goal. It was only a short 3-4 blocks to all the downtown hub where Pacific Place was located. The pictures online made the hotel look better than it really is. The hotel was renovated but the rooms still felt a bit old and dreary. Staff at hotel were quite nice and service was very efficient. We paid $69/night on hotwire, but then there is a $30/night charge for parking. If I could get this price next time, I would stay here again because of the location. Overall, this hotel quality was average, but excellent location.

I went here with my partner at the end of June to celebrate my 40th. We were really pleased we had picked this hotel. It is away from the crowds and tourist mayhem of San Marco but only about a 15 minute walk away. Situated in a residential area, next to a park with views across the lagoon. Our room was modern and very clean with tea and coffee facilities and toilettries provided. Breakfast was ample, with plenty to choose from and a garden to sit in if you prefer (limited seating). The staff were always very helpful and courteous and the free wifi in the reception and restaurant (where breakfast is held) is really useful. There was nothing negative about this hotel that I could see and my stay was a good one. Would defiitely recommend it. The only thing is, that it's a 15 minute walk from the main square...we found this to be a plus but for those that like to be in the centre it might be too far out?

Hotel is in a central location which makes it easy to see all of downtown on foot. Swanky, stylish lobby was refreshing. Rooms were fine, but as this was a splurge I found it a bit too business like than as stylish as their lobby. Also, only valet parking was available which meant a charge of $31 a nice, + tips for parking! For a 4 star hotel, the bathroom was dirty and the shower stall full of mould, mildew and softening drywall. That's unacceptable for a hotel of that rate and star class. Other than that disappointment I would say its a fine hotel, but if its more than you usually would spend, I would go elsewhere.

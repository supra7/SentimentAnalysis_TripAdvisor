The Novotel is located in the outskirts of Amsterdam, 4km south of the city centre and 0.2km from the exit RAI of the A10 Autobahn. It is a good example of the average unimpressive business hotel. Location is at walking distance of the RAI Convention Centre. It is a reasonable starting point for visiting Amsterdam. RAI railway station is a 2 minute walk from the hotel. The city centre is 20 minutes by tramway. Never enter Amsterdam by car, parking tariffs are the highest of Europe. The hotel was built in 1978 and completely renovated in 2006. The interior of the hotel is clean and adequately furnished. Staffs are competent. Our room was OK, had a good bed, a satisfactory bathroom and was clean. The buffet style breakfast was acceptable. The food in the restaurant is average, service was very friendly. As most hotels in Amsterdam the Novotel is somewhat overpriced and does not really offer value for money.

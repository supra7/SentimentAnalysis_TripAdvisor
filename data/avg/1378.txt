#1 advantage: right across from the airport. You can walk. Otherwise it's nothing special. The hallways smell musty, but the room was clean enough. Nice fluffy beds with some kind of air-pump sleep-number thing which I didn't try. Plenty of space in the room. Wifi is not free. Personnel were friendly, no issues. They have a hot breakfast buffet which was average for this class of hotel (eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, yogurts, etc.).

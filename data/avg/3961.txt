The hotel is in a condo building. Some floors are residential while some belongs to the hotel. This hotel is nice overall. Clean, good location (if you are driving), nice room (very spacious bathroom). It also has a nice outdoor hot tube and pool. It was cold when I was in Vancouver otherwise I would have used it. Price is decent as well and it's located right downtown. I would return to this hotel next time I'm in Vancouver.

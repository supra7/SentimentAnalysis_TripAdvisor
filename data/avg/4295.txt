We read some negative reviews and were a little skeptical about the hotel, however we were very pleased with the hotel and thought it to be one of the best values. It is located in the prime Back Bay area, two blocks from The Boston Commons and Garden, two blocks from Newbury Street (Boston's Rodeo Drive), several blocks from the Esplanade on the Charles River, Prudential Center, Copley Place. We walked everywhere from the hotel; i.e. the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Marketplace, Beacon Hill, the Wharf. It's also in a quieter location. The hotel is an older, classic hotel, but very well kept up and recently remodelled. The rooms are small, but well appointed and clean. Some rooms are more updated than others. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel has a nice fitness center, breakfast buffet (though a little pricey $20) and a McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant that features a half-price Happy Hour. We ate there three times during the week. They even changed the menu during the week. In the evenings, there is live piano music that you can enjoy in the lobby or the cafe. Overall, we were very satisfied with the hotel and would stay there again.

We enjoyed our stay at the Travelodge in Seattle. We did have a few issues, but nothing major and we actually extended another two nights. Pros: - Good size rooms - Large king beds - Really comfy, new linens, duvets and hundreds of pillows - New carpets and nice hallways - Good cable TV service with on demand films, TV programmes - Friendly staff - Free parking - Coffee in reception was actually drinkable - Good location for Space Centre and about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown - Good value, we paid 50 inc tax weekday and 65 at the weekend - Excellent local pizza delivery place called Bambinos - fresh, homemade and delicious Cons: - We had a downstairs room which smelt really musty and was damp - we didn't bother to ask to move as we spent little time in our room - Bathrooms are a little grungy - they need redoing and the towels were thin - Heating/air con unit was a blast from the past - it just about heated the room up but it was like a jet engine taking off - you could hear everyone elses too - Although the location was good, it was a little 'lively' at night. Having a ground floor room, we were a little distracted by the locals having street races and generally hanging out on a Friday/Saturday night. Probably congragating round the nearby McDonalds. - Housekeeping staff pretty noisy in the morning if you're trying to have a lie in - Breakfast usual free continential buffet but the room is tiny and you're not supposed to take it back to your room (although I sneaked it on a couple of occasions). - They advertise a self-service laundry but looked surprised when I asked to use it (I had run out of pants). Still never got an answer as to why they have it in their in room brochure and website and yet it doesn't exist in the hotel I'd say this is a very good value budget option for Seattle with a car. You can't really get the location with free parking for less. But go for a room higher up and just make sure you don't need to do any laundry!

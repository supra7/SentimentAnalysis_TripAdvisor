So I'm a Intercontinental Hotels Platinum card member, so I did get upgraded to a Club level suite. So the fact that I found the whole stay pretty average says a lot. The location is not great, the staff are more interested in themselves then helping guests (in one case advising me to take my 9 year old son to a 21+ only bowling / entetainment location. The club level free breakfast often was poorly staffed so that it all ran out if a few people came at the same time. I've stayed at many Crowne Plaza hotels and this one, a franchise, just is not up to it.

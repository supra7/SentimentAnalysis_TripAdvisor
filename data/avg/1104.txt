NO airport transport, Pool, free internet~! Service is good - the rooms are small and have a weird mold smell to them/ If you have allergies to detergents may want to skip this one they dont use hypoallergenic detergents to clean and that was bad for me/ Its clean and its close to everything but my friend stayed at the marriott during the same time and we swam til late and the rooms didn't smell funny. 30 bucks more a night I would have gone there. Tried to get late check out and I travel a lot not all places do it make sure to ask before you reserve. Our flight was late and we wanted to stay in an get room service to chill for a bit while we waited to leave for airport. No dice. Kicked us out at exactly 12 noon. Even asked if we had time to shower or anything. Nope! So make sure you double check all these things! The food is nothing to rave about. Breakfast is quite disappointing for the price. that is it. Shop around I think 30 bucks more for something on the water over seeing the bay beats this. That's what we will be doing next time on business or leisure.

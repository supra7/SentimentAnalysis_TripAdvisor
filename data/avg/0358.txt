Really really really small room but old buildings like this are often small. They have two computers for guest use and Wi-Fi in a nice sitting room/business area. Parking costs about $8 per day in covered garage next door. Good location for shopping and waterfront. Loved Elliotts Waterfront restaurant and The Brooklyn Restaurant. Loved Nordstroms! Had a great time in Seattle.

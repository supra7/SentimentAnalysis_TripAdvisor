On the positive side: great architecture, good rooms with views, modern design common spaces and nearly fully booked it doesn't feel crowded. The down side: upon check-in they tried to give us a bay view when we paid for an upgraded bay/city view. Make sure you get what you pay for. Service is on the slow side and is not up to the Hilton standards that we are accustomed to as diamond members. Some personnel delivered excellence while others had a poor attitude. When you are spending that kind of money for dining and lodging you expect a lot more. The location has it's plus and minus. You are not in the heart of everything but can walk a half mile or less to get there. Another reviewer made a negative comment about the convention center which is right next to it. I happen to think the diverse architecture that surrounds the Hilton is a positive. I do want to add that the windows were filthy which was a distraction looking at the view. Also, there was a lot of visible dust in the room. It's a lovely hotel and location but lacking in quality and there is no sense of value whatsoever. Until they improve their service, we will stay somewhere else. It has a lot of potential to be top notch.

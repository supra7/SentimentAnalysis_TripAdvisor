I had a quick stay here last week for one night. The good news - the hotel is very close to the airport with a 24hr shuttle to the airport. My room and bathroom were both very clean and the service at the hotel was friendly, The check in process could be slow and it would be helpful if the airline crews were not given first priority to jump in front of everyone waiting. The not so good news - food at the hotel was OK. I believe there are better options in walking distance from the hotel.

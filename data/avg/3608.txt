First time stayed at this Marriott in downtown Dallas. Upon check-in, the only staff was talking on the phone...for 5 minutes! Other staff walked by, no one offered to help. Not impressed with customer service. Strike one! Asked (Booked) for a King bed but only 2 twins ready at the time. Minor, but still, strike two! Note: Requested early check-in during booking. Also called the morning prior to arrival to confirm early check-in. Hmmm... Room was decent and clean. When making a business call, I realized there was no note pad and pen in the room. Minor and acceptable issue. Strike three came when I found out I had to pay for wireless. My understanding is Marriott reward members always get complimentary access. Maybe I have been spoiled by other Marriott chains... and maybe the management at this particular hotel is a spy from Hilton... ><

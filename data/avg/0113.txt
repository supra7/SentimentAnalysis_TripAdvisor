My husband and I thought this an attractive little hotel. Rooms were on the small side, but nicely furnished. The rooftop garden deck was a nice photo-op, but too breezy in Sept. for lounging. Also, getting service for a glass of wine was a major undertaking. We finally had to go to the bar next door, order it, then come back and wait for the bellboy to deliver it. Didn't need a hassle after a long flight! Would probably stay elsewhere next time. Perhaps the Fairmont.

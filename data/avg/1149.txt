Really liked the hotel setup - very W like but cooler. Bummer part was that the room was pretty small. I had a King room - 1003 and after asking the front desk on my last day I learned that apparently each room has a different floor plan and that some of the rooms are much larger than others - that said, I would go back provided I get a bigger room next time. One annoying thing - the bathroom light was outside the bathroom door in an awkward spot - Hotel Max, you guys should fix that

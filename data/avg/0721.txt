I stayed at The Edgewater with my two children, & my wife for one week in early July. The accommodations were clean, yet the hallways were dark. There are no vending machines, (which I've come to take for granted for a late night snack). Although they boast of an excellent shuttle system that can get guests to & from various Seattle locations, you must be OK with there schedule, & be OK with receiving guilt in requesting the shuttle from some staff that answer the shuttle hotline. We enjoyed walking & exploring downtown, so bring your sneakers and enjoy walking to your destinations. Also- pay the extra money and treat yourself to a water view room...Unless of course you LOVE listening & seeing trains constantly go past your window. This was cool for our 6 year old, but the rest of us would have rather gazed out over the water. Also the bathroom was odd in that you felt very exposed with modern partial barriers. Btw- our son fell out of bed at 1:00am. When I asked the front desk what I should do with a child with a quickly swelling child's ear that was changing various colors, they responded with we can call an ambulance. Idk what I expected, maybe ice? Maybe an EMT on call? This is a nice hotel...but just enough quirks to make you question spending your hard earned money:(

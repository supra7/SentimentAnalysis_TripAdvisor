Is well located for tourist, including by vehicle (but watch out for street cleaning day if parking!). Our "quiet" rooms (709 & 909) were pleasant but "tight" and only quiet with the air conditioning off - so noisy we kept it off until absolutely required, not comfortable! Breakfast good value, doormen most helpful and welcoming, pity reception didn't attend same training school. Business people may want the "ishy" bit, but was more than necessary to feel comfortable. Next stay will be elsewhere!

I was very worried about staying in this hotel after reading previous reviews but I had no problems. Our room was big enough for the two of us and yes we only had one bathroom and we managed to cope with no problems. the room was clean yes the a/c was noisy but it did the job. My only complaint was that we could not check in until 3pm and after a 7 hour flight from Manchester England were in need of a shower but thats life. the hotel was in a great location and the price suited us. We were in Boston for 3 days to see the sights and not to spend our time inside a hotel room I think some people need to remember that when posting their comments.

Whenever I go away I like a little touch of luxury and usually this is reflected in the price. Although the price of this hotel falls in this bracket it's not a luxury feel hotel. The tolietries, bed and size of room along with the fact that you only get a shower(with no privacy) and no bath all have the feel of a motel.The lighting in the room is not practical and the air conditioning is noisy and not efficent. the first room we had overlooked a dodgy building- so it is possible to get a bad view. We were moved the next night with no problem. On the plus side the staff are friendly, the sheets are nice and the concept of the hotel is designed well- although personally I'd rather a bit of comfort than the impressiveness of a 360 degree terrace- which is available to anyone who wants to buy a drink you don't have to stay here. Would be happy if I'd used clubcard vouchers to pay for the trip but hotel is overpriced for one not on the Ramblas itself and lacks the luxury touch to really make it special. Wouldn't stay again.

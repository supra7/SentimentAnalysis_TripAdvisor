We stopped at the Hilton for four nights at the end of July. We paid for the upgraded corner room but couldnt see a difference from the standard room apart from a bit more space. The room was clean and comfortable, with a small balcony that you could manouvre a chair out onto at a push. The swimming pool and gym were fine nice to have a quick dip after a long day sight seeing. Used the bar but not the breakfast room which seemed to be overpriced. Overall it was a good experience and we would stop again if in Boston.

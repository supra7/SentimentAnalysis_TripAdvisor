I have stayed at 3 Intercons in the last few months- Chicago (ORD), Atlanta (Buckhead) and this one in Dallas. Dallas is the least impressive of all these. The rooms are average, the parking is free but can be challenging to find if busy. The club level or concierge level is not worth it at all- at this Dallas location. Possibly the Buckhead location spoiled me and set expectations to high- but simply some fruit and coffee in the morning is not enough to charge what they do for this service. The staff, for the most part (not all) are very helpful and knowledgeable. Overall this was a satisfactory experience- no major complaints and nothing that would draw me back in 2 months on my next trip to Dallas.

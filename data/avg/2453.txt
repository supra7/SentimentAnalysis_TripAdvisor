We recently spent two nights at this property. Our king room was adequately clean but quite small; there was no luggage rack and, really, no place really to put a suitcase. The design of the room made its use by two people difficult; if one person were dressing, the other could not walk to or from the bathroom. I had requested a refrigerator. None was in the room when we checked in. I asked at the front desk, and the clerk loudly called someone and commanded him or her to take a refrigerator to the room. It had not shown up by checkout a day and a half later. The bed was confortable, but sleep the first night was marred by lots of noise -- a party of people yelling to/at each other -- at 3 - 4 a.m. Service at breakfast (not included with the room) the next morning was nearly non-existent, despite the restaurant being largely empty. One can order off a limited menu or there is a buffet. The food I ordered, omelet and toast, was not very good, but there is a nice coffee station with coffee and tea available all day. It took a couple of tries to find one of the two treadmills available in the small exercise room, but having individual televisions on the treadmills was a nice surprise in a hotel. Night two also was marred by noisy guests. I used the wired internet service a couple of times, and it worked fine. Overall, the accommodations would probably be fine for me if I were staying alone overnight on business, but otherwise little larger and better designed space would be better.

We enjoyed our stay but I would say that it would have been better to be on the waterside and not on the parking lot side. The train passing by very often does not help if you are a light sleeper. The bathroom is nice - compact but very efficient. The heating and air conditioning is definately an issue if you don't like to be too hot or listen to humming in your ears. Friendly staff and very clean. Wish we could have taken in more of the hotel but were scared off by the prices of what everything cost!

Our first night we didn't get in until afte 1am and had tonleave at 6 am. We were put in a hole that barely had room for a fullbsize bed. No bathtub, just a shower. Very noisy. I think a heat pump was outside our window on roof. The room was reserved by a 3rd party. The next week, we were here for 2 nights and I made the reservation. We had a larger room with a queen bed, bath tub and good view. Still not spacious, but good quality. With the location and price along with fact we weren't here much as were were touring, I would recommend this place. Very clean both times.

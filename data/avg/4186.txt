Stayed for two nights, got a room upgrade which saw us in a huge room with two bathrooms. When we tried to check in while my husband parked, we were not allowed until he could be there and present photo id! This was ridiculous - I had my passport with the same surname and the credit card he had made the booking on. We had to wait in the lobby (big and v impersonal) for quite a long time until he managed to find a car park - the hotel doesn't have one. We were very tired and this was not a great welcome. Beyond that, the hotel was typical of a big city centre hotel, clean, large proportions and well positioned. Wifi not free.

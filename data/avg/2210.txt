Overall, it is an ok hotel. One major down side is the valet parking. Valet parking is the only option for this hotel. And it will take a long time if they are busy, like Sunday and Monday morning. As well as Friday and Saturday afternoon. From my point of view, the valet parking is a joke. There are also some small things needs to be take care to the room. The glass door for the toilet is opened to the wrong side. The auto light switch in the cabinet is also not working. The location is at the north side of the fashion mall. Not a great location.

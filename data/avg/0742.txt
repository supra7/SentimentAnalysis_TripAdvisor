The room was pretty small, it only offered 2 double beds and a cot for my 3 kids, my husband, and myself. The bathroom was nice though. There were no vending mashings so they offered in the room m&m's for $3.50, and Figi water for $6. When we made reservations, they neglected to say that parking was $35 a night. The Hotel it's self was nice, you could go to the lounge and relax with an awesome water view. But I think it was a little pricey for what you get, unless you reserve a really nice room!

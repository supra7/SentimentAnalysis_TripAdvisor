I stayed here mid-week for a quick business visit. I visit Philadelphia regularly, staying in pricier hotels (Doubletree, usually when my clients are paying) but decided to change it up and try to save a buck since this was a personal trip. The Center City location was great for me, as was the price, but it quickly became clear how much you lose when you go down in price. The decor of my room was very dated, with fabrics and colors from the 80's. Not old enough to be retro yet, not new enough to seem clean and fresh. There was no view - just a painted over airshaft with a sad faux window treatment. The flat screen TV was great, but it was over a sad looking dresser which carried the scars of an older television installation. On the other side of the room was a newer desk and coffee making area. The bathroom was simple and clean. Their appeared to be some renovations in the works, so maybe I just got an older room. This vegetarian found the 'included' breakfast very sad as well. For me, the best and most interesting part was the funky elevator. It reminded me of many European trips. But that was about the only charming detail I could find in this well located, reasonably priced, but sad little hotel. If you just need to crash in a good location, this hotel is fine, but it does not truly reflect the hip yet charming neighborhood in which it sits.

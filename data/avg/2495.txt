Small, overcrowded reception area, snappy hostess upon reception telling us to go upstairs to check in (as if we were stupid not to know that), two separate very busy elevators needed to get to room, luggage was very late finding its way to the room (2 calls needed to hunt it down), internet that didn't work for 1 1/2 of our 3 days there, but worst of all was the very, very bad service at the restaurant: we got the feeling we were putting them out (way out!) by showing up and asking for our continental breakfast. For that alone, I won't be back.

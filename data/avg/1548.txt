While he location of the hotel is great and he complimentary breakfast was good, the room was the smallest I have ever stayed in (and I am 60+). Glad it was just me:) I paid almost $300/night, inluding the $50/night room tax. For the price, would look elsewhere. Can hear anyone in the hall and every door which is closed.slammed! Free high speed internet a plus.

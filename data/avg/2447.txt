I travel for work and have stayed at this property several times over the last six months. While it is true that it is not the cleanest hotel, it is one of the remodeled ESA's so it doen't have that rundown creepy, grungy feel and the rooms are very quiet. I am not sure what good the security guard does, since one time while I was here the laundry room was broken into and vandalized, but overall it seems to be a quiet location. I never had a problem with any of the staff, and it is convenient to the airport, and highways. Once you figure out how to navigate around Philadelphia, you can find restaurants and shopping areas, on your own. But, I had no luck with anyone at the front desk knowing what was nearby, which I found a bit strange. This is not the worst place I have had to stay in but, it is far from the best.

Won the room at a good rate on Priceline and it definitely is not worth more than I paid. It is in no way a 4 star. Weird setup because you must first go downstairs, the up to the lobby on the third floor. Really dated lobby, but friendly and attentive staff. All of the furniture, the vanity, doors etc. chipped and scratched. Terrible sink faucet with an aerator so you can't get a steady stream of water to fill a water bottle. Awful and strongly scented toiletries. Room service was goo, but only had the cheeseburger and paid over $24. No free wi-fi.

This is an older downtown hotel, but was very adequate as far as amenities, very clean however room and bathroom was on the small side. The location was great to visit the waterfront, Pike Place Market, the underground tour (great). Within walking distance to many attractions, and right on the free city bus route. There is a Seattle's Best coffee shop joining the hotel, and several deli's, coffee shops, and restaurants within walking distance. Free iInternet service is available in the lobby, and there is a great restaurant around the corner with very reasonable breakfast. We did the Tillicum Village ferry and dinner/show and enjoyed it very much (within walking distance from the hotel).

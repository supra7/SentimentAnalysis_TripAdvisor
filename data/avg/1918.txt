Good location within walking distance to Whalers Village shops and restaurants, and good snorkeling site at black rock. I would recommend bringing mask and snorkel because fins are not absolutely necessary here. I was able to stand on bottom and see sea turtles within arms reach. Otherwise, you will spend 10$ an hour per set. Whalers village has good restaurants and good place to go for coffee or a quick breakfast. Room spacious but not luxorius (comparable to best western or similar). We stayed in room 146 which I would recommend due to closeness to parking garage, pool, ice machine and house cleaning (where you get beach towels). My family enjoyed the magic dinner show held at the hotel. My 7 and 5 year old boys got bored of the pool fairly quickly; the water was cold and no slides or anything exciting. The Sheraton next door has a much nicer pool for kids IMO. Count on spending additonal $9.00 a day for parking or $11.00 if you choose valet. Some of the negatives I experienced included no pool side drink service. The pool is right next to the Tiki bar so I expected to be able to lounge poolside and have a server come by to take drink orders. The "happy hour" was lame IMO. Only one beer and one cocktail were reduced slighlty. No food specials. The facility is a little dated. For example, there is no fan in the bathroom for ventilation. No free internet access, but you can print out airline boarding passes for free at front desk. Overall, just an average experience for our 4 day stay over Thanksgiving.

I was really disappointed, especially after so many great reviews on this Hotel. Let me highlight the downsides: Its not the closest hotel to the airport. I had to be at the airport at 3 am, but they run the shuttle service only from 4 am to 12 am, so I had to order a cab to get there! Something not expected by an airport hotel. And the problem is that I found out about this just when I was expecting to leave the hotel, so I had to wait close to 15 minutes for the cab to come. There is only one elevator servicing the 3 floors, and there are no stairs close by, so if the elevator is stuck on a floor, you just have to go up/down through the emergency stairs. The room was simply average, being the bathroom a bit old fashioned and not well maintained. For the price they charge, there are simply better and cheaper options around.

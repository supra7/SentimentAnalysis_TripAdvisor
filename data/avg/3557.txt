We met our college daughter and her 2 roommates in Dallas for the Arkansas/A&M game the 1st weekend of October. The game was at Cowboy stadium, and easy to access from the hotel. Staff had a mix-up and gave us rooms far from each other, but no harm done. The breakfast was undistinguished, and for us, did not matter, because we planned to go out to brunch. The bed, as usual, at Hyatt, was great. Great flat panel TV. I was able to get this on Hotwire with just a couple of days' notice.

My boyfriend and I decided to take a short trip up to Seattle for our spring break. We booked our room through Expedia. When we arrived we realized that this hotel was much more than we needed. When we checked in the receptionist tried to overcharge us and assured us that they would have never sold a room for the rate that Expedia gave us. We were able to resovle that issue fairly easily though. We liked the hotel but didn't realize that we had to pay for valet parking and $5 for a bagel! So, I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere ritzy to stay, but it just wasn't for us.

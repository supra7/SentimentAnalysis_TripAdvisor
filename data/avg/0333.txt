This hotel is in a very very good location in Seattle. However, the weather was quite warm in Seattle (unusual for September they say) and the A/C had been turned off ! So they had a hotel full of uncomfortable travellers and could only say "sorry". Other than that the bed was good, the room was a bit small but functional, clean and nicely decorated. Probably won't stay there again since the management is not interested in the comfort of the guests.

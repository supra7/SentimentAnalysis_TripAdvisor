The hotel is basic: bed, bathroom, tv, coffee and tea making facilities. We got a dark room facing the building itself, but at least it was quiet. It is so close to the rail station, Darling Harbour and Paddy Market. So we spent most of our time outside the hotel anywayI For Muslim travelers, there is a nice Chinese Muslim restaurant on the way to Paddy's Market. In fact, the same restaurant also has a branch opposite Great Southern Hotel. We were supposed to stay there two nights, but due to missing our flight we only stayed for one. I was grateful for the counter staff giving us takeaway breakfast meal set (cereal, milk, cereal bar and biscuits) although it was already noon when we arrived - welcoming gesture! I think the hotel can use quite a bit of new decor as it looked quite dated and made it seem not worthy of 4-stars, but the staff do make up for it.

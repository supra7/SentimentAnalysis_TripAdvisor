I stayed here from February 27 to March 4. The resort is very nice and I found the staff to be very nice and pleasant. Beware of going there with the expectation that you will sit through their time share presentation. They will stick you in a room with no view and that's supposed to make you want to buy?? There are many nicer places to stay near by. The food at this resort is mediocre at best. By the 3rd day I was ready to order room service (which was better than the food I had in the restaurants) and forget the a la carte restaurants. Breakfast was good, but by the time dinner rolled around they had recycled the food to fit the different themes in the restaurants. The pools were clean and warm and the staff serving drinks were very efficient and friendly.I thought the Grill by the pool served the best food and it came hot and not overcooked.The beach sucks, but the mouth of the river is amazing. It is nice and quiet by the adult pool as long as parents with kids can read. Very relaxing but don't expect gourmet meals. By the way....the beds are the most comfortable of any place I have stayed in Mexico (8th trip).

I am frequently in Seattle and have stayed at this hotel many times over the last 30 years for both business and pleasure. The view, if you are on a high floor, can be spectacular and my room this last week was the best yet - a sweeping vista of the Sound from the cruise dock on the south end up to Magnolia. Ask for a room with a westward view although fair to stay that I have never had a view that wasn't pretty interesting. That said, the decor is looking a bit dated and worn. The carpet in my room, as an example, was a bit dirty and thin. Service could be much better as well. I had room service the first night and when I left, the dirty dishes were still sitting in the hallway for pick up some 3 days later. And as to the take away restaurant in the lobby, they were asking $2.20 for a single banana. Just avoid the place, there are lots of places to eat within 2 blocks walk. Overall, just average but could be so much better with just a little effort.

We stayed at the Edgewater for three nights, our first impression was great. Great location, nice interior design & friendly people. But unfortunately I think we got the wrong room... The airco was very loud, not only ours but we also enjoyed the neighbours one. Beside the airco our room was at the front of the hotel at the first floor and for some reason our window was next to an outdoor staircase and path. So we had no privacy at all... every 10 minutes somebody walked by and at night it didn't feel save. I think if you ask for a sea view room, you would love this hotel.

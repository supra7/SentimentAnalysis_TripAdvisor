Big comfortable modern room (King-size), but some niggles. The bedside lamp didn't work (not plugged in and no power socket that it could reach(; a ridiculously expensive minibar with electronic monitoring; iinternat access via t-mobile is expensivel no business centre; 5-10 minutes to get outside from the rooms, via two lifts; in-house restaurant extraordinarily expensive; not much in the immediate vicinity, apart form a Macy's, and Boston Common, so it's 10-15 minutes walk to Quincy Market, or to the nearest bar or restaurant (except Chinatown). Downtown Crossing metro station is close by, so it's quite convenient to get to via public transport.

This place was interesting. In general it seems like a pretty nice hotel, and maybe our room was just not great, but overall it felt very old and dated. The lobby, lounge area, bar, and restaurant look incredible (directly on the water with beautiful sunset views), but we didn't spend much time there, as we had other things to do in the city. That ended up being a problem, as the hotel isn't very close to anything downtown. It's a walk up the hills to get anywhere (unless you're walking down the street to the aquarium), so we found ourselves wishing we had picked a more central hotel. The bathroom was nice and modern, but even though the room had apparently been renovated fairly recently, it felt old. Our room was also very small. It faced the city rather than the water, and since there are train tracks running right down the road we had noise very often, throughout the nights and mornings. The hotel provides you with a set of "complimentary" earplugs, which is nice of them... I guess? If we had a larger room, weren't next to the train tracks, or spent significant time in the bar/lounge this place could have been really nice.

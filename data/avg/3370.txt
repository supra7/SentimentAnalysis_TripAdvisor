I selected this hotel for an overnight Sydney sojourn for my wife and I for its proximity to Central Station which is a junction for all rail routes including the route to and from the airport. The hotel is also on the door step of Chinatown and Paddy's Markets with easy access (walk or bus) to all the other attractions, sites and shopping that Sydney has to offer. The hotel is apparently heritage listed which is evident with much of the period features and original character remaining. A facelift with a splash of colour and perhaps a change to some of the interior decor, fixtures and fittings would provide the Grande touch an old lady deserves. The rooms are quite small, dated and could do with a lick of paint where bags and furniture have scared the walls. The carpet is nearing the end of its life and attention to detail in the housekeeping, particularly the bathroom where mould is evident in some of the tile grouting and base of the glass shower screen. The shower recess is very tight so watch the elbows and hands. Our bed was a king (two singles pushed together) which was reasonably comfortable. The air conditioning worked, the TV (an old style flat screen) functioned correctly the bar fridge kept our drinks cold, the kettle boiled and was clean and there was an iron and ironing board. Compact but satisfactory. Oh! don't expect a view of the Opera House or Harbor Bridge...we had a view to the overhead of diners down stairs, a brick wall and external walkway. Overall there is nothing wrong with this hotel. Reasonably clean, friendly front of house staff, and small but adequate rooms. A respectable 3 star hotel with an affordable tariff by Sydney accommodation standards. As a house guest I did find the $2.00 per bag/day storage fee a little unreasonable but with no where else to store bags while waiting for your room on check in or late departures from the city...you don't have much choice.

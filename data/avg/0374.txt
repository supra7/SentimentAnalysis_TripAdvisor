The hotel was conveniently located, walking distance to all areas of downtown Seattle. The room was a touch on the small side. The bed was comfortable. There was an empty bar fridge included which was nice. Most hotels provide a fridge full of overpriced goods. No complimentary slippers. In downtown Seattle parking is free on Sundays, but the spots are taken up quickly. We stayed Sat & Sun night, we paid $8.00 to park from 6PM to 8PM Sat nite while spots were available. On Sun nite we prepaid $8.00 to park from 8AM to 10AM on Mon. The result was $16.00 to park from 6PM Sat to 10AM Mon. This saved approximately $45.00 in parking. Ask for a room away from the Interstate. Ask for a room on a lower floor (6th), this will allow you to use the complimentary wireless internet provided in the lobby saving $12 or so per day (ask the front desk for the password).

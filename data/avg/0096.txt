This spot really does have a prime location. You are right at the market, hence the name. I was here for the entertainment package at the Triple Door. It was a great price and it included free parking and done by the valet. Nice touch. There was a little bit of a mixup though and things did not go according to plan BUT they did fix it for me later on and that made all the difference. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was really a good size and I liked their amenities as well as the lighted magnifying makeup mirror. There was only 1 nightstand with a lamp though which seemed a little odd. Also, the sound of the aircon was pretty loud so I ended up shutting it off. There was also a strange sound like a whirring of motors that went off and on and was thinking it might have been something coming from the courtyard or maybe the elevators. Not sure if I would stay here again. The Triple Door package is a pretty good deal though so I might still think about that and try it again. Jury is still out.

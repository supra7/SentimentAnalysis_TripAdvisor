The reviews on TripAdvisor are very accurate. If you plan to spend most of your time at the beach and exploring the island, this hotel is perfectly fine. If you are someone who wants to sit by a lavish pool, choose somewhere else. The hotel itself is outdated, but it was clean and functional for what we used it for. The grounds were beautiful and the location is excellent. We didn't use the pool at all. It's very simple, shaped like a whale, not very big, not jacuzzi. Also, I think it's comparable with other hotels, but they hit you with hidden fees every chance they get. If you use the safe, it costs ~$2.5/day. We didn't know this until we got our bill at the end of the week. We explored the other hotels in this area, and next time we'll probably opt to spend a little more and stay at either the Sheraton or Westin. We ate at the restaurant once, only because the service was so terrible. The food was really good, but even though it wasn't crowded when we were there, dinner took around 2-2.5 hours. That's just for appetized and entree. We didn't have dessert or coffee.

We stayed just one night while catching a flight. We requested a top floor away from the highway (a must) but even so, there is still street noise. The hotel charges for wifi which I think is silly since the Marriott property a few blocks away does not. Be advised that this hotel is a very steep walk up hill from Pike's Market. I would not recommend this location for exciting evening restaurants -- for that, I would locate closer to Belltown or down on the waterfront.

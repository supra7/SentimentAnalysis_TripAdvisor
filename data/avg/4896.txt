The lobby of this hotel is nice but their service was not the quality of a Hilton. The best thing from this hotel is the location and just right outside the hotel there is an entrance to the train. The rooms were very small and the hotel as a whole was out dated. If you stay here you don't need a car being that you can walk to where you are going or simply go outside to the trains entrance. Even as a gold member I did not qualify for free internet or breakfast.

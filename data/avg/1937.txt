I stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel with my husband and 4 year old daughter in early March 2008. Here's the good and the bad. Good -The location is wonderful. Right on a beautiful, very long stretch of beach. It was whale season so we could look right off our balcony and see whales cavorting out at sea! Magical! -The grounds are meticulously groomed every day. There are huge lovely shade-giving palm trees all over the property. There are plenty of lawn chairs and picnic tables in which to relax. -There is a nightly free hulu show. It was fun and my daughter loved it. The hotel staff dance in the show and they are very talented. -Go to the welcome breakfast. It gives you a nice overview of what to do on the island. There is zero pressure to buy anything. It is just informative. -It was a decent value for the money. -KONA COFFEE - mmmmmmm! -Walking distance to many restaurants and shops in the Whaler's Village. Bad -The rooms are very average. Nothing special at all. They are worn and dated and ours had only a very small shower stall (no bath tub). The hallways are dingy and there are dirty marks on the walls where luggage or carts have scraped. -The staff is not all that great. Some are friendly, some are not. They all seem to know each other very well and get caught up in personal conversations and can ignore the guests. -The kids passport program was pretty dumb. It really just encouraged my daughter to go into their stores and ask me to buy her things. -The breakfast was just OK. There was a large variety but the food was not so tastey. -The pool area was nothing special. -The Mixed Plate restaurant was not very good. All things considered, I would not stay here again due to the "just averageness" of the hotel. Next time, i will stay at the Sheraton next door or the Alii a few hotels down.

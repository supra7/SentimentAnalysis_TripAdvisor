When we booked our stay here, the resort fee was $15, when we got there it had jumped to $25!!!!!! I dont understand why we have to pay it in the first place. When I go on holiday the last thing I think about is a gym or playing Tennis, I have no need to ring any one locally and I don't read the paper. So what I ask is Why did I have to pay it???? The resort was beautiful, the rooms could do with a revamp, especially new carpet which smelt old and stale. Will visit Maui again but will be looking at somewhere else to stay unless the Hyatt removes the resort fee and renovates the rooms.

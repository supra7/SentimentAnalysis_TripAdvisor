This is a very nice hotel with excellent friendly staff. We were upgraded to a suite when we arrived. The room was great... fantastic even. Unfortunately it shared a corner with the extremely busy firehall next door. Unless you sleep very soundly, expect to be awakened many, many times during the night. Perhaps the rooms on the other side are less noisy. I would definitely stay away in a room as far as possible from the firehall.

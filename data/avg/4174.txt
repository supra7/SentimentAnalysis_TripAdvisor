Attended a 4-day meeting here. The conference staff seem to not know how to feed a crowd of 400 efficiently. The food was good but one had to stand in line and wait a long to be served from the buffet. Most of the breakout meeting rooms are long and skinny, making slides hard to read from the back. The Imperial Ballroom is gorgeous.

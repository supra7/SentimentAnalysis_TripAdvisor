I stayed at the Doubletree Boston (Allston) in September, 2008, and found it to be a well-kept, well-equipped facility, especially for a Hotwire rate of under $100. However, its isolation makes it a challenge. The hotel itself was nicer than I expected, with a renovated lobby and a respected local jazz club in the atrium. The small gym was surprisingly well-equipped and just down the hall were two coin-operated washers and dryers--a great idea. Great little salt-water pool and hot tub. Room service menu was extensive and available until 3 am, and the breakfast buffet, while a little pricey at $17, was good. The Hotwire rate is pretty good for expensive Boston, but Hotwire customers may be a little surprised with what they get -- my room, while well-appointed, was the smallest one on the floor, barely half the size of the other "suite" style rooms. Doubletree are being a little sneaky, giving Hotwire customers the "runts" of the litter. Thankfully it didn't matter to me as a single traveler, but a couple might find it a bit cramped. While the hotel's location next to the Charles River across from Cambridge makes for lovely views of the river (if you're lucky), it's extremely isolated. Across the river you'll find a Whole Foods and a Rite Aid, and jogging/biking trails line the river, but car-free travelers will have to buck up and learn the bus route to the Red Line, because there is nothing, and I mean nothing, within walking distance, other than some sort of train depot and a Harvard lab building, and lots of multi-lane roads. However, hotels in Boston are crazy expensive, and a budget traveler looking for amenities over location can't do much better -- anything in the price range will be a sketchy B&B or something.

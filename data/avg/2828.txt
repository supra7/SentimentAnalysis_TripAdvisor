A totally average hotel experience, all things considered. While it was very clean it was also very cramped. While it was centrally located, it was located near museums and on an expensive shopping street. An hotel on the canals would of course have captured at least some of the essential Amsterdam atmosphere that is found so easily in so many places around the city. The staff were really helpful but all in all, this is an hotel that one would use purely as a dormitory. There is no point in returning to the premises during the day. The best eating, drinking and canal gazing experiences are to be had at least 10 - 15 minutes walk away. Overall, at about 50 Euro each per night for a very cramped triple room it was quite average. You might do better.

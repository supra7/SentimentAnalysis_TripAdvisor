We stayed for 5 nights. We were on the 14th floor the first night with absolutely no view. We moved to the 15th floor the next day and the view was better Bathroom is very small. The staff were not friendly. For the rate we paid, we were expecting better service than this. When we asked about free Internet and breakfast and etc...we were told rudely that we are not elite guests but they never told us how and explaint it to us. We felt that they only care about the elite guests It's a great location but so are many other hotels around it. I won't stay here again

Wow was it a walk everywhere! This hotel is soooooo far from everything! It sucked, especially if you're drunk!! The staff was amazing, especially the bell boys who helped us get a cab almost each night since we couldn't stand walking anymore. Although, it is seriously right across the street from the mall which was pretty cool. The room was sublime. I would stay here again, I just wish it were closer to everything else...

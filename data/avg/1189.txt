As mentioned in many other reviews, the location of The Roosevelt can not be beat. A fair price and location are the only reasons we stay there. The room needed a good cleaning. We walked in the room and immediately saw a very stained carpet. Checked out the bathroom and it too needed a good cleaning. Check in, check out...no problems.

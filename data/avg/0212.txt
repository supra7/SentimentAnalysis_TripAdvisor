Our initial impressions from the outside were good but less impressive once inside. The hotel is showing signs of age and would benefit from upgrading - perhaps starting with new carpets. Our room was small and our daughter had a fold out bed but we had some warning of this when booking and we did book at short notice. The outdoor garden, prominent in photos of the hotel, could also be improved by some investment - better paving and more seating for starters. Good points were the continental breakfast and the free shuttle. The location is also good - a short monorail journey from downtown Seattle.

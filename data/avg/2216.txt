The rooms at the Trump are very spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately the service was the worst we have experienced in a long time. The logistics problem with the Valet and lack of self parking is obviously problematic. The service at the pool/spa is inexcusable. And don't expect any apologies from management or taking responsibility for blatant ignorance. The $15 "resort fee" seems like a pretty good deal until you actually use any of the amenities. We ended up cancelling our plans to stay at the spa and making reservations elsewhere.

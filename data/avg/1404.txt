We spent 2 nights at this hotel. One when we first arrived in Seattle before going on an Alaskan Cruise and a second night immediately following the cruise.We booked both nights through priceline and got a fantastic deal. The rooms were average hotel rooms and were clean. We had a non-smoking room with two double beds (we had requested a king at check-in, but none were available). The beds were relatively comfortable.The staff was curtious upon check out and they kindly gave us directions to drive to Vancouver for our cruise.

I stayed at the Trump International in LV from July 14 to the 17th 2011. To me it seemed over-rated just because of the name Trump.The hotel is the same as any other hotel. There is no difference. The room rates are too exorbitant.They charge you a $20 resort fee even though it is not a resort. They say the resort fee is for the internet, the paper, etc. Internet is standard for many, many hotels and so is the morning paper. Internet and a morning paper should not be a "resort fee". Internet is paid on a monthly basis and is used by employees of the hotel as well. It is a collective charge. It is just another way for Mr. Trump to nickel and dime you to make his "cup run over" and fill his already bulging coffers. Save your money and stay at a Marriott for example, for the same amenities and service

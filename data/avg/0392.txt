hotel was in a good location split between pioneer square and pikes market , still have to walk up the hills though. if that is bothersome for you the trolleys are free in the downtown area!!!!!!!!! room was small but the view was nice and it was clean. breakfast was included, was same day after day so a bit boring. all in all a bit overpriced.

We made our reservations on the Holiday Inn Express site in July after getting tickets to an area concert. Our primary reason for selecting this hotel was because the jacuzzi suite showed available at the same price as a regular room... so we booked it! Once we arrived in the room, we quickly noticed it was not the room we had guaranteed on our reservation. I logged into the website to check the reservation to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and I noticed the email confirmation and the website reservation were COMPLETELY different. I called the front desk and they stated they changed the reservation because the jacuzzi suite should not have shown up for that price and if I wanted to pay another $50 per night, they could move me to the room I originally was guaranteed. Needless to say, we just stayed in this simple room instead since we had lots of activities going on over the weekend. The hotel was basic and nothing really special, but it was clean. Our bathroom door would not shut, but we had no problem throwing down a towel in front of the door to hold it closed for privacy. The area around the hotel completely changes after dark. There were cars continuously going around the hotel two or three at a time and would never get out of their cars. The hotel uses its shuttle van to block one of the entrances to keep unwanted people out. There is a Baby Dolls strip club right across the street. The night guy at the front desk was on his cell phone every time we came in and out of the hotel and the side entrance door was broken (so you have to walk all the way around the dark property at night). Although the room was clean and the only actual problem we had was reservations, I would still not stay at this hotel again. The hotel staff, management, and their nationwide reservation number showed very little care for the situation and offered even less help.

The South Loop Hotel is a perfectly acceptable place to stay, but do not be mislead by reviews that make it seem like a three star or luxury boutique. The location is not particularly close to public transit and cabs are sparse, so it's a bit out of the way. The walk to McCormick place is long, and not one that you'll want to make in the dark or bad weather. The beds are clearly second hand, both beds in my room sagged. The linens were OK. The room was very clean. The hotel was very, very loud - I was woken up by rowdy guests on my floor on both nights (weeknights!) of my stay. However, when I called the desk to report the noise, they responded promptly and politely.

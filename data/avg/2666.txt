The hotel is located away from everything, and you can only get out by taxi or car. I only had a problem with the toilet of my room, that was promptly solved. For the price charged, it offers a very honest service and acceptable quality and it can be a good choice if you are planning to stay for 1 or 2 days (as in my case). If you go to have fun, you better stay in South Beach.

dissapointed and wouldn't stay again We stayed at the Bali Mandira for 7 days during March and would have to say I was very disapointed as had heard good things about it. I've always thought the Madira was targeted towards families so was shocked to rock up and see that there were NO other children and not only that, everyone was about 30 years our senior. I was also very disapointed in our room as I thought we had booked a deluxe room so when I arrived to a small, old 2nd story room, I was not happy jan! I questioned this with the hotel and it was not there fault as I had the room that was booked for me, it was more a problem with the booking company. Also being upstairs was a pain as we had our toddler(which they were previously aware of) with us so lugging a pram up and down was annoying, I asked if we could upgrade or go to a below ground room, and the not very helpful front desk staff said they were full.The breakfast was not great( this is my 5th bali visit so I have tried a few)The other thing is the pool looks like it needs a good clean and renovate( sorry but for apying a lot of money you would think this would be included)Positives:I loved the location of this hotel, the beach is awesome. Cold bintangs for 10,000Rp at Bruno's bar every night was so great and the lovely girls(hi Nancy and Fergie) I wouldn't say to anyone don't stay here, I think it would suit an older crowd and I would definatley reccomend a deluxe room.I just think that it is a bit pricey for what you get and it needs a bit of renovating.

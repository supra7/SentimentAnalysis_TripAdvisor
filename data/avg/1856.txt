stayed here for 4 nights in October. I thought pool and the health spa were fantastic. Breakfast in the Swan Court was excellent but the food in the italian restuarant was a ripoff and the decor in there was very tired. we had to move rooms as the noise of rattling windows and faulty air conditioning was unbearable. We were moved to a much quieter room (unless you include the hours 5- 8 pm when the drums of the in house laui may drive you insane). I have to agree with other reviewers who thought the hotel was just after your money and feel that they really shouldn't be using some of the rooms until they are refurbished if they want to be called a five star hotel. So as i say. Try somewhere else.

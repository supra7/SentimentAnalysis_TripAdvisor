Great location however room was very small, considering what we paid compared to other places we stayed on our 7 week holiday, but reasonable for Roma. Taxi driver could not find place, but we did find it for him. No lift so vitial you have staff take your bags up, as my wife would not carry bags up 3 flights of stairs to Hotel. Staff very friendly and very helpful.

We were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. It was gorgeous, spacious, and cheap ($69 a night on Priceline). A full kitchen, dining area, living room, guest bathroom, master bedroom, and master bath (double shower heads, double sinks, huge Jacuzzi tub). So, we were satisfied with the room. We were on the 44th floor, facing north. We could see the train passing by, and yes, it was loud. It woke both my husband and I, as did police/ambulence sirens 3 times in one night. Though there was no noise at all between rooms/floors. The pool was OK. It was large, 2 hot tubs, really nice lounge furniture, but it was packed. The pool bar has a very limited menu. My biggest problem with the hotel was the lack of restaurants and entertainment. Waking up hung over on a Saturday morning all you want is a cheap, greasy meal like McDonalds (same goes for coming home at 2 am). But there is no fast food anywhere near. In fact, there is one very expensive restaurant and a lobby bar. That's it. It really wasn't that far from the strip. Equivalent to about 3 blocks to the Wynn. Directly across from Fashion Show Mall. I prefer the central strip and a casino however.

Stayed one night in March, 2012. We usually look fro Hilton Garden Inns because we find them clean, friendly and affordable. We use them for both business and personal travel. The Hilton Garden in Miami seems to be the exception to the rule as far as cleanliness is concerned. Carpets were filthy. And I'm not that picky! Staff were helpful and moved us to another room. Same thing. My advice? Ask to see your room first.

Just finished my stay here with my partner and 2 other friends. The location couldn't be better, close to everything you'd want to see and visit in Barcelona. Lots of bars and cafes around too. On the other hand the service was poor, reception staff VERY rude, especially one individual which I managed to find the name 'carmina' she was so rude I couldnt believe it. On another occasion my boyfriend woke in the middle of the night very thirsty so we rang reception and they tried to charge us 12 EUROS for ONE bottle of water, the same brand of water from local shops that was 15 CENTS. I was appalled. The rooms are nice, pool was shut so that was disappointing. Close to the beach, there's a restaurant that no one seems to use. If it hadn't of been for the very rude staff and water incident, I would have enjoyed my stay here much more.

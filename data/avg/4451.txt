Fabulous location. Staff nice. Beds made my back hurt (too soft) and if you are used to a King for two people, a double wont cut it. Had to get a roll away. Asked for and got the roll away and Wi-Fi at no charge, a $40 per day savings. Right across the street from the Prudential and Sheraton, with great food court and shopping. Right next to Summer Shack restaurant. Walking distance (1 block) to the "T" subway. "River view" is to the Charles river but way way off in the distance. OK pool and hot tub. Good weight room. Rooms do get stuffy in winter, as the AC and fans don't run, and too noisy to open window. Pillows were awful. Trolleys pick up and drop off right at hotel entrance.

Nice place to stay when at a convention. Just across the street from the Convention Center, it has all the usual amenities. The rooms are clean and bright. The bed was good, bath adequate. Concierge cordial and professional. However, the price is a bit steep. If it is a business trip, especially a convention where you will be spending little time in the room anyway, OK let the boss pay for it. (It does have an actual business center with computers, printers, and a shipping office.) But if it is your own dime, you may want to shop around and stay at the Roosevelt or the Red Lion, which are nearby for less $$.

I am a frequent traveller so I may be sounding very particular in this review. I arrived in Seattle very late on a Monday night for a conference that started the next morning. The hotel contact me prior to arriving and suggested that I book a car service to get there from the airport, which was a good idea, although maybe $10-15 more than a taxi. Check in service was great. The room not so much. The room was average size. The good is that the view, and I was on the water side, is amazing. The fireplace is a nice touch. I thought the bathroom was above average, but did not match the room at all. The not so good: The furniture and decoration of this room is bizzare and not really nice. The too much furniture is old and worn. Only one phone and has to be moved to be reachable from the bed. There were no less than 3 competing plaid patterns, too much furniture which included a huge 4 poster bed. The tv is oversize for the room. The room is worn, chipped paint, bad scratches on the doors, tired paint. There were stains on the paint in the bathroom. NOT what I expect from anyhotel, let alone one with this kind of a reputation, price and rating. I did eat twice at the restaurant and had great services (except the host) and very good food.

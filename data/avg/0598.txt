The hotel was nice even though it was still under renovations. One thing I noticed right away was that the staff didn't seem happy to be there, but it was friday night and I am sure they all didnt want to be there. I walked into my room not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly suprised. The room was very spacias and the views were nice. The bed was comfortable. I was in RM 1901 - Traditional King. I didnt feel that this hotel was a 4 star, but it was stilla very good 3 - 3.5 star hotel but they charge a 4 star price. I would have not stayed here if I didnt get a steal of a deal on Hotwire. It was close to a lot of shopping and all the stores downtown and only a few blocks from Pike's Public Market. The only incident I had was at 11:15 friday night. I hadnt had anything to eat all night long so I called down to room service and was on hold for 15 minutes listening to music and the same hotel recording. I called down to the front desk and explained the issue and they just connected me to the same line - so after being on hold for another 10 minutes - I just went outside and found some dinner.

Very disapponted with this resort. For the beach- iti s great! Food - very very basic. Yes, 7 restaurant,but... with almost the same menu. Service and staff - could be rated for 2+ stars hotel. The only one who works at this hotel, brings his spirit - Fernando at the beach bar. Rooms: it is OK, but nothing special. If you are planning to go there, be prepared to wait for hot water when you are taking shower at the old design bathroom. New Year night: very boring. Entertanment - same , very boring... not planning to come back. We were comparing this hotel with The Royal Cancun, Excellence Riviera - not even close.

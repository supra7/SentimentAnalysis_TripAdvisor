The service at the hotel is first rate, location is superb. But if you are a businessman or family looking for comfort and space.... this is not for you. The lobby is massive, lush, and well appointed. This image begins to deteriorate when one walks into the cramped elevator, and dips further as musty odours waft you towards your tiny room. I'm sure you can pay for a sitting room and all, but I didn't and the room is so small that you almost have to squeeze by the foot of you bed to get to the bathroom. If you want to watch TV, there is no 'sitting room' style chair even. You either sit on edge of your bed, or lay down and watch it at an angle. Like most 'old lady' hotels (with apologies to any elderly women), the money has been spent in the lobby for those touring it's historical significance vice business style amenities for those staying there. A final kicker - 7$ for a bottle of water in the room - come on!. As with many who travel constantly, please.... book me at the Courtyard Marriot or equivalent next time! Likely cheaper for the company, and more practical!

I travel for business and spend a lot of nights in Marriotts. I have a definite idea of what to expect from a Marriott property and this property meets but does not exceed those standards. However, opinions are subjective as I overheard other travelers raving about the rooms and the breakfast buffet. These were families with children and not adult only travelers. The rooms are very standard small "suites" with basic hotel furnishings and a decent bed. There are two flat screens but the reception was fuzzy. If you need to be in this area the Marriott Suites is a decent choice but for a few dollars more I found the Renaissance across the street to be superior to this property. Overall, a clean average property but nothing to get excited about.

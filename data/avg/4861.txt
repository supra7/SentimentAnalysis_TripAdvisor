I had to stay there for a conference. The room was quite small and the interior dated. Neither the room or the bathroom were very clean. Very dusty ...and under the bed and found till receipts from previous occupants!!! NO wireless internet in the room. On the plus side, the location is excellent and around the hotel there are lots of lovely coffee shops and restaurants.

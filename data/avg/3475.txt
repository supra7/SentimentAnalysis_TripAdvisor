I stayed here for four nights a couple of weeks ago and was glad to find quite a decent place at a decent rate. London is an horrifically expensive place to stay in, the price quoted for Holiday Inn or Travelodge was twice the price of this hotel. All I want when I visit London is a place to stay that is clean and quiet and at a reasonable price. I am not looking for frills as I am out visiting relatives and enjoying what London has to offer. The hotel has obviously had a make-over to make it appear more modern looking. The room had a larger than kingsize bed which was a bit firmer than what I normally like, the pillows very flat but I suppose you could request more, and the sheets were clean and of good quality cotton. The room also had a TV which worked, a mirrored table with hairdryer - most important, and a shower stall which though had DIY repairs of the tiles was clean as clean, with a shower head which had plenty of pressure. Also included were cheap but useable hair & body liquid sachets along with soap, and plenty of spare toilet rolls in under sink cupboard. It also had a fridge (unstocked) which annoyed me with its noise, but that was easily remedied by switching it off at the wall. The staff were friendly. I didn't have breakfast as I took that elsewhere. The hotel is only a ten minute walk from Kentish Town tube and two mainline stations. This place ticked most of the boxes for me and I will certainly stay there again.

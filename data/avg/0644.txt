This isn't the nicest hotel ever, but I got a very low price and it got the job done just fine. Pros: The location is excellent, in downtown, just a block away from a major shopping street and within walking distance of much of downtown Seattle. The staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant/bar is very cozy (fireplace), with friendly service and good food (I'm actually writing this from the bar now!). My room was a decent size and everything in it was fine, if not exciting. Cons: My entire floor had a bad smell, that permeated the room. I got used to it so it wasn't a huge problem, but you'd rather not have it. The walls were also very thin which creates a noise problem. I heard every room's TV from the hallway. More important, when the person above me moved around at night, the noises through the ceiling kept me awake. Might not bother a better sleeper but it was a problem for me.

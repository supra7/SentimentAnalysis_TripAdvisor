This is located about 1-2 blocks from the Space Needle and I think what they call the Science Center with various museums as well as one end of their monorail. Good things: Off street parking (not secured), very efficient checking, AND one of the better free breakfast services for a hotel. I gotta chirp about the latter since I need a good breakfast. They have juice, coffee, and milk. They have free waffles. They had free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. Wow,..since when do you get free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. They also had cereal, yogurt, and fruit. They also had a small pool which wasn't good for much more than taking a dip to get the grime off after running around Seattle. Note: the mention of a restaurant only pertains to their free breakfast area. Bad things: The carpets were a bit on the nasty side, especially in the hallways. They really need to replace them, though they're worn probably due to all the traffic. I think a lot of people stay here for the location to the primary Seattle attractions at the needle and center. Kind of a cheap shower (though hot) and bathroom area though the beds were comfy enough. All this said,..a bit over-priced, but I'd consider staying here again, mainly for the free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. Good location to the bigger Seattle attractions including the various pier areas (great seafood,.yum yum), the monorail to downtown (i.e., stay here, take a monorail to the city center is pretty cheap), Pike's place (you have to see this area; yum yum sea food, all kinds of shops, tons of beautiful people, the original Starbucks). Note that the Seattle area can seem to be a bit seedy, however, do note that this is a BIG, port city so you have to expect this. Very safe during the days. I'd be a bit careful walking around at night though.

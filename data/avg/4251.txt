Check-in was great. Fiendly and efficient. I had originally booked a standard room. Check-in desk advised that these rooms were very small and that as I was staying for six nights they could offer me upgrade to a King jnr suite for a reasonable additional fee which I accepted. This additional fee included free breakfast, free wifi, free bottled water in the room etc. All sounded great. The King jnr Suite ... was TINY. No room to swing a cat. I shudder to think what my standard room would have been like. The condition of the room was poor, almost run down. Bed was big and very comfortable. Free internet was an irritation as it was only provided by plugging into the ethernet port on the tiny desk squashed into the corner. I eventually went to Bestbuy and bought a $20 wifi access point so I could work from my bed. The location was great. Easy access and walking distance to most areas of interest. Restaurant in the hotel were very average and expensive. Eating outside of the hotel was much better and cheaper. Would I stay there again ? NO. The rooms really are too small, too old and too run down. At those prices there are definately more modern / better facilities in a similar location.

The sense you get from the Hotel Lawrence is of a hotel really trying to be warm and elegant -- and almost succeeding. The lobby and rooms are lovely and tasteful (my room on the 6th floor was renovated nicely). It is an older hotel, so you can't expect palatial rooms -- thank goodness it is not a glass rabbit warren like so many modern hotels. The location is terrific. You can walk to the convention center and DART is half a block away. You don't need a car. The front desk folk are all very kind. They hired for me a superb driver for the trip to the airport and had suggestions for running routes and restaurants. And now for some "howevers": The front desk folk are not always up-to-date on information: They recommended a restaurant that had since closed (the replacement restaurant in its spot was perfect, though); little things in the room did not work (a desk lamp; the t.v. remote) -- but I didn't bother asking for repairs since I didn't need them. The continental breakfast, while abundant, does not meet their standard for elegance -- lots of pasty, white carbohydrates, canned fruit, and styrofoam cups. More healthy and more green-aware would be nice. They do serve great coffee, and there is a restaurant on the first floor. Their workout facilities are a joke, but they are located an easy jog from the Katy Trail (again, the front desk not too up-to-date on the status of the trail -- it's finished and fine!). My room was very clean, although a tad more attention to things like scuff marks and the elevator carpet would push this hotel into the hidden gem category.

5 days here (honeymoon) IT WASN'T VERY EXPENSIVE :)) I like the hotel, the design, the style... it's very small, but original... rooms are small too, but you have everything you need. it's not nearest to the centar and it is not connected with transport to the termini station. it's not very easy to be found (i was walking around for one hour from the train station to find it) but it was late night. It is in a loud part of Rome (tram passing near) but with the trams and buses, you can get almost everywhere (#3 to Colosseum and antic rome, #19 to Vatican) breakfast was OK, they prepare me the best coffee in italy

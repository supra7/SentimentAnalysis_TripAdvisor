Stayed at the Fairmont for several days during our transition from one condo to another here in town. The hotel is in a central location. Easy reach of the T... Or just walk to where you need to go. My partner and I booked a Fairmont Room for $289 a night which we felt was reasonable for Boston. Our room was rather small, but typical of a city hotel. Furnishings were definitely showing their age and the carpeting was quite strained. As others mentioned, our view was of a dank interior "courtyard" which offered little privacy. All in all, the room was fine, but seemed to miss the mark of what we expected. As we were relocating we opted to splurge on room service breakfast each morning. Basically, the menu offered typical generic hotel fare at a premium price. Again, the food and service were basically fine, but not exceptional. One complaint that we did have was with the fact that we were told by Reservations that the hotel had a nice workout facility. This was not the case. The workout facility was comprised of a small, poorly ventilated fitness room with outdated equipment. Also, it is worth mentioning that the hotel does not have a swimming pool or spa services. On several occasions we ventured to the Oak Bar for a change of scenery as the weather was not cooperating. Again, the service and apps that we had were fine, but off the mark. Menu was rather uninspired, especially in a city with so many amazing places to eat. Service was adequate and they got the job done. For the price, expected more. Tip: Venture to the Franklin Cafe in South Boston... worth the taxi ride over. On the whole, a nice hotel in a great location, but I know that there are better in Boston.

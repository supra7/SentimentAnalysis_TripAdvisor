Went to Boston for an overnight adventure... booze cruise, dinner in the North End, & bar-hopping. We made reservations at the Sheraton... upon arrival, we were notified that they had over-booked and they were wondering if we'd consider a bump to another hotel. They offered us something across the river in Cambridge... we declined because that would screw with our bar-hopping plans. She then offered us the Park Plaza... I knew it was an old hotel... hell, it was old when my grandmother took me there for tea MANY years ago... but the offer included a full refund of our room charge at the Sheraton ($300) and they would pick up the room at the Plaza. Anywhoo - we took the bump. It was a good choice... even though it's an older hotel, it has so much charm and class. The lobby is something out of a Audrey Hepburn film... beautiful marble and gold-leaf. The staff was very friendly. We stayed on the 14th floor... apparently with a large group of hippies... the hallway smelled very "herbal". ;) The room was very clean and had a nice view. Never turned on the TV, but it was a bit of a relic. Not a fan of the air conditioner... it sounded like a plane taking off every time it came on. Good shower... liked the water pressure. And lastly, make sure you go have breakfast somewhere else... the food was good, but not good enough for the price... I'm not Rachel Ray, but I make just as good a breakfast.

We had a lovely stay at the Paia Inn - we booked here a few nights for our honeymoon following the raving TripAdvisor reviews. We had a great time, but when I left I felt that the Paia Inn somewhat under delivered considering its price tag. The Pro's: -The staff: very helpful, attentive and friendly. -Decoration of the rooms: very stylish -Location: town Paia is strategically located, close by the airport, on the road to Hana, next to the beach. The beach on the north shore is famous for surfing. Paia is a fun town with quaint eateries, like the organic pizzeria next door. -Some reviews mentioned noisy rooms - I did not experience any issues with that at all. The Con's: -The weather on the north shore can be prone to more rain outside the summer -Value: our Deluxe room was not overly large, I would estimate 250 sq ft. Just enough room for 1 shower - not a bath. Remember Maui has the highest room rates of Hawaii, but for $270/night (incl tax) the room did not live up to my expectation. As the photo's on the hotel website show, the deluxe room is set in a wooden unit that has sort of a "wooden shed" look and feel to it - I did not like the wooden panels on the walls and ceiling personally. -There are 8 parking spots (free parking) for 15 rooms which sometimes means you'll have to look for streets side parking - not a huge issue. Overall I think the hotel was good - but I don't think it lives up to it's price tag.

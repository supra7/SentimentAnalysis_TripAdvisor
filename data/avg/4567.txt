For the price I paid (through priceline), it's a decent stay. Good location, close to Downtown Crossing, China Town and the Theatre District. The front desk is trying to be helpful but not very efficient. I called to ask for a room change due to a strong cigarette smell (I asked for a nonsmoking room). I told them I was ready to switch right away, I waited for 20 min and no one came to bring me the new room key. I finally had to go down stairs to get it. Room is clean and good size. My favorite part is the swimming pool, it's a nice one that you can actually swim laps.

Just spent three nights with my husband at this hotel. Great location, clean and very hot water in the shower (although it was snowing and we had freezing temperatures). I loved the fact that it is very close to the tunel station and to shishane metro station and that in 3 mins you can be having coffee/walk/ice cream or visit a modern gallery in Istikhal. Can be really noisy at night (we were woken up by fights, shouting and broken glass and quite loud music from the bars) and it is quite small (especially the bathroom) so, if you are big or have big suitcases avoid it. They are aware of the problem with the noise and they provided us with earplugs when we asked for them. Breakfast was good and the service ok but think that the people at the reception could be a bit more helpful - answered our questions with yes or no. I am not sure if I would go there again.

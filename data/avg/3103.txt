getting there we left the hotel Dec.5 after a 1 week stay,this hotel was not ready for guests,we had to be moved once but there were a lot of people worse off than us. I can tell u that it will be some resort when finished.one thing the staff can start working on is eliminating the BS we were lied to many times about many things.the location is great,the people were great(for the most part) the food got better each day and the buffet is fabulous.The pools are all over the place but are ice cold, didn't see many people using them the ocean is much warmer and a great beach for walking.

This motel was in a very convenient location & not on the main drag. Never had problems getting in or out. Rooms were spacious & clean with microwave & fridge no extras such as shampoo or lotion, etc though. We stayed in a double queen room lower level. Room was out dated & needed slight repairs (wallpaper peeling from walls, stained tub from age) nothing unreasonable though. Still was clean & comfortable. Breakfast could be improved was cold & just warmed up in microwave it seemed. Staff was friendly though & check in was fairly quick. For the price & location would be willing to stay again.

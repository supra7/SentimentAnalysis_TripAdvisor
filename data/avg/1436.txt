This hotel, whilest being perfectly acceptable and very good value for money in relation to the standard of the qooms, is not what anyone would consider to be in 'Mitte'. It is quite far from the centre of Berlin and although the underground is easy to use, the hotel is situated quite some distance from the nearest station and the area surrounding the hotel is not ideal, to say the least. The hotel itself was a pleasant suprise. No problems with the rooms which were clean and comfortable, but the bar shuts at whatever time the staff decide; irrespective of the time displayed and no amount of cajoling the (still in attendance) barman or the front of house staff could persuade them to serve us drinks even though we had arrived before the advertised closing time. This happened on several occasions during our stay and all the consierge said was 'would you like to complain'?! There is a bank of vending machines which serve snacks and extortionately priced drinks (can, bottles etc) but room service ends early so late travellers will be disappointed. All in all, if you are looking for a hotel with very reasonable rates for good rooms, basic service and you do not mind being quite remote from the centre of Berlin, this hotel will serve you well.

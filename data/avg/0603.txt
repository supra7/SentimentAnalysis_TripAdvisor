I stayed here for a conference in March 2007, and even with the "special" conference rate, my 2-night stay was nearly $500. The room was what you'd expect at a Sheraton. The hotel is in the middle of a major remodel, so if you really want luxury I'd pick another one (maybe the W). But in its favor, the hotel was posh and very well located.

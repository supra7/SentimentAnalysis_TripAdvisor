I've used Priceline before to book hotels for Seattle, but in this instance, and like all others, I wanted something right downtown, close to everything. While the Renaissance is considered "downtown" it's kinda a reach to say so, it's right on the end and literally right on the highway. So if you're hoping to do a little shopping downtown expect to either cab it back to the hotel or walk quite a few blocks with bags in your hands. The hotel has been renovated beautifully, the lobby is gorgeous, even the rooms have been renovated nicely..but there's one thing I wouldn't have thought of prior to staying here, and that I've never ever experienced in a hotel in Seattle before. The building is built on springs....I believe for the sake of earthquakes etc. which isn't a problem other than you will hear the ear piercing, and CONSTANT sound of the building swaying and screeching throughout the night with the same rhythm as the wind. After trying to figure out this noise for about 3 hours..we finally called the front desk and they explained all of the above, of course there isn't much they can do about the construction of the building which is understandible, but she kindly offered us earplugs, which we used and finally slept through the remainder of the evening. This also helped drown out the noise of the highway traffic. On a positive note, there are some great restaurants within a nice walk from the hotel, we enjoyed a beautiful dinner at Elliot's on the pier and were able to walk there. The staff were quite nice, the security out front was more than accomodating and offered us directions and an umbrella. It's a nice hotel, that they are definately doing their best with it, but it is older, and the location didn't fit our needs this time around, but for quick accomodations right off the highway on a not so windy day may be worth it.

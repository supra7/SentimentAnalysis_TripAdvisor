Stayed in City Park for a couple of nights before joining a cruise. Reception and restaurant staff were pleasant and helpful. Breakfast OK - nothing special. Location is very close to Sants Metro Station - 15 minutes or so into central Barcelona. Had some difficulty one night getting back to hotel as taxi driver didn't know where it was but he dropped us off at the Metro station. Speaking to other guests, rooms are very variable in quality. Our room (515) was very small with double bed pushed into corner of room to create space to move around room - bathroom was almost as large! Window looking onto concrete wall. Wallpaper peeling off and carpets grubby. Other guests had larger rooms although those at front were woken by refuse collectors in middle of night.

I just finished spending 6 nights at the Hyatt and I was a little disappointed. This is a fantastic property. It was definitely kid friendly with a fantastic pool , waterslide, waterfalls, etc. It was also a place for couples with all kinds of romantic backdrops and places for some private time. However, the service in a majority of the areas of the hotel was awful. There were few places where you were greeted with a smile and an aloha. The Swan Court restaurant was a fiasco for breakfast in the morning- understaffed, could not get service. The Paradise Cafe and the service poolside made you want to get up and go purchase your own drinks or food. This is a four star hotel without a doubt, but you expect 4 star service and a friendly attitude , this was a one star in those regards. Sorry Sincerely, East coast family

Slightly pretentious, not all reception staff were friendly and outgoing; as I checked out the guy on reception was fingering his finger ring all nonchalant like and uninterested. Our room was very clean, however the heating/ cooling was noisy and sensitive. Set to 21c it was constantly turning on and off nosily through the night. Just a niggle, enough to annoy but not enough to push anyone into one of the older hotels in town! Breakfast a great touch, again some staff were friendly, others looked down their nose at their customers. "Free internet" throughout the hotel shouldn't be exceptional but in Chicago it is and the Dana is to be complimented on this too. Never used the Spa, couldn't be bothered - it's prohibitively expensive compared to other hotel spa facilities and some really good day spas in town. If I had to go back to Chicago I'd stay there but only because I already know how mundane the alternative is...

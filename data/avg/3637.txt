I stayed for 5 nights while in Dallas for a conference. I decided to skip the conference hotel in downtown to save some money to pay for a rental car and more. First impressions weren't great, as the hotel seemed to attract some undesirables in the parking lot. Checkin was good, though, and my room was clean and comfortable. The whole place is well worn but other than a leaky shower head, everything was in working condition at least. There were a few problems. My room overlooked Interstate 35E and there was plenty of road noise. That usually wasn't a problem but once in a while a large truck would go by in the night and wake me up. Most of the problematic noise came from within the hotel. There were either a lot of noisy guests or the hotel's walls allow way too much noise to go from room to room. The plumbing was also especially loud. I definitely knew when my neighbors were using water. The wireless Internet was not very good. Very slow at times, but at least it didn't drop me. My final complaint is minor, about the breakfast. It was OK for one or two nights, but there's no variety on the hot items day to day. But I assume most people don't stay long enough to care about that.

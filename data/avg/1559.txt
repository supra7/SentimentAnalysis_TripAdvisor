This is a great hotel. It's clean, the location is unbeatable, and the room we had was huge with a great view of some of the Harbor. You can walk everywhere. This was a treat for us, because although we live in Baltimore, we decided to make a little vacation out of it, stay downtown, eat at our favorite Italian restaurant, and enjoy walking around. The front desk personnel at check weren't the most friendly. There were two lines--one for HGI and one for Homewood Suites--however, I saw a sign for Hilton Honors members and walked up to the desk, not realizing that the sign was on both sides for both hotels. I walked up, said I had a reservation for HGI and was told I was in the wrong line. I pointed to the sign for Honors and he said, "yes, it's for Honors members." I told him I that I was a member and he said curtly, "well, it will take me some time, but I can probably log in to the HGI system." I stepped back into the other line. The bed was nice; however, in the middle of the night I woke up and it felt like I was sleeping in a bathtub. The adjustable firmness was not firm at all, so my husband switched with me and we tossed and turned. At check out, when asked if everything was okay, I told her that it wasn't. The mattress was on one side was not firm, even though we had adjusted the dial to as firm as it could go, and that we felt like we were sleeping in a bathtub. She told me that she wished she could do something, like a free dinner or breakfast, but "the bill had already gone through." I didn't know what that meant and I didn't feel like arguing, so I will wait for my Hilton Honors survey. Please keep in mind that this was just a fluke with the bed. Had I noticed it earlier and not in the middle of the night, I gladly would have called the front desk to be moved. However, i wasn't going to do that at 2:00am, pack up, and change rooms. I would stay here again, but I would check the mattress first to make sure that it's firm.

"We're a convention hotel," the guy checking me in told me. As one of the few non convention goers at the Westin that night I was given a 37th floor room with a great view. It took at least 10 minutes to make it up there when I did it sounded like there were 5 or 6 screaming children in the next room. At 9pm my boyfriend and I were conversing at normal volume when we heard a knock at the door. It was security, requesting that we quiet down. I immediately called Service Express and requested a room change which they said was fine. However, once downstairs it turned into a huge ordeal and after waiting in the lobby for over an hour we were sent up to a lower room in the South Tower with no view. When we got up there our keys didn't work and after calling the front desk (they told us security would be right up) we sat outside the room for another hour before being let in and still not given a working key. The hotel gave us a $50 voucher for room service an said our PayPer View would be free. However, they ended up charging me for everything a week later. It does seem like it would be a great place to attend a convention, though, and the pool and hot tub are quite nice if you make it there before the throngs of children. I, however, will never stay there again.

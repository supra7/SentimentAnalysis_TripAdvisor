I booked the hotel considering its location very close to Istiklal street and good reviews on tripadvisor and relatively cheaper price. However, the rooms are extremely small and you can hear the music from night clubs and bars which are on both sides of the hotel till early morning. The "superior" rooms are the most "inferior" rooms in the hotel. To reach the bed, one needs to pass through the bathroom. Wash basin is at the entrace of the room (right) and toiled on the left. We could not open our suitcases unless we kept it on the bed as there was no room otherwise. The beds are very uncomfortable. Corridors noisy too. However, the reason for not giving a very poor rating to the hotel is their service. Staff was friendly and attentive.

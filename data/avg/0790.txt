Worn carpet and furnishings, loud hall and room noise and minor service problems mean that I probably won't return. I get it, they are remodeling. I couldn't tell based on my North Tower room and elevator but I gather it will be nice at completion. If anything, please focus on limiting the intrusion of noise from the hall and adjoining rooms. I really don't want to be up late hearing folks returning from a night out or continuing the party inside. While I wasn't placed in the best available room (SPG Plat), my 44th floor view was panoramic even sans Space Needle and Puget Sound. The location is fine and the operator (Service Express) was helpful and friendly. First off, the internet connection did not work and I spent quite some time with tech support to sort that out. Second, I requested a morning wake-up call and answered the phone when it rang. I didn't pick up a follow-up call as I exited the shower. Shortly thereafter, a security guard knocked on the door and then tried to open it and was stopped by the bolt. Hey, I wanted a call, not a personal rousting. Within 10 more minutes somebody else knocked to pick up a room service table. I didn't have one but I did have a 'Quiet Please' tag on the door to no avail. Finally, the video checkout system did not work very well. I stayed at several different hotels on this trip and typically enjoy the Westin brand. Not this time; the Westin Seattle was by far the worst of the bunch and did not come close to meeting my expectations. I'll look elsewhere on my next Seattle trip - hopefully there will be less snow!

First of all, as I write this, this same hotel is listed twice on TripAdvisor: both (here) as "Hyatt Place Wolfchase Galleria" and also as "Hyatt Place Memphis/Wolfchase Galleria". Read both listings. The most important thing I can tell you is that I would rate this Hyatt Place (and others) as "4" (excellent) for a business traveler or single person or maybe even for two people traveling light. But I would rate it as a "2+" (inadequate) for families or a couple not traveling light. It seems designed for single or business travelers. There is beautiful contemporary decor; a comfortable bed; a big screen plasma TV; an adequate complementary continental breakfast; 2 fast PC's & a printer in the business center; pleasant lounge; & wireless acess in the room worked fine. However, my husband and I arrived for a 3-day stay with lots of luggage and hanging clothes for several weeks on the road. And, we did not want to leave all our belongings in the car. There were only 3 smallish drawers in our room and a tiny closet. There were no luggage racks in the room or available at all per the desk clerk. So we climbed over suitcases stacked up on the floor for 3 days. The bathroom was extremely small -- with the bath mat on the floor, you can't open the bathroom door. Pillows on the king-sized bed were small. There was no way to leave a light on in the bathroom at night without glare in the mirror or leaving the fan on. A/C was really close to the bed. Room cramped. Fridge did not have any freezer compartment. No micro. Oh yes, don't plan to sleep in -- trash truck empties multiple dumpsters at 6:00 am. The swimming pool was not open even though it was mid-late May, it was hot, and other places we had stayed earlier in the month (St. Louis & Nashville) had pools open. I would not stay in any Hyatt Place on leisure again or if staying more than a day or two. I would gladly stay there again if alone on business for a limited time.

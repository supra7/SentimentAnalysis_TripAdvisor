As we read a lot of reviews we were a little bit sceptic about this hotel. The hotel has 2 buildings, very nice entrance and lobby. We were in the other building which is renovated recently. Our room was on the top floor, the stairs are very narrow. The room is a bit smaller, i guess that's normal for london, we had a key card, LCD TV, elec. kettle, few instant coffe's, tea, sugar and 2 sandwiches in the mini-bar (All you need for London stay i guess). In this building you can't hear anything from the outside (as many of you review'd). Brakfast is not so rich, toast's, cheese, ham, coffe, juice, butter, marmelade, for me and my wife enough. The hotel is 3 bus stations from Camden Town Tube, the buses go every few minutes. Hotel is ideal for those who spend their day sightseeing and don't want to pay a full load of money. Worth every penny.

Stayed at the Crown Plaza Changi airport as a convenience due to onward travel. The hotel has a 5 star rating however when we checked in they downgraded the type of room we had paid for using the excuse they were heavily booked. I raised the issue with reception to no avail as we found out when we got into the rooms. Instead of providing 2 x twin rooms with twin double beds as booked and paid for they downgraded us to 2 small rooms with one bed and then tried to add a roll out bed. It was impossible to move the room with the additional bed. After complaining to housekeeping they organized their manager to look into the problem. I accepted 1 x twin room and I double room in the end. Paul the duty manager that finally assisted us confirmed that they were heavily booked hence the issue and conceded that it was not the customers problem but the hotels for overbooking. I had arranged the holiday for my family and was therefore embarrassed by the bedding outcomes by this hotel.

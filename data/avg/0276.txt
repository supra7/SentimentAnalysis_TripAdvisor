We're from South Africa and stayed here for a night before cruising to Alaska. OK, on the positive side, the rooms were large, staff friendly, and we got an early check-in. Plus it really was cheap. It was clean, and one could easily walk down to Pike Market- about 4 or 5 blocks. So pretty convenient for one night. On the downside I have to say it really is very basic. Bed and Tv, that's it. And the surrounding area shuts down real early as there's nothing around it. So to get a bite you'd better leave early or alternatively be prepared to travel! But for a single night? Just fine.

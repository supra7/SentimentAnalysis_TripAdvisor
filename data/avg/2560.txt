We booked a double room some months back for New Years Eve and paid full flexible rate. We have stayed in a few Travelodges before so knew what to expect. Basic but clean room, helpful staff. We just needed a bed for the night which was conveniently located and we could get back to at 4am with no problem. Location was perfect, right outside Euston station with shops around and a 10 mins walk from KOKO in Camden. I had read reviews about the traffic noise so asked for and got a room on the 3rd floor at the rear so we had no problem with noise. Also it seems there was a problem with the heating reported on here before but it was fine when we stayed. We had no TV though and oddly the kettle had no lead, but the lead was supplied on request. We were not staying long so the lack of TV wasn't an issue for us. Bed (as usual in Travelodges) was too soft for us, wish they were as good as Premier Inn on this front. All in all though, we wanted a clean no frills place to crash on NYE in central London and that is what we got.

On other reviews of this hotel, noboby saw fit to mention that this hotel is gay-friendly and frequented by gays. During check-in, we were treated to lesbians necking on the couch in the lobby. We were unprepared for this and it made our stay uncomfortable. The crowning touch was the "intimacy kit" placed in each room: 2 condoms and lubricating gel!! The decor is very modern with photo murals on the corridor walls and the room entry doors. Room decor is modern and attractive. Rooms are small (but functional), due to the fact that this is a renovated older building. The hotel location is great for touring the downtown and getting on the monorail to the Space Needle. An adequate, reasonably-priced hotel, but we never ever felt comfortable.

Stayed at the "W" in Seattle for 2 nights to compare to other Starwood properties. I found the hotel very average for the following reasons: 1). hotel lobby poorly designed (you have to navigate around guests checking in to reach elevators) 2). front counter check-in person did not advertise any hotel amenities when checking in 3). no signage at front desk for VIP/starwood members, front counter staff always having to ask if anyone is in line to jump ahead 4). hotel floors so dimly lit you can barely make out room direction signs 5). so called "fabulous rooms" have three tiny drawers to put clothes While these were fairly minor details (did not ruin our stay in Seattle), I thought I would pass these along to the general manager. I sent an email indicating that for value, I did not beleive the "W" provided the "WOW" factor for the price I was spending. I indicated that I would welcome any feedback or any recommendations for future stays in Seattle (hint hint nudge nudge indicating that I would give "W" another chance). I received an email from guest relations apologizing for the inconvenience and offering 5000 starwood points. Well on the positive, they did offer some time of compensation. However, I was quite surprised they didn't want us to return. So much for the "WOW" factor.

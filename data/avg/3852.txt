I knew there was no A/C in this hotel, but it was about 85 degrees the 3 days I was in Seattle. My window faced the busy 3rd Ave, so during the day it was quite noisy, but at night it wasn't too bad. Room was very clean, staff was friendly and informative. Don't worry about the neighborhood, just be vigilant as you should be in any city. Great location in relation to transit, restaurants, Space Needle, downtown, & waterfront.

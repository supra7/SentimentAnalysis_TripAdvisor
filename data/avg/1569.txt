Stayed at this establishment for nearly a week for meetings in town. Great location- close proximity to Camden, Harbor, etc. Besides the service, this is a decent hotel. From the front desk staff to the sales and catering staff, it was a huge disappointment overall. If you're looking for a sense of urgency or to be made to feel welcome, may want to try a different hotel (and after spending that much time in B-more, you may want to try a different city altogether). The bonuses were a spacious room, great amenities, and a wonderful workout facility (which was actually an independent club), which almost offset the treatment we received as a group at this hotel.

I was there during the NCAA final four. The hotel was decent...3 stars. The room was clean and spacious, but the shower didn't work that well. They kept saying they would send someone up, but they never did. Breakfast was good...with lots of choices from cereal, yogurt to eggs, french toast. We were close to the superdome (easy walk about 6 blocks). We were about a 10 minute walk to the French quarter. The staff was friendly and willing to help, offer directions despite being quite busy. The only negative was there a good bit of homeless people hanging out within a block, but I think that's pretty common for Canal St. There was a significant police presence which was nice. Taxi cab drivers were a little shady- careful with that. All in all a very good experience- the people in New Orleans are very nice and welcoming.

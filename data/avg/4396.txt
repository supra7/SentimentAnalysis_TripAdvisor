All in all, a nice night at the hotel. Rooms were good size, enough elevators for the size of the hotel. Bathroom was fine, was good to have kitchenette/microwave area. Looks like updated recently with new tvs, etc. So if you need a night in boston with a suites arrangement and do not want to stay in Back Bay, a good alternative. Didn't have any mice experiences like what I read recently ( were on 14th floor) Biggest sticking point is parking (tights spaces, pricey $35/night, up $5 from last year). Seems like they want to lure you out of the Back Bay with decent room rate but you're going to end up giving it back for parking, etc.) Unfortunately, cookies were not offered on check in, had to go back down to request them.

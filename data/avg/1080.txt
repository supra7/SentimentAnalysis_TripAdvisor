The rooms and facilities are fine and actually quite spacious, but the problem is the size of the hotel (c. 18 -20 floors and 20-30 rooms per floor at least) which justs make you feel like a cog that passes through without touching the side. Bit of a mixed metaphor I know, but if you like 40-60 room boutique hotels you will know what I mean. All the staff were friendly and helpful, just never saw the same one twice. Good sized gym and location also a plus. Few issues 1. the water they leave at the side of your bed is not complimentary (there should be a label telling you this), it is an eye watering c.$12 after tax are added 2. in room internet is like $15 plus and is not even free in the business centre - this in the homeland of Microsoft 3. food trays seemed to get left outside of rooms for a long time. As I say nothing major wrong - just too big for my taste.

good location in down town short walk to Pike place and seattle center. We stayed here for two nights Feb. 18-19 with our two small children under 5. The hotel has a bad small to it when you walk in. The staff is very nice and rooms are clean but the hotel is an older one, the rooms are not as nice so seen in the pics also the bathrooms only have showers no baths at lease the room we stayed in didnt. The beds are ok, not that great & they are small for two adutls. The coffee in the room is really good. The people who stay in the hotel are mainly young adults and college students. The hotel is very loud all night long. On the back side of the hotel is strip club so you hear the music til very late in the night. (If I would of know this we wouldnt of stayed because of the strip club due to small children) We went to buy a fan to keep the noise down because of the kids. People were in and out of the rooms and hall way on our floor so that made the noise louder. We paid $212 for both nights with $15 parking each night, which is crazy because we are already paying to stay in the hotel. I wasnt happy. We will not stay in the hotel again due to the fact of the noise with the kids but if you are alone or with a spouse it could be great. Also a car was broken into the last night we were there, so keep everything of value with you in your room!

I stayed at the Wyndam for 4 nights, and while the staff are friendly and obliging, and the beds are comfortable, the standard of cleanliness is not up to scratch. While my room wasn't filthy by any means, it wasn't clean enough for my liking. When one my my earrings fell off the night stand and onto the floor between the night stand and the bed I was horrified to see how dirty the carpet was, it didn't look like it had been vacuumed for several weeks, it was so dirty that I threw my earring out. The bathroom was cleaned each day, but not thoroughly. On the upside the hotel has free wifi, and is in a good location, only about 15 minutes walk from Madison Square Garden, Times Square, and the Empire State Building.

We chose the Embassy Suites for a weekend family get-together, as we had our grown son along with us. When we checked in, I discovered that the in-room coffee hadn't been replenished, and when I called, the front desk immediately sent up a very apologetic housekeeper, but I had to ask a couple of times for enough cups. The Embassy seems to favour the one-cup coffeemakers, which I've always found tetchy to operate, and we were given pods enough for only one cup each, which seems a bit chintzy, though there's plenty in the downstairs breakfast area. The Embassy also charges $10 for parking, which I find to be excessively nickel-and-dime outside of the downtown core. Hallways can be noisy for those sleeping on the hide-a-bed, and my son tossed and turned all night.

We stayed in this hotel in february and was delighted but this time(August), we nearly regret it. We booked like a month ago, and on check in got only single bed instead of queen one; apparently only given on availability. The good thing is that eventhough it was was early, we got out room. .... A super tiny room, i think the 712 was the left over space but still need to fit in a room to maximise the hotel. The shower cubicle had curtain instead of door, just give you the impression of the those really really cheap hotel on the street, the shower head holder was broken and fixed by amateur with a rusty screw, but still not holding the shower head at all(they fixed it properly when complained tho), the curtain was useless. A huge lack of ammenities and since we stayed there before, we asked for them and the obvious reply, we do not provide this,(not sure if that was the training buzz word) to get rid of you. The next day, we took the shuttle bus to orchard road, took us 55 mins to get there, a trip worth 20-30 mins. The driver has decided to please one of the customer who was leaving by going all the way to bugis just for them. So we had to rush to get something to eat off orchard and took a taxi to get to my medical appointment. The best was 4am in the morning, bang bang, our door just broke opened and new client getting in our room, the security lock broke until my gf shouted. 5 mins later when trying to get back to sleep, the receptionist to appology. Anyway.... next day, talked to the manager, she really catch up, good service recovery. Upgraded us to business room, with a fruit basket and even on check out she proposed for late check out. But her staff really need re-training.... they su.....ed.... they mistakenly AGAIN charged us the business room but the manager rectified. So guess Hotel Re... it a think twice for next time. FRom loving it, hating it, to maybe, maybe not

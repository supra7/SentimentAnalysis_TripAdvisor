My husband and I recently stayed for 6 nights at the Seattle Westin in connection with a conference held there. We were given a room in the south tower on the 39th floor. Thankfully, we were on the opposite side from the street constuction going on near 6th Ave., although we did occasionally hear noise from the workmen--even up that high! Note: if you happen to get a room above the construction, insist on something better. As a travel agent, I'm always on the lookout for properties to which I would send clients. Can't say that the Westin has our full endorsement. The carpet in our room was stained, and there were a couple of mix-ups on our bill (which were straightened out upon request.) Didn't eat at the hotel -- seemed way overpriced for what you got, and there are plenty of other options in Seattle. Great location -- within walking distance of just about everywhere you'd want to visit. I used the bus system a couple of times, and found most of the drivers polite and helpful. Workout areas and pool were fairly nice, although located in the north tower -- for those of us in the south, it was a bit of a hike. Doormen and the rest of the staff were pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. If you can get a great deal on the price, and need to stay downtown, I'd go with it. Not necessarily worth the $185 or more they're asking. But it is in Seattle, and most hotels there seem to think they can charge higher than average prices. They do need to spruce up the place a bit, and practice a bit on the "personal touch" that Westin should exhibit.

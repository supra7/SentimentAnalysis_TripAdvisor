quite nice hotel! Novotel is just a quiet, nice, shiny hotel, as all around the world. this one is not the exception. it's really huge, though rooms are really small. for me it was convenient to stay there because it is situated just 10 minutes walk from the RAI congress center!! but for those who are just tourists, i think it's not that comfortable, though there is a tram number 4, that connects the hotel with th city center. the tram goes till 12 at night! so if you go to redlights or will be late on any other reason, you will have to take a taxi, which is round 20 euro... so you choose) the room is simply standard, nothing special. the breakfast is tasty and really huge! the hotel staff is very kind and attentive.

We stayed at the University Inn because the Watertown was fully booked. The Inn is owned by the same owners as the Watertown, and they tell potential customers that freely. They also tell customers over the phone that they have "all the services" of The Watertown, and that it is a "boutique" hotel like The Watertown. Wrong -- this is an acceptable hotel for most business travel, and is just steps away -- but that is where the similarity ends. By all means, stay at the Watertown if at all possible -- same price, much better service and style, new rooms and decor, great breakfast area. Rooms with great amenities. University Inn is a poor substitute and the ugly stepsister in the family.

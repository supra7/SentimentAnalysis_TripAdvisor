The location was great. The room decor was better than most Sheratons and it was nice having coffee available in the rooms. The management generally treated me well as a spg platinum. On the other hand, they sent two bills after checkout by Internet, both with incorrect charges. When calling to fix the errors, I had to wait. Over 7 minutes on hold waiting for a live operator to answer. At every call, I noted long delays and an annoying ARU. There was a long delay to be checked in at the front desk. There were only 2 towels in the bathroom.

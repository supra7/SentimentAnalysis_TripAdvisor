First, the rooms here are gorgeous. Very spacious with jacuzzis. They are relatively quiet but the windows dont block out sound too well and I could hear the morning train from the 30th floor. Now, the service. They make you pay a $20 resort fee daily and in exchange promise you wi-fi access, 2 bottles of water, and newspaper. For me, they didnt replenish my water & paper the 2nd day. I called them, and in 20mins someone brought me a paper, but no water, but he went and got some. Last day, again no replenishment of water or newspaper, and I called them, except this time nobody came by before I checked out. I wanted to complain at checkout, but our shuttle came and there were only 2 ppl working on the front desk at night... You may wonder why I'm making a big deal out of water, but we were sooo thirsty and tired after walking back home from the strip (so location is a big disadvantage for this hotel) from a long day, and for a 5* hotel that is supposed to give you good service, they didnt do the little things well, and the water did matter to us at least in showing us the attitude of Trump. I'll let you decide if you want to stay here, but we won't be

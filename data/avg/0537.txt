This hotel is located walking distance away from Pike's Market and other downtown sites and is attached to Seattle's conference facility. The hotel is reasonably well maintained and has a lovely widescreen game in the lobby which caught my kids' eyes immediately. However, I also chose this hotel for its advertised amenities i.e. swimming pool and hot tub, which were never available because the hotel was continuously full and the amenities were not sufficient for this number of people. I also waited in line to check out for at least a half hour since there was one woman on reception at 11:30 in the morning (when check-out is midday). So, the hotel is lovely, although the rooms could be better maintained, the water pressure in the bathroom was weak to put it mildly and clearly the service level does not match their room occupation levels. I was somewhat disappointed.

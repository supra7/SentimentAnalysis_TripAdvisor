i visited this property twice before my recent stay: nice size suites, no casinos = "quiet" lobby and super friendly staff. staff is stil friendly but the room... well, by entering there was this nasty smell, that would not go away. we flushed the zink to make sure, no smell was coming from there. later it turned out, the kitchen has not been cleaned after the last guest, so maybe the smell was from the old food in the trash can. that cleaned up - the smell was still there all the way the staff and front desk were notified about the process, but all they had to say was; "i'll make a note of that" (!!!) it wasn't until next day, when checking out, a man who has not been involved in the process credited the resort fee ($20). i think, they should have offered a clean, not smelling room from the very beginning. the hotel was not sold out.

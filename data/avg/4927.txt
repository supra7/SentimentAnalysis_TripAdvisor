Great locationQ 1/2block from from Michigan Ave Millenium Park, Museums, Soldier Field. Rooms are REALLY small, and bathrooms are tiny. No mini-bar, mini refriderator or refreshment center in room. Comfortable bed. Be sure to ask for room on opposite side of L train. L runs 10 feet from the building every 5 minutes.

I booked la fabe from the reviews on trip advisor however after my stay I felt that it was too expensive for what it offered. We paid 450 euros for 3 nights and whilst the room was small (but as expected for Paris) the location was disappointing. Although by Pernete metro it felt a long way from the centre of Paris and far from the bustling Monparnesse centre.

I got a great deal on the price of this hotel, combined with good rail ticket prices to make a cheap theatre break. The hotel location couldn't be better, just over the road from the station. We avoided the reception queue by using the self check in machine. Train to room door in about 15 minutes. The room itself was small and quiet (on the third floor), clean, shower only, no bath and only one chair. It soon became apparent how they keep their costs down: One hand towel & one bath towel. We had to go down & queue at reception for more, which were removed by housekeeping the next morning. (We were staying for three nights). No remote for the television. Reception had no spares. Three pillows. None left at reception. Thank you to the kind gentleman in room 207 who let us have his spare as he was on his own. The most uncomforable bed I have ever slept in, like sleeping in a double hammock. We had to cling to the edges to stop rolling into the middle and getiing stuck. We had pre paid for breakfast. Don't bother. Scrambled eggs only and orange juice that tastes like dilute orange squash. By all means try it, but I think you'll find better across the road in the station. I would go back, but only at rock bottom rates. If I had to pay higher prices, I'd find somewhere else.

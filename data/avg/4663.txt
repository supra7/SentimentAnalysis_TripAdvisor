Overall this is a nice hotel with a good complimentary breakfast, location and a very accommodating staff that is willing to go the extra mile to make sure your stay is desirable. The only downfall and it is a big one is the NOISE! The walls in this hotel are paper thin and you can hear everything the tenants next to you are saying/doing, this isnt the worst of it either as right door to the hotel is a Chicago Fire Station. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and got maybe 4 hours of sleep each night with ambulance or fire trucks running their sirens several times each evening. Nice hotel but if you are looking for a place to get a good night sleep I wouldnt recommend it.

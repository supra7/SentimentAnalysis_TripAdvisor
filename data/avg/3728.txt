I've stayed more than 30 times at the Magnolia, having monthly business in Dallas. Frankly, I'd stay elsewhere if my employer didn't have a deal with the hotel. The good: thick walls, high ceilings, doors that don't slam loudly, short hallways (no kids running up and down them, fewer loud late-night conversations), free full breakfast. The bad: When the hotel is full (which is often, since they have a deal with the federal govt), you can wait more than 5 minutes for one of the slow, creaky, mildly scary elevators, half of which tend to be out of service at any one time. Beware of outdoor rock concerts on warm nights, even during the week. Staff are friendly but clueless, the exercise room is substandard, and the loud top 40s pop music in public spaces can make you want to throttle Lady Gaga. Overall: Not a horrible hotel, but not worth the price.

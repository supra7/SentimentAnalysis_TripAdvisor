We stayed at the hotel as short vacation with my wife. I chose the hotel for its view and uniqueness. First night we stayed at the site facing the parking lot and we paid extra to upgrade to a water view room. The rooms were nicer. The hotel was about 10 minutes walk to Pikes market. They had a shuttle service (hourly) to take you within 2 miles. We found staff very friendly. My biggest issue was with the rooms and their thin walls. In our upgraded room I could hear our next door neighbor through the connecting door till 5:45 AM . I wrote an email to the hotel general manger about it and have not received a feedback yet. I also found their heater too noisy (could not hear the TV when on). Fireplace was nice.

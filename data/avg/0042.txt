Arrived at the hotel at 11am on a Sunday and without heistation were given a room. We were using the location as an in transit so only had the one night. The lobby area is compact, basic and functional provided you don't arrive with a group booking. Service was no friills, functional but lacking in friendliness and warmth. The room was a good size with a view, albeit uninspiring. You could open a window but it was a bit noisey at evening time.. There is a theatre (limited opening times) across the road, a grocery store on the other corner and it is a only a 10 minute walk to downtown. We did not explore eating options nearby but there seemed limited choice in the immediate vicinity. The business centre near the lobby has two free internet computers that seem to be in demand so pick your time or wait. We did have dinner at the hotel restaurant and found the service to be OK, the attention to a special diet to be first class, the prices are fair but the meal portions are on the small size. We paid full price but if you can get a special or last minute rate then it would represent good value. OK for an overnight stay but may have reservations for a longer duartion.

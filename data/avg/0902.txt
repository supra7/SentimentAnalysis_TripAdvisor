The hotel is in the heart of downtown and walking distance from everything you need. We stayed overnight after going to a play at the Paramount and it was a nice walk back to the hotel. The bed was comfy and room service was pretty fast. There is also a little convenience store a block away so you can avoid the mini bar prices. I agree with other reviewers that you get a room to match the price you pay. We used the Name Your Own Price feature and payed 1/2 the price listed on the Westin's website. We ended up with a small room right by the elevators and could hear the people talking in the hall.

I booked a special weekend,treating my sister and niece to fun in Chicago. I got premo tickets to The Lion King, dinner at The Grand Lux,and I thought one of the best hotels in Chicago. I was dissapointed in the unfriendly check -in.Once up to the suite I found it dusty and dirty..I thought it happens..o.k. But once we were all dressed up to go to the play,we waited out front for help getting a cab..nobody helped,they were all talking in a circle too busy to notice 3 ladies needing a cab.We hailed our own. Nobody greeted us comming or going from the hotel.something I am really used to when staying at the Sheraton Four Points on Rush Street. To sum it up..The Omni is a 4 star Hotel that acts like a 2 star. The Sheraton Four Points is a 2 or 3 star that acts like a 5 star.

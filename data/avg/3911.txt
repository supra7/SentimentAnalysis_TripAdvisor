The problems that we experienced were that the hot water for the shower did not get hot and the refrigerater did not get cold enough. The pool was dirty and it had large ants in it my daughter started screaming when she seen the ants.They really should clean there pool more often like on a daily basis because someone is going to get sick.And please make sure you get all your belongings out of your room because we left a few items and we called the resort lost and found and left a message sevaral times so someone could call us back but we never received a call back so our experience was not so great.

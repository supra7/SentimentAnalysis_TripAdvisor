Great location, quite clean but let down by the noise. We had the same experience as JohnDoe9. Arrived in the early evening to be told that our (pre-paid, well in advance) room was no longer available and would be like to pay for an upgrade? This really didn't impress my Priority Club Gold member husband and the receptionist wasn't interested after that. "Upgraded" room was on a lower floor and a corner room with glass on two sides - this meant waking up at least twice a night - as JohnDoe9 described - sirens (from the ER at the hospital on the next corner), whistles and quite loud heating system. I don't think this can be explained away by saying the hotel is in a big city, as clearly the other rooms don't have the same problem. A rating of three for location/nearby amenities/cleanliness but we would think twice about coming back, especially since there are so many other hotels (even in the same street).

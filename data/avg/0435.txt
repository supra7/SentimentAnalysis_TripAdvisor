We stayed here on a Saturday night as a stop over before flying home the next day. We were on a top floor overlooking the expressway. We could still hear all the noise. There were few restaurants, we walked a square 4 blocks down from the hotel and found nothing open at 2000 on a saturday The hotel's own restaurants were empty so we decided that would not be a good choice. The bed was comfortable. Then today when checking bank statements I find an unexplained $104 charge on my credit card. The real test will be "how many phone calls will it take to correct this mistake" This is really just a hotel. Nothing special and a bit isolated because it is so close to the expressway.

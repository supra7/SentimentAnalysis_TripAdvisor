if you go to any of the secrets resorts, do not go to the "breakfast" informational meeting. They do a high pressure sales to get you to join their vacation club. Unfortunately it looks great, but you don't get a chance to really research it. We did so when we got home, even though we were told we had 30 days to cancel, they are trying to charge us 50% of the total cost. They are running a scam and taking peoples money. The resorts are nice, but this has really soured me on this resort. They are not following with what was promised, and now that we've had a chance to do the reviews, we've found that it is NOT what it seems.

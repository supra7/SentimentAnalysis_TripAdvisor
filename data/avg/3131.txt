I stayed at the W in Hong Kong shortly after it opened. I was excited because i typically love W hotels - especially the new ones. I booked one of the FABULOUS rooms with the "full harbor view" and was disappointed to discover that you don't get the typical "million dollar view" you want in a Kowloon hotel (the view of downtown HK) but instead a view of a side of the harbor with a bunch of nasty cargo ships parked in it! :-( So sad, since the only reason to stay in Kowloon is for the view. In any case, yes - the hotel was fabulous and very W-like. But for the price being charged I would have expected a real view and I didn't get that and I was ultimately really unhappy about that. Fortunately, I changed to the HOTEL LKF for the rest of my stay in Hong Kong and it was FABULOUS! I highly recommend it.

Went back to the Seattle Hilton for one night this week and now I know why I stay elsewhere especially with so many nice Hotels in downtown Seattle. Rooms are small. Bathrooms are beyond small. Think New York but its Seattle and even New York has bigger rooms. Elevators are slow--and overall its just a tired Hilton. Great location. Just not a thrilling property. Stale. Tired. A non descript property.

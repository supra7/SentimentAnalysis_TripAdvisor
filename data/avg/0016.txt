This is a lovely, neat hotel with good sized rooms, however, the front desk staff are less than helpful. The doormen were wonderful, very helpful and prompt, however, the front desk team were anything but. My colleague required a power adaptor for his computer, he requested this several times without any luck. When I asked the same question I was advised by the young gal at the front desk "We have already been on that wild goose chase for another guest, we don't have them". Oh, and if you need coffee for an early flight the Starbucks is aound the corner. Come on people, you are in the service industry!

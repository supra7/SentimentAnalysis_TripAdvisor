First time staying at the W Seattle... First the good... + Great location (can walk most everywhere you desire) + Cool lobby, restaurant and bar Next the bad... + Not really worth the price (food, drinks and especially valet and internet) + Room smelled a bit like smoke + Gym is weak (except for those sweet stretching machines!) + I know they are going for a cool feel with the dark vibe in the hallways, but it is WAY too dark... I could even see my key to open the door. I might stay here again, but the only reason is to keep gaining Starwood points. The Hyatt Olive 8 is a bit better IMO (except for location) --

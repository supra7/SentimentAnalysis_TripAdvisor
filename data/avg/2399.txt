The room was very nice. It is small, but they had a flat screen TV, refrigerator, microwave, bottle water, a Keurig coffee maker, and a very comfortable bed. The one thing that we really had a problem with was the noise. Our room was on the street side, because the rooms were supposed to be a little larger, but the noise from the street was really bad. We were there for two nights, and each morning at about 1:30 people began talking, laughing and screaming. Traffic is very heavy. Also, the room next to ours had some very loud occupants that kept us up for a couple of hours. The rooms were not very sound proof. But the room was clean and the location to the attractions in Phili was great. Also appreciated the parking lot.

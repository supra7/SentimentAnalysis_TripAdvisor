I've stayed here several times for the Blues Festival, which is always the first weekend of June. At least 3 times, I've been able to get a room for $70. through Priceline. It was worth every penny - 10 years ago a Motel 6 downtown was $100. Our room was always clean. One year we had 2 queen sized beds and 2 bathrooms, which was heavenly! Another year we had a very small room. I'm guessing it is just luck of the draw.

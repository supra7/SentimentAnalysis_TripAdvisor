The hotel is on a corner with two major bus routes running past. We stayed on the first floor and the sound of the buses was pretty obtrusive. The room was clean and warm. This chain of hotels is a basic one so don't expect luxury. There are a couple of small family run cafes nearby for breakfast. The location is ideal for sight seeing central London as you are right next to Euston station and about ten minutes walk from Kings Cross.

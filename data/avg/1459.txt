For starters, at this price they don't even pick you up at the airport, which is fine. But when we pulled up my husband thought we were at the back entrance of a WalMart. No curb appeal and the lobby was nothing great. We didn't like the food, but that is personal preference. What made this a 3 star property for us was the dozen times we lost electricy in our room, not to mention the mold, we never once saw our 'personal conceige'. The rock siding was falling off and poorly maintained. But here was the deal breaker for us.....The property is suppose to be all inclusive, but they tried to up charge us for everything...from the room when we got there, wine at dinner, and they pushed us to make a reservation for the Christmas dinner, which we eventually did, and the meal was horrible, all four couples at our table agreed, it was processed Turkey...AND THEY NEVER TOLD US THAT IT WAS A $100 UP CHARGE until we checked out. So check your portfolio closely before you leave. That was the final straw for us...we will never go back. I felt like they were trying to get in our wallet with every move. The food was terrible, and the property was poorly maintained. Oh the drinks were good, so we filled up on them!!

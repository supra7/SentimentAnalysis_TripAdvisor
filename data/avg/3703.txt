Good- The location is great and its right next door to the Iron cactus and other good restraunts..the view is nice if you stay on the 23-26 floor. Bad- make sure you take your luggage up with you, I had a bad experience but I must say they are handling that issue better than i expected. Good- They do give out complimentary cocktails and cookies, that was a plus. The restraunt in the hotel is not good, better to go eat out. Be prepared to pay 22 a night for parking.

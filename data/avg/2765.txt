The receptionists were a bit slow to understand and fullfill our requests, the internet was very slow, the room was small for 2 of us, the heating was very strong for me, but when we opened the window it became too cold. Of course, there was no climate control or a\c. Also, the hotel is very expensive (more then 100 euros per night), a bit dirty. And also, as we noticed, if there are vegetables, olives or other food left after breakfast, they just hide it, and the next day serve the same dish, not even rearranging it or adding smth fresh. As a result one side od the vegetable dish was covered with thick layer of green mould! When I saw it, i immediately lost appetite. Thanks God there were a lot of wonderful cheap places to have breakfast in the city, so we started to skip hotel mouldy breakfasts. Also, the hotel is a bit far from everything, everytime you have to climb up the hill and walk about 2 bus stops to the center of sultanahmet. In general, the city is wonderful, and every day we got so tired and happy that we just dozed off at once, and early in the morning left the hotel again. So i would suggest to take some nice clean hostel instead of this unreasonably expensive place.

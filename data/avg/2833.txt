The Hotel Smit is currently undergoing renovation. The painted boarding around the exterior of the hotel can be a bit off-putting upon arrival. In fact, I had a little difficulty figuring out how to get into the reception area but once I did I was greeted by a friendly and helpful desk staff. I stayed in a single room which was tiny. It had a single bed, a chair, a desk and a tv (wall mounted). The walls seemed a little thin but luckily during my stay the noise was fairly minimal. There was a big window but no view as my room faced the backside of the hotel. That said, I must also say that the room was very clean. The bedding and towels appeared new. The attached bathroom was tastefully renovated though the shower was an open stall with no curtain so the bathroom became kind of soaked when used. The location of this little hotel is ideal for tourism. It is just a few steps from a tram that goes through the center of the city (to central station) and near some fabulous shopping, eating and sightseeing. Several designer stores are just out the door and both the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum are within 5 minutes walk... which will make it easy to be first in line if you fail to buy advance tickets. Given that the Hotel Smit is a clean, friendly, and relatively inexpensive... I would stay here again. Maybe by the time I do the construction will be completed and there will be a nice lobby.

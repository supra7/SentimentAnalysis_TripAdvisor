The Omni was very sweet to my daughter and her friend. When we arrived the kids go a 'back pack' of fun items. On the flip side, my other two friends and their daughters didn't received the same item, so there were some boo boo lips. The staff was super friendly on check in both front desk and the gentlemen at the door. The room was a bit of a disappointment. We booked the suite. The bedroom was a bit cramped, and the sitting room was a bit odd. They had a couch and desk with wet bar. There was this huge space that it seemed something belonged. Additional seating would have been very helpful. Once the couch was pulled out, there went any seating. Was bummed there wasn't a refrigerator or microwave. They did bring a refrigerator up after we asked, which was nice. Unfortunately it didn't work, so the wonderful Italian dinner leftovers we brought back with us had to be tossed the next morning. The room was a bit worn looking. Not what I was expecting for the type of star hotel the Omni is rating. Workout facilities were great. Very bright and clean. Wished they did have some wipes or spray bottles to clean the workout equipment when we were done. Kids loved the pool, though is was not big by any means. The fact it was shallow all the way thru made it easier to manage the children. All in all, I loved the friendly staff, but didn't see the dollar value at all.

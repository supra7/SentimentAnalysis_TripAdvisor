I got a $99 deal from Hotwire to stay here. Which I was excited about until I saw all of the construction on an entire outer side of the hotel. The EL line outside of the other entrance was also under construction. Once we dodged all of the construction and made our way to the actual check in area, we didn't have any problems. We got a king size room which was pretty average. The lobby is beautiful, but everything else is what you would expect for $99 a night. Glad I didn't pay rack rate. Excellent location, staff was friendly, rooms are not sound proof. Bachelorette party coming in across the hall at 2:30am should have been made aware of that.

Excellent location and even better staff. But we do have to say, lack luster beds (not up to normal Marriott standards we have come to expect) and beefy priced. We did take advantage of accumulated points and promotions - but were less then impressed w/ property appointments. We were warned of "under construction" status - but our concerns were outside of construction. upon our next visit to Boston, we will consider alternative location for our stay.

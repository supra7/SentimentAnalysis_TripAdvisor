The Park Plaza is a historic hotel in a great location. Lots of rooms means that it's usually on the cheaper end of the downtown hotels. Unfortunately the rooms could use a good overhaul. The bathrooms in the rooms that I've stayed in have been tiny and a little rough around the edges. Overall, I'll definitely stay here again, as the price is right, but I wouldn't recommend it someone without explaining the upsides and the downsides.

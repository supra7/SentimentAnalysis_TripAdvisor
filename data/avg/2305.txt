We expected a resort with SOME amenities, but there really weren't any! Bare minumum staff, rooms cleaned only once every four days, restaurant really a bar with a few food items, advertised 'sunning beach' not even indicated on hotel map being given out (seems to be reserved for the most expensive rooms being let). Other than that, it's really more like a fairfield inn with multiple nice pools and nice gardens ( with terrible music piped everywhere). If that 's what you are looking for, you will like it. Just don't expext a resort!

Total confusion with my booking. Got another guest's booking and messages. Informed hotel about it during stay. When checking out, still the confusion remained. Have complained to them and they say that it is not their normal procedure but no explanation as to why it went wrong. Surely a hotel of this calibre can cope with guest with similar name? Breech of privacy was overlook too. The hotel was not too bad otherwise. Best thing for me was the direct link to the airport. Offered upgrade next time I stay.

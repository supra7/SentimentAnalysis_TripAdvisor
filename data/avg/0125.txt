The Kings Inn is a decent stay for people on a budget. It's cheap compared to other accomodations in downtown Seattle, and so long as you aren't expecting anything other than the bare necessities, I don't think you will be too disappointing. The room itself was small and sparce, but it was clean. It wasn't very noisy at all. When it comes to the shower, don't even mess around with the cold water, as I turned the hot water handle a full 360 degrees, the water was still, at best, tepid. Other than that, no real complaints. The other reviews make this place sound like a hole, but it's really not all that bad, albeit, I never had any problems with the hotel manager. For anyone on a budget, this place isn't too bad. Everything is within walking distance.

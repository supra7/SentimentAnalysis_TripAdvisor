Is this place a 4 star resort ? No, and that's a good thing - 4 star hotels usually don't have kitchenettes. It's a cute and quirky old place that is a great budget option. Not just because it's a great deal ( About the same price as the hooker hotels close to downtown), but having a fridge for sodas, snacks and all those goodies from Pike Place can really help the money go farther. Our room had AC ( The hotel told me all the rooms have it now), a view of the Space Needle from one room, and a view of Puget Sound from the other one. About the continental breakfast. It's a joke. Oatmeal bars, Lipton tea and a coffee machine. Walk one block to Metropolitan Market for a real "power breakfast" you'll need it if you're exploring Seattle on foot! We're looking forward to staying there again.

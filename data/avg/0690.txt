we stayed in the double non-refundable suite and were given a basement room. at first, we thought this would be horrible, however, it was very decent (size, cleanliness, etc), especially since we were only there to sleep. there were a few issues with the room, namely the phone didn't work (staff didn't endeavour to fix it - they just said that we could use the main reception phone), and the shower leaked all over the floor. the place was out of the way, but there are two buses that take you to the termini main train station within 10 - 15 minutes - we came home one night after midnight and it was completely safe. the hotel is very quiet - especially in the beginning of october, and there's never anyone hanging around the bar. the night shift guy was great and kept us happy and entertained and the bar is stocked well. the grounds are gorgeous and the continental breakfast was lovely. i would stay there again. p.s. the hotel soaps (shampoo, bodywash, etc.) are great quality, although the fig smell wasn't for me.

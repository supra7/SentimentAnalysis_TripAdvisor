Stay here only if you like lots of noise, crowds, have fairly low standards, and get a deal. My experience here was much different than at other Starwood hotels. This is a huge convention hotel and hotel for people leaving on cruises. I suspect they pay very little for their rooms. Buses of people constantly arrived while we were there for a 3 night stay. Parking was $35 a night. If I did it again, I would look for a small boutique hotel. I booked 2 rooms via Starwood's website several weeks in advance of my stay. I am Starwood Gold. I called the hotel in advance and asked for 2 rooms connecting or adjacent on the club level, in a quiet area. I did not get a "deal." When checking in, there were probably 100 people in line--no joke. Fortunately there was a separate line for Gold and Platinum members. We were told we could not have adjacent rooms--they were on separate floors. We were not offered an upgrade. The rooms were not ready at 2:45 p.m. (Gold gets early check-in). Fortunately a big tip to a porter got us adjacent rooms on the club level, but in a VERY noisy area--right next to the club lounge and elevators that ding nonstop and feature a recorded lady's voice "You are on the 32nd floor." Parking was $35 a night. The workout room is dreary and in bad need of updating. The pool area looks a bit dated and sad. It's a big pool with enough chlorine to make you itch for weeks. You can't call for your car in advance--you wait at the valet for a long time before they will pull it around. I will pass next time!

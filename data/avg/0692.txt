This hotel was listed as a 4 star hotel but it is not a 4 star. I read about the beautiful views of the water and thought that would be nice. Our view was the parking lot and the train crossing. The trains come through about once and hour, so there is no restful sleep when you have one of those rooms. The room was quite small, but the bathroom was a good size. There is no dresser in the room. I also found it odd to have the coffee machine in the bathroom, which doesn't seem very sanitary. The hallways are dark and dreary and look like they need a good cleaning. Our son lives in Seattle and we were going to drive his car back to the hotel in the evenings and park it there, only to find out there was an outragious fee to park there. They don't let the guests park there for free even though they have a huge parking lot. The one good thing about the Edgewater is that they have a very friendly and professional staff. We will not stay there again.

First be sure you are GUARANTEED to be on the side of the hotel away from the bridge. If you face the bridge it is very noisy and you maybe very upset. Second know that you are in Chinatown. I love Chinatown and needed to stay in lower manhattan but it is a bit out of the way for some people. It is very clean, new and the customer service is great. It is however minimalist. You get everything you need but not a thing more. There is no wireless - there is hard wired DSL and in our room the cable was next to the phone on a TINY night stand with a short cable. We had two queen beds and the room was quite large. The desk was also tiny. The free coffee in the lobby is instant coffee and hot water. Cabs are fairly easy to get in China

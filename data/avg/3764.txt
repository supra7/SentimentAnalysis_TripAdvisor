We chose the Radisson for our 19th anniversary getaway because the rates seemed reasonable for the accommodations. When we vacation, we don't spend a lot of time in our room but want it to be very neat and clean. We went into this past weekend, based on Tripadvisor reviews, knowing that the Radisson was in the final phases of a major remodel, which is basically what we found. We reserved a room with a sleep number king bed, which my wife tried and enjoyed, and ended up in a suite rather than a regular room which was a nice surprise. There were obvious signs of a remodel in progress; missing baseboards in the hallway and in our room, hallway temperatures on the sixth floor around 95 degrees due to a missing thru-the-wall a/c unit, minor problems w/one of the a/cunits in our room, and an under the-counter-fridge in our room which we defrosted ourselves to get it to work properly. Having been in the construction industry for over 30 years, my guess is that the work that has been done was done in-house rather than by a professional contractor. On the positive side, the front desk and staff were very polite and responsive to our requests for maintenance and very helpful to us in finding our way around town. Would we stay there again knowing what we know now? Sure. At $70 per night for a suite w/a king bed, the Radisson was acceptable though not impressive. We found nothing gross or disgusting but rather a well-trained staff trying to make up for the obvious inconvenience of a remodel in progress. We also found a watch by the pool Sunday that we would really like to return to its rightful owner. My message today left w/housekeeping, who is in charge of lost and found, has not been acknowledged yet. cakesetmoi

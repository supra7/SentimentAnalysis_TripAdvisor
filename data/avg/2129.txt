This place was ok but I don't have anything to compare it to in Mexico City. Most of the staff was nice (minus one particular lady that's at the front desk in the afternoon) and I found that only the man on duty at night speaks English. Our reservation was messed up so we had to move twice in 5 days. No big deal. One room was had no windows with no fans, and got musty quickly. One single room actually shared a balcony with another roomodd. Rooms that overlook the street get noisy, smell a little from the sewage outside, and windows provide no noise insolation. Bathrooms are clean but smell like pork from the restaurant downstairs. The rooms also have carpet, which kinda grosses me out. Great location, near some good food options and between 2 metro stops. Great location, clean, and safe. Overall, good budget choice.

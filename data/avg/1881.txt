We stayed here 4 nights in September. It was an OK hotel, nothing fancy, but is clean and the staff are friendly. They have cultural activities including a free hula show and they have a restaurant as well as a grill that serves burgers and the like which are very nice (I really enjoyed the burgers!). They also have a bar and a whale shaped pool. The beach location is very nice (although we couldn't go into the water due to surf conditions) and the cost is far less than some of the fancier hotels and resorts in the area. We were in the Molokai wing, which has 3 floors, but no lift. We were on the second floor. One of the staff took our bags up for us. I know hed be used to it, but I still felt a bit sorry for him! One thing I really appreciated after having been travelling for over a week was that they had a coin operated laundry in that building. It has one washing machine and two dryers. The dryers were not super (we split up our one washing machine load between them to get our clothes dry), but still better than nothing. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to do the cultural activities, but they looked interesting. We did attend the lei farewell ceremony, which was really lovely but if you are from Australia be aware that you cannot bring your Kukui nut leis back home - quarantine will take them and destroy them. So you can still take you lei from the hotel if you like, but you will only get to enjoy it while in Hawa'i. Below is a list of pros & cons for the hotel. Pros: Good location (nice beach area). Friendly & attentive staff. Clean and neat rooms. Free live shows of an evening and cultural activities. Laundry facilities. Close to shops (Whalers Village). Lovely lei farewell ceremony (optional). Relatively inexpensive Cons: An older hotel  the walls are quite thin and you can hear your neighbours  especially at night. Hard mattresses.

Impressive entrance on Monroe St. and stunning lobby. Building is listed on the National Register. Service is sorely lacking. No doorman at door to offer help with luggage, waited in line to check in, then a further wait while staff tried to locate a room for me. I have had a confirmed reservation for over 6 weeks so delay in assigning room was inexplicable. Room itself was commodious and included 2 very small bathrooms. Appointments were attractive, but not recent or fresh. No in-room coffee pot, refrigerator, or free internet connection. Service in the bar was non-existent. Sat at a dirty table for several minutes, complained to hostess, returned to same dirty table for several more minutes and finally left. Concierge was very helpful but, again, had to stand in line to get service. Hotel rules state that all but one ground floor door closes at 9:00 pm. Not true. Street people lounging in elevator lobby several times during my stay. Room not tended until late afternoon. Disturbed by noise in next door room; however, beds and pillows were very comfortable. All in all, the approximately $450 per day room rate was excessive for the service received. This hotel seems to be most successful at providing large blocks of rooms to conventioneers who let somebody else pay the bill. Will look for other accomodations next time.

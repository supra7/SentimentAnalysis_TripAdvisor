location was great, resterant on sight was good, indoor pool was clean, warm enough to enjoy, whirl pool great as well, great location, few steps from the red line metro. Had a few issues with lack of staff. Had no towels, called front desk, took about 4 hours to get towels. next day no one cleaned room at all. called front desk about 6pm, someone came about 830pm to clean, didnt get usa today either but other rooms did. Same deal the next day as well, did come to clean the third day...... no conceirge on hand, tried to wait on line to ask desk staff questions, they were busy and not very accomodating. Rooms were large and nice, location was great, close to everything, but don't expect service any time soon, very short on staff and it was obvious.

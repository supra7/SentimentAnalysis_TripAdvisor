Stayed here for 2 nights on a quick visit to San Diego and Seaworld. I chose it because it was Number 1 on TripAdvisor at the time and was well reviewed. Its a great stopover hotel, near the airport and Seaworld 10 minutes away, service was great, hotel very clean, but it is a basic no frills stay and has a small outdoor pool. It was our first visit to San Diego so quite difficult to compare to any other hotels in the area. If you are driving there from LA, we stopped at Del Mar were there are some great restaurants looking on to the beach.

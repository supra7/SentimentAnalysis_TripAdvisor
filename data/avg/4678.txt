This hotel is in a good location to downtown/Mich. Avenue and shopping. Unfortunately it is also one block from the fire station and we heard sirens all night long. The other thing that I was disappointed with is that I think the purpose of a suite is to have a separate bedroom. The design of this hotel is such that you have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom, and the wash area is not even closed off from the bedroom. So, there is really no private sleeping area, which is what I look for in a suite. If you don't care about sharing the bedroom with the bathroom/vanity area, then it won't bother you, and if that's the case you're probably a heavy sleeper and the sirens won't bother you, either. Otherwise, it's a mediocre hotel that delivers what it advertises.

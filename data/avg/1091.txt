Great hotel location for the discounted price. Even though we had a car, it was not used the one night during our stay because all the attractions were walkable. So....where can you walk to from the hotel? Pikes Place Market, the first Starbucks, the Monorail and shops, lots of restaurants, movie theater, etc. Valet parking was pricey..as is all in Seattle. Their parking was 32.00 nightly. The hotel lobby has yummy pink bubblicious gum in the gumball machine and various fruit flavored water dispenser display....a nice touch for thirsty travelers. The sushi restaurant next door was closed so I can't comment on it. The worst thing about the hotel was the super small bathroom. I'm not a big person but I found it a bit tight. There is a nice pillow service option where you can select the type of pillow that you want for the night. That was a nice perk especially since I was having some neck problems before I arrived. Overall, it was a comfortable stay. Oh, and the elevator was very slow and small.

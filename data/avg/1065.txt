Stayed there for 3 nights with a girl friend. I was shocked that this hotel was a W. Apart from the Lobby which has the W signature bar the rest of the hotel has to be a 3 or max 4 star quality. The towels and bed sheets in the room need to be used for rags! The bathroom still has the old bath tub from when the W took over including all the light switches. Called for a shower cap and had to wait 40 minutes to get it. Called for an extra shower gel which never came. Although a turn down service is offered they do not replenish ANYTHING. A quick flip of the comforter and done! No complimentary water bottle either. The Business Center is a joke. A man sat there with loud music playing. When we asked him that we had a letter to mail with "signature request on receipt" he tried to talk me out of it and said it was unnecessary since it was going to the IRS. When I insisted he said he could not provide that service and I should go across the street to the Post Office. Found out that the across the street meant 4 blocks away! Dont bother with the breakfast at this hotel. The choice is very limited and the service is the same. You are much better off going across the street to Starbucks for a predictable coffee and muffin at least you will get what you pay for. On the positive note the Front Desk staff were very nice and the Bar service was excellent. Certainly NOT worth the $325 a night tab. I would never stay there again and would certainly have moved out except there was a big game in town and a convention hence was stuck.

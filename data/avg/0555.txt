I was in Seattle for a couple of days on a short business trip so I chose this hotel based on its central location (close to practically everything). My room was clean but nothing fancy. There was a convention going on and a lot of young people were staying at the hotel (unfortunately, I heard them late at night!) The staff were courteous and the concierge was helpful. The checking in/out process was efficient. Overall a good hotel for the money spent. Parking was around $30 extra for the one day though.

This was our honeymoon. We have been to one other all inclusive. (couples swept away in Negril Jamaica). My travel agent recommended this place because we were looking for a place with beautiful calm beach and great food. SMB had better reviews than couples so we were expecting greatness. We were dissapointed and thought couples was better in every aspect. There is really no comparison. First, here is what we thought was good. Beach-beautiful, but 7 Mile Beach in Negril is far better for relaxing and sunsets!!! Spa-Outstanding Wait staff- great and very friendly Rooms- we were on top floor of 16th building, beautiful view and room Now the bad food- lunches ok, but only dinner restaurants we thought were great was El Patio and Himitsu, the rest were dissapointing conceirge- we stayed in preferred building so we had personal conceirge. Especially as honeymooners we felt we were interrupted several times a day for no good reason at all. If you didn't anwer the knocking door, he would literally let himself in. secrets box- Every room has one, but unless you have money in there, it will not be used. at all!! Its says all taxes and gratuities are included, but tipping is the norm and is expected in all departments. Dinner on the beach- great view, but were we not given any choice on menu, and food was not good at all. However, Rafael was a great server. Breakfast in bed- Huge dissapointment, only fruit and bread served with oj, thats it. Breakfast at world cafe is a far better option. All in all, we had fun, but will not return to this resort or location. We would highly recommend Couples resorts in Jamaica if your looking for the perfect honeymoon location!! We did get engaged there!!! The beach in unreal and sunsets are even better!! The people there were amazing and the food was phenomenal.

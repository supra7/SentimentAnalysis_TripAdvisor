Stayed one night before flying from the airport. I could not believe the lack of amenities - no glasses, one facecloth for 4 people and only 2 bath towels, no snack bar. Yet you could buy an amenity kit for $15!! The breakfast deal is terrible - a paper bag with a juice, croissant and an apple. The worst part was the careless check in where Claudio did not bother to explain any of the amenities of the hotel and then an error in their system showed our room was unoccupied. This meant the room was alotted to two other guests throughout the night, resulting in people trying to get into our room while I tried to get the most important thing before my flight - a good night's rest. My bill was not discounted as I had expected. There are good aspects to this hotel of course - the comfortable bed, nice shower and modern clean lines.

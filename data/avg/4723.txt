We stayed at the Hotel Burnham for three nights in September. The pluses: friendly staff, good location, beautiful elevator lobby, Aveda bath products. The minuses: very small room, not very good food in the surprisingly busy restaurant and a bellman who never arrived to help us with our luggage, despite two requests.

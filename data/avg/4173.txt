The Park Plaza was obviously very plush in it's day but is now showing major signs of tiredness. I was in a small room, just enough space for a double bed and a desk. My colleague, who paid exactly the same rate got a room double the size, so maybe I was just unlucky. Bed extremely comfortable, best I've slept in for ages. Internet is $13 a night and isn't good enough to hold a video skype conversation. No wireless so stuck to the desk. :( Dead handy for shopping, Chinatown and convention centres. Arlington T station right outside.

This was a typical Fairfield Inn. Only problem - - next day, my arms were coated in bites. Now one week later, they are still itching, oozing. I think some of these bites will leave scars. Have visited the doctor.....trying cortizone cream My own conclusion: i) Allergic reaction to the sheets - due to chemicals/soaps used to launder sheets. This is unlikely, as there seems to be "bite patterns" on arms ii) Scabies. If the bedsheets were not (properly) cleaned, scabies can remain on the sheets from a previous guest iii) Bed bugs. This is the most likely. Upon researching hotels in the Dallas market center area, it seems that many properties have had bed bug outbreaks over the past several years, including the neighboring Courtyard. Advice - if you stay here, INSPECT mattress and if possible - behind headboard - very carefully. Just a couple of bedbugs can do a whole lot of biting......

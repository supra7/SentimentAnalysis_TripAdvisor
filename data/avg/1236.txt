I got this hotel through priceline and I would say I got a great value for what I paid. However, I was pretty surprised to see their normal rate is so high! Never would I pay over $100 a night for this hotel, but if I got a good deal again ($70) I'd do it. Two of my biggest issues are the fact that they nickel and dime you for everything - parking $16, internet $13..phone calls, etc etc.. and the other issue is definitely some of the front desk staff, especially the guys, who seem irritable, bored and hating their jobs. You're in the customer service industry boys, and you're my first impression of the hotel...FD managers, retrain these guys please. The good stuff includes good airport location,, delicious cookies, great concierge, bell and housekeeping staff.

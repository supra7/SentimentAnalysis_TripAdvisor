We had a little problem finding the hotel initially but after our first visit we were ok. The hotel is about 20minutes from the city center but the tram and bus service is excellent so you wont have a problem getting around. The only draw back is that the bus & tram end their service to that area at 12midnight so if you plan to stay out late then you have to get a cab. The staff is very helpful and courteous, the breakfast is also very good. I had a double room and the single beds are extremely small and the carpet in the hall way leading to the room needs changing. The area where the hotel is located is very boring and its also hard to get food in that area. Overall the hotel is very nice and the rooms are clean.

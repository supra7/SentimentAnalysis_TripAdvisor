I stayed 4 nights at the beginning of January while at a Conference. Got conference rates. I was expecting a bit more. On the good side: Room is cleaned daily, fancy decor (liked the lobby), very comfortable bed. On the bad side: room is small (smaller than my bedroom, and I live in New York), paper-thin walls (could hear the 'recreational activities' of the couple next door). Staff was OK. Do not try to access internet via your TV (too slow). Overall, my experience was not good enough to merit another stay.

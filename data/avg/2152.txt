If I paid full price for my stay at this hotel, this would be a much worse review. First off, we had to call the front desk to have our toilet seat attached to the toilet. The first night we had the appropriate amount of towels. From then we always had to call for towels. I assume housekeeping cleaned up dirty towels, but would not replace those taken. Since I am on towels, I would suggest bringing your own. I think the towels may have removed some flesh they were so rough. Then the ones we got had holes in them. Does the staff not inspect towels as they fold them? If you travel during the week cabanas by the pool are free. Weekends are not- be prepared. We were also supposed have robes in the room, we didnt. The resort fee includes a number of things you don't need. It gives you "access" to high speed internet. You still have to pay for it. I still havent figured out the benefit of the resort fee. All I got were bottles of water. So the good. The staff was awesome. The concierge desk was staffed by really friendly people. They had great suggestions and were helpful with tickets to shows and reservations to restaurants. The outside staff was great as well. The doormen were friendly and helpful with suggestions, too. There is also a complimentary shuttle that takes you to the strip, but it stops at midnight on certain nights, so be prepared. Overall, it if were a cheaper hotel with lower expectaions, it wouldn't have as far to fall.

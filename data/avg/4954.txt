After a lovely stay at the Hilton Financial District in Boston, this was a big disappointment. I had checked on the Internet that there would be a refrigerator and coffee making facilities in the room, and several sites had confirmed that this would be the case, but the room had neither -- of course, it was so small, that this was not surprising. For the most part, staff who were going to get a tip were pleasant. However, one fellow behind the reception desk, was positively obstructive. The room was beautifully clean and we had an excellent, good value meal in the bar. On the other hand, in another bar, I was charged $6 for some take-away crisps. Our luggage was moved around efficiently (tips at stake). Perhaps the biggest disappointment was that the pool was out of commission -- the desk helpfully suggested that we use the pool at a Hilton a mile or so away.

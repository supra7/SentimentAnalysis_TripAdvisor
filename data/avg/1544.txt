With some small and easy fixes, along with some basic maintenance, this hotel could be quite nice despite the impossibly small size of the rooms. There is essentially no closet or cupboard spacesome attractive wall hooks for hanging coats, clothing, etc., would make a huge difference. A light over the mirror would provide some brightening for what is otherwise dark. Fresh paint, repair of dings to furniture and floors, cleaning and re-caulking bathroom areas, and spiffing up the institutional-feeling breakfast room would all go a long way. Breakfast was a mixed bag, i.e., some really good and fresh breads and bagels but unfortunate cereals (Fruit Loops, etc.) and gummy yogurt. Staff was generally helpful and good natured.

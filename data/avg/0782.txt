I was looking for a romantic getaway hotel in Seattle. The reviews on this site really influenced me to try the Sorrento as opposed to say the Inn at Market Place. This is a very nice property with many pluses, but my over all opinion is that it's nothing special, which is of course what you're looking for on these getaways. The Sorrento has an excellent concierge who gave very good recommendations, even when put to the test. They also have complimentary Town Car service to and from downtown destinations. This is a really nice thing. The public rooms of the hotel are top notch. The lobby lounge, for example is warm and inviting. I opted for a Junior Suite which ran around $300 a night. The room is a very small divided into a small sitting area with a tv in armoir and a bedroom that is tiny. The king size bed barely fits in the room, you have to squeeze buy it to get to the bathroom. The bedding was spectacular with super soft sheets and a large variety of pillows. The bedroom had an oversized desk that abutted the bed. The bathroom was nice with white marble and a spacious walk-in shower. Unfortunately, there's no tub in the bathroom and that's a minus for me. So here are there reasons for my average review: The room lacks any special aesthetic. The entire room is beige and boring and feels very, very cramped largely because of the poor layout. The bathroom is solid white. The room really needs the services of a good interior designer. The room temperature was impossible. They rely on small under window units that you just cant get right. We were either freezing or boiling. There are no views whatsoever. No evening turn-down service was provided, so no evening straighten up of the room either. No coffee or breakfast service provided. Seating was uncomfortable and dated. So overall, this is a nice place, but more like a business destination than a getaway. Id say take the $300 youd spend here and spend it at Inn at Harbor Steps.

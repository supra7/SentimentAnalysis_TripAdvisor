Stayed here for one night with my wife and son. The appeal of a hotel in Vegas without a Casino attracted us to this property as well as a previous excellent experience at Trump Hotel in Chicago. This hotel is great if you are turned off by the crowded hotels in Vegas. It is quiet, in a good location with a short walk to all the attractions. Room and especially bathroom are very spacious. Bed is comfortable with great linens. So whats not to like?? Despite the luxury feel to this place, it somehow lacks the class of other Trump hotels I have stayed at. It feels like the place has been thrown together without much attention to taste and more attention to the glitz of Vegas. More importantly however, when I moved the living room table to prepare the pullout sleeper for our son, I found old food on the carpet under the table. NOT A GOOD FINDING! It gets you wondering how well the rest of the place has been cleaned. This really made us uncomfortable. I would not return. Cleanliness is one of the most important issues for me when staying away from home. Staff are friendly and helpful

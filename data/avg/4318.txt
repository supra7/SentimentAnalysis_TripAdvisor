I booked a "European style" room at this hotel through Expedia because it was the cheapest find for the location. After booking I started reading the reviews and was very nervous about my choice, but there was nothing to do because the deposit was non-refundable. I needn't have worried; our stay was absolutely fine. Yes, there is truth to the bad reviews -- the rooms are small, the bathroom tile is somewhat dingy (though clean), the air conditioning wasn't impeccable.. but it was adorable and comfortable and clean and quiet and fantastically located and completely suitable for our weekend. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the shower was excellent, and all the staff we dealt with were extremely friendly. So really, this hotel is all about your expectations. Those who expected a 4-star completely modern room would inevitably be disappointed, but for us, who expected a small but functional room in a beautiful old hotel for an excellent city price, this was a great choice. I never write reviews but just wanted to comfort anyone who might be as terrified by the awful reviews here as I was!

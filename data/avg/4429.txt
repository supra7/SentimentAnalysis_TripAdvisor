This hotel is old and lovely and expensive and charming. The service was OK and the room looked nice but the air conditioning did not work well and every little thing costs extra....there is not even an ice machine, which means you have to tip the fellow who brings you that one, small bucket of ice. The bathroom was very small and, although everyone in our party had a small suite, each room was different and came with different things (like some got a breakfast voucher and some didn't, even after asking). The door men were very friendly and help, the front desk not-so-much. I would not stay here again.

We stayed at this hotel the night before leaving for a NCL cruise. The location was great. In the morning we were able to walk to the dock in about 2 minutes. However, the rooms are VERY small and the shower broke while we were using it. Also, if you want to store your bags there when you return from the cruise they charge you a fee. Overall the hotel served its purpose. I would not stay there for extended periods because our room was so small.

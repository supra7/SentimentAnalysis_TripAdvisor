We stayed in the Meddusa Hotel in Istanbul for four nights in October 2010 for a leisure trip. People at the reception were friendly. Communication in English was possible but do not expect too much. The double room was tiny. Sometimes it was easier to crawl over the bed than to pass each other in the scarce space between bed, walls and furniture where our luggage was placed. The bed was not too big but good enough. The mattress was alright. After walking the city we had a good sleep. The bathroom was small too, but clean and in an acceptable condition. Our room on the 2nd floor led to the street which can be a little noisy (in the morning). You might want to ask for a room which leads to the back of the building. Still, there are mosques around which call for prayer early in the morning. The Hotel is placed in Sultanahmet which is a quarter of the city with some of the major sights. You can easily walk to the Hagia Sophia, the Grand Basar, the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet). A walk to the Galata-Brigde which is kind of the centre of the centre takes about 15 minutes. Walking to the Galata-Tower and inn-quarter Beyoglu takes further 15 to 25 minutes. One of the tram lines which takes you to the Galata bridge and further is not too far. In close distance to the Meddusa Hotel are small shops, cafes, restaurants, a supermarket... All in all Meddusa Hotel was alright. It seemed to me that the price for value relation was okay. I can recommend it but do not expect too much. Ask for a room that does not lead to the street. However, you might want to carry ear plugs. Just in case.

Since I live in Vancouver, I am always searching for a Seattle hotel that I can return to regularly, and I really enjoyed my first stay at Hotel Max so I returned nine months later. While the hotel was still nice, it wasn't as good as my first stay there, so I thought I would update the review. First the good: great location, great artwork including two nice original paintings in our room, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. We got a tenth floor room with interesting views. Next the not-so-good: last time we received complimentary water and little chocolates along with a personal note from the manager, this time nothing and no mention that we were returning guests. The room was freezing cold and heated by a tiny, noisy window sill unit. The housekeeping staff bizarrely removed everything not hung up and didn't replace it, so that on the second night we had no facecloths, no new toiletries, no bathmat and only one robe. Perhaps the hotel has been a victim of the tough economy and is trying to save money, but personal notes and leaving robes in the room don't cost anything. Overall a good but not great experience, and I may have to start looking for a new home away from home in Seattle.

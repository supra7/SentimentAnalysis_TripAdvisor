The first few days were peaceful. Beachside cabanas, though an extra cost were well worth it. The service was amazing with constant service of drinks and lunch. The restaurants always served plentiful amounts of food, the a la carte 4 and even 5 course was more than expected. We loved it. Until day 4 of our 7 day stay there were 2 conferences being held of approx 400 people. The experience by the pools was a nightmare. Frat party is the way to best describe it. You couldn't get any access to the pool bar as they all congregated there and beds were hard to come by. No amount of loud volume on my iPhone could drown put the rowdy noises in the background. Not the best place for a honeymoon despite all it's positives.

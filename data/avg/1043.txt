I've stayed here several times over the last couple of years, and quite like the W Seattle. It's a very chic, very trendy hotel with a great location, but the prices are a bit steep. The staff is very professional and efficient, from the valet, to the doorman, to the front desk. The decor is very 'design hotel' and the theme is dark and cool. It extends to the corridors and rooms. The room decor is dark purples and blues. This is actually a really good idea in Seattle, since come summertime, the sun is up early and down late. It makes sleeping a lot easier. They have the W/Sheraton "Heavenly" bed, which is just that... :) I've seriously considered buying one for home, they're so comfortable. The bathrooms, on the other hand, are only mediocre. Overall, I think it's a pretty average value, and would stay here again.

Just came back from a two night stay. June 6& 7 The pro's: The hotel is pleasant and clean.. The staff helpful. The location to Universal Studios great. The cons: very unsecured parking (no tickets or patrolling of lot ( as a woman felt uncomfortable parking at night) The pull out sofa unusable by anyone over the age of 5. Literally 2 1/2 thick, my daughters and I all slept in the one king bed ( age 21 and 14). The comfort level of the bed and pillows mediocre at best. The studio room had older styled tv and no DVD . Odd for a newer complex. Came back in mid afternoon (after day at park) and room had not been serviced had to ask front desk to send housekeeping.. Upon checkout I commented about the resort fee I felt it is unwarranted, did not have to argue. It was removed from bill. Again staff was top notch. I would stay again if only two people. Then again with other properties in the area I will probably check out other locations before I return. (I am a annual ticket holder to Universal and plan several visits to the parks)

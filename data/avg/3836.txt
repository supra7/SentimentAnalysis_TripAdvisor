This hotel was a nice, nice location, trendy, but didn't work for me. The rooms were okay but not great! I've stayed in nicer SpringHill Suites. The staff were impersonal. The pool was underwhelming. The conference space was okay but not great. Disappointed by the valet only parking. The parking staff upstairs and downstairs where the friendliest folks in the hotel. Overall this didn't feel like JW Quality to me. That said, I love marriott resorts, but would not have stayed here unless I was attending a conference at this hotel.

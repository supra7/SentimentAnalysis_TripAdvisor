My stay was comfortable and quiet. The hotel property is set up like an apartment complex. Parking isn't the greatest, it is first come first serve and you could be quite far from your room. This is not the best area. You will be right off the highway and not close to decent places to eat. However, there is a grocery and pharmacy a stones throw away. The rooms are small for suites, not normally what I've seen in a Residence Inn property. They look very nice when you first enter, it is only after opening the curtains and taking a good look that you do realize there is a lot of wear and tear. The staff was excellent and met every need. The breakfast bar in the morning had much more than what you would expect. Also, the managers special at night was a meal in itself. These two things alone were welcomed since the weather was icy and going out wasn't a fun alternative. I didn't use housekeeping as I only stayed two nights, and I never visited the laundry. All in all, yes the place could use a little work, but for the price and the things that did go right I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again or to recommend it to my business partners.

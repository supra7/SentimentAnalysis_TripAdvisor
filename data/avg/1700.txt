Overpriced for what it is. Very nice new hotel. Restaurant breakfast is a buffet, horrible food. Great views from 12th floor large corner room, however, overlooked dock for Dole Shipyards, and the noise starts at 5:oo AM, so don't try to sleep in. This place is very expensive for the room that you get and suites are so out of price. Hotel is close to gaslamp quarter, and right on the seaport boardwalk, you can walk to seaport village. WE ordered a room with a KING and got a room with a queen and they would not fix. The workout facility is nice, hot tub and pool look inviting.

The hotel was close to the metro, pretty convenient location even though it's not in the centre. Close to the beach. Clean enough. But.....I have nasty little bites all over my body. At first I thought it was an allergic reaction, went to the chemist and thought it was over. However, over the 2 nights, I was bitten again and again and now the bites are infected and terribly itchy. The hotel wasn't fancy, but it did what it said. So I was happy to stay there. However being covered in itchy bites isn't my idea of a nice holiday..... Once I put 2 and 2 together on the last day, I showed my bites to a lady at reception told her of the situation. She asked which room I was in and thanked me for informing them. I only hope that I haven't brought them home with me :(

My husband and I stayed at the Suite Dreams at the end of September for three nights. Our stay was just alright. I was glad that I looked at the pictures on Trip Advisor because the outside of this b&b is not like a typical hotel. The entrance looks like an apartment building and you ring the buzzer to be let in. The check-in process was quick and efficient and we were given a map of Rome which was nice. The room was okay. It was nothing fancy but for European standards was large. The bed was very hard and there was substantial street noise from the Via Nacionale which is less then a half block away. The shower was a bit moldy (there were some mold spots on the shower ceiling and a moldy hand held shower device). It wasn't enough to prevent me from taking a shower. The room included a hair dryer and we were also given 2 complimentary bottles of water each day. We had to ask for an iron and ironing board and I think it may have been the only one for the entire place because the maid removed it when she made up our room and we had to ask for it again. I enjoyed the breakfast. There was fresh fruit, meats and cheeses and breads with nutella. There was also a variety of juices, cererals and yogurts. The location was very close to the republica metro stop and there were many restaurants, bars and shops near by. I wouldn't say it was a charming part of Rome but the neighborhood was safe and provided us with what we needed. When I return to Rome I don't think that I will stay here again but if you are looking for a b&b near a metro stop without frills for a reasonable price that includes breakfast then the Suite Dreams is exactly that.

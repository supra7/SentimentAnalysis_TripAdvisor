Basically the hotel is good: large appartments, fully equiped kitchen in every studio, etc. The breacfast is very simple with just a few dishes. The staff is not very supportive - for example we had a problem one night with some of our neighbours who made a midnight party. Even after a few signals to the reception desk they did nothing and it was unavalilable to sleep for us this night. Also we found a bed bugs one day but in fact the staff solve this problem quicly. The location of the hotel is not good at all - it is too far from the transport connections. Reccomend to find a hotel near to Deira City Center - you will have not a transport problem in this case as there are metro and bus stations as well as taxi stop.

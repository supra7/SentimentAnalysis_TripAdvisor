Don't get me wrong. I love the flashy entrance, the glitzy lobby - ambient light shifting lifts with non-stop dj spun music. But after awhile - it does get quite much. Especially when you are paying close to USD400. The Service was nothing to shout about and niether were the big black gothic rooms. For this reason, im glad i tried W once in HK. But once is enough. People seem to be more in love with idea of the hotel than the hotel itself. I will say though, that it is a well located hotel that is placed at Elements - 1 train ride to the airport on the airport express.

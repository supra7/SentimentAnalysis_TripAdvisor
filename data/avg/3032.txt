I stayed here with my family earlier this month. The room easily accommodated four adults, the room was large and tidy. The bathroom was smaller and had only a shower in it. It was however clean and all that you would need. The rooms were cleaned thoroughly daily. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all the major sites and in an ideal location for any tourist visiting the city. My only complaint would be that the breakfast room is very small and we had on one occasion to wait before we could sit down for breakfast. The staff were helpful and efficient. Overall very good value for money. I would stay in this hotel again.

I must admit, I was terribly concerned when I found out Priceline chose this Hotel the weekend of June 30th what with all the negative reviews I had been reading online, but I have to say it was not as bad as I expected it to be. The room was clean, nice, with amenities in the bathroom so nothing to complain about there. I got super pleasant service from the front desk which I liked, and the location was amazing. My only negative was the noisy neighbor (with children) next door who I could hear day and night unless I had the TV turned on at a loud level. Other than that, the elevators were crowded and that's really about it. It's a historical hotel so it was interesting to read about it in the Guest book provided in the room, as well as quite beautiful, grand and stately.

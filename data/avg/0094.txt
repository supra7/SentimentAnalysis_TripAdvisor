Water view and market access superb. Clean and comfortable. Good WiFi access. Staff if asked will help. We had three major problems which point to sloppy management: 1. Our room had a noisy smelly restaurant exhaust working overtime just outside the window. 2. Front desk advice on public transport was belatedly and reluctantly provided and was extremely inaccurate causing much trouble. and 3. Security: Our room was found locked open on our return after a late night out.

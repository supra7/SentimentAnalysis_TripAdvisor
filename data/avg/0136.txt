Very hip, very contemporary......very noisy! Great room (the revolving wall into the bathroom was fantastic!) but there's so much noise from the road outside....you really will be tempted to check if there's any glass in the windows. If you plan on being out until the wee hours every night (and need to get up early) this is the place for you.....if not I'd hesitate to recommend it. A pity because the location is spot on.

This is a low budget hotel with the feel of a high budget hotel when you walk into the lobby. Seems like a popular place for family reunions so you can imagine children, visitors, loud talking, drinking....more than what I bargained for. The decor is very 70's. Large rooms, small flat screen, basic furniture, poor decorations, no amenities. There is nothing in walking distance to go to: not a store, restaurant, gas station, NOTHING. Pass on this one definitely.

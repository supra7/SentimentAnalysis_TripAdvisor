I chose The Point recently for an overnight stay in Orlando because it advertised itself as a "new, boutique" property. It is not. It is a condo-hotel and it is neither new or a boutique property, as the old-fashioned TV and furnishings will attest. Luckily for us, we just needed a place to stay for one night and it was quite adequate but nothing special.

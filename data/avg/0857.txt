I was really looking forward to my stay at the Westin Seattle. This hotel in the center of Seattle downtome offers its visitors an amazing 360 view (my room was in the 34th floor). The downsite of this hotel are the poor rooms and their old equipment. Carpets and hangings definetely require a renovation and are kind of manky! This is not what I expect when I visit a 4* Starwood property and is really poor compared to the standard of the W. Summarizing: Take your slippers with you and enjoy a great view over Seattle :)

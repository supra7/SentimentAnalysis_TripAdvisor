We paid way over $300 for a Junior Suite, so this was quite expensive, even if this is Venice. This is essentially a largish room with the bathroom splitting it to two separate parts, making it convenient when traveling with children/babies who sleep in the bedroom part while parents are still awake in the part with the couch. Our room was in the outside corner of the building; others seem to have other floorplans, according to the fire exit map in the room. We had street views from the windows which are quite high and could not be easily peeked out from. Some of the Junior Suites face the courtyard, which is presumably nicer. There is no street noise, as there are no cars and only few people on the streets in this part of Venice. The room was clean, with nice modern decoratation and furniture, TV also in bedroom. Bathroom was OK, but a bit cramped, with water getting on the floor from the shower. The breakfast was good but not quite at the level of 4-star hotels.

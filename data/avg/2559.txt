It's a Travelodge. It's a basic bed, a basic room and nothing more than a bar of soap in the bathroom. But it's clean, it's cheap and as long as you know what to expect for central London it's good value (at least for one night... any more than that might be a bit depressing). Benefits of the Euston Travelodge is that it has a cafe in the basement - but I didn't use it so can't comment on quality. Plenty of other places to eat in the immediate vicinity though - including an M&S Food store around the corner.

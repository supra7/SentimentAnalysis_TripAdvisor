In all, I would recommend this hotel if you just need 1 or 2 nights. It's clean and handy to the airport. We stayed 1 night for a quick overnight as we needed something near the airport. Our flight arrived late and the free airport shuttle was handy - you must call the hotel to have it sent out as it is an on-demand service. Check in was quick. The room was clean, and of average size, the bathroom was a bit small. Breakfast was just OK - nothing special...

The University Inn is walking distance from the U.W. Seattle campus. Walking to and from the school was easy - plus there is a Starbucks and a variety of restaurants along the way. There is free parking at the inn so leave your car behind and walk ... a lot of people do! Continental breakfast in the lobby is nice - you can make your own Belgian waffles or have some fruit, cereal, yogurt. We also like the "breakfast-to-go" option where you can pick up some breakfast items or have them delivered to your room. If you prefer something heartier and have more time (because there's usually a wait), the Portege Cafe has *wonderful* breakfasts - their specialty French toast dishes are absolutely delicious! Our room was on the Roosevelt street side, so it was noisy. The mini-fridge made strange noises as it cycled off and on so we ended up unplugging it at night. The A/C is wall-mounted, so the bed nearest it gets very cold while the other side of the room is okay. The bathroom is standard - one sink and vanity (with the wall-mounted hairdryer) is outside the door with another sink and a large counter space is in the bathroom itself. That makes it convenient for two people to brush their teeth at once. Wasn't crazy about having to hold down the button of the hairdryer to make it work, but maybe it was just that particular dryer. The front office staff is young, helpful and courteous. They were always smiling and welcoming when we returned from our trips to the campus. We liked the big bowl of candy on the counter, too! There is a small laundry room on the lobby level, and the use of the stacked washer and dryer is free for guests! Bring your own laundry detergent and fabric softener. Guests have use of the PC and printer near the front desk - also free. It's great for printing boarding passes or maps/directions to places.

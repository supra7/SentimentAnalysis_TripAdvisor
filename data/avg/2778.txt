Great location for the Walk of fame, celebrity house tours and Hollywood Bowl, and all the other trashy things. LA locally around the hotel has dirty rubbish on the pavements and streets. Beware the yellow cabs will charge $80 for the taxi from LAX airport, book one at a fixed price with the hotel. Free wi/fi. This hotel has a 'paper and plastic' plate, self service breakfast routine. You cannot get a cup of tea in a nice cup and saucer. Breakfast food is just about ok but no variety each day. Furthermore, you are expected to clear away your own table after breakfast! Really quite unaccepatable for what they charge. The room was adequate, but not in anyway special, in fact you could say that about the whole hotel. Go to the La Brea Tar Pits, very interesting.

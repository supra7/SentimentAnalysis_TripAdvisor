The hotel is located on one end of a strip of hotels. The beach is small and the Marriott, Westin. and Sheraton have better portions of the beach. The pool was amazing. The big problem was the breakfast. People told me birds would fly around but they all made it sound cute. It was not cute. It was disgusting. The birds poop all over the chairs (watch where you sit). Only one person can leave the table at a time or the birds will swarm. We ate dinner at the Westin outside a few doors down (which was amazing) and not a bird in site.

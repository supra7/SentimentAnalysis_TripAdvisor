When we first walked into this Hotel we loved it. It is a few hundred feet from the strip, mall across the street, nice lobby and rooms. But after our first night we forgot about all that because it is impossible to get a good night sleep. A train woke us up at different hours until dawn. If you come to Las Vegas for business or pleasure eventually you need a good nights sleep so you can wake up rested and do it all over again. With the trains it is impossible to get a solid eight hours. Also housekeeping needs to be more attentive, we saw some used condoms under the bed.

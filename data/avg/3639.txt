We have just returned from the OU/Texas game. The hotel was a little difficult to find. I called the hotel to ask for directions and was greeted by a real person that had problems speaking English. When we finally found the hotel, the desk clerks all had difficulty understanding English. I asked for a rollaway bed and with the language barrier that was quite a struggle. The room was clean and we used the free internet on the 3rd floor without any problems. Our room faced the interstate, but we just turned up the air conditioning didn't have any problems. Overall, this was just an average room. For $140 per night we expected a little more.

Ok, standard business hotel in a good location. Parking was a bit high, $40 a day, but whatever. The thing that got me was my room. First off, I'm not handicapped. Why did I get a handicap equipped bathroom? That just annoyed me. Also, if you boast your room amenities on your website why didn't I have and soap, shampoo or conditioner in my handicap bathroom? And the location of my room.... right smack next to the elevators. I'm pretty sure there wasn't anyone else on my floor, why was I stuck next to the elevators? Three days and not a soul seen or heard on my floor. Let me take a guess.... Because I booked on Priceline?? Was that it? Give the Priceline customer's the crappy rooms? Just let me know next time and I'll pay extra.

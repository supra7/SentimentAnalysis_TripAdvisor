We recently went there for two weeks on an all-inclusive basis. The resort offers a lot and almost all of the people working there were incredible. Going to the resort you NEED TO do it on an all-inclusive basis otherwise you would be paying 5* prices for 3*-4* food. The beach was nothing short of terrible (compared to other resorts on the Riviera). Laundry services is ludicrously expensive and if you take kids with you, the cost for getting a one-piece washed and dried for a 10 month old is the same as a sport shirt for an adult (something they should do better at as someone selling themselves as a 5* family resort). When I questioned the concierge about this and mentioned I am not willing to pay these prices, we were told that they will call in the police and that what I do not pay, will be deducted from the salary of the employee who delivered our laundry to our room. Not really 5* treatment for both customers and employees. Will not return to this resort and in future will rather fly to back to actual 5* resorts such as the ones you find in the Maldives.

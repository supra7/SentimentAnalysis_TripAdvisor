Great rooms, poor food choice Building unimpressive as there shops at ground level, was old Bayer Co HQ, has very unusual original continuus open lift shaft where you step on and off. Rooms great, very comfortable and well finished and equipped. No room service menu. bar food/restaurant menu very limited. No sandwiches, burgers or even a club sandwich. menu choices very rich, one night ended up going to pizza cabin next door and bringing back pizza. Bar has nice views and staff generally very nice.I was there on it's first day as a hotel and had a complimentary bottle of wine in room from manager because of this.Location is OK at edge of shopping area, walking distance to centre areas. Subway stop outside front door.

The hotel was extremely well situated on the edge of the ancient city just off the Pizza S Maria Maggiore which is a 10 minute walk from the Termini station. I had paid extra to stay in the so called superior rooms which are across the street from the main hotel & are all located on the third floor (no lift just large stone steps to hump your bags up). Room 310 was clean & pleasant with some nice roof beams to stare at but that's the only pros. The cons were that the room had no window as such, just a barred rooflight you could not reach to see out of or close on a night (midges). The air con system didn't work & the shower enclosure was so small that you had to be an 8 stone weakling to get into it. The wash hand basin plug didn't plug & when you switched the light on in the ensuite the extract fan sounded like Concorde taking off. Breakfast was italian style pastries with drinks out of vending machines (adequate at best). I was glad to spent only a minimal amount of time in the room & when I expressed my dissatisfaction to the staff, i was told they had nobody to deal with the problems. You certainly got what it said on the tin - low quality for low price package from Thomas Cook. Rome itself was magnificent once you saw past the grafitti, beggars & tourist traps. Try to see all the sights late at night because most of them look their best when lit up & also the main tourist hordes will be safely tucked up in their hotels. The hop on hop off open top buses that operate around the city are well worth the money not only to locate & view the sights but to save you time & to relieve your very tired legs. Will definitely be going back but next time will look for a slightly better quality hotel more in the centre of the ancient city.

We stayed here for Thanksgiving as a treat for my mother who grew up in Boston. Bought a air/hotel package from Expedia. We were going to move out to Newton for two nights but extended our stay at this hotel because we liked it. They also extended the same rate to us. We all know Boston very well and we would stay here again for several reasons: REASONABLE PRICE, GREAT LOCATION -- one block from the park, and right next to the best shopping and historic sites. Great not to have to get in a car. Fantastic fun to jog/walk around the park in early am. Had a rental car and it was easy to get on and off expressway to get out of Boston -- easier than staying in Newton or Weston. Yes, it is an older hotel but our rooms were comfortable, nice bed, and we had two small bathrooms in our double room. Hotel prices in Boston can be sky high. So if your company is paying, maybe you stay some place grander. If you are paying, this is a good bet. We had a lot of fun, and found the staff helpful. There might be more issues at a time of year when there were lots of college students or tourist groups running around, but Thanksgiving was full of families but still relatively low key.

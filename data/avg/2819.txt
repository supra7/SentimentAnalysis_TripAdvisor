If you're looking for someplace great to spend most of your vacation at, this isn't it. If you're looking for a good, fair-priced, clean place to sleep, shower, and relax after a long day on the town, this is your best bet. When you go to Branson, there's too much to do in one week's visit, and you're not going to waste your time lounging at the hotel. But this place is right on the strip, yet set back off the road and traffic. However, the Outback Pub is a few hundred feet from the front of the building with live music nightly outside in warmer weather and unless you are into late nightly nightlife, you'll want to request a room on the backside of the building. They have an outdoor pool, hot tub, and SAUna to relax in after a long day on your feet or to take in after one of the many local shows. The owner is very nice, knows the area, and can provide good information on where to take a ride to see the best views of the countryside. One of his best recommendations was a loop that included Eureka Springs, AR. What a cool town! Our next trip to Branson will again include a stay here (on the back side)! - Paul & Bobbie

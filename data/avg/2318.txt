The Resort is nice. The pools are nice and surroundings peaceful. Complaints include, We paid for and "Ocean View". Did not get it. What we got was a Bay View and you could not see the Bay because of the Palm Trees. A/C in the condo was not set up for three stories. Had to freeze out the bottom two floors to get the top bedroom cool. Advertised one adult pool. It didn't exist. You can only get pool side towels from the 4th pool and then you have to bring them back to Pools 1-3. The term Ocean View and Bay View is used too freely. Palm trees blocked the views. The location is good if you want to be far enough away from the business of Duval St. and Mallory Square. Staff did not seem to want to leave enough towels and wash cloths for 6 people. Had to constantly go hunting for more. 9pm seemed too early to close the pools. Staff leaves at 11pm so if you need anything you need to make sure you get it before then.

If you are looking for a no-frills place to stay and on a budget, then this is the place to stay. Very basic room with a small fridge and sink in the bedroom. The room had a bed, desk, and cubicles for your clothes. No closet or iron. Front desk staff is bilingual (French and English). Lobby also had a 24hr convenience store for impulse buying. Hotel is within walking distance of Old Montreal. Public transportation is only a few blocks away. The view from our 11th floor room was great... had a view of downtown and Mont Royal Park. Internet access is available for a small deposit for the cat 5 cable. This was refunded at the end of our stay.

I had always intended to stay at 3 hotels either side of a conference at Microsoft in Bellevue so I could see which one I wanted to stay at on my next visit. I booked my first night at the Mayflower Park as I needed an address for the visa waiver form, however I had to move rooms as soon as I arrived due to noise, despite requesting a quiet room on the booking and again during the check in. The second room was adequate however it faced the street so there was some noise and the room was fairly small, dingy and rather dated in a shabby kind of way rather than quaint. The TV was very small and looked about 20 years old with poor fuzzy reception and poor range of channels. I did not try the restaurant so cannot comment on this. On a positive note the hotel is in a great location which would be difficult to beat. In short the hotel is ok however it was not a tough decision to try another hotel and I would not stay at the Mayflower again unless my first choice (The Vintage Park) was not available.

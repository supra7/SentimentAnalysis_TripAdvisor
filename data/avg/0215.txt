Nothing fancy here, if you are looking for a place to spend the night, then it may work for you. I got a good deal over the phone, and since I was not looking for anything fancy, it suited me well. However I do think they can make the rooms a bit more clean - with clean sheets, towels and a well scrubbed floor. It looks like an old place, it is an old place. Would work well if you are visiting someone in the hospital.Has a good lobby, the restaurant is OK, the menu is limited, but the food tastes good.

As other reviewers have noted, the location of the Augusta Lucilla Palace is ideal for Termini with its train, Metro, bus and taxi connections. We also picked up one of the open top bus tours that start and finish there. If this is not enough, reception will book you a shuttle ride to the airport, door-to-door for 14 Euro per person. The Reception staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The room was small, but spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet even though it overlooked the street. On the downside, the hotel has no restaurant, only a breakfast room and there were no coffee or tea making facilities in the room. However there are several restaurants within a few steps from the hotel. We would recommend three: "Trattora Cecio" on Via Principe Amedeo - small and reasonably expensive,but excellent food. Get Reception to make a reservation as it is always busy; "Gallina Bianca" on Via A Rosnini - reasonably priced with a Bistro feel. "Bar Washington" on Via Del Viminale - cheap but good quality. The buffet breakfast was disappointing. The hot buffet was cold and the coffee was dreadful. Stick with the cold meats and pastries. All in all, not a four star hotel, but none the less a clean, basic place to stay in Rome.

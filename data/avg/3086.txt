This hotel is well placed near Rue Catherine. The rooms were spacious and tidy and the restaurant downstairs did an excellent breakfast buffet. However, I had two issues with the safety deposit and not getting a wake up call which was critical as we nearly missed a vital connection. When I raised this at the front desk I was told to email the manager for which I did the same day. As yet nearly 2 and half weeks on I've had no response and 7 days ago I emailed Hilton customer service and still haven't heard. Totally spoiled my experience with this organization.

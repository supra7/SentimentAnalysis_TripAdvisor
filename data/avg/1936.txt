This place is ok if you're on a budget. The Hotel is not up to date. My husband and I went there for our honeymoon in December. We enjoyed the location because it's next to the Sheraton and a few steps from the Hilton and other great hotels. You do get nice views of the beach, but don't expect any room service or good food. The lobby and the restaurant are kind of stinky and it just feels like you walked in to the 70s. I say spend the extra money and stay at the Sheraton or any other hotel in that area because Ka'anapali IS beautiful!!

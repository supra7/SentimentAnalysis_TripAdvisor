Yes this hotel is fairly new and pretty. The location is good, as all the hotels since the airport is within 3 miles of downtown. I just don't see what others are seeing with their rave reviews. Average at best. Awful polyester towels that you can literally almost see through, some with mascara stains. Bed shhets were torn, room small to average size. Staff very pleasant, but we just feel the price was too expensive for the services we got.

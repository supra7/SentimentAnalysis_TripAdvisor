We stayed here 4 years ago and remember the staff to be so pleasant and refreshing. This time some of the staff were great and others were just rude. When we checked in I had some questions about room rates and options since my mom decided to come the day before we left. The man originally assigned to us knew less about the rooms and rates than I did. The other lady was just plain snippy and unconcerned(you know when you can tell whether someone is even paying attention to what you say much less care). Anyone this woman couldn't care less what our predicament was. ON checking out I do remember I nice young lady named Jenny who couldn't have been friendlier who I wish had been there when I checked in. Mom also found one of the bellman to be rude and lazy when taking something to the desk to be picked up. The bar staff was great and housekeeping should get an award. I think is in a great location for the money and housekeeping does keep it clean. The turn down service is a nice touch. The rooms and the aloha are no longer anything to write home about though. We stayed at the Marriott for the three days before for the same price with a military discount. Felt more aloha there and had a full service resort and renovated room to boot. It's a good value if you can't get a deal at a better resort and it does have a homey feel but i used to rave over this place to anyone that would listen and now I wouldn't even stay there myself.

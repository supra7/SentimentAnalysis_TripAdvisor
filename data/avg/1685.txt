The hotel is new and clean, but I found the experience mediocre: - They try to nickel and dime you: if you want a king bed, they call that a "voluntary upgrade" and you have to pay extra; a view to the bay is extra; bottle of water in the room is way overpriced, self parking is $25 and there is realistically no other option around; internet is extra - If you are not part of a conference you feel out of place (the hotel revolves around conferences) - The location is good if you have a car. If you don't it is inconvenient to get there - The concierge is not interested in helping you out, they just want to answer the question so that you go away Overall I think you are better of at a more personal place

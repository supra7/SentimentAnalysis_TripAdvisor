I wouldn't have paid the rack rate for this hote, but we got a deal with Priceline. We had a good view from the room, but it was pretty small. The concierge wasn't helpful with reccomendations (or particularily friendly) and just suggested we eat in the hotel's overpriced restaurant. There was no free wi-fi in the rooms. The bed was good, but the sheets were ridiculously overstarched and super noisy. One other picky comment was the short sleeved uncomfortable bathrobe. We parked a block away in a secure indoor lot (the valet suggested the lot) for $30 a night which was better than the $40 plus valet rate. Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the hotel, but given the great rate don't feel that it was that bad.

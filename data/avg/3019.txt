Although the hotel rooms were excellent, there was an electricity problem and we had to constantly fiddle with the key card. Location is not good, ie was further from Sabiha Gken airport than expected. There are no cafes restaurants shops etc near the hotel. Our main complaint is that you must wear a swimming hat in the pool and pay 5 TL (3.5 US Dollar) so if you want to use swimming pool do not forget to bring one. Considering the amount you pay for the room, if you complain they refuse to provide one free of charge. It is funny that you do not have to wear a cap in the Titanic Antalya. According to them those guys must be cleaner than us...:):):):)

The Rodeway gives you a feel for being in an historic building, close to train from airport and within an easy walk of Independence Hall, for a reasonable price. Very lively neighborhood makes for noisy nights. Be prepared to open your window for temperature control. Pros: Comfortable bed, free wifi, huge TV screen, very clean, staff friendly. Cons: Not well maintained (bedside lamp not working, safety latch torn from door) and no maintenance on site. Loved seeing William Penn perched on top of City Hall from my 5th floor bedroom window.

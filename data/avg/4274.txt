Well, If you are looking for a bathroom and a bed near the Theatre District and the Boston Common, this is the place. The hotel is just huge, full of restaurants and other places to spend money. It is encouraged. Not many bennys in the room. No coffee maker for instance. The day we arrived was a little chilly, but then temperature in the room could not be independently adjusted, it is a hotel wide issue. The elevators are slow and the lobby while pretty large is not the kind of old hotel lobby where you can sit in an easy chair and strike up a conversation with a fellow guest.

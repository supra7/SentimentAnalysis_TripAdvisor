I have been trying to figure out how to write this review. The hotel was clean, the employees were pleasant, the turn down service was nice with a little paper review of weather for the next day. The room we were in was small on the top floor - but cozy. Bathroom was small but no big deal once you squeezed round the door.... There was just nothing exceptional about the stay, or staff, or room, everything was just fine. If i go back to Boston again I think I would like to try a different hotel - not because it was bad but because there was nothing memoriable about the stay to make me a loyal customer. Oh and at night there is noise, as a heavy sleeper I heard nothing but my husband mentioned a couple of things to me in the morning - so if you are a very light sleeper I suggest you go to a different part of town. Also if you are coming from the airport take the tube - you can get anywhere for $2 and its really easy to navigate around.

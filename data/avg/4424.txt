This hotel was rated as either the most romantic hotel, or one of the most romantic hotels in Boston. I don't agree. The deluxe suite, did not have a bathtub. The shower had only half a glass wall, which meant that much of the water went onto the floor. The tv didn't work properly. The computer didn't work at all. The room was lovely, but the lamp by the side of the bed didn't. Room service was okay, no better. The location was good, but not great. The staff was nice, but no better. Try to get a good price deal if you are going to stay there. It was very average.

I recently stayed at the Boston Back Bay Hilton for 1 night. The room and location were great but my checkin was miserable. The desk attendent couldn't find my reservation, and couldn't find my HHonors numbers to cross check the reservation. This was graduation weekend in Boston so finding another hotel would have been extremely difficult. I asked for a manager. He finally came over, told me the desk attendent had it all taken care of (he still hadn't found my reservation), and went back across the counter to continue chatting with one of the bellmen. I finally had to boot my computer and find the reservation email with the confirmation number. Then magically they found my reservation. This took approximately 30 minutes. On the way up to my room the bellman asked how my day was and I told him I was very unhappy with the incompetent checkin staff. I thought he might have relayed that message to the shift manager but if he did I didn't receive a call or contact of any kind. I also left a voicemail with the GM but haven't heard back and it's been a week now. For $400+ per night I expect better.

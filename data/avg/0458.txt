The hotel is convenient to the convention center through an underground walkway. The room corridor smelled musty, but the room was fine. Although the toilet-tub area was very small, the room itself was fine with all the usual amenities. The robes were an unexpected touch for a hotel at this price point. My biggest complaint would be the lack of lighting-especially in the entry and closet area. Also, the hot water tended to fluctuate. Service staff were very friendly and professional. I recommend the food in the lobby-tasty and reasonably priced.

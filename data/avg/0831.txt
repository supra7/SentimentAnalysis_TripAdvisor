The Westin is in a great location, at the south end of the Monorail and within easy walking distance of the light rail link to the airport. It is also very centrally located in terms of touristic sites, restaurants, etc. Moreover, the rooms are beautiful semi-suites and the service is very efficient and friendly. The only drawback is the design of the hotel itself: two 45 story towers each of which has only four elevators. If there is a conference going on (which seems to frequently be the case), you may have to wait 15 minutes to get onto one. It is not easy to see what can be done about it at this stage. Management puts out signs urging patience, but that really doesn't solve the problem. We were told that an effort had been made to put conference attendees (of which my wife was one) into the same tower for convenience, but this policy may need rethinking since it means that everybody in the tower has the exact same schedule regarding elevator use.

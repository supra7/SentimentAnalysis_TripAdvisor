I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during my trip to Los Angeles. First, the staff was always great when I asked them some questions. But, I didn't have a car and I asked to the guy from the front desk where to take a picture with the hollywood sign and he give a place to go, but he didn't talk about the walk (he just said it's going to take 10 minutes). I mean you need to go to the top of a mountain and he didn't talk about how it was ( if you're not in shape forget it). Except this little accident, everything run smooth, we arrived at the hotel at like 11 am and we weren't able to the check out, so they took our luggage and we went to the hollywood blvd. Great location if you want to stay in Hollywood, if you don't have the chance to have a car, be ready to wait a lot... There's a subway in front of hotel and some others little restaurants. The room was great and the hotel was full booked but we never had a problem to sleep or anything. Maybe a little bit expensive for only a holiday inn express during the week end, but every hotel are expensive near to the hollywood blvd. If you have car, you should go to the hollywood reservoir (lake tahoe drive) you gonna get the best picture for the hollywood sign! Also the printer at the front desk was out of service but the every time I went to the front desk and I take their printer and use it.

First, I conducted a cocktail and dinner event last night for 145 customers and cannot offer sufficient praise to the event banquet and a/v teams. They did an outstanding job and would consider the property again for a business function. That said, one of the main attractions to W Hotels are the fun public spaces. Everything here is being renovated and meals and cocktails must all be taken in makeshift hotel banquet rooms... no character whatsover. With the construction, room service becomes the more appealing meal option, but it is a ripoff. Here's a quote from the room service menu (when public options are all under construction).... "...Please note a 23% service charge and a $4.00 delivery charge is added to the bill. Included in the 23% service charge is a 17% charge that is paid directly to the employee(s) providing the service. No portion of the delivery charge is paid directly to the employees." They got the room service order wrong and I had to call the front desk to request soap. Now that I know there is a Kimpton property right across the street, I'll be there next time... Hotel Monaco. Again, great for a meeting event, but not a good choice for sleeping rooms and no branded W experience in the public areas at all.

This is a good hotel at an okay location. It is located right on the beach but not much of a beach there. I was a little dissapointed with the lack of employees there. For a hotel rated 4-5 stars, I expected better service. I found myself standing at the front desk waiting at times because no one was there. The hotel has a big pool split by a cave with waterfalls that you can swim through. They even have slides. The downfall is that they make you use towel cards to get towels. You can't have more than one. If you fail to return your towel card, they will charge you $25 for each. I think thats a little ghetto. There was only one server out at the pool taking orders. I was a little annoyed with Hyatt Vacations, they told me that daily breakfast was included which wasn't. On the first morning, I spent half an hour talking to 3 different people to fix the error. They even had to call me back to give me a response to the issue. The food there was average, nothing fantastic. I had better food outside the hotel. Make sure you rent a car for Maui. It's really easy to get around. Nothing is walking distance.

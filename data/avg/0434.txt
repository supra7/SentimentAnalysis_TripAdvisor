The hotel is nice, but it is located between the major interstate that runs through Seattle and a construction site. So no matter where you have a room there will be noise. It is also located on a hill several blocks from the waterfront, so everytime we went for dinner or sightseeing down there, it was quite a hike. It is also a bit of a walk to the major downtown shopping area and other attractions. The rooms were fine, but the location isn't the best.

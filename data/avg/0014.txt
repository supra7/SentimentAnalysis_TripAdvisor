Valet and bell service were very prompt. Front desk staff were very friendly and nice and provided directions to business locations. Bell service from lobby to room was very quick. We have 2 pets who we often take with us on leisure and business trips. So Kimpton hotels are great for families with pets. Loved that pet beds and dishes were already set up in the room, nice touch. Although, to most travelers rooms are probably just average, but for us pet owners who take our little friends with us it's a nice hotel. Some "Pet Friendly" hotels can be real dumps and Monaco is certainly not one of them. Only down side is being right in downtown Seattle is there are limited grassy potty spots, so that's a bid of a bummer. Also, walls are a little thin and we could hear our neighbors having a good time (wink*wink*) and were pretty vocal about it. Probably could have slept through it but the dogs kept jumping up and off the bed trying to figure out where the noise was coming from or perhaps they thought someone was in need of rescue. Oh well, over all a nice location!

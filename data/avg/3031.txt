Whilst the room was beautiful the service was not. Having come from a 5star hotel in Florence that cost 50 euro less a night where they have excellent maid service where theynturn down ure bed, close the windows in the evening have a great reception and bar downstairs to come here was a real let down. There is a tiny box as a desk when u arrive the hotel was a mess with dirty laundry carts in the first floor lounge and bed linen drying on the chairs on the second it was definitely not first class. there was a sad looking mini bar with plastic cups the bathroom only had little sachets of shampoo and there was no welcome pamphlet or any of the nice stationary etc we got in Florence. You have to pay for wifi And in general not worth the money.everything is just a bit sloppy.

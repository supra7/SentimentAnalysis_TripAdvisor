While the grounds of the resort itself were lovely, I was very disappointed in the food- particularly the buffets offered- particularly breakfast. We loved the Mexican restaurant and went there twice and strongly recommend it. IMPORTANT HINT- if you go there- they excel in cooking beef- every beef dish was amaxzing- the others were soso. Re desserts, that if you had a great dessert one night and then tried it again another nite, it didn't taste the same. The staff were super accommodating but on the entertainment side, it was very disappointing- one show was just amateurish to the point of embarrassing and the others were OK. The casino nite was ridiculous with its 4 tables. We also found the walls in the rooms to be paper thin- and the lack of daytime activities a real detriment. I didn't care about the beach issues as I am more interested in the swimming pool. I found it very refreshing that the staff would not only bring you drinks to your chair, but also meals from hotel restaurants. The timeshare presentation, which was mandatory for us, was agonizingly long- every time you thought you were done, you would be sent to another person who would lower the price even more. By the time we reached the last person, who really brought everything down to a reasonable price, we were so ticked that we could have been taken with some of the earlier offers, that we just walked out. That was not impressive. I also found that for a hotel so far from the shopping area, the gift shop was a real disappointment. Very overpriced on unimpressive jewelery and gifts. I would not go back- only because there are many other places to try. We have a time share at the Moon palace so we would prefer that resort hands down.

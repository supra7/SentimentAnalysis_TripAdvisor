This hotel is located just two blocks from Seattle Center and the Space Needle. It is close to the Belltown area where there are tons on restaurants. The hotel fronts Aurora Ave which is a very busy divided highway (no turn arounds). The location is prime for just about anything you want to do in Seattle and the prices are uaually some of the best around. It has free internet and free parking (rare for downtown Seattle). The free breakfast is the standard fare with all the craziness attached. The hotel has lots of tourists and can be very busy, although the staff at the front counter are very friendly and check in is quick. The downside is the hotel itself is pretty old and while very clean is outdated. The styling is probably 80's at best and has a few rough spots. In short if you are looking for a great location and good price, and you will be using the hotel just to sleep, it is probably just fine. If you prefer a little nicer style of accomodations then this place is probably not for you.

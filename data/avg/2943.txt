We stayed for four nights in July. We were aware of the location and did not find it a problem. 5 minutes walk to Pernety metro station and then about ten minutes on line 13 and you are on the Champs Elysee. The room was fairly small and sparsely furnished. There was a bed, a small bedside table one side and a two tier glass table the other with a Tassimo machine and cups. A very small glass table on wonky legs no bigger than a shelf which was supposed to be a dressing table. a little stool also glass/perspex , no padding. No mirror above this table.One other dining type chair. Lighting not brilliant. Wardrobe space very limited and only two small shelves, no chest of drawers. Bathroom was good, although more use could have been made of space under basin, shelves or cupboards would be useful. Towels were very poor quality and bath towels were quite small. Limited toiletries. The room and bathroom were very clean. All room doors are very close to each other and consequently you hear them banging. All the staff were pleasant, spoke English and were very helpful with our queries. Did not take breakfast as we thought it expensive. All in all an O.K. hotel , but for money we paid, ( 150.00 per night ) we would would have expected more amenities as mentioned.

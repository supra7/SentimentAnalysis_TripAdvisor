I was traveling through Memphis, and I was just looking for a place to sleep, so I did not want to spend much money. I have had bad experiences with Days Inns in the past, but I decided to go for this one because the price was lower than others. This hotel was much better than I expected. The decor was not too stylish, but the bed was very comfortable and the shower had plenty of water pressure and hot water. The air conditioner worked great. The room was clean but the finish on the sink was flaking off which made it look dirty. Also, it was very quiet. We heard someone pass by with a rolling bag once, but that was all the noise we heard. Breakfast was not fancy, but it was about as expected from most motels. The only real complaint was that the light bulbs in the lamps seemed to be around 15 watts. It was hard to read. If you are looking for a fancy place with lots of amenities, this is not your place. If you are looking for a comfortable bed, a hot shower, and peace and quiet, check this out.

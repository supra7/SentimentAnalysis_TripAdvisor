Super small rooms but a really beautiful historic property. The line to check-in was horrible and there weren't enough people working on the Tuesday afternoon that I checked in. The rate is also a little overpriced considering there was a daily fee to use the gym and the Internet was $14.99 a day (I got it complimentary because I was on my company's contracted rate). I did like the Potter's Bar - had a contemporary feel and was pretty cozy.

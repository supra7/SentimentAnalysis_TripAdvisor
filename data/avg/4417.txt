I stayed one night at the Eliot with my 19-year old son for a college visit. We had a double double suite that was a reasonable size for a boutique hotel in Boston (which means it was a bit small). The decorating is quite lovely if you are into VERY traditional Americana. Unfortunately, the television and electronics are about the same vintage - a bit disappointing after spending a day traveling. The valet parking was painless. The restaurant, on the other hand, was a big mistake. We ate there for breakfast - painfully slow service, mediocre food, and dreadfully high prices. I did complain about the service at the front desk upon departure. Got a simple, "Thank you," but nothing else. All in all it is a nice place, but for the money and the reputation it is an average experience. I am heading back to Boston is a few weeks and will be staying elsewhere.

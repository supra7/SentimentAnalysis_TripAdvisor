I had a double room which was small and which would have been cramped with two but that is fairly typical for large European cities unless you are paying premium rates. The pictures on the website are slightly misleading as the room appeared larger than it was but otherwise it was fairly modern room, clean with a comfortable bed and generally I have no complaints other than the walls were pretty thin and my neighbours doors shut with such a bang it would wake me up. The hotel is situated a short walk from Rome's main train station and 10 minute's walk from the Coliseum so ideal as a sightseeing base. Breakfast was pretty good as it included a small selection of hot food and together with the cold cuts will set you up for the day. All in all a good base in a fairly good location with reasonable staff at an affordable price, if you're looking for a comfortable place to stay as a base in Rome this should do but don't expect luxury.

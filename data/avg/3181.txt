We only stayed here for one night as we were passing through Singapore. Definitely a good hotel for a night but not for an extended stay. The rate was relatively cheap and the location fairly central. The lobby looks clean and new, as do the rooms at a first glance. On a closer look the bathroom was actually quite grimy. Again, fine for a night, not for an extended stay.

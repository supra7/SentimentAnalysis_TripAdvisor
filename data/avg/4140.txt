I'm writing from the hotel, on the second of night of a two day stay. The other reviews capture the pluses and minuses pretty well: Great location; too expensive; rooms clean and in good shape; design somewhat dated. But what is this low rumbling noise that comes from the heating vents? It sounds something like a condenser on a large refrigerator. (The heat is off by the way.) The noise woke me up at 3am. Ear plugs don't help much. I asked for a different room this morning and was very kindly accommodated. Now I'm on the opposite side of the building (still the 6th floor), but the noise is essentially the same. Too bad TripAdvisor doesn't allow us to post audio files.

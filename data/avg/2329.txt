This is my third visit to Tres Rios, I am actually in room 4318 as I type this. Wanted to get an honest review out as things are fresh on my mind. So you understand my view point my wife and I travel outside of the US more than 3 times a year, so we are tough but fair when rating a place. Lets get started..... Food is excellent, we have eaten at places around the world and spent over $1,000 on a dinner for 4 in places like Dubai, and Europe.....the food here is excellent. Room service is average as it is not unusual to wait 30 - 40 minutes........most important is the order has always been accurate. Grounds are well maintained with plenty of ocean access and pools. Rooms are average in size, well maintained. Issues......as I type Texas is playing Cal in a NCAA football game on ESPN......however we are getting soccer on ESPN. The Sports Bar here is a joke; they get the same channels we get in our room. American TV selection is average at best, not uncommon as you travel but usually a sports bar will have Direct TV or a satellite to get guests multiple options........ One concern is there is no ethernet connectivity in the room, nor a true business center. I needed to log into some brokerage accounts and check some financials, and was told to pay 5 bucks for 30 minutes to gain secured access.........not only is the wireless unsecured but the signal is very weak. If the rooms were equipped with DSL that would solve my Texas problem as the game is on ESPN 3 (internet). Shuttle service was not booked 3 of the 4 days we requested it; disappointing as we are not only guests but members since 2008 prior to consruction completion. I will end with the staff is GREAT......they are always helpful and friendly, as you would expect. You could do much worse, but honestly you could do better for the money...

We stayed with our daughters at this downtown Hilton property for three night over the holiday weekend. We had a nice view of the bay, although some buildings got in the way. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful with me, but I did see them treat some older guests with a little disrespect. Parking was a joke at $26.00 per nite. On the positive side - the Executive Lounge, although a little cramped, offered free drinks and appetizers everynight from 5 - 9pm and the Exec Concierge was very helpful. He put together a dinner at Salty's that included a complimentary limo ride to and from the Hilton - a big win for the kids. I would stay here again on points of for business, but if it was my own money I might look around before booking it.

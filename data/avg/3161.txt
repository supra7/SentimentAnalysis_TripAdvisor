This hotel is well located if you are in Amsterdam for business and go to the RAI center. It's 10 minutes walking distance. If you want to visit Amsterdam, avoid it - it is far away from city center. The hotel rooms are clean, the bed is comfortable. I had some issues with the lights in the bathroom, which were blinkig so much I had to switch them off. So shower in the dark... Breakfast was good, good choice of cold food (cheese, etc..), a few pastries, and choice of hot food. The downside was on the tea/coffee side. One machine for all, very slow, you can imagine the waiting time to get your coffee or tea at 7am. What I was really unhappy with was the customer service. I asked for internet access when I arrived. The cost was around 6 Euros. They did not specify wifi or cable. When I arrived in my room, I took the cable as wifi in hotels is not always so good. I found out the following morning that there was a difference between cable or wifi. Cable costs 10 Euros. Just by principle, I am unhappy.

Positives  Stunning beach  Fabulous grounds  Great food  Good beach butler service Negatives  Service is very patchy  Hotel is a little too formal  Too many rules  Too big and impersonal  Completely geared towards the American market Beware that until 10.30AM if you leave your sunbed unattended for 30 minutes it can be reassigned i.e. your things moved to a chair and sunbed given to another guest. I went for a walk on the beach and on my return could not find my things. I found it very disrespectful and complained. The Operations Manager Mr. Rafael Cordova said that it wasnt really an issue because out of 800 guests only 7 complained in the last 3 days and therefore he is happy with the things the way they are. Apparently more guests have complained about the shortage of sunbeds. I can only congratulate Mr Cordova because the hotel is obviously doing so well that a few unhappy guests (600 if you extrapolate over a year( clearly do not matter. I have also complained about someone very insistently ringing the doorbell at 1.30 AM, I was fairly sure it was room service wishing to collect plates. I was reassured that the management would find out from CCTV footage who it was. Unfortunately there was no follow up on either of these complaints. Even a token gesture (a piece of cake? A bottle of all inclusive wine? A personal message? A note saying my issue was investigated?( would make me feel a lot better but obviously it was not viewed important enough. Its a beautiful hotel but I dont think Ill be back as I do not feel my custom was valued. TIP> Don't bother with room upgrade to sea view - this may be just a distant glimpse of the sea. Out of of 10 days of my stay 4 were in a room with hardly even a glimpse of the sea.

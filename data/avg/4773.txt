Make sure you ask to stay on a really high floor or your view will be of an enormous air conditioning unit, as ours was (floor 7). I called for a rollaway bed to be delivered while we were out for the evening but when we returned (11:30pm), no bed. To the staff's credit, when I called to again request it, they responded within 5 minutes. Not sure why this hotel is outrageously expensive ($300?!), other than the fabulous location. Have certainly experienced better appointed rooms, softer blankets and nicer bathroom lotions at other, way less pricey hotels (like nearby Hotel Allegro). All in all, we did have a good stay, but simply because of the friendly staff and location. Was NOT impressed with the breakfast. I'd bet my life that the french toast I ordered had been made hours earlier, and kept on a warming tray. Definitely eat elsewhere.

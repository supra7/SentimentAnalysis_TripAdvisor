Finding this hotel was tricky as the sat nav took us to the correct road, however we were on the wrong side of dual carriage way that could not be crossed - worth getting a local map in advance of staying to approach it from the right direction. The reception staff were friendly and useful when we made queries about Seattle and where to find specific shops and tourist attractions that we wished to visit. The hotel is very close to the Space Needle (within walking distance) which makes it good value for money. The aircon was noisy at night but not so bad that it was worth a complaint. The pool looks better in real life than the picutres.

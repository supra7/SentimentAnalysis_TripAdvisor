I stayed here for two nights on business. The hotel is centrally located, and has very good views from the higher floors of the towers. It also has decent rates for a Westin. However, I've had much better stays at other Westins. I was upgraded to a room with a better view, but when I walked in, neither the hallway light or the table lamp were working. An engineer came after 20 minutes and fixed them. The rooms overall have seen better days. There also weren't any breakfast menus in the room, and I had to call again for those to be sent up. When I asked about the business center hours, I was told by the reception clerk that they open at 8 AM. But when I showed up at the center, I learnt that they actually open at 7. Had I known that, I would have come earlier and saved some last minute rushing. Seems like something as simple as the business center hours should be common knowledge to the front desk staff. Staff service and friendliness overall was very good, but I wasn't that impressed with the hotel.

The hotel looks clean enough on the inside, although our room did smell like smoke. There is a workout room and a coin laundry room. The hotel is the nicest one in the immediate area, but the part of town overall is not great. My husband's truck was broken into during the night while it was parked in the back of the hotel, and his car stereo was stolen. Everything else was left in the truck. Spots in front of the hotel fill up at around 7:00 p.m. There is a security guard outside at night, but he is older and uses a walker, so I am not sure how much help he could have been even if he had seen someone breaking into the truck.

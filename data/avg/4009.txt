I felt welcomed when we got there and throughout the stay. The room service was really warm and caring. People that are giving this place a bad review I just dont understand it. The internet service did need some help though. The housekeepers were very friendly and helpful. When we wanted to stay another night. It was done very promptly and without any problems. THANK you all from us for a very wonderful calm stay. We will be back to see you all in 2011. Oh, By the way, all of our wishes that we needed was given promptly and without a problem. Thank you all again Harrisburg,Pa

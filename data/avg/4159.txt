Great location just a block from the T stop and within walking distance to Public Garden, Boston Common, and plenty of restaurants. It is older, so we expected the rooms to be small. We were upgraded to a queen, but my brother and his wife (on the same reservation) were not, even when they mentioned we were. The bathroom was very small, but adequate. The room needed a little TLC and the walls are very thin. While the location was great, I don't know that we would stay here again for the price.

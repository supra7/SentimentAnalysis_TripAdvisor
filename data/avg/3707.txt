THe staff was very nice and the hotel was located to numerous restaurants, clubs, and very clode to cultural items such as museums. We did not take advantage of the cookie buffet or the breakfast but it smelled great! The rooms are out dated and due to construciton in the area, sleeping in is out of the question.

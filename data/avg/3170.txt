I attended a conference at the RAI Centre and although it is 10 to 15 minutes walking distance, the Novotel was the closest from the venue (together with a Holiday Inn). Welcome was normal (although I could not get the upgrade I was entitled to). The room was all right, not very large, but clean with a nice view on the city (that is more than 5 km aways) and the Arena (3.5 km away). Staff was pleasant and ready to help at all time. Did not try the restaurant but the bar is OK (and suffers from no competition as there is nothing around!). In short: given the taxi price in Amsterdam (EUR 7.50 minimum charge - EUR 30 to go downtown), it is to be only used if you have business around or attend a conference at the RAI.

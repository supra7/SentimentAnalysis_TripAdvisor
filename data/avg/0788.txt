Just stayed at westin which comprises two towers,one has 47 floors, the other 40. Thus a big hotel sharing the tiniest fitness facilities. Two recumbent bikes, one of which was broken and a separate weight room the size of a large walk in closet in a separate area. This goes way beyond inadequate in terms of the Westin brand and any hotel this size period. The room itself was dated and as noted by other reviewers, noisy due to the circular setup of this corncob shaped hotel . Excellent location though and cheap with priceline.

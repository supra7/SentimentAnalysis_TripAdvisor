I traveled with a group of six of my colleagues. We were booked into three rooms, which were reserved for us by our finance manager. Five were scheduled to check in on a Monday, one was to join us on Thursday, and the last person was to arrive on Friday. In addition, our finance manager booked all the rooms under her name, didn't give the hotel any of our names, and also forgot to fax them the credit card authorization form. Our arrival and stay had the potential to be disastrous. But it wasn't. I want to single out TOMMY, who works at the front desk. He is smart, understanding, helpful, patient and above all, courteous. We were able to check in after one of us put our credit card down, and he explained he wouldn't place a hold on the card and he'd wait until our finance manager faxed in the completed authorization form, which she didn't do until Saturday! (We stayed until the following Monday.) When the seventh member of our group arrived on Friday, he was mistakenly placed in one of the two rooms we had already, and when I went down to explain to Tommy that we were supposed to get a third room, he understood and checked him in with no hesitation, even though our finance manager hadn't yet sent in the authorization form. While the South Loop Hotel is not a five star establishment, I have to commend Tommy for making it feel like it was.

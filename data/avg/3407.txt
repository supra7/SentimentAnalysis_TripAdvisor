We were welcome by a VERY dimly lit...too dim for comfort..the lobby has no pipe in music..it is so quiet and 'dead'...(maybe to welcome jet-lag travelers in transit =P). The room size was surprisingly pleasantly big and tastefully decorated...the toilet size and design is awesome! The reception staffs were not friendly (maybe because we were locals?) and seem to be 'stressed' and distracted. We didn't go to the restaurants (although the room rate we paid comes with buffet breakfast) because the food is not halal. The hotel should have a halal corner for Muslim travelers as i see a few muslim middle eastern guests. The pool is beautiful but not child friendly. My kids were the only ones swimming... not a family friendly hotel...The activities and food outlets in the renowned Changi Airport help make the stay fun.

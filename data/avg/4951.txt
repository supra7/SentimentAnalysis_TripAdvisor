Myself and a colleague were in Chicago for business. We checked in early evening and there was no que. We had got a great rate through priceline.com for this hotel $70 a night, My room was on the 19th floor. The lifts were a bit of a faf, lots of people getting in the wrong lifts for the wrong floors. My room was pretty big and a corner room so i had good views. It was very dated and had I paid anymore I would not have been too pleased. My colleague had a room on the 15th floor. Wow his was so nice, very recently revamped I would say and the bathroom was 100 times nicer than mine. The room was very masculine, and looked like the one in the hotels own photo's, it was much smaller though and no view. Location was superb, We only had the following morning to do some shopping before we flew back home. Easy walking distance from everywhere and the hotel are happy to hold bags for free for you after you have checked out.

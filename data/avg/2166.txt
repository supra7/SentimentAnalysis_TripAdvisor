I picked this hotel as I hate long walks from parking lots to your room (Venetian!), am generally annoyed by large groups of drunk 21 year-olds (Planet Hollywood!) and can't afford $300+ a night (Wynn/Bellagio) It was my first time here and maybe I'd stay again if I were in a better room. As others have said - if you find a promotion, you seem to get an obviously substandard room. For example, I used hotwire and got the Jr. Suite facing the street (not strip). The room was fine for two people and was very clean. However, the train woke me up with its loud honking every few hours, our TV power and volume didn't work and we had to call twice to have it fixed. Also, the vanity mirror light didn't work. If you can deal with the issues above then it is a DEAL. If not, pay a couple hundred extra to stay at the Wynn. PROS: - Across from Fashion Mall and you can take the bridge to Wynn from there. - Friendly valet - Comfy beds - Spacious rooms - Pool was nice and not too crowded - Pretty calm group of guests (no loud music, non-smoking, lack of large, drunk groups...) - Complimentary water bottles in-room CONS: - Valet only and line gets long at peak hours - pay-to-use business center - weak wireless signal - sometimes no one answered the front desk

First off late me say my wife and I have traveled to Mexico 5 times in the last 4 years. I have stayed at the SunPalace twice, and the Le Blanc twice prior to staying at Secrets Maroma Beach. So I can say that the place was average at best. Upon arriving to SMB, my wife and I had to wait more than 2 hours for our room which is something we never had to do at other resorts we have stayed in. To say that this is a 5 star resort is not accurate. The Le Blanc is every bit of 5 star for us. After reading all the great review we decided to try something different and decided to give SMB a try. It just wasn't what we thought it would be. We did make the best of our 7 day stay and met some real nice people. The Idol contest was fun and I was an active participant by being a judge. Food okay, Service okay, Rooms okay no real oean view even though we were told we had one and that was the reason for the delay in getting our room, all we got was a basic 2nd fl room. Activities a lot to do. Beach and Landscaping is nice, Pool areas had enough chairs available. The outdoor grill was also good, the Spa was okay, Gym small, all in all SMB is just average.

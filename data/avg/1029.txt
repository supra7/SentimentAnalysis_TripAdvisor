I stayed there as I was part of a conference. I visit Seattle a lot for pleasure and had always wanted to stay at the W but could not afford it. Well first off we had to circle the block twice. I was sure it was there but the lack of lighting on the building made it impossible at night to see the sign. The interior is dark. The room was ok, it was large and comfy but I was indifferent to the space. My room (711) had a view of the parking lot that everyone could look into, fine turn the venetian blinds well no matter what I tried the light still seeped in, this did not bother me but I know it would bother many. There was a card on the night table that said because of the view I get free internet, I confirmed this but it was still on my bill, it was removed. (Why does any hotel charge for internet these days?). There was good free coffee in the lobby in the morning and a nice refreshing drink in the afternoon (hint to tourists not staying there but walking by). As for environmentally friendly??? None not even a note requesting you to reuse your towel. I turned off all my lights but when I came back all were on, including the bathroom, this was part of the turn down service. I guess they are making up for the darkness everywhere else. I am not sure of the W brand elsewhere but it is definitely overpriced in Seattle. I would not stay there again there are way better hotels for the same price or less in the vicinity.

First I've traveled a lot and never have I ever experienced the rudeness of trying to check in early. My husband and I were on our honeymoon and with inter island transfers your flights are usual late mornings, so we arrived around 12:30pm. Well we were informed check in was not allowed until 3 / 4pm and boy did we wait until then to get a room. Nothing special about the room either and I can say that because we honeymooned through all three hawaiian hyatt resorts...which Kauai was worth the money the Maui location is definitely NOT! When I say all they have is a slide that's what I mean. Children were everywhere running around jumping off the side of the pool playing basketball and people kept constantly walking/running by since there is a long boardwalk that connects multiple hotels and shopping areas. Also our breakfast was included daily and every day we seemed to receive a check to have to pay for breakfast. Honestly I will never return, if I go back to Maui I'll be staying in either the Grand Wailea or the Four seasons. You're in Maui pay the extra money to enjoy yourself, if you head to Kauai then use the Hyatt hotels.

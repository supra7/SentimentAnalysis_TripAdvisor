Bed slept like it was way overdue to be replaced(one side caved in like an elephant slept in it) Location @ 1/2 mile from anything going on-had a free shuttle but would not go to hotel with monorail access which would have made it much easier to get around strip. Only plus is the staff was very very pleasant

When we made our reservation, we requested connecting rooms with our children and were told that it was not guaranteed, but shouldn't be a problem. We called the morning of the day we were arriving and the woman I spoke to said that we had connecting rooms on the reservation. I confirmed it as I checked in and the manager said that the rooms were close, but not connecting. We asked her to change it and she said that she did. When we got to our rooms, they actually were next door-but not connecting. I called the front desk and the same manager said that the type of rooms we had didn't have connecting rooms available, but she would check for us the next day-she never did. The customer service was very poor. We also found the hallway carpet very worn and didn't have a pleasant smell. Other than the common lobby area, the hotel is showing it's age and needs some updating. The train screeching outside your room also makes it hard to sleep despite the fact that they put earplugs by your bed.

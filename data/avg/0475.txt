We stayed three evenings at the Quality Inn & Suites - it is very close to the Space Needle - you can walk to the Needle within 10 minutes. And if you're really enthusiastic, you can walk to the Pike Place Market. Took the monorail to the bus and link train connections at Westlake Mall which made traveling around Seattle very easy. The only drawback was the hotel - the rooms are very small (especially two people who are staying three nights), but the hotel staff accommodated us by giving us a larger room. The breakfast was good - both hot and cold offerings.

I stayed here as it was one of the closest hotels to headquarters for work. Yes, small rooms, but that's NYC. + Friendly, accommodating staff + Small but otherwise fine fitness center (it's a tiny room with 1 set of free weights, 1 elliptical machine, 2 treadmills, and a water cooler.). If you're looking for room to actually use those weights or stretch, you'll need to get creative as there's no weight bench or much floor space. On the positive side, no one else was there using it when I was there. + free wifi + close to a nice pizza place a few doors down + room had no odors - I did discover some stained topsheets (eww) but it would appear inconsistently throughout my stay. Some days the sheets were fine, another day - they'd appear. - When I first arrived, the shower curtain had a strong musty towel order... I'd already put my things down and didn't want to change rooms (though the front desk was more than willing to help there). The next day, first thing when the cleaning people arrived, they changed the curtain and resolved the issue

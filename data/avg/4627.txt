Stayed at this hotel for 3 days with teenage son recently. It is very well located in central Copley square, only 1 block each from both the Green and Orange lines of the "T". I should add that the subway is the best way to get around Boston. Anyone willing to compete with the aggressive drivers is nuts. The hotel is old and ornate, with a beautiful lobby, but it's aging and the Deluxe room we had was a little tired and faded. The bathroom was small with a door that would not fully close and the walk in closet had a defective light that they could not fix. The hotel was busy and noisy with lots going on like meetings, proms, etc. so be prepared. I also thought the staff, particularly the concierges were not that friendly or extremely helpful. The hotel has one very formal restaurant and no casual coffee shop, so we ended up having breakfast at a Starbucks on the corner. Bottom line: We paid a discounted corporate rate so I was happy with the value received. But I would fell differently if I had paid the rack rate.

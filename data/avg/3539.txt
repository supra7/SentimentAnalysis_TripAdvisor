so-so It was too high but maybe that's the going rate for motels these days.I got an upstairs room because upper levels are usually the cleaner, less-used rooms. There are cameras everywhere but the area isn't probably the greatest in the world. It wasn't terribly unsafe but I've stayed at motels that I felt were much more secure than this one.The ice machine on the ground floor was not working. Other than that, no real complaints. I only stayed there one night.Bed was average, not great not terrible.

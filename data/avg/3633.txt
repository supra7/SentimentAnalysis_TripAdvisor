Whereas this wasn't the best Fairfield by Marriott I've stayed at, it wasn't bad, and lived up to the expectations of the name. The staff was friendly, the continental breakfast was very good, and they were able to accomodate my request for a refrigerator. My only complaint is that the guest who previously occupied my room *hid* garbage underneath the nightstand where the maid couldn't see it. I only saw it because I moved the nightstand to plug something in. I would make 2 requests--To travelers: Don't hide your garbage where the maid can't find it. To chambermaids: Please move furniture to look for garbage. Notwithstanding, I would stay at this hotel again.

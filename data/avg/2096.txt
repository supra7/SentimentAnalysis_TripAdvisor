I stayed here briefly on a stopover from LHR... and since it was free, thanks to a special deal on BA, I was somewhat skeptical. But, it was totally fine, and conveniently located. I had a single, and it was a true single: single bed, small room, small bath. But everything was quite fine. I was most surprised that, although it was a basic, no-frills room, it had a mini-fridge. It is very close to the Tube. There are lots of shops and restaurants, including places that are open late, which was convenient as a traveler arriving late. A breakfast voucher was included (coffee, juice, cereal, pastries; additional options for a surcharge), and while it wasn't noteworthy, it was perfectly fine, but I wouldn't have paid for breakfast, as there are plenty of options nearby that would certainly be better.

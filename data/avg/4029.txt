I stayed at the Marriott Copley Place recently with friends for a long weekend, and we each enjoyed the hotel. Parking is steep, and the hotel is located on busy Huntington Ave. The location of this Marriott could not be better as it is quite central and near many T stops, however I feel that the hotel only compares average to it's great location. The rooms were nice, (nothing too over the top), clean, and exactly what you expect from the Marriott name. We had a noisy batch of neighbors one night, and called the front desk to complain, the staff was prompt and friendly in responding to our call. On a side note-in order to call the front desk be sure you are pressing the right phone button-it can be a bit tricky! We did not take advantage of any of the other amenities, except the lounge (which tends to be packed, and the appetizers are HUGE...so take note and plan accordingly!), so I can't comment on those. We will stay here again if the need arises to be in the Back Bay area again.

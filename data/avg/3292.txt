I stayed at this hotel because it was close to a business meeting, and most other hotels in the area were booked out. It was ok, the room was clean and the staff were very professional, but it was rather soulless - I felt like I was staying in a hospital - and the breakfast area had all the charm of a cheap cafeteria.

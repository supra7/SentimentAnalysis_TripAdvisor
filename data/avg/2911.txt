Very helpful staff, clean hotel, breakfast great, pool clean. However, before booking ensure you ask for a room with air conditioning that is not connected to the adjoining room, and away from the ice machine. The first five nights were great as the ice machine was out of order, as soon as it was repaired guests stood outisde our room chatting whilst getting their ice up til after midnight. We requested a room change and then after returning from a night out we turned the air conditioning off in our room but it sounded as if it hadn't turned itself off. We called the engineer and he explained that it was an old system and it was the room next door that obviously kept their air conditioning on all night - it was like sleeping in a jet engine. We asked for a change of room but each one my husband was shown was the just the same. We spent the night on the duvet in the quietest corner of the room by the bathroom and the room door. Fancy paying for a room and camping out on the floor!!! We were moved to a suite the next day, it was great until ........both adjoining rooms kept their air conditioning on all night - imagine what that was like!!! we didn't say anything that night as it was our last. Staff were apologetic but obviously the air conditioning system needs updating and signs need to be placed asking guests to refrain from using the ice maching after a certain until a suitable time in the mornings.

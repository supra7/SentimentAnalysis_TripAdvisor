I was booked into this hotel for business travel. One thing off the bat is that even though starwood owns the hotel, they do not offer SPG points! That is pretty odd. Great location for the hotel. It is right around the corner from hotels costing 2-3 times as much as this one charges. The first room I had was pretty small, but clean and decently furnished if a little old fashioned and out of date. However, there was a smell of sewage coming from the bathroom, and next to no hot water in the shower. I complained about this, and was upgraded to a tower level room which I thought was the correct way to handle situation. This room was larger, had great hot water and was thankfully devoid of any sewage smells. It also came with access to a lounge that had complimentary breakfast in the morning and drinks and hors d'ouvres at night. I would stay here again for business, but the style of the hotel is not my thing if I were paying. That being said, service was excellent and the location can't be beat for the price.

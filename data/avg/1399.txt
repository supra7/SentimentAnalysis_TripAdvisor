I missed my connecting flight and the airline forgot to rebook me, so they put me up at the Radisson for the night. It is very close to the airport. When I checked in and went to my room, I discovered it was a handicapped room. I did not want a room that everything was low (I am a tall person). I went back down and they changed the room. I thought this was just an error, but then I read of a previous review where the guest got the hotel from Hotwire and was also at first given a handicapped room. The other post questioned if the reason was that she paid a lower cost. The airlines also pay a much lower cost. After getting my new room, everything seemed great or so I thought, the bed was very comfortable, room and bathroom very clean. Then I wanted to make a phone call and my phone was not turned on. They said I needed a credit card on file. No problem. Down I go again, gave them the credit card information. Twenty minutes later, the phone still did not work, so they send a maintenance man up. He could not find anything wrong and low and behold, they just did not turn the phone on. He told me there were new people who did not know much. The airline gave me a dinner voucher, but it did not cover the high cost of the restaurant. The food was good though.

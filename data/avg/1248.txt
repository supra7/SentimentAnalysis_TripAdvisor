We stayed one night as part of a "Park, Stay, Fly" promotion. Considering the price we paid for a night's accommodation and a week's parking we were pleased. The room was basic but tidy and clean. Reception was courteous and friendly and the shuttle was prompt. We had no concerns and will stay at the Econo Lodge next time we have an early flight out of Seatte.

For the standard one expects fom a Hilton Hotel, this one was a great disappointment. The entrance on the ground floor is very poor and the lobby on the 1st floor is not much better. Both the ground entrance and the lobby are mor typical of a 3 star hotel. The rooms are typical of a 3.5 star hotel. Bathroom extremely small, toilet no lid. Bedroom is OK. The safe did not work at all and was clearly broken and needed attention. No hotel restaurant available for dinner. Limited food available in the lobby/bar lounge.

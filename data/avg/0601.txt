I write this review as a leisure traveller. This hotel has a superb location and the beds are super comfortable but that's about it. The valet parking is $35.00 enough said. The rooms are not modern in any way starting with a 10 year old television. What strikes me is the odd lay-out of the bathroom. Open the door and you walk straight into a wall( you better be sober!), step out of the shower and your foot will be in the toilet. This is not a quiet hotel. The noise from showers around you will not allow you to fall back to sleep if you are awaken. The noise from doors closing can be compared to how a door would close after a 6 hour arguement with your girlfriend or boyfriend, the foundations literallly shake. I don't know why someone would want to stay at this hotel for the prices charged, if you're going to spend the money stay at the Hyatt or Westin . If you're on a budget stay in Bellevue, the hotels are every bit as nice or better. I would recommend the Bellevue Athletic Club, the Hyatt or the Westin. Take a taxi or public transport into town and you'll save enough money for a steak dinner at Ruth Chris.

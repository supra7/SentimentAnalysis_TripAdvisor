Stayed four nights in two different rooms. The second room had a very strong cigarette odor. The rooms were clean and decent. Breakfast was OK. but the meat ( frankfurters/hot dogs and sausages in scrambled eggs) was recycled way too many times. I also saw one of the waiters pick up some tomato slices from the floor and place them back on the plate in buffet. The front desk staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. The mini roof top pool is a nice touch and the view is spectacular. The wifi did not work in either of the rooms I stayed in. I saw people sitting with their notebooks near the staircase elevator area in order to get the signal, so I wasnt the only person with this problem. The location is well communicated with subway and tram nearby. Laleli is a rather interesting area filled with clothing shops that seem to cater exclusively to Russian speaking customers.

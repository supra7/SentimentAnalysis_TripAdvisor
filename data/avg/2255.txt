We put in a five star request with priceline (name your own price section). Trump took our price $40.00 below per day what they were asking on their website. Since we wanted a five star, we expected the hotel to pay attention to details.....Trump did not in our view. We checked into our room and there was a used bottle of conditioner in the shower. There were no bathrobes in the closet either (they are supposed to have them in the room, the hangar was in the closet but empty). I will admit the staff corrected these problems but they should not have occurred. Our door key was not programmed to open the pool doors...had to get a new one. There was blue painter's tape in three places on the ceiling. One of the mornings, our used coffee packet of regular was replaced with decaffeinated by housekeeping (so we had two decaf). Had to call the next morning when we saw this to have regular brought to the room. Q-tips were never replaced by housekeeping. The hotel is about a quarter mile off the strip and the sidewalks stop half way there. No walkway to the fashion mall right across the street (we jaywalked). There were not too many people staying at the hotel so the pool was quiet. We enjoyed the pool, though it is just a square pool no deeper than 4 feet. ****This is very important: The hotel is right next to the train tracks. Expect 2am and 4am wake up calls from the train's whistle. On a plus side, the bathroom is very spacious and the marble is nice. Two rooms share a foyer with an additional door to the hallway so you dont hear hallway noise. There was no 5 star hotel close to what we paid, but I would expect more from a hotel still that is rated 5 stars.

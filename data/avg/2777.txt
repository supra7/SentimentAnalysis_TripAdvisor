Our room was a king bed room on the 5th floor. The room entailed a king bed, large tv, airconditioning, a seperate area with a 2 seater couch , table for 2, kitchenette with coffee machine, microwave & fridge. Rooms are quiet, no noise from other rooms and clean. The bathroom was a good size with the shower over the bath. The water temperature varied, but it was ok - it was still warm enough. The staff were helpful and friendly, service good. Breakfast was included and is served 6.30 - 9.00am. It is self service and consisted of a good variety of foods. It is not of a high standard, whcih we felt was a let down of the hotel. The location of the hotel is good, a 5 minute walk to the Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood walk of fame, shops, bus stops, train station. As LA is so spread out, hiring a car is a good option. We caught the bus to Santa Monica, hired a tandem bike and rode around the area. Note, Santa Monica is about an hour away by bus.

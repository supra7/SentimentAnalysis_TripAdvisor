As a regular solo traveller, I often feel invisible and that was the case at this hotel. It's location is great. It's rooms are old style but perfectly adequate. It celebrates its connection to Hawaiian culture and offers night time music and day time activities - all of which is great. But it was the small things that made me feel unconnected. Arriving after midnight, there was no information about breakfast; no help to get to the room; no capacity to change the hawaiian greeting breakfast to another day as I had early starts for the first 2 days. It was fine but felt lonely.

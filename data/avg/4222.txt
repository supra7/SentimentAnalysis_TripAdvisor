This is your Priceline 3.5 star hotel in the Theater/Copley district. The good: This hotel is in a great centralized location. There is a subway stop that is a 10 second walk from the hotel. With access to the "T" getting to Fenway, Harvard, Sam Adams brewery, and other locations is no problem. Just past the Arlington "T" stop is the Public Garden which leads to the Boston Common and one end of the Freedom Trail. Upon first walking into the lobby, I was really impressed. The lobby has a grand feeling to it. The staff was nice and attentive to request. The hotel offered $5 credit to use at their restaurants if you turned down room service for the day and the room had a Krueig coffee maker. Room size was decent, and I had no issues with noise (our room was an interior one). The oddest part of the room: It had two bathrooms in it! The bad: The rooms seemed old and dingy. Lighting in the rooms was bad. Not that I travel to watch TV, but they where the old school CRT TV's. It would be nice to have an HD TV in the room. Also, the two bathrooms that I mentioned before, the floors looked dirty as can be and the toilet was so close to the bathtub/shower, it made it difficult to use at times. I would of much rather prefered one larger bathroom or a bathroom and a half as opposed to the two extremely cramped ones. I also had to pay $8 to print an e-mail which I found to be a complete rip off. The end result was a hotel that I didn't want to spend much time in. Which with its location, made it a decent hotel to stay in. Would I stay there again, probably not. I also wouldn't rate it 3.5 stars (Priceline).

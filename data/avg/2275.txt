Been to Key West before but wanted to tryout this new resort. Beautifully landscaped, nicely furnished and comfortable beds, but that's where it ends. Advertised as "minutes" from Duval Street but in reality you have to drive or take a cab which costs either way. It took about 30-45 minutes from the property to get to Duval Street. Spent a little more money to get a gulf front suite with balcony. Gulf view was nice, but balconys were way too close to each other. At one point, we actually saw someone peering into the bedroom from the next balcony....ouch! Parking is a HUGE problem at this place. Was told by their front desk employees Alma and Sean that I could "park by Walgreens or Home Depot right next door because parking wasn't guaranteed, read the check- in paperwork". Really not what I wanted to hear after paying $450 a night for the best they had to offer. Forget the fancy cigar you just bought on Duval Street because they won't let you smoke it anywhere on property, you can walk right over to Walgreens and smoke it is what I was told by "Alma". They advertise a fitness center, howeve the "fitness center" consists of 3 or 4 treadmills and a water cooler in a room next to the reception area.....very disappointing. Pros: nice landscaping, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Cons: not enough parking, no place to smoke a good cigar, not very helpful front desk staff. Bottom line, for the money you could do much better!

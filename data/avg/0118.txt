yes, this place is basic, with aged furniture and bathroom... but my experience was by far not as bad as described in many other reviews. The room was cleant every day, TV worked, the bed was okay and I didn't have to share it with any bugs. Well, the doors indeed do not appear as secure but it's not good practice in any hotel to leave your valuables outside of a safe. If you're only at the motel for sleeping, it surely is sufficient - the location is excellent and there were no loud noises during my 1-week stay there. I guess it all also comes down to what people are accustomed to, but what do you expect from a 80$ per night motel right in the city centre? If people have stayed at the Marriot Seaside before (which one of the reviewers had), then of course it will be a disappointment to change to the Kings Inn. In summary, if you're looking for comfort and luxury, of course don't go here - in case you're looking for a cheap place right in the city, it's fine. And in case you need to escape, there is a great donut place right next door :-)

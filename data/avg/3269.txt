Good price for the stay, the service was average to poor, the hotel is trying to be a high class 5 star hotel, however its more a 2-3 star hotel, with locals and Middle Eastern guest., very few westerners. do not book your airport transfer with the " airport and tourism and travel agency" the first one after arrivals for car rental, i paid them 70 euros for back and forward transport from Eser hotel, i had booked and paid for the transport from eser to the airport at 5 am - they never showed up and i had paid an extra 35 euros for the taxi,

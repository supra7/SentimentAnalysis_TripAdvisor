Having read the read great reviews here for the Monaco I was expecting more - especially for the high price. The hotel was only 'OK' in my view. Initial impression on arrival was uninspiring. The rooms were OK. The view from the window seat was nice. The restaurant attached (maybe separate management) was pretentious, over-priced and distinctly ordinary. The hotel never real felt close to anywhere and having to wait for the valet parking every time I wanted to go out was a pain. As I had to use the car most of the time anyway, when business or pleasure takes me to Chicago, I now usually stay out of town and save myself a small fortune.

I stayed one night here. The rate was okay--$158 plus tax--but not great. The location is excellent--across the street from the airport. I was able to check in early, at about 1pm, so that was nice. The employees were uniformly pleasant and friendly, and check-in was very quick. The room was large and clean. There's a good sized work area with free internet (and several computers in the lobby, if you don't bring your own). The decor is worn and dated, especially the carpet. But the bed--a sleep number bed--is extremely nice. Nice shower head, too. There wasn't much airplane or hotel noise, although someone was being loud with their car in the parking lot for a short while. The room heating/cooling system was noise, too. It kept making loud clanking sounds. I had dinner at the restaurant, which was okay. Breakfast, too. They have a breakfast buffet which is completely blah and not worth the money. Canned fruit, packaged pastries, crusty oatmeal, etc. Skip it. Check out was extremely fast. Overall, a perfectly acceptable experience, if slightly overpriced. Would be better if they updated the room furnishings.

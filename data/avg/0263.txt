I chose to stay at the Moore Hotel with my friend as it was in a great location and very reasonable in price. It's so close to Pike Place Market, the shops in downtown Seattle, and the exit to the Light Rail. If you arrive late in Seattle and need a place to eat, the guy at the front desk said the only place open is "Night Kitchen" and it was a nice place to eat. The only real downside of this hotel is that it's sooooo quiet. Some people like quiet rooms, but I found it very hard to sleep at night because I could hear my every movement. My friend and I would see many people in the lobby each day and at night, it was dead silent. I think part of this has something to do with the fact that they do not have an air conditioning system, which we didn't really need, but I think the white noise from the AC would have allowed me to sleep better. The beds were pretty comfortable. Also, there was no hair dryer.

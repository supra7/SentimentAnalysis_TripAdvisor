First drawback being that they didn't have my booking. I'd made it the day before on their official website. I called soon after to confirm and was assured (bluntly) that it was too early to be displayed on their system. So I thought never mind and took a chance. I arrived the next day and they had nothing. They assumed Id booked on some unofficial travel agent website, when I told them it was their official site that I made the booking I just got some blank stares. Fortuntately it wasn't full and I got a room. The hotel is nice, very good value, nice local neighbourhood close to the beach and about 10euros taxi from the city centre. Free internet access in the lobby. The room was large, spacious and minamlist. Not very cosy, as others have said, but you make it your own after a few days and it bothers you less. The hotel is a smile-free zone. The staff are always helpful but always blunt and charmless aswell.

We checked in Sunday morning and appreciate that the lady at the front desk was able to get us checked in early. She apologized for the long check in process as she was new. She was very pleasant and gave us a few different room options and explained the different views. The concierges throughout the stay were very helpful with directions and recommendations on where to eat. Overall, the service was great but the hotel itself needs a facelift. The lobby and lounge area were fine but the room was lacking some amenities such as shower caps, body wash, and no privacy sign which resulted in being woken up early by the room attendant trying to get into the room. We ordered in room dining twice and the food was delicious each time and was delivered in a timely matter. We will be back in Seattle again, however next time I'd rather stay at the W.

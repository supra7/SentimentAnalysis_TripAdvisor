W Hotel, with its quirky styling and nice ambience, does leave one with a feel of excitement and wish for more. PLUSES are many, from a great connectivity to the airport and fantastic hotel rooms and amenities. Another huge positive is its Bell-team, who were informative and helpful. A personal negative I encountered during my stay in December is the service staff on the LOBBY level, who I must say operates with machine-like efficiency but cold service attitude. Perhaps this could be an exceptional experience (or a modus operandi) but given an early afternoon arrival and unready rooms, a small favour of a nice thermos flask of hot water should not be too much to ask from the service team. A brusque reply was definitely unexpected, especially given the significant improvement in service level in Asia over the years. Personal views aside, the hotel is great for business (although I still prefers Central hotels) with its fantasitc connectivity to the airport, but from a tourist perspective, it may be less attractive as it is poorly connected via tube to the rest of Kowloon.

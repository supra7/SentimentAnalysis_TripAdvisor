I stayed at the Sheraton for a convention and found it very convenient to the convention center. It also has many good shops and restaurants conveniently located. The Daily Grill is the hotel restaurant and I found it to be good. I rated the cleanliness low because upon arrival there were some peanuts, loose change, and plastic clips from the previous people which clearly didn't get cleaned up by the housestaff...merely pushed up against the armoire. That said, when I mentioned it to housekeeping, they were extremely solicitous about it. I stayed on the 8th floor next to the elevator (the hotel was packed due to the convention) but had no trouble with noise. Higher floors may have a view of the bay, since I could see it from a meeting room that was higher up then my own room. My room was spacious and the bathroom was nice. The carpet has seen better days but wasn't scary. You have to pay about $10 for cable internet, but there is free wi fi in the lobby (when will some of these better hotels realize that they should get free wireless in the rooms?). Regarding the shopping, there is an H and M, the flagship Nordstrom store, Ann Taylor, Eileen Fischer, and many other high end shops and regular stores around the hotel.

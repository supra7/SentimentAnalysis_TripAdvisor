My fiance and I were on our way from Dallas to Nashville and made a pit stop in Memphis to get some rest. The room was clean and good for your basic needs. The room was small and the bed was fairly comfortable. The breakfast area was small but served its purpose and the food was your typical continental breakfast food. Overall I might stay there again if the price were right but I think for $99 a night you can find something a little bit better. I would suggest you try to get a room on the side of the building not facing the freeway it made it a little loud in the room.

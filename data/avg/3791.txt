Got a great rate at this BW and it was only blocks from the next day's appointments. This is a recent remodel of an older hotel from another chain, but they've done a good job of it. Rooms are outside-entrance and are not as large as the new BWs, but good size and well equipped with above average micro, fridge, flat screen w/ good selection. Bed, pillows, towells were above average as well. Very friendly staff. Breakfast area is very small, but can grab a bite to go with no problem. Standard fare, but well presented and clean area. The restaurant adjoining the hotel parking lot was surprisingly good. No parking problems or undesirables noticed as mentioned by other reviewers. Will stay here again.

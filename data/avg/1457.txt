Overall wonderful trip, was at Secrets Maroma Beach over New Years for 6 nights. No problems with check in - as some others have mentioned on here. We did book an Ocean View (a change we made 2 weeks prior to arrival - from a partial ocean view and paid for the upgrade - as we were traveling with friends that booked the Ocean View) initial rooms lovely but they were partial ocean view - this is what the concierge in our building informed us as well as the bellman who brought our bags to our room - yet the front desk said we had an ocean view (really - I couldn't see the ocean) we would have been happy to stay in these rooms if they would refund us the difference but they said they'd move us the following day to swimup rooms - great, 2 rooms next to each other for us and our friends we were traveling with. Friends swim up room - perfect - our swim up room had a horrendous mildew odor - when maintenance tried to fix, our shower started backing up into the bathroom, so 2 days later we were switched again to another swim up. The hotel had to know about the problem in the first swim up room they put us in, everything in the room including the bedding was absorbing the odor and no one should have been put in this room. Other than the room issues, we had a wonderful trip, food was good and what you would expect from an all inclusive at this level, drinks, hospitality, property - all were excellent. We did spend last year at Secrets St. James in Jamaica - and the New Years Eve party they threw was outstanding - so above any expectations I had, so was kind of expecting the same for Maroma Beach - and unfortunately New Years Eve at Maroma Beach didn't come close to the party at Secrets St. James.

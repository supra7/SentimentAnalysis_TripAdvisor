I stayed here during the U2 concert tour (at Quest) for one night. Friendly desk help but other issues: Don't get a room facing I-5...the windows do not adequately shut out the noise (I was on the 15th fl). Bedding was fine. The workout room was gross....dusty / caked air ducts and wall outlets, missing lighting...looks like it had never been throughly cleaned (which is too bad since there's a decent amount of upper body equipment and incredible views from the room). Garage was completely full, but luckily there's a parking lot just across I-5. Location is nice, too.

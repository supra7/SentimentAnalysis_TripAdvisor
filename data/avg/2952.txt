The hotel was very hard to find, and when we found it, and went in, there was no reception at all. We walked around and finaly had to call, then some guy came and showed us our room. The room was ok, clean, beautiful, great view from the bathroom. The strange thing was that we didn't see anyone during our stay. There was no one at the reception, and we didn't see any other guests. It was like we were there all alone.

We just finished a four night stay here after a glorious stay in Hana. What a disappointment this place was. The pool was very crowded with people jockeying for lounge chairs through out the day. Poolside service was great one day, non-existent the next. In fact,we gave up getting our drink order after our server diappeared for over 30 minutes and went to the bar ourselves.Then we paid her only to have her call our room later requesting payment again! Another big problem was a lack of sit down food service for lunch-there basically is nothing other than a food court comparable to that found at the mall. Yikes,this for $400 a night! To make for a perfect stay they nicked us $15/day resort fee for the privilege of in room coffee (like that at Motel 6),a newspaper and the right to hit the gym, which we really didn't need since we didn't get lunch!!!!

My husband and I just left Best Point after 4 nights. As everyone else mentioned the staff was very frendly and accommodating. The hotel is close to the major attractions and just a short walk away from the tram line. Here is my list of pros and cons: Pros: Staff is very attentive and strve to make you feel at home. Good location. Apple tea s plentful. Had an ssue wth the bll and t was taken care of wth no problems. Cons: (and these are not thngs that are the staffs fault) The walls are very thn. You can hear every door that opens, every conversaton that s had EVERYTHING. No iron in the room -- they wll ron for you at an addtonal charge. Make sure you understand that charge UP FRONT before agreeng to laundry servce. Breakfast has a few too many fles hangng around the food for my taste (but they wll make omelets for you fresh). Only three Englsh speakng televson channels Overall, okay experence. The noise was especally dstractng as you cannot sleep n at all once all the other guests are up and movng around. When I frst arrved we had a room on the ground floor n the back of the hotel for one nght. I enjoyed the quet area but there was no nternet access. Fath seemngly upgraded us to a room on the thrd floor. Had t not been for the fact that we needed the nternet to assst wth our trp, I would have asked to be moved back. Another thng to consder s that they wll recommend that you speak wth the tours locaton next door. Understandably they assst each other wth gettng customers but the prces they quoted me and my husband were out of control. We went to another travel sevice recommended on turkeyplanner.com and got a better trp for $1,000 less. It asks would I recommend to a frend -- I cant say yes or no. Just make sure you are n the back of the hotel and or bottom floor f you dont need nternet access (there s a publc laptop n the lobby)

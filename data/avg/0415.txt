I got a deal of $70 per night through Priceline for this hotel. At that price it was a good deal. If I was paying the $170-200 I saw on their web site I would have been disappointed. The room is clean and had sitting chairs. Almost everything in the hotel only comes with extra $$. I big pet peeve for me is that they charge for internet access. In this day and age, wireless should be free at every hotel. The location is poor as it is right next to the freeway. Also, that area of DT Seattle on a weekend is pretty dead.

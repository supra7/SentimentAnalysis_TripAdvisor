Don't let the nice furnishings and art fool you, it's an average hotel when it comes to the room. Our room was pretty cramped considering there was only one bed in it. It was very clean at least with the exception of the bath mat which had leftover hairs on the underside. The service was quite exceptional, though. The staff was always accommodating and quick to respond.

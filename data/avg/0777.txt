Found a deal through hotels.com for $75 dollars off and upon arrival was told we were receiving a free upgrade. Yay! Room was big and clean. Staff was friendly and helpful, but when inquired about the complementary car service to go to the train station, was told they could call us a cab. Was quieter than expected since it is between two hospitals, only heard one siren during the night; but, was woken around 2am by the person above walking around, could hear everything and made it difficult to sleep. The biggest pitfall is the location, the hotel is at the top of a huge hill and if you do not have a vehicle is definitely not enjoyable to walk to at the end of a long day on your feet. Also, was not able to connect to the hotels Wi-Fi. It is within walking distance to all major sight seeing places. There is a cafe across the street and a drug store one block up, also a grocery store a couple blocks down.

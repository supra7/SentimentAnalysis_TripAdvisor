A tall striking tower outside of the main city, this hotel tries to place itself amongst the elite. In the effort, it becomes a contrast of right and wrong. The rooms are modern, chic and reasonable spacious. Yet they fail on a number of fronts. Too few towels, towel heaters that don't work, lights that are more cool than functional. Also, not sure what the point is about the ability to open the bathroom, via levered panels, to the rest of the room. As to the service, again a plague of inconsistencies. Ice takes two requests the first time but shows up in 3 minutes the second. A request to make a dinner reservation with a call back confirmation fails completely but the second request is promptly honored. A request for coffee in the morning fails for reasons reasonable only to those failing to deliver. This is a hotel that aspires to be a top class one but seems to not grasp the regrettable contrast of style over substance.

We arrived from London, England to l'hermitage at a late hour. We checked in reasonably quickly and, despite a rather enthusiastic bell boy who insisted on showing me such gems of knowledge as how to work the TV, we managed to get settled in quickly and had a drink and a late night snack in a nearby bar. The hotel room itself was very good with a nice seating area in addition to large well presented bathroom and comfortable bed. Our problems all started early the next morning when we were awakened by extremely loud building work in the building opposite the hotel. After a 10 hour flight that's the last thing we needed and reported this to the Front Desk. The hotel manager, Jean(?) seemed friendly and professional, and gave us the option of either staying where we were (in the knowledge that over the weekend the building work would start later in the morning at 10.00am) or moving to another room at the back which we were informed was slightly smaller and did not have a fireplace. We opted for the latter on the basis that we would most likely need a siesta later that day to catch up on the sleep we had lost. He also deducted $30 a night off our rate and arranged for a bottle of wine to be sent to the room. This all seemed fine, but we were a bit disappointed when we got to the room. It was actually much smaller than our first room and it was missing both a fireplace and a similar seating area (just had a table and chair). It was also next to the pool and ironically we managed to get awakened by kids playing there! We also had to endure groups in nearby rooms banging on each others door and chatting outside our room (I suspect these cheaper rooms lent themselves to cheap group or family bookings). At this point the $30 deduction didn't seem much of a concession and felt simply the going rate for a much inferior room. OVerall, I would imagine that when things go smoothly, you can enjoy a good stay at this hotel; but unfortunately we didn't on this occasion

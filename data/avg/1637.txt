We had a nice room, but half of the stuff wasn't working or not clean. The jacuzzi tub shut on and off every 5 minutes. We told the consierges 3 different times but it never got fixed. After the second try, there was greasy little finger prints on the tub...romantic. The outdoor patio only got cleaned after we asked and the food was ok. The Asian place and the beach food were nice, but the Italian and Sabores sucked. The menus were fancy but the food was not so nice. I was definitely ready to eat somewhere else after 6 days. The beach was nice, but the sandbags 100 meters off the beach bothered my wife. It was an ok place, but not worth the money. Steer clear of the sales pitch. The concierge really tried telling me how great the benefits were and how I was too young to know what a nice hotel looked like. I explained I am very well traveled due to my job and the service here sucked. If your food is not there within 30 minutes from when you request it, room service has forgotten. The amount of really fresh fruits available did not compete with other places I have stayed. The desserts were bad as well. I had just returned from a hotel in Colorado for about 10% of the cost, and it was much nicer. The other guests were really cool and the staff was nice, but overall a bad stay. They also charge for the internet!!!!! Hello it is 2010, everywhere has free WIFI. One more thing, we had the outdoor shower and it made a lot of noise in the night due to wind. Best of luck, but I do not recommend this place.

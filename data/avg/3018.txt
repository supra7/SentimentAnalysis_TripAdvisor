This is a busy hotel with many tour groups, the restaurant consequently crowded, offering generally only buffet meals for breakfast and dinner. Not wanting a full meal tried to get an a la carte meal but this was only possible by having to move to another side area of the dining room. The room was OK, but a bit scruffy and needs some updating/redecoration. Its location is right beside one of the main thoroughfares but there is nothing to explore in the immediate area. Staff at reception were polite, good English and helpful.

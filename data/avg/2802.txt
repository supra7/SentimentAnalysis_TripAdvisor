I give this Hotel a 3/5 It was a decent stay the rooms were very modern and updated, clean sheets, and friendly staff. However.. when we arrived to our room the closet shelf, along with iron and ironing board had fallen off the hinges literally and laid on the ground next to the kitchen area(turn off). Secondly for paying $140.00/Night + Tax and $14.00 Parking I expected more.. The television was an older model contrary to a flat screen, and it was quite blurry at first before it warmed up. Also one of the in-room phones did not work correctly. All in all this hotel wasn't as bad as every makes it seem, however there are some flaws and the price in my opinion is clearly overpriced. Good breakfast though, if you get up early!

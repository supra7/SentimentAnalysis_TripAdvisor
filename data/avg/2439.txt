We stayed here for one night to see a show at the sports complex area. It is very close to the arenas. The hotel was clean and breakfast good. Some of the carpeting needed to be redone. Not brand new. There is a Ruby Tuesday's Restaurant across from the parking lot for those that do not have a car. Very average hotel.

Stayed at this hotel after being recommended it for its location. It IS in a great location but for the money there are a lot of other hotels in the area. The room was an average marriot room. It was quiet and clean and perfectlty...average. I wouldn't go back for one reason alone. The hotel desperately needs more elevators. Each time we knew we had to go for an elevator we knew we would be waiting. My guest even had to use a bathroom in the starbucks bc the elevator took so long...and when he came back....I was still waiting for the same elevator. Do your research and stay in a hotel in the same area but not here.

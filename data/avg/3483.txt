Location was fine for getting to a meeting near Euston the next morning - about 10 min walk from tube. The area was pleasant but the traffic in front of the hotel was noisy until the early hours. I found some shops and food options a short walk away. The room was better furnished than expected and comfortable for 1 person. Only problem was that the shower gave the choice of scalding hot or even hotter. I mentioned this next morning but would suggest you check it on arrival. Breakfast was simple but as expected for the price. (The caff by the tube station does great coffee!)

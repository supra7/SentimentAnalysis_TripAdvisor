The front room of hotel is adorable. In the morning, it's completely busy and full of people checking out old school style. For whatever reason, to-go coffee cups are behind the front desk and because of the morning crowd not easily accessible. Remember to get yours when you check out. The room was fine. I slept comfortably. But the walls are thin. I could hear the phone and alarm in the next room over. The lamp knobs require man handling to turn on and off in room 309. And the sink handles are also tricky to turn with wet hands. Interesting tiger robes and socks in closet. I never put that stuff on but some may like that perk. I wish there were water bottles available in the room but that said, they do have fresh cucumber flavored water in the lobby.

Stayed recently at the Parl Plaza as they had a promotional rate that caught my eye and I remembered it was a nice close walk to Newbury Street. The front desk didn't answer the phone when i tried calling three separate times . When I got to the front door with suitcase in hand the doorman just stared at me and didnt open the door. When I got to the front desk they didnt have my reservation on file (luckliy I had my confirmation # with me), While the lobby was nice, the actual room was very small, very tired. The floor in bathroom looked like it needed a good scrub. The room had no coffee maker as I have come to expect in even low end hotels. All in all, yes it was inexpensive but it detracted from my overall stay in Boston. I would not recommend and would not stay there again.

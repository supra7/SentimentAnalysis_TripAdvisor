This hotel is ok, it is not worth the regualr price that the chain charges. I have only stayed at the one that is located in Dallas, i have stayed here twice now. The first time I was extremely disappinted, i expected soemthing so much more and better. Lots of the things in this hotel was not working, out of order, Room service was mediocore (THE FIRST AND THE SECOND TIME). THE SECOND EXPERIENCE HERE WAS PROBABLY 1/2 A NOTCH BETTER. This hotel is no big deal.

Just across the street from the Amtrak Station, the Marriott Copley Place in Back Bay is an ideal location for business travellers. The hotel is within steps to the Copley Place mall with shops and a supermarket. It was quite an enjoyable walk to the Copley Square and the bustling Boyston Street lined up with restaurants in the evening. Room was clean with comfortable bed but the decor was a bit old fashioned. Tried to book the hotel for other times but price had gone up considerably. Can get better deals at the Fairmont Copley or other brands in downtown.

Room 1905 is spacious, but is located next to the elevator machinery, so is noisy ALL the time. The furnishings are modern, in jewel tones, which combined with poor lighting makes the whole hotel dark. The complimentary breakfast is much better than most hotels and always includes hot dishes. The fitness center is small but serviceable. There is also complimentary wi-fi in all rooms. The hotel is near restaurants and a CVS pharmacy, which is convenient. I was attending a conference which is held in Dallas every few years and I will not stay here again.

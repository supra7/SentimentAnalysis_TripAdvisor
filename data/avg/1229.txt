I was in Seattle on business this past week, and based on room price I decided to stay at the Doubletree at Seatac instead of where I usually stay, the Hampton Inn directly across the street. (The rate difference was a whopping $5.00). So to save $5/night, I ended up paying $16/night for parking (valet parking is $20/night), and $14.95/24 hours for internet. I received one $10 coupon for any meal, but even as a Hilton Diamond member, there was no coupon for breakfast each morning. The Doubletree is okay, the restaurant and bar are nice. But unless you have a room in the Tower building with a mountain view, (and you need to be on the 8th floor at least), there is absolutely nothing special about this hotel. I will be back in Seattle next month and will galdly return to the newly remodeled Hampton Inn. The bed is wonderful, the working space is adequate, and the breakfast is complimentary for all. As for internet and parking, no extra charge.

We stayed here during Labor Day weekend in 2008. The hotel was okay. The room was a decent size, but seemed old. Doesn't look like the photos provided. They were doing some construction while we were there, so it was loud. The area the hotel is in isn't exactly the prettiest or safest. The only thing close to walk to if you get hungry and don't feel like eating at the hotel is a Rally's which has really slow service. You get harassed by homeless people walking to Rally's and back from Rally's. The pool area was okay. Nothing really memorable about the hotel itself. We had a good time on our vacation, just didn't care too much for the hotel. We booked here because they were having a special.

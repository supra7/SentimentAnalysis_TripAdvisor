This hotel is in an ideal location for Seattle offering perfect views. The rooms and service are cookie-cutter Sherarton. The lobby has been redone and is gorgeous. I've stayed at this hotel many times and it's not bad. I guess it just kind of boderlines on borrrrrrrrring. There are certainly no surprises. Also, Sheraton will nickel and dime you for everything (internet, phone, mini-bar, parking, etc) . The rooms are in need of a re-do. The bedding and furnishings are starting to not look fresh. However Seattle has many unique boutique-like hotels that offer a lot more charm and charisma than this place. So check out your options before you settle on a "big box" like this.

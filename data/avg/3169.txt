For the most part, my stay was unaffected by the current renovations. The main areas affected are the lobby and restaurant. There is no bar and the food service is basically a buffet. No fitness center currently as well. The rooms were fine - clean, modern and well kept. Should be a much nicer stay once it's completed.

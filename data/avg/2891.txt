I have to admit that the hotel is beautiful, comfortable, and the room is amazing and clean. I would not recommend the restaurant, the food is not impressive, I went to a massage and i really didn't like it, plus that the hotel do not have a pool, I understand is a business hotel in general but they also offer the package of honey moon, so what do you do inside the hotel?? they have an amazing jacuzzi in the Spa but you can only use it for 30 minutes and the showers (in the Spa) are in terrible condition. When i arrived the guys in front desk were really kind, but the next morning we called to verify the check out time and it was informed 1:30pm, but at 12:20 one lady from front desk asked us to get out of the room at this moment (it wasn't a five star service).

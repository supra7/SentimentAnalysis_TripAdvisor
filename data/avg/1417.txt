This hotel is both good and not so - even from the point of view if one person. I ordered a business package including parking, Internet access and breakfast for two. 110 EUR it cost me probably not the cheapest option in Berlin, but bearable. The hotel is about 30 minutes walk from Potsdama Pladz. Not so close! But take the bus 85M and it will take you there in no time. Rooms are exactly what you see on the pictures - you can trust them 100%. Ours was rather small and had absolute minimum: wardrobe, TV, small bed. It didn't have such usual things as coffee machine or minibar. Same time bathroom was very big with huge mirror and the best shower cabin I ever experienced. Bed in the room was rather small. Personally I slept very bad. Air conditioner didn't really cooled down the room. I found the pillow most uncomfortable in the world. But my wife slept well so maybe it was just me. Breakfast was in the lobby, which works as public bar outside morning hours. I'd say it was very decent but strange to some extend. For example it had traditional omelet and beacon, but missed beans and sausages. Check in was good, people are very sweet. If you asked me if the hotel is worth its money and I had a decent stay? I'd say Yes. If you asked me if I'd stay there again or recommend to friends. I'd say No.

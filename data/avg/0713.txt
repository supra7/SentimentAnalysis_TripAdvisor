My husband and I stayed at the Edgewater for 4 nights in a city view room that was located on the the 3rd floor. We travel a lot and typically stay in upscale hotels. First, I would like to say that the staff here were very friendly and the housekeeping did an exceptional job of keeping the room clean each night. The hotel itself is an older hotel and I would not consider it an upscale hotel but we still had a pleasant stay. The room itself was small and cozy with a great fireplace. The bathroom on the other hand was great & would definitely hold up in a 4 star hotel. The room itself I would give a 3-star rating. The TVs were not LCD/flat screen and you could see the age of the room. The pillows and the bed were not comfortable for us. The train did keep my husband up at night. I took sleeping pills so I slept through the train. We did not like the fact that you had to pay for internet but this did not take away from our stay b/c there were coffee shops in the area that did offer free wi-fi. The cool part about this hotel was it was over the water. We did enjoy our stay but I am not sure if it would have been so great if we had paid full price on it. We bid on it using Priceline so that is probably why I title it "a pleasant stay at the Edgewater". I think if we would have paid full price we would have been disappointed. I would stay here again but not if I had to pay full price....so sorry Edgewater! We do thank u all for being so nice to us during our stay!!

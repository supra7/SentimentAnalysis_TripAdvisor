As this is a brand new hotell We expected it to be realy fresch but even if it did not seem ready in many ways (signs whith directions on A4 sheets standing on the floor, no information about anything in the room etc.) it already seemed very old and worn (elevators had holes covered by tape, furniture is missing handles and knobbs etc.). We had room 235 at the second floor facing the side of the hotell, the size was good and it was clean and pretty noicefree but the missing parts on the furniture gave a cheep impession. The room had a bath and if You like to shower make sure to get a room thithout the bath as it does not have a handheld shower. Taking a shower i also noticed the electrical work i the bathroom not very proffesional looking to say the least (look at pictures) and it sure wasn't cleaned up there since the work was done. Another odd electrical soulution was the light. The light by the waterheater and the bedlight was conected so You have to keep one lamp in the room lit if You want to use the bedlights and leave the bed to turn it off. STUPID! The bed by the way was good put the pillows were terrible! Big, high and hard like rock, coud not sleep more than half an hour on it whithout waking up whith a neckpain :-( The front desk staf was very helpfull and nice and the distance to the city centre is no big problem as the tram is just outside the hotell. Just next to the hotell where's a weekend market, shopps, cafs and some restaurants. Breakfast was okej but not more, a toaster for the bread could be nice and more variety would not hurt. Overall the hotell is enough for a few days but not as good as expected by a brand new place.

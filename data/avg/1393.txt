The Seattle Airport Radisson was a typical airport business hotel -- in decent shape and with friendly staff -- but in two nights there we got close to zero sleep. Don't stay here if you plan to get some shut-eye. The first night we were next to the elevator and room with icemaker. Even with earplugs we were bombarded by the constant loud humming, punctuated by periodic working of the elevator. We asked to move for the second night and were put in a quieter room -- but due to noisy neighbors (kids running and shouting in the halls until after midnight, people talking loudly in their rooms, guests from a wedding downstairs stumbling back in the wee hours, etc) we couldn't sleep there either. The hotel is not a fault for loud guests of course, but the thin walls and door didn't help dampen the noise. On the positive side, the hotel is really within walking distance of the SeaTac terminal -- couldn't be closer -- and the staff was very good about letting us check in early.

After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor we expected better.When we arrived by auto we pulled up in front of the main entrance.I walked to the front desk and inquired about a bellhop.The guy behind the desk looked at me as if I was crazy.He pointed me to a luggage cart ,which being a senior was not easily pushed thru a long lobby to our room.The room was well furnished,but for $200+/night you would expect a king sized bed.My next complaint was that the A/C made a loud noise,odd for a cental A/C system.The desk clerk said the noise would diminish,which it didn't.As for the supposedly wonderful continental breakfast,it was a few servings of fresh berries above one that you can find at a typical Comfort Inn.It's sad that this place is the best Baltimore has to offer!!!

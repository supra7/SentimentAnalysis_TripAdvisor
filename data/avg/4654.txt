This is a nice little hotel in a good spot but the rooms are small and the service average. We paid 280 euros a night for a twin, but it was more of the level of a 200 euro hotel, hence it is overpriced. Good points are that it is quiet regarding street noise ( but the elevator is noisy at night), and it has a little pool.

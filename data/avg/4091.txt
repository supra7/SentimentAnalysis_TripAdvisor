I stayed here for 3 nights in early August for a convention. The room was comfortable and clean. However, it was smaller than other Marriott hotels, and the room just felt a little frayed at the edges. The hotel location is great. It was near restaurants, shops, and the convention center. If I didn't have the convention rate ($200/night) or didn't need to be near the convention center, I would've chosen a more interesting hotel. Marriott hotels are predictable, maybe a little bland, but I've always liked them better than the other big chains. This Marriott, unfortunately, was not as nice.

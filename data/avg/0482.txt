We stayed here to attend a family wedding and chose this hotel because it is near my brother's apartment (which was already full with family members visiting). The room and bathroom were exactly what one would expect from an older, classic hotel: 2 beds, little storage, and small bathroom. Everything was clean and the free breakfast was more extensive than expected. There was a mini-fridge as well. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We were able to easily walk to the tourist attractions like Space Needle and there was a Walgreens just a block away for incidentals

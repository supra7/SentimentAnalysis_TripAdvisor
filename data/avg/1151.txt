The decor and original art make the Max worth a visit along with its excellent downtown location. The staff are trendy, friendly and having a town car to run you to the airport is a nice touch. The attached Redfin restaurant is convenient and good. The room while nicely decorated with great, comfy beds and linens are tiny. Never book less than a King, it's an acceptable single and a tight double. The Queen is cramped for one. The window A/C unit is noisy and hard to get the right temp. The bathrooms are tiny but supplied with Arveda products. Book an upper floor as the lower floors are subject to traffic noise early. On balance, I've stayed there twice and I'd stay again for ambiance, location, service and value.

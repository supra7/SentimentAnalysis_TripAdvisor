This property was just OK. My husband and I tend to stay in historic hotels so we are used to some signs of age but certain aspects of this hotel were just completely impractical. For expample, our room still had the his and her bathrooms with all the original fixtures. At first this was cool but once you tried to use it - not so cool. I am a fairly slender person and I could barely fit in the shower! The room was very clean and extremely spacious. The bed was comfortable and had new linens. Our view was of an interior area with astro-turf and four fake geese...boo. The walls are rather thin too. There was a bachelorette party or something going on next door and I felt like I was there with them. The location is nice. Off of a side street so less congestion but still convenient. There are just so many nice districts in Boston though that you really can't go wrong - like the Italian section and down by the Harbor. We absolutely loved Boston and will return but not the Plaza Hotel. If you do stay I would recommend the the luxury rooms with the renovated bathrooms. My sister has stayed in those a number of times and says they are very nice.

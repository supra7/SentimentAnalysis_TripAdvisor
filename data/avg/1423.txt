One of the things that caught my eye about this hotel was the the modern look and especially the soaking tubs in the picture on the expedia web site. I called the hotel to confirm that all of the rooms had soaking tubs and the lady on the phone confirmed they did. When we arrived in our room, no soaking tub. The hotel did change to a room with a soaking tub, but not even close to the one on the picture! False advertising. The rooms are ok, the toilet has been broken for 3 days and running non-stop, even after i called front desk and told them to fix it. The hotel is nicely situated in the downtown area, close shops, metro and restaurants. The staff is great, very friendly and helpful.

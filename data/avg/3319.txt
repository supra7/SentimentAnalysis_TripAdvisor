Small Rooms but good location and views Looking at the other reviews I guess people like these artsy types of hotels though I prefer getting more value for money and less of the artsy touches that this place had. We booked a double room with breakfast for 1 night and paid 29,400 yen or about 196 at the current exchange rates. This place was not worth more than a 100 in my opinion. The room was interesting with a nice view over downtown Tokyo and had various quirky things but again just give me a nice comfortable, decent size room at a good price and I'm happy. The breakfast buffet was rather sparse and included more lunch-type items like beef/pork mini hamburgers then traditional western or japanese foods. I would not go back to this place unless they drop the price. Location is very good though for Ginza and other areas.

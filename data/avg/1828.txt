My husband and I stayed here during our honeymoon. We were completely unimpressed. The hotel is beautiful in the common areas, but that's where it ends. Upon arrival, only SOME of the guests received leis, while others were ignored by the valets entirely. The receptionist checking us in barely looked at me, and even had a flirtatious conversation with another staffer while I was waiting there. The first room we had was in what they called the garden, but it was almost a sub-level. The room reaked of mold, and it turned out to be the couch. We requested a change and they did move us to a higher level with no moldy couch. We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. One of the days were were gone, we returned to find the door to our room ajar. Thankfully nothing was missing, but we called security. They found out that the guy who checks the mini bar had left it open. There was not much of an apology. We did receive a small basket of food as an apology, some of which was expired. The pool was insanely busy and getting poolside food or drink service demanded a significant wait. The food here was outrageous, even by Hawaii's standards. One night we had dinner at the restaurant next to the pool. It took 45 min. to be seated (and there were open tables ) and then took 75 min. to get the food. Again, there was a half-hearted apology, no discount on the food and the food was not worth what we paid for it. The positives of this hotel were that it was pretty in the common areas, and the private beach. You could easily access the beach from the resort and it was very well kept. Also, I hear that during the whale migration you can see the whales (and some dolphins) go through the area right from the beach. We did like Ka'anapali. It's about 45-60 min. from the airport because there is so much traffic in Maui.

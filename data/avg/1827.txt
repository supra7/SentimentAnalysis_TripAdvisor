We booked the Hyatt specifically for the pool water slide since my daughter just reached the magic 4 ft. height to go on the big slide. You can imagine our disappointment when we learned that it was under repair for the next 5 weeks. There is no mention of that on their website, nor did they respond when I complained about it. Pros: - beautiful grounds and pool - most employees we encountered were great (front desk just fair) - Kids Club has great service and really friendly employees -great breakfast buffet (but get it as part of a package) Cons weren't huge, but numerous enough to leave me feeling nickeled and dimed enough to have an overall negative impact. - the response to our disappointment about the pool slide closure was indifference. - the policy on the snack tray was ridiculous that if you even MOVE an item on the tray then you are automatically charged. They did come and remove the snacks after I called, but this is just a ridiculous practice. - 'partial' ocean views are just that, and you see a cemetery, the busy road and the parking lot as well as the ocean view once you're on your balcony and leaning out. In other hotels, I was upgraded automatically, but the front desk clerk didn't seem particularly interested in going out of her way to make sure we had a good time. -Partial ocean views will hear the nightly luau - rooms and bathrooms need updating -I never figured out what I was getting for a daily $15 resort fee on top of my bill - dial up?? Are they kidding me? All in all, most of our issues could have been resolved with better customer service from the front desk in particular. Since it's in an unbeatable location, with a beautiful lobby and pool, I'd recommend to a friend with the caveats above in the hopes they could get a good deal.

We chose this hotel because of the price, so didn't have high expectations. The front desk staff here could not be more helpful. Their knowledge of the neighborhood and recommendations for local eateries were great. One of our group had a dental emergency, and the staff arranged appointments with an excellent dentist right away. The rooms were clean and the continental breakfast was better than we had expected. While not the hotel's fault, it was hot in London, and the London Visitors Hotel has no A/C. Open windows cooled the rooms at night, but the traffic noise was disturbing at best. The nearest tube station is Kensington (Olympia) Zone 2. If you're looking for a clean, inexpensive hotel in a safe neighborhood, consider this one. Be sure to bring your earplugs.

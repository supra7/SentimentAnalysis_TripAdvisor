Palmer House Hilton in Downtown Chicago, IL Date: Labor Day Weekend 2008 Reviewer: Couple from Louisville, KY going to have fun for the weekend! The hotel is historic and beautiful! But beware when the first thing they ask you when you check in is, "Would you like to upgrade your room for $55.00 a nite ?" Our room was very expensive to begin with, but in a great location for us. The size of the room was fine, but for an expensive hotel it had just a full size bed! There was plenty of room for a queen size, but they want you to upgrade for the $55.00! to get a queen size bed. Also wifi was $18.00 a day...in the UPS buisness center they charged by the 15 minutes to use the internet. The pool was closed and the gym cost $18.00 a day! This hotel just kept having charges for every little thing. They are plenty of hotels in downtown Chicago in great locations that include all of these extras in the nightly room fee. I will be choosing one of them next time!

For the price of the room I could have stayed at much nicer and classier hotels. I had always imagined the W chain to be a 5 star establishment, but the standard room that I was booked into was 3 star at best. The room appeared recently remodeled, but was definitely not on par with the cost of staying there. Finishes were not typical of the high-end fixtures one would expect at the W. It appeared as if this hotel was getting by on name only, and travelers were willing to pay exorbitant prices to stay at this one in Seattle. The lobby however, was more impressive and very hip, catering to the 20-something crowd (I arrived on a weekend at night and the first floor reminded me of a packed club). Perhaps the hotel was trying to impress the X-generation with the lobby, thinking that most of them would be too trashed later to remember what the room looks like? Needless to say, I ended my stay at one night only and transferred to a true 5 star hotel nearby.

Unfortunately I made a bad mistake booking this hotel... I read all these reviews after I booked and paid for my accomodation! Something I'll never do again. This hotel does NOT deserve a 4 star rating, it deserves nothing more than 3 stars... The rooms are tiny.... I probably would have had more room in a storage closet. The rooms are old and boring and you there seems to me absolutely no circulation of air in the rooms unless you turn the air-con on. The rooms don't contain any information about the hotel, the area, the room service or the channels available on the TV... this is something every hotel I've ever stayed in has provided... including those with lower star ratings. I don't really spend much time in my hotel rooms... but I did expect a degree of quality... especially with a 4 star rating and the price that I paid.... I could have got something a little closer to the city with better reviews for only a little more. Overall I regret my decision to stay at this hotel, especially considering how misleading 4 stars actually is... and I'd probably never return to the hotel... However on a positive note the buffet breakfast was cheap and filling! That's the only positive I can find.

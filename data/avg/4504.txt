As many other reviewers have already stated, the hotel's location is its strongest point. It is centrally located, public parking is next door, subway station around the corner along with theatres, shops, restaurants and many tourist sites. We found the hotel to be clean and well maintained. Staff were friendly and courteous. My only concern was the nickel and diming of extra fees in addition to a $300/night rate (without breakfast) that we paid. I was very annoyed to find there was no free internet access in rooms or in the shared business center on the first floor. However, you can buy internet access at a mere cost of $26/hour. That's outrageous. The Hyatt is very large and accommodates conferences, conventions and corporate clients. Apparently, they don't care what individual customers want or experience, so I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a better value and a more positive experience. Now I understand why the Hyatt is ranked a "C" by reviewers (56 out of 73 hotels) in Boston.

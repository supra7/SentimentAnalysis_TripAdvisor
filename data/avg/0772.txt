Let me first start by saying that I will never use Priceline.com again. I had never used it before and thought.....what the heck, I'll try anything once! I put in a price of $150 and Hotel Edgewater came back as the hotel that accepted my bid. Well after the taxes and parking ($25) our total room cost was about $210.... The hotel has great views.... but thats it! The rooms are cute, but super small. So small our suitcase had no place to even rest. The balcony, which looked to the south over the ocean was old and looked unsafe. All balconys are connected so you dont have your own, just a little privacy half wall that seperates yours from your neighbors, which means you cant keep your balcony door open all night because it would not be safe. The check in went smooth and they were gracious and nice. Parking was outragous..... Overall, so-so. When I go to Seattle next time I would rather choose my hotel and know exactly what I am getting.

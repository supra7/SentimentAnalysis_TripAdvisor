Spent two single nights at this hotel (with a day between) so saw two different rooms. The first room was smaller than the second, which was impressively large (large enough to have two beds, and still let me do my exercises without moving them. The hotel was clean, and most of the staff were friendly. The shuttle service was very reliable and it is very close to the airport, and many nice restaurants. The rooms had too few electric outlets and I had to move furniture and unplug lamps to plug in my computer and cell phone at the same time. The rooms are not well soundproofed and I heard the airplanes at a volume that was worse than most airport hotels I've stayed at. Overall, it met my needs for a clean bed and an early (5 AM breakfast before a flight) and was a good value.

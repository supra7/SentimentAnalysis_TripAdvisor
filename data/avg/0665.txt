The location is great ; near bars & restaurants, and a short walk to Pike's market etc but relatively quiet. Attracts stylish young guests . The room was lovely and spotless but sacrificed usefulness for looks. Example: akward & noisey pocket doors on the bathroom and a bed with a frame that juts out in a way perfectly designed to attack your shins. Service was mixed. When we checked in, the desk was rude and clueless. Luckily after a while, a manager swooped in and sorted things out. My rating would be much lower if that had not happened. Overall, I would not hesitate to stay here again but it would not be my first choice.

We have traveled to Vegas 10 plus times and have chosen to stay in many different hotels with all different ratings. My expectation for the Trump was high, however I was sadly disappointed. The location is fairly central but there is limited other services around. We do not gamble so it was a bonus that there was no smoky casino. On several mornings we were woken up at 9am by staff. Once by maid (we had the do not disturbed button pressed) and once by window washers.(It's Vegas.....we hadn't been in bed long) The rooms were average, and the shower system needs to be upgraded. This is not on the strip, however but you heard an unusual amount street noise. We were on the 37th floor. Water was either extremely cold or extremely hot ~ even after running for several minutes. We traveled with several other couples and the front desk continued to get us mixed up even though we were in separate rooms. To check in online for am flights we would have had to purchase time online in business center to print off boarding passes. We went to front desk to get done, however they lacked the skill to do online checkin so took a very long time for this simple task. We were very pleased with the staff who did assist and the night manager that helped get boarding passes. We also were very impressed with the limo/transportation services offered. Some rooms were already showing signs of wear and they are not very old. Towels were dirty/stained and had holes. We did call for new ones however some days we didn't receive towels/bathmats. We called for items such as an ice bucket and menu. We never did receive them.

Ive been to Seattle dozens of times, but had never stayed at the W. Im usually in the Sheraton that is only a few blocks away, but I thought this time around I would try something different. We were checked into our room by an agent with minimal friendliness. Not very welcoming. The rooms are classic W in dcor and classic W by charging for everything! The bathroom had some mild mildew in the shower and the return air vents were pretty dusty, which turned me off a bit. Upon checkout I notified the agent (same guy) of the issue and he responded with  Oh Sorry. Now for the good points. This property is in a great location; heart of downtown. Located only a few blocks from a light rail station and well within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. The bed is amazing  super comfortable with excellent pillows. This alone was worth the other inconveniences. Overall, I would not recommend this property, rather, I would recommend their sister property, the Sheraton.

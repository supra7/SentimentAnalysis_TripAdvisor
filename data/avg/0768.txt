I stayed for 2 nights while visiting family. I booked though priceline and after reading other online reviews, I was somewhat pleased with my stay. First off, if you do book through priceline then seem to give you 2 twin beds which were barely long enough for me (6ft) and the heating system is dificult to operate. The fireplace is nice though. Parking is 28/day which is pretty steap and hard to find offsite parking. The next moring we were told we could upgrade to a king bed and water side room for an extra 50 a night. We did and it was a much better room. Great view and larger bed. Just be away the cruise terminal is next door so you might have an alaskian cruiseship in your view for most the day. I stayed at the Seattle Sheraton the following night and for 180 on priceline I liked that hotel much better.

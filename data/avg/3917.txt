We enjoyed our stay. Our two bedroom suite was nice. The bedrooms were too crowded with the free standing closet. We had to dress outside in the living room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Parking was not convenient. Trying to access our room with my 93 year old mother was difficult. She was fearful of walking at night on the stone path, so she elected to stay in the room and not attend the rehearsal party. We tried to park in the back for just 10 minutes so she did not have to walk so far but the neighbor complained and the staff moved our car. When I arrived with my mother, the car was moved so we had to return to the room and start over. Parking is going to continue to be an issue for the hotel.

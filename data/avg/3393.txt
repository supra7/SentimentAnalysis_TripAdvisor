As has been said, Great Southern is close to the Central Station, and it's easy enough to wave down a taxi. It's on George Street, close to Chinatown and within walking distance of Darling Harbour. You can catch the train or hop onto the Sydney Explorer bus at Central to see other tourist attractions. In the lobby of the hotel, there are brochures and maps of places and things to see. I paid AUD 400 for 5 nights in a room with a standard Queen bed - the room and ensuite were all right and well-maintained. The problem I had was that the windows didn't open, and I couldn't adjust the air-conditioner to less than 20 degrees Celcius. Given that I'd just arrived from NZ (around 3 degrees Celcius!) and it was unseasonably warm in Sydney for winter, it was almost unbearable. Also, what I paid was just for the room - anything extra such as broadband access, laundry, gym access, and breakfast had to be paid for. I couldn't find any listed charges for internet access either, although someone else's review says it's about 27 AUD. But there are nearby internet cafes! On the whole, Great Southern was still a great place to stay, especially if you're just looking for someplace to stay at night while you stay out all day.

A modern and clean hotel with good friendly and helpful staff, breakfast was a continental buffet with enough choice to start your day. The location is excellent, 1 minute walk and you are right in the middle of the Ramblas and walking to the Harbour and Cathedral is no problem. The letdown was the room, we had so much to see that luckily we didn't spend too much time there but it was small and basic, no bath, no furniture just a rail and a couple of shelves and a very small balcony that we couldn't open the door to due to the fact the neighbours had their TV on mega-loud, however the room did have AC which worked quite well. If we could book again we'd spend the extra money as at 100 a night this didn't feel like great value.

My girlfriend and i went from 03/24-03/30/04. I'd been to maui three previous times, but she hadn't. i was familiar with the kaanapali area and was looking for a hotel with a good location. After reading some of these reviews, i was somewhat leary about the accomidations. We decided to give it a try because of the loctation and price. When we arrived i was pleasantly surprised. We checked in with no problems. We paid for a garden view, but were upgraded to an oceanview to our surprise. The room was outstanding. very clean and appeared to have recently been renovated. We were on the fifth story in the maui wing. Our lanai overlooked the hotel grounds and the ocean. We didn't eat at the hotel except for one morning at the free buffet. It was terrible. After that we'd eat breakfast at the nearby reasturants at whaler's village or we went to the breakfast buffet at the hyatt twice. I will say that the two women at the activities desk were a little rude and almost no help. I asked about things to do and one handed me a book and continued talking to her co-worker about personal stuff. We decided to go into lahaina and see what we could find. We ended up booking almost all of our activities through a place called "barefoot" something. Can't remember the whole name, but it was great. They were very helpful and we booked five things through them. They have nothing to do with timeshares. If you want to take in a show, i highly recommend "ulalena." Great show with even better music. All in all we enjoyed our stay at KBH. The evening shows were very nice and we would sit on the lanai and relaxe while listening to the music. I guess the big question is, would we stay there again? yes we would, but you shouldn't expect the large pools and waterfalls you'll find at some of the other hotels. You also won't find the fancy restaurants, but you can walk to the other hotels on the walkway that runs the entire length of the beach.

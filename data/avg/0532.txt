I stayed at this hotel for my company's training event at the Washington State Convention Center next door. The hotel shows a bit of age. Most hotels spruce up the lobby and common areas and neglect the guest rooms with older properites. The halways in this hotel were stained and looked disgusting, but the rooms were in decent shape. I seemed to have alergies to the room, however, so sensitive travelers may want to take their alergy pills. Overall, I rate this as a mediocre hotel for the level.

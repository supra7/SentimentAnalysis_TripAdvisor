My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel while visiting Venice. Although this was not my favorite hotel stay, it was not that bad either. The positives about this hotel is the location and the breakfast. If you are looking to stay away from the main center of Venice than this is perfect. I would have loved to stay a little closer to the main square but this was not far at all. The hotel breakfast was really good and as a celiac I found many things I could eat including eggs, fruit and meat. The hotel staff were decent but definitly not overly nice. I personally would have been very grateful if they could have helped more with finding a gluten free restaurant. A few times I asked the staff to call a place to see if I could eat there and they really made me feel like I was bothering them. My husband and I both felt as though the staff could have been a lot more helpful and warm. Every hotel we stayed at was very helpful with helping me find places to eat except this one. The bed was also not my favorite at all. Basically it was 2 twin beds pushed together and so you could really feel the slit down the middle. It was not very comfortable but I will say it was very clean. I would personally never stay here again but it really is not bad for a quick stay at a moderate price.

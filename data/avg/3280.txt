The hotel is far away from the city centre. rom Termini station, u need to take the Bus 90 or 90D. Its about 15-20 minutes and you will need to wait for about 15-20 mins for the bus as well. Because of this i stayed in hotel for 2 nights only instead of 4 nights and shifted to another hotel near the termini for the same price! Hotel is clean and basic. Breakfast is what you would expect. Internet was free if u had yr own lap top. Stayed on the 2nd floor and as there was no air con, had to open the windows, so it was very noisy. Also, the walk from the bus stop to the hotel is about 300 meters, and at night, it might not be safe. Overall was alright but wont be going back.......

Stayed here for 3 nights from Friday to Monday. Arrived hotel at about 11:35AM and room was not ready. Returned at about 2PM and was assigned a room. Booked a deluxe room which is about 100 sq. ft. bigger than than the standard room. This hotel is 100 years old and although it has obviously been updated over time, it is showing it's age such as the noisy air conditioner and small closet. The bathroom is small too. Amenities of this high 4 star hotel are surprisingly basic. There is no coffee making machine in the room and also has no free Internet access. Even the 2-star HI Express has those. The bathroom amenities are limited to the standard shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. My room and furnishing were otherwise in satisfactory condition. Sound insulation was not very good and you can hear people walking pass. Room service for a continental breakfast is US$21 plus US$4.50 "delivery charge". This is the first time that I saw a "delivery charge" for room service. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. My room has only one tiny window, probably reflective of the design of the era when the hotel was built. The location of this hotel is directly across from Copley Square and is 5 minutes' walk to the Copley T station and 10 minutes to the Prudential Shopping Centre. However, I think the Westin and the Mandarin Orient are superior by their connected walkway to the Prudential Centre which is helpful in foul weather. Valet parking is US$42 per night but there is a public parking garage immediately behind the hotel. All in all, this is an okay hotel if you find a good rate.

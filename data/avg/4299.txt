We booked a hotel on Priceline and this is what we got. It is a nice hotel for the price we paid (less than $100.00) but nothing great. The lobby is outstanding but the rooms are average. The carpet could be replaced. The front desk clerk we interacted with seemed robotic and indifferent. I will say the food from room service was outstanding, although a bit pricey. I would stay here again at the rate we received from Priceline but would not pay full rate for this hotel.

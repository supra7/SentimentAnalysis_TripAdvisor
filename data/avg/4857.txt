Stayed here for one night and wasn't impressed. To be fair, there was a large restaurant convention/trade show going on in Chicago, but then again - when ISN'T there always a large convention in Chicago? The hotel was extremely busy and crowded. Check-in took forever and when I got to my room, I discovered it was a smoking room. Went back and had to stand in line all over again... the staff were pleasant, but I was not impressed with all the extra charges. Not only was it extra to use the internet (which I've come to expect) but also to use the fitness centre? They try to sell you a "business package" for an extra $20 that includes internet and fitness, but that's just cheap. Rooms were incredibly small and the bathroom especially so. I didn't use the pool (was over-run with kids/families when I checked) or fitness room. The lobby and central bar area is gorgeous due to the history and heritage, and the location very central, but I would never stay here again, especially since it cost almost $300 for one night including taxes!

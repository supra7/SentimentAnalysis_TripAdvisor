We were excited about getting a room for less than $100 in downtown Seattle...but.... As the other reviews state, you do hear a lot of traffic noise, even on the west side. Barely a view of the water, since there are so many other tall buildings blocking the view. Very good appetizers for the $2 happy hour price. Room very clean, roomy. No bargains for us, since we reserved on hotwire... Others have mentioned free parking, free desserts, free breakfast, etc., but not with our budget reservations... I guess you pay one way or the other - parking was too expensive and we didn't get a break... We enjoyed it, anyway. Would choose a different hotel next time, though. No microwave, small shelves in small refrigerator - couldn't put our leftovers in it... Loved the pillows & feather comforter...

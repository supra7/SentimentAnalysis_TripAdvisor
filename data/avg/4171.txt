The Boston Park Plaza Hotel is in a terrific location and the lobby is beautiful. We booked a double well in advance of our visit. When we arrived, there were no doubles available, and we were offered a room with a queen size bed and a roll away bed. The room beautiful -- if dated -- but it was the exact size of a postage stamp and it looked out to a brick wall. The only place to put the roll away would block access to the bathroom. Back to the front desk we went where there was much lip biting and delay. After my demeanor shifted from understanding to assertive we were finally given a corner suite, which had an AMAZING view, huge living-sleeping area with fold-out couch, coffee table, three or four arm chairs, potted palms, fridge, king sized bed, bath with double sinks and separate toilet-bath area with giant square tub. All of the furnishings were somewhat dated, but we could have hosted a cocktail party with all the space. The bed comfort was fantastic. The fold out couch, not so much. TVs are old school console models. Parking is not provided by the hotel and is a to-be-expected high city rate ($35/day, no in and out). To be expected. We didn't dine at the hotel. Taxis are lined up outside and the T is nearby. So much is available within walking distance. Having seen two rooms, I was startled by the contrast. I would definitely stay there again but I would insist on a room on a higher floor that has a view. The small room would have been fine if it had the terrific view that the suite had and if we didn't need space for an extra person. Shop price as there was a huge variability between the hotel site and some of the travel sites. We got the best rate using hotels.com (at least $40 less than the others). This would probably not be a great place if you are travelling with children, but the "old world luxury" vibe made for a positive experience.

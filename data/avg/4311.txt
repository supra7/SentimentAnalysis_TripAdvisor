I stayed at this hotel for work, and it was acceptable. It was close to Boston Common but be prepared to walk about 10 to 15 minutes to the more interesting parts of The Freedom Trail. I ended up staying in two different rooms (not the hotel's fault). The first one was really nice with double beds and was spacious with a full walk-in closet. The bathrooms are small, but this didn't bother me that much. The second room I stayed in also had double beds, but was significantly smaller. It smelled like smoke even though we were on a non-smoking floor. We were told when we checked in (very, very late at night) that the type of room we had reserved was not available. They said that a reservation guarantees a room, but not the type of room. They did manage to get us in the room we reserved, but co-workers who checked in on another day were not so lucky. Tip: Check in as early as possible to get the room you want, especially if they are hosting a conference. All in all, the hotel was nice enough if you get a deal for it. Don't pay full price to stay here.

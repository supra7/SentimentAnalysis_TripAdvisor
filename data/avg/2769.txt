I learned about Hotel Kupeli in New York Times' traveler review and decided to make a reservation. I did an initial inquiry by e-mail and didn't get a response; a second e-mail did get a response and things went smoothly after that. The hotel was built in 2007 so everything is refreshingly new and clean. Our room was bright and cozy. However, I can't imagine it's going to stay that way for long -- things clearly aren't maintained very well. Two doorknobs in our room kept detaching, the main drain in our bathroom was covered in mildew, and light-bulbs were burnt out and not replaced. The computer in the lobby was free for guest use, but the Internet connection was constantly going down. Also, the main front desk clerk was impatient and irritable all the time... though I can't really blame him, considering he was at the desk about 20 hours/day. Overall we enjoyed our experience at Kupeli and don't regret our stay. Breakfast on the terrace was especially lovely.

I had heard about the coolness of the W hotel so I was looking forward to it, being more used to Seattle's Marriott in the suburbs. Well, the W does look good, particularly the lobby and restaurant, there is definitively an atmosphere. But, as it happens often with "trendy" hotel; it's more window dressing than actual value. the W is basically a 1930's revamped hotel where they renovated the basic rooms with a few cool looking pieces of furniture/colour scheme but the air conditioning is still super loud, you can hear whatever happens in the corridor from the bed and the neighbours. The bed is not particularly comfortable and the wide screen LCD TV, a good idea in itself, is positioned at an awkward angle (ie on the wall opposite the bed but not in front but more to one side). Being cool, all practical & boring infos about the hotel (such as internet rates, check out times etc...) are hard to find in their little paint palette like booklet. If you want internet, you basically have to have an ethernet cable as no wifi is available (low tech hey). And that cable is not in the room of course, given the exhorbitant prices of everything, I gave up without even asking... The in house DVD collection sounded cool as well (and free, an event here) but unfortunately, maybe it was bad luck, but the DVD was worn out and freezing every 30 secs so also gave up. The biggest letdown was the room service. The restaurant has a very good reputation locally but room service is 1/ daylight robbery 2/ food is so so. 46$ for a minuscule chicken sandwich and asparagus food is crazy : So, all in all, this was not a good experience and I will certainly not return if I have a choice. FYI I stayed 2 nights.

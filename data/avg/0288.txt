I stayed Moore for 3 nights. I was excited when I found this hotel from this website, sounded fantastic. Maybe that's why I was dissapointed when I stepped in the hotel. It's obviously a budget hotel, not so nice. Some of staff were not so nice like other comments say. But there was at least one guy who was helpful. I stayed queen single room with bath. The room was really large, but the bathroom was old and terrible since it has cracks on the really old tiles etc... and everything in bathroom is 100 years old. Water pressure was weak. Somehow, the furnitures in room are new, so that's good part. I asked room with view, and it had a good view, but comes with some street noise. Anyway, I wanted to save money while close to downtown, it's ok experience.

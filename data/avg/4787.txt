The Palmer House Hilton is an historic hotel. Its lobby area is spectacular. Some of the public rooms are truly beautiful. The location is great; e.g, in the business district, within walking distance of the Art Institute and Symphony Hall. Huge convention type hotels often have employees who are either pleasant but vacant/unknowledgeable or non-comprehending of even simple requests. In contrast, the Palmer House has excellent staff, all pleasant and responsive including the housekeepers, doormen, etc. The food is the standard Hilton fare (somewhat overpriced) but there is a Starbucks on the lower level, and right on the corner are places for breakfast and lunch. The rooms, however, are way below what one would expect from a standard business hotel of modest price. For instance, there were bedside tables on each side of the bed, but a lamp on only one side (so if two people were in the room, and the one by the lamp wanted to go to sleep earlier, the other would have to get into bed in the dark). THe desk chair could not be adjusted regarding height. There was not enough lighting in the room (partly because of what might have been high efficiency bulbs, but some gave off that harsh, greyish light). The closet was small and the door would not stay open and the ironing board hanging on the door kept banging everytime one moved the door. The bathroom was small but ok; however, it looked like it had not been redecorated in 20 years, had no makeup mirror, etc. If one is travelling alone and will not be in the room much, this hotel is acceptable. Finally, when I was there the ethernet connection for high speed internet would not work. I called the free number and they said there was a problem at the Palmer House. There was still a problem the next day. [The literature in the room said there was a "nominal fee" for this service. There was only the 24 hour option, at a charge of $19.95 which is not nominal.]

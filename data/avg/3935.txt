Initially we had to stay in the other hotel, but they moved us to Anatolia Suits. They gave us big room but with the wall view and in the morning we got up from the noise from big energy tank. The owner and the staff was very polite and helpfull. breakfast is ok. Unfortunatly we leave part of our money in safe, and next morning was in hurry to got to the aiport in time (we had a flight to Cappadoccia). On the way we understood that forgot pocket with money and some documents and visit cards in safe box, called to the hotel and agreed that they brought the poket to the aiport in a week. We passed the key from the safe via driver. In a week. when we came back to Istanbul, the owner brought us the pocket - and we find there less 150 dollars and no business cards.

Better than my first visit I have stayed at this hotel twice in the last 3 months. The first time was not great the place was a mess, took long to check in, and things did not work in the guestrooms. But I did book the room based on price so I had no one to blame but myself, as the saying goes what you pay is what you get. So once again I had to go to Seattle, booked on one of the name your own price sites. Oh great I should have known better, I got Seattle South Red Lion. This time around I notice that there had been some changes. The place did not look as messy as the first time, the landscaping was cleaned up, the guestrooms were clean, and things worked in the rooms. Best yet the pool was opened, as it was closed the first time. There was signs talking about a remodel, so I asked the front desk, and they said they had new owners.So I don't know what will happen now that there is new owners, but this time my stay was much better. This time I did get what I paid for. Hopefully there will be some great changes since the location is pretty good to get to the airport, and downtown Seattle.

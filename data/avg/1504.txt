Although the food; service and location are extraordinary; we are extremely dissatisfied with the manner that the resort management responded to several prolonged power failures. The guests' health and safety were not taken into consideration. From 4/17 at 1pm thru 4/18 at 1am our building and room lost power. The AC; smoke detectors; and lighting were not working; as well as the elevators and lights in the common areas. Management failed to inform us re: the loss of power or the time frame that it would be back on. We were allowed to enter our rooms in total darkness without flashlights; etc. The common hallways were lit by votive candles( another safety issue) An alternate room that had electricity restored was not offered to the guests and there was no update as to the restoration of power to the guests.

Let's be fair and say that the staff is very friendly and helpful. But this hotel is overpriced and pretentious. There were patches of mould (?) in and around the bathtub as well as dark grey scratches in the bathtub. The room was very small and dark with a big brick wall facing the window. This hotel claims 4 stars but would certainly get only 3 in Europe. However the location is good.

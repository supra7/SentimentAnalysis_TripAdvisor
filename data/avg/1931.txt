Our recent stay at this property was quite delightful. If you are looking for a 4 or 5 star deluxe property then look elsewhere. If your needs require deluxe, sleek, spotless accommodation then you will be disappointed. But if you would enjoy an authentic Hawaiian experience with a wonderful local staff who are proud of their heritage and are willing to go the extra steps to make your visit to Maui memorable, then you will enjoy a stay here. Some rooms feel older than others, depending on the building and if it has had recent renos. Ours was clean, spacious and certainly met our needs as we were not requiring cooking facilities. The "Best" things: The evening entertainment with authentic music and dance from 630-9ish The caring and knowledgeable staff The location is amazing, thus I rate a 3 star property with 5 star location All rooms have a mini fridge Lovely landscaped property The boardwalk out front to take you down to Whalers Village for some nice shopping and great dining at Leilani's or Hula grill within a 5 minute walk Beautiful beach out front with decent snorkelling next door The Cons: The pool is in need of a facelift and not exceptionally clean. We noticed sand and a slight oil slick every day and a few "chunks" had come loose on the flooring The buffet breakfast was not exciting but since it was included with the room rate, how can you really complain? Food at the other 2 facilities on site were just average. The overall property could use a really good cleaning (stairwells, etc.) but for the most part guests here dont seem to be the type to be overly concerned in this regard Beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach in front are not provided and have to be rented Overall it was a lovely experience, just go with the right expectations. The cultural experiences and lovely staff should more than make up for the "small stuff"

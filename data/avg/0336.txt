We stayed here for two nights for the Seahawks home opener. My husband warned me that the rooms were small, but I was not prepared for how small they really were!!! We booked a superior room, but there was no room for anything, we were constantly shuffling our stuff around and tripping over one another. The worst part was the bathroom, and the sink faucet. It was leaking so bad that we called the front desk - they sent someone up and he fixed it to a slow leak but it was still driving us nuts, so we ended up turning off the main water lines to the sink. Someone in the room next to us wasn't feeling well (we know this because of the thin walls) and was up all night getting sick into his toilet - and lucky us we heard it all night. I mentioned to one of the employees about the sink and he wasn't concerned, just told me that this is an old hotel... We had requested early check-in, but we were not able to get a room untill 3:00 in the afternoon...

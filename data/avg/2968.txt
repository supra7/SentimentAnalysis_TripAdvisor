Positive comments: - Very close to subway and 15 minute walk to the beaches - Interesting location, ex-industrial part of Barcelona, some will like it, some not - Nice and free breakfast - Helpful staff at the reception Negative comments - First impressions are bad, fells like vacant office building - The hotel is not very clean, the windows are dirty, carpets in walkways with lots of stains - Unpleasant smell in our room and especially in the bathroom - Complicated TV system that pushes paid movies - For 93,- a night, not good value for money

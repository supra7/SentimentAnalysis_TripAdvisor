My wife and I stayed there for July 4th weekend. The room was nice, the breakfast was just ok, the location was just ok. All in all, it's an average hotel in a great city. Fitness Center & indoor pool were hidden away, behind some doors, down 2 or 3 hallways and lots of steps, and was just average. We got a bill for $40.00 for "BEVERAGE STORAGE", in other words, we put our water in the mini bar. The front desk staff was kind enough to remove the charge from our bill, but when she said it was a "courtesy" to me, I was a little annoyed. Courtesy ? for removing a charge that shouldn't have been there in the first place ? But would we stay there again ? Probably, now we know what to expect.

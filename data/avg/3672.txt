I've stayed here several times, twice for conferences, once for a wedding, each stay was fine. Most recently, I was attending a conference at another hotel, and I got a deal on this one through Hotwire for $81/night. I think the normal rate is upwards of $160. The inside is a bit dark, but clean. Checkin staff was friendly, parking was only so-so - they had valet for extra, and a garage that was $10/night but no in or out. So I self-parked, but the lot is not well lit with a bunch of trees. The room was nice, clean, well appointed. The beds were ok, but the pillows were lumpy. Lighting was particularly dim, even for a hotel. The bathroom was adequate, shower worked fine. I didn't eat at the Starbucks or restaurants, but I had room service several times, and it was quite good - the French Toast was to die for. Internet access was $9.95 per night, I couldn't get wireless to work, but wired seemed ok. Overall, decent hotel for a deal price, but for full price I would probably go for the Westin Galleria or something else.

I have stayed in Vegas at many hotels, but if you are looking for a 5 star hotel, do not stay here. The bathrooms are 5 star, but the rooms remind me of a cheap extended stay hotel. What were they thinking when they put kitchens and gold carpeting in a room in Vegas? It took me 3 rooms to get one where the carpet was not stained and I am afraid to take my socks off in this one. Rachel at the front desk was great, but I booked a 5 star hotel and got a 3 1/2 star hotel. If you want a great 5 star experience in Vegas, stay at the Encore, the Palazzo, the Bellagio or the Four seasons.

On the 22nd floor, at least, street noise is considerable. Maybe that's why they give you ear plugs during the turn down service. (The heater also was pretty noisy -- the one in the bedroom at least; the one in the sitting room was much better.) But, a pretty good location, and they gave my father-in-law a good deal for our block of rooms. Oh, another con: the pillows are way too full and unforgiving. I called for flatter ones and they told me they had only one flatter one available (which my wife and I arm-wrestled for). And my final gripe: the elevators seem very slow during busy periods.

We recently stayed at the Byzantine on the last leg of our 2 week tour of Turkey having being married in Gunogan. As we had stayed in the same area before (Sultanamet) we were eager to return but had to choose a different hotel to our previous one which was full. On a recommendation regarding the Turkish spa at the Byzantium we decided to also stay in the hotel. There's not a lot to say as it is a fairly mediocre hotel with cheap fittings in the rooms, (we stayed in two rooms as they had "forgotton" to book our sea view room and put us in a 'suite' for the first night). The hotel advertises soundproof rooms, however at least in the 'suite' which is on the ground floor, it couldn't be much noisier if it tried. The windows opened to a small street where people constantly sat in drunken states all evening and the air conditioning didn't work (neither did it work in the sea view room which we were moved into the following day). It is a good size room but with no thought to decor or ambiance. I felt more like I was locked in a dungeon. The sea view room is no more inspiring. Yes, it does have a view of the sea, but it is a very small room with scant decor and no real ambiance either. So for position I give this hotel a 10 but for value for money and charm a 0 unfortunately.

The staff is great at this place and the location is wonderful if you're looking to stay downtown. The price was overpriced and every time I attempted to ask about any specials before our arrival, I was continuously told that it was the best they could do. Yet, we will be staying at 3 other hotels on this vacation, two of which have full kitchens and the price per night ranges from $50-$75 cheaper per night! We won't be staying here when we visit Seattle again.

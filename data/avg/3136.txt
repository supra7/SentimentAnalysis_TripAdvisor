I stayed 3 nights at this hotel for our company's annual gathering so I sum up by counting positives and negatives: GOOD: 1. The hotel is nicely decorated and you can see beautiful designs around the lobby. 2. The location is the best in Istanbul 3. Staff are polite and try to be nice to guests NOT SO GOOD: 1. Sleep quality at my room was a disaster since every 5 minutes a frightening BUMP sound could be heard from the corridor and originally from the adjacent building ! 2. When all of our team checked in to our rooms we felt that we are inside a big refrigerator. the rooms were all much much colder than the weather outside !! ( keeping in mind that we were on the last week of November) one by one we brought the matter to the reception and complained about the condition of our rooms but we heard 1001 excuses ( some were really funny ! ) and zero effort to solve the issue and turning the heating system on.So we experienced Ice Age sleep quality during our stay.... bottom line : 6 out of 10 returned home sick one of them directly taken to hospital from the airport! 3. Some the dishes at breakfast were not washed properly and had traces of food on the surface. 4. The wireless internet was buggy most of the times as the signal in my room become so week. I think they should fortify the signal at the end of the corridors. All in all ,will not recommend & will definitely NOT going back there

The hotel was built in 1927 and has elements of this everywhere. The room doors have huge bulges where a visitor could hang clothes, that could be taken out the corridor side for pressing by some 1930 servant. And this reflects in the hotel. The common areas have been recently been refurbished and are very nice. Corrridors are beautiful as are main conference areas. The rooms are another matter. - Firstly there is the size. I got a "queen" sized bed, which seem considerably smaller than other queens I have slept in, - But the mattress was newish ang good - The rooms vary hugely is size, see the enclosed floor plan pic from the back of the door. - Air con did not work, it made horrible noises and the maintenance team arrived to mend it and did this by turning it off. Luckily windows open. - The carpets, fittings and bathroom have not been touched in years. Watch out for static discharges from the carpets, it is monstrous. All in all mixed bag, if you get a decent sized room, on an upper floor you an open the window you can sleep without too much noise from the street. Other rooms

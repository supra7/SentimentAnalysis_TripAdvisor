stayed twice. A good change from the usual urban hotels in town. Experience with checkin and checkout were both pleasant. Rooms are quite alright. But do note they are quite dated but clean with a musty smell. Might not be acceptable to all. Breakfast is.. well.. i'll opt to skip the one provided and walk over to picotin for one.

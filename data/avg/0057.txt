I stayed four nights in the Warwick in April 2010, travelling from Germany. My requirtements for the hotel were simple: 1) clean, and even cleaner, 2) close to downtown, 3) reasonably priced. The hotel achieved full marks in all departments. My room was very clean, especially the bed and bathroom area. And I am fussy about these things. The hotel is just on the edge of downtown, 3 minutes walk to Macy's, 10 Minutes to Pike St. Market. The "Downtown Airporter" express bus service to SEA-TAC Intl. stops at the hotel (on 3rd. Ave.) every 30 Minutes - perfect and at 11$ much cheaper than the cabs at $45. The price is very reasonable for the area. However, the Warwick is not a hotel you visit because you want to spend time in the hotel proper. It is very much somewhere where you sleep and shower, maybe watch a bit of TV or check your emails. I would stay there again, but only if travelling alone. I wouldn't bring a family here, not a hotel for hanging out in. The furnishings were several years old, and showed their age. The bathroom was smallish, nothing chipped or cracked, but nothing new either. For example, the shower / bath tap (faucet) worked perfectly well, if you found just the right position to balance the settings on. The TV cabinet (huge) was neither pretty, quite worn, but entirely utilitarian. The big window out on to the very tiny (20cm) balcony didn't shut tightly, causing quite some draughtiness. The air conditioning / heating worked exceptionally well and balanced out the draught from the window nicely. The staff were effiicient and courteous - perfect. All in all a very acceptable, no fuss, no th(fr)rills, competent and efficient - if aging - hotel.

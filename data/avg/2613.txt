I decided to stay a single night in this part of Manhattan so we could explore this area a little. We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff and were given a clean and comfortable room - small, but this is NY. We had no complaints at all - except for the weather - (pouring rain!) , but the hotel couldn't control that! We walked to the Hotel Chelsea - and to the meatpacking district and to Madison Square Park, (we really enjoyed this park - very under-rated!). In this park you will find the Shake Shack - a New Yorker recommended we try the "scroom" which is a meatless burger and we both agreed that this burger was the Best Burger in the Universe and if we could only do one more think in NYC, it would be to return to the Shake Shack and have a shroom!

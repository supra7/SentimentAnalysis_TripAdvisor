We visited Seattle for 6 days at the end of May 2008. A fancy hotel is not important to us but we do require a safe and clean place to stay. The Sixth Avenue Inn was just what we needed - it was fairly cheap compared to the other hotels - and it's location was great, which was about 6 blocks from the piers. It was a little run down and the elevators and hallways sometimes smelled a little funny, but the rooms were always clean and smelled fine. If you want a luxury hotel, this is NOT the place for you, but it was perfect for travelers who want a comfortable place to come home to at night, and a safe place to leave your things during the day.

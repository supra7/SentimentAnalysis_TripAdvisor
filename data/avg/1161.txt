I am torn on my review of the Max. First, they did a great job remodeling what was a former hotel in dire need of a facelift. I don't think they made the rooms smaller to make just a little more $$ every night, but I do think the Max is the poster child for overpriced, slightly pretentious, minimalist, boutique hotels. Staff was great and I had a view of the Space Needle but with two of us in the room, it was not comfortable. We checked out early for this reason. Like others have said, at the price the Max asks, there are just better, more roomier options. Perhaps they'll get their room rates in check with the product they're offering and then everything will be in check.

i stayed at the Roosevelt for three days on a weekend getaway. the hotel was centrally located in the downtown core, but i found the hotel lacking i a couple of ways. the elevators seemed to be very slow and usually one was either down or occupied with hotel staff duties. you could find yourself waiting for quite a while to find room on one. they were packed with people. perhaps this was an unusual occurance, but it surely slowed everything down. the room was very dated. the bed was comfortable, but the set up was odd and felt strange. the bathroom was very small and the fixtures were from the 40's or 50's. it was clean but spartan. the staff seemed pleasant enough but it always seemed like there were not enough people on the desk. my parents stayed in this hotel on their honeymoon and i am sure that the room has not changed too much from those days in the 40's. the train and hotel package that i got was ok, but if i return to seattle...i will not be staying at the roosevelt.

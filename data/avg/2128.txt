Stayed for just 1 night. The room was ok. Stayed in a large 'apartment' room with a full kitchen and sitting area. The light switches are a little different with a lot of lights. The bed was fine but had just 1 pillow. The internet didn't work in our room after paying $29 even being on the 1st floor. We ended up getting a ethernet cable and the connection was moderate. The sink in the bathroom was clogged, didn't drain at all. Stayed in Rm 129 near the elevator so there was a lot of foot traffic outside the door. The room overlooks the courtyard. There is a small mall across the street with a pharmacy and food market, which is convenient. A short drive to the airport and creek.

The hotel is good from the point of history, the building is old, the lobby is beautiful, great location and view (I was lucky and got a room with Plaza view). But there is nothing here, no pool, no sauna, a poor gym, no nothing. The rooms are small and definitely need a good renovation. The ventilation is bad, you can smell the restroom in the suite. It is great to come

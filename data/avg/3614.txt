Having stayed in other Courtyard by Marriott hotels, my husband and I chose this hotel on a recent trip to Dallas. We attended a workshop nearby and the hotel was very close. It was also conveniently located to downtown and other points of interest. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, but it was not exceptional. There was space in the bureau for a small refrigerator; however, there was none. Breakfast was not complimentary; however, the Bistro was quite good. The staff were very courteous, especially those at the Bistro. Although wi-fi was available, it was not very fast. I would probably stay again, but might check out other places as well.

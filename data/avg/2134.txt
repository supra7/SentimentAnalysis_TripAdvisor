I was reading some of the other reviews and thought I'd share my 2 cents. I stayed at the Trump with my wife because neither one of us are big gamblers. We found the staff top notch and excellent but this is to be expected in all Vegas 5* hotels. To me the staff being excellent was not a huge selling point because I honestly think the staff at the other hotels are just as awesome. The reason why I gave this place an average rating only is mainly because of Location, location, location! 1) I hate having to plan my times around the shuttle bus and waiting and wasting time. To me time is money. There are no cabs just waiting around here either so it's kind of hard to get around having to wait for a cab or shuttle bus. 2) It is far away from the shows and restaurants so it was again annoying being far away. 3) There are no side walks connecting all the way to the strip either. You have to kind of take your chances walking on the road on a few occasions (I haven't been back since early 2011 so I don't know if this has been fixed. The pool was very tame and usual. Nothing really special about it. What I would recommend is that a monorail be built to the strip casinos to improve the situation. When I goto Vegas I basically have the choice of a zillion 5 star hotels. The hotels with the casinos, clubs, and top notch restaurants are just as quiet in the rooms as the Trump so it's just not worth the inconvenient location for me. I would recommend this for families who want to keep kids away from smokers though.

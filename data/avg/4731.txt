I ended up at this hotel by bidding $150 per night for a 4 star hotel in the loop area of Chicago on priceline.com. The average room in the area was $250, so I did pretty good. I enjoyed the location, right next to th "L" and plenty of restaraunts and theatre within walking distance. We ended up with room 401, all the way in the back of the hotel with no view except the roof over their eeting rooms. I guess that's what I get for bidding on a room. As hindsight, I wish I had just booked a room at the hotel with a view and paid whatever their rate was. It was a clean hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Parking was expensive, but probaly less than most downtown hotels. I would stay there again and pay full price, the only reason I marked the room down was because of the room I got, not their fault, mine for bidding! Recommendation - It would have been nice to have in-room coffee maker.

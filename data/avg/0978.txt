Even though I was annoyed at being woken up every morning at 4am, I would try the University Inn again. The staff was helpful, the room was clean and the continental breakfast was sufficient. I loved the fact that they offered the free shuttle to and from downtown Seattle. The shuttle service drivers were also very pleasant and friendly. The staff suggested a really nice and affordable Thai restaurant 3 blocks down, and we liked it so much that we had dinner there two nights in a row. All in all, not a bad stay. Make sure you ask for any other room except 209.

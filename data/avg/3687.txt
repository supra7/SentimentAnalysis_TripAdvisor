I really wanted to like this hotel. To start with some positives, the rates were very reasonable and the location was great, very convenient to the downtown sights including the convention center and Dealey Plaza. Also, the included breakfast was pretty good, usually eggs, pancakes, breakfast meats along with oatmeal, other cereals and breads. The nightly reception was nice as well with two free drinks included. Now for the problems ... Reading other reviews, the hotel evidently has been renovated but it still has a very "tired" look to it. The elevators shook and were very noisy and a few of my colleagues got "trapped" at various times on the elevator trying to navigate to their rooms. The room which was a suite included a full kitchen. However, it was very dark and pretty depressing to come back to at the end of each day. I had almost every light on and it was still quite dark. One of my colleagues commented (and I agreed) that he was definitely ready to check out after staying there a few days. Finally, my room was very noisy as it faced downtown. In fairness, my colleagues did not have this problem so it has to do with where the room is located. Each night I was awakened by either revelers in the streets along with honking horns (cars lined up trying to navigate downtown at 2:00 a.m.) or garbage trucks (I think) banging and clanging very early in the morning. I can say that I would not return to this hotel on my next trip to Dallas.

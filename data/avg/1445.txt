After an impromptu day at Orlando, I realized that my mom and I needed somewhere to stay the night. We got this room at the rate of $45. I guess it was exactly what we paid for. Not the most extravagant, but it was clean. The room was small and the shower did not look clean. Let me put it like this, I did not walk on the floor without my shoes. Besides that, the room served the purpose. It included a nice little plasma, coffee maker, toaster oven and fridge. I would not recommend more a 1-2 night stay.

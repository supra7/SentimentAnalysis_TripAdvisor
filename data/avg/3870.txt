Excellent accomodation in Orlando but a bit overpriced for the service provided (a bit unpersonal and cold). Good location in Orlando area to access the parks, downtown and shopping facilities. Very nice pool area. The room was big and comfortable, with a small but equipped kitchen and a living area with table and sofa. Complimentary coffee in the room (coffee machine) Plus: - room - cleaninless (one of the best ever) - free parking Minus: - price - breakfast not included (add 9$ for continental breakfast) - no wifi in the room! that was the worst minus for me. Wifi available only in the lobby and pool area, in rooms only wired (wired internet is useless nowadays) Overall very good but a bit overpriced.

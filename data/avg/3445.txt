Stayed here for a one-night stopover between flights. Very handy for the airport as you can wheel your trolley directly from the airport into the hotel. Found the hotel layout rather rambling and confusing and the rooms somewhat over-trendy - the necessary air-conditioning resulted in a very cold blast alongside the bed. The food in the Azur Restaurant was reasonably priced, with a good selection; but drinks were very expensive.

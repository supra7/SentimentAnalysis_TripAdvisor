A few weeks back I was at this hotel with a group of friends. We had 4 rooms in the hotel and the hotel was fully booked during that period. As expected from a HIX it was a clean property, actually decent sized rooms and well appointed bathrooms with good showers (good pressure and constant temperature). There's no roomservice or restaurant on site, but there's a Supermercado just 1 minute away. The breakfast is very basic with cold meats and cheeses, but it was actually good enough! The location is okay; subway is not too far away and if you have a car, there's plenty of free parking available in the area of the hotel. There's not much around the hotel's area, but everything is 'just a metro ride away'... Platinum members get free internet and a guaranteed 2PM c/o which was a nice touch. There was a vending machine with decent snacks and sandwiches + a drinks machine on the lobby floor which was great for late night cravings or thirsty moments.

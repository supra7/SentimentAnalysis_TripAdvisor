decent room for a decent price Booked the hotel through the Japanese version of hotelclub: Rakuten Travel. Paid 5500 Yen a night for a single room.Hotel is located in a business/office area, so it is very quiet area after working hours. The hotel is a 10-15 min walk to Tokyo station, has 2 subway stations near it, so it is convenient for sightseeing. It is one or two stops to Tokyo station and couple of stops to the fish market and imperial palace.It does take 20 min or so to get to Shinjuku. Around the hotel are many convenient stores and some restaurants. Very safe area, because it is very close to a police station and the fire department. :)The hotel entrance and lobby looks very modern and stylish, however the room was very old dated. I stayed in a single room that was quite spacious for Japanese standard. It was clean came with the standard stuff: fridge, tiny bathroom, tv with Japanese channels, CNN and a Korean channel. I did not bring a laptop so had to make use of their computer downstairs. Paid 100 Yen per 10 minutes to access the internet. Staff was friendly, helped me to get around in Tokyo, as I arrived from Tokyo station where there is not a Tourist info center.

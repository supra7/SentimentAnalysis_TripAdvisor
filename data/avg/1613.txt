superior location,rude lady manager,inexperienced but pleasant staff for tourists, the location is super convenient! we paid $800/night for 7night stay,it was a fair price to pay. lots of eating places here and there. the relatively new hotel room was pretty small but since we did not plan to hangout in the room, it didn't matter. we had a clean room to rest in, take baths,etc. nothing more. the tv in our room didn't work well, we only had one working channel with poor reception. towards the end of our stay, around day 5 til we checked out,we noticed that the room hasn't been cleaned as efficiently compared to the past days.the lady manager,monica, i think she was the only one who spoke english quite well, was rude and arrogant. however the more senior male manager was always pleasant and attentive.the staff although inexperienced really try to be of service to you, that is if your lucky enough to get the message across. my daughter threw up one night, the guy who changed our sheets was muttering to himself quite loudly, he sounded annoyed and mad that we called for service. funny, as customers, don't we pay for their services?you do get what you pay for. if you are not too needy maybe inferior service won't matter. but if you are a normal tourist who may have questions and may need service every now and then, you may be in for an ordeal.if i rate solely on location, i'd be back again and book in this hotel with no doubt! if you take into account their service and increasing prices, i'd rather stay somewhere else.

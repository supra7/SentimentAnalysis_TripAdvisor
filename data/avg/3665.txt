This hotel was very convenient to my meeting location, so I felt lucky to stay there...but I wouldn't stay there again. First, no wifi, which means you have to sit at the big imposing desk to plug in your computer, and you can't see the TV. Sure, the TV swivels, but not enough so that you can view it from the desk. The room service menu is limited, and although they'll tell you "25 to 30 minutes" that means 55 minutes--at least it did for the entire week that I was there (the food was good though). They never provided a key to the mini bar, so snacking was out of the question. One day I returned to find a makeup bottle broken (Lancome--the expensive stuff!) with no explanation or apology. Even more strange, one day, around 4 pm, a houskeeper just entered my room unannounced. She was replacing a towel, and she apologized for walking in on me--but really? Just a weird experience--beautiful lobby and lounge, but the rest is a little off.

The room was very nice but nothing really special. The view was great. If you stay here make sure to get the river view. The wine hour was wonderful. The service was wonderful. The concierge was very helpful. Check in and check out were both quick and easy. We did have a few complaints. The bedroom was too warm for us. We had a 2 room suite and the ac vents were in the living room half. The fridge was extremely small and they had it filled. Would have like to have had room to put our own bottles of water and soda in there. We had to request a coffeemaker, one is not automatically provided. I will say it was delivered in less that 5 min and they sent plenty of coffee. The ice machine was on the floor below ours. That was a pain to go up and down the elevator to fill our ice bucket. The people were wonderful and took great care of us. They took pictures of us, gave us directions to places, told us the bus numbers to take when needed.

The KBH is an older property that is nice but not glamorous. It has a very nice beach and good location close to the Whaler's Village, but it's not as classy and polished as the Sheraton next door. The room was nice, big and clean, but you feel as though you are in a nice motel as opposed to a fancy upscale resort. The pool was small and cold and the grounds were O.K. The breakfasts were pretty good in the outside restaurant(omlettes - pancakes made to order), and the service throughout the hotel was very good. If you're on your honeymoon and you can afford better, try the Sheraton, otherwise the KBH will do for most people on a limited budget. For dinner or drinks, the Hula grill and Leilanis were great at the nearby Whaler's village. If you are golfing on your trip, the courses were better in Wailea or Kapalua as opposed to Kaanapali.

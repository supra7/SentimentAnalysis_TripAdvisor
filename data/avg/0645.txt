After reading the not-so-great reviews about this place, my husband and I decided to give it a try. The staff was friendly upon arrival and the room was very clean. It costs $15 for 24hr parking but it is well worth it as it is impossible to find long term parking in the city! The location was close to everything and didn't have any problems during our stay. My husband and I would stay here agian!

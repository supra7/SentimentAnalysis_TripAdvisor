We visit Seattle every couple of years to see family. We have stayed at some very high end hotels in the Seattle area. We feel that it's room prices and star rating are a little overboard. The room was SO tiny (but clean). We could barely move. The bathroom even smaller with no tub (also clean). We made due. We did love the restaruant and bar. It was also nice to walk about the pier, even though it was quite a distance to any place worth going to. The staff overall was very helpful and friendly. It did not help that our room was near the elevator/party room - a lot of noise. In general, if you want to be on the water and downtown, not a bad option IF you can get a great deal OR you don't mind a super small room for a really big price. We could almost love this hotel just because of it's location, restaurant and bar - just wished the prices reflected a little better for what you actually get.

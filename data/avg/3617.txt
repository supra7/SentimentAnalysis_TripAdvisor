Recent gushing reviews over this Courtyard near the Dallas city center seem to focus primarily on cleanliness ("extra clean, "immaculate") and perhaps value. While this is an average representative for Courtyards in general, I don't think it's the #4 hotel in the Dallas metro area. This Courtyard has been refurbed in the current Courtyard room scheme, although they retained the old mirrored sliding doors on the closets and the original (c. 1990) tile and surround in the bathroom. More significantly, the HVAC is quite loud; corridors and hallways have carpet that isn't being cleaned regularly; exterior entrances are worn, with painting and other maintenance needed; the elevators are slow, clunky, and have significant scratches and near-grafitti on the inside doors; and there are disconcerting "Watch Your Car" signs posted by the Dallas Police at several spots in the parking lot. All of this is easily forgiveable at a price point of oh, say, $120 a night; but at $169 a night, the value proposition is below average, especially when a comparable Courtyard (Central Expressway) is $149 and the nearby Renaissance and Marriott Suites full-service properties are $229. Unless you have reservations at Medieval Times (which is adjacent), there are better Marriott options nearby and less expensive Courtyard options about the same distance from the city center.

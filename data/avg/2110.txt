The location of the hotel is very good and we can recommend it for 1-2 nights of leisure trip. But we spent in Pera Tulip 6 nights and found it as too much. The rooms are clean but very very small and without space for the luggage so you have to jump over directly from bed to bathroom or to window ... Also in the bath room is no place where to put anything. Only one chair is in double room what is not very comfortable. The breakfast was nothing special, no fresh fruits and without change the whole week - so after some days we had enough of that. The pool and sauna are also very small and what more the pool was mostly out of operation due to maintenance. As mentioned above, the hotel is appropriate for the short tourist stay only.

Spent one night at Palmer House while on a weekend trip with my 9-year-old. We took the L from Midway. The hotel is just steps away from the Adams St L stop. The Art Institute is about a block away. We used CTA buses to get around and it was very convenient to go to the museum complex and Navy Pier. The hotel lobby is beautiful. Our room was also very nice. The decor was lovely. They have some really cool lamps. We had a double room The room was a little small, but larger than I expected from reading reviews. I saw the interior of some of the single rooms as I passed in the hallway and they seemd to be very small. The bathroom was nice, very clean and appeared to be newly redecordated. We grabbed a quick breakfast at the Starbucks on the lower level of the hotel. There is a restaurant and lounge in the hotel, as well, but we didn't try those. We had Mother's day lunch at Miller's Pub which is on the corner by the hotel. The staff was very friendly, the service was good and so was the food. I highly recommend it. The down side at the hotel was the lack of any soundproofing. I was awakened in the middle of the night by a man's voice in the next room. I could hear every word just as clearly as if he had been in our room. We could also hear the L trains clearly from our room but that didn't bother me. It noticed it when II was awake, but it wasn't loud enough to wake me up.. The swimming pool was closed when we were there and they told us we could use the pool at the Hilton which they said was about 25 minutes away, which seemed silly to me. Overall we had a nice stay, the location was great, and we paid the $89 non-refundable rate, so it was a very good deal. There are a lot of other hotels in the area though, so I will probably try a different one next time and hopefully it will be quieter.

Everyone from valet to front desk and room service were all very professional and kind. We were on the 51st floor.The fold out couch mattress was pathetically old and soft and had no support. House keeping added a comforter to the mattress but to no avail. overall room was well appointed. The hinges to the armoir were exposed when opening the door. Unexpected. I bent down to put my luggage in the closet and hit the hinge full force with my head which caused my scalp to bleed. I should have asked for an upgrade! Maintenance repaired the hinges. Otherwise, the room was fine. Someone should go through and make repairs. Also, the Train whistle blew at least 4 times throughout the late night and morning (not the hotels control).Pool area had a large boisterous group in the pool that made for us not hanging out longer.

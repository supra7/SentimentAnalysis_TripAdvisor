When we arrived we were given a room that, while clearly marked "Non Smoking," REEKED of cigarette smoke. The woman at the desk commented that "this has been a non-smoking hotel since I've worked here for a couple of years," so this doesn't make much sense. (Esp. since I've now read the management's comments here that they just took over in Oct. '08 and transitioned to a non-smoking hotel.) However, she moved us to a different room and was very pleasant about it. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The location is very good - walking distance to Pike's Place market, Monorail, and Space Needle, as well as some good restaurants. The beds were comfortable but the room overall was rather shabby, with stained carpet and scuffs on the wall. The bath contained the narrowest tub/shower I've ever encountered in this country, and the "hot" water ranged from warm to occasionally cold - the temperature varied during my shower. During the first morning's shower I discovered there was no shower gel and almost no soap in the dispenser, so we hunted down the housekeeping staff in the hall and asked her to refill them so my travelling companion could take her shower. Again, this was done politely and cheerfully. I was also surprised to learn of the fee for parking, although now I see that info buried on the "amenities" page. Overall, it's a great location and a decent night's sleep, so if you don't look too closely at your surroundings it's OK. The next trip we would probably inquire if the rooms had been refurbished, or consider another low-price chain hotel in the area next time. My response to "would you recommend this hotel to a friend" is a RELUCTANT "yes," with caveats.

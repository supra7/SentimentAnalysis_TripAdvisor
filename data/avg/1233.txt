Spent 3 nights at conference at the hotel. The staff are wonderful! They are dedicated and helpful to your every need. Bed's in the room were the heavenly beds and I slept very well all 3 nights. Room was highly run down. Wall paper peeling off walls in different places, light bulb not replaced in room and carpet stained. Bathroom floors seems dirty and needed to be regrouted. Food was very expensive in restaurant and just okay. Burger, soda and tip $21.00. Save yourslf some money and eat off site. This is a hotel in the Hilton chain and I was disappointed.....:(

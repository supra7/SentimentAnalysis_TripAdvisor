Stayed in room 1723 for two nights while on a business trip to Boston. The Hyatt was the only hotel in the central part of downtown with a decent rate for the nights I wanted. I found the hotel to be very quiet and comfortable, with a staff that tries hard to ensure you have a pleasant stay. I did have some issues about the neighborhood, however. I was out walking after an early dinner (it was still light out) and was approached by a man in front of the nearby abandoned Paramount Theater who asked for money in a very aggressive way. The sidewalks around the Hyatt were littered with trash both days I was there and even the cab driver said "this is not the best part of Boston". But the Ritz Carlton is only three blocks away, so it seems the area is on the upswing. I recommend this hotel but be careful in the area at night.

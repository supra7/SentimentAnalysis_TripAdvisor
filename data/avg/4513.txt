This hotel is not a cheap stay by any means..and after paying a pretty decent nightly rate, they will nickle and dime you for EVERY little request that you may find comes standard in other hotels. ($15 room refrigerator delivery fee, $15 for one hour of internet in the business center, $16 for a crappy continental breakfast, self parking is over $30 per day, etc). The hotel does not have a shuttle service either. When asking the hotel staff questions, it seems each person will have a different, inconsistent response as well. Very discouraging. Good location& good if money is no issue.

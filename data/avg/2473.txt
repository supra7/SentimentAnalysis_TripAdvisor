Good value for money The Comfort Hotel Tokyo Kanda is a clean, basic chain hotel located in a central part of Tokyo. It is located about ten minutes walk east of Kanda station, which is one stop north of Tokyo station on the Yamanote line - the main circle line around Tokyo. It is new and like all hotels in this chain in Japan, has complimentary breakfast (self-service), free coffee and tea in the lobby and free Internet access near reception. The room I stayed in was very clean and new, although, as usual in Japan, not very big. The bathroom was the typical preconstructed unit bathroom - again, small, but new and clean. The bed was very comfortable and there is a brand new TV with lots of mostly Japanese pay TV and video options for 1,000 yen a day. Free internet access is available in your room as well. The breakfast was basic, but for the price (I paid 9,400 for a Economy Double room including breakfast) you can't really complain. The hotel is located in a fairly quiet part of Kanda, but there are a lot of restaurants and izakayas near the station. It is not a particularly interesting neighbourhood, but as the Yamanote and Chuo lines run through Kanda station there is easy access to all of Tokyo.My only criticism would be that the hotel is not well equipped to cope with a full house. There is only one small elevator and it often took quite a long time to come and soon filled up, followed by stops on almost every floor. The breakfast area is also too small to handle a large number of people, although the hotel did extend breakfast hours on the day I stayed there to make some allowance for this. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you wanted to stay somewhere not too far from Tokyo station or the Yamanote line and were only after a clean, basic place to sleep.

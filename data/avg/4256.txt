I love the park plaza's location, but they seriously have issues with the rooms being way too hot. We couldn't shut off the heat, and barely could crack open the window. The hotel itself is in a perfect location, close to many Boston attractions, but the sleeping in stuffy, overheated rooms is really not worth the cost of the room.

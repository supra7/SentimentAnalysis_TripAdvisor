Overall, I had a good experience at this hotel and would probably recommend it if you can get a good price on Hotwire, Priceline, etc. The staff is really great, and I had a lovely view on the water overlooking Mt. Rainier and the Sound. The bar and restaurant both had a very chic vibe, and I thought the modern lodge decor was interesting and tasteful. Room, however, was a different story. While my bathroom was fantastic, the rest of the room was just plain weird and in need of upgrades (minus the enormous flat screen tv): room smelled odd, which I think was from the wood they used for the dresser? Giant stuffed bear in front of the fireplace? Kinda gross. As opposed to the modern, interesting decor of the bar/restaurant, the rooms are just disappointing. Valet parking prices were steep, but I'm not sure if that's commonplace for the rest of Seattle. While I was only here one night for business, I really liked the area. It's a nice walk to the Pike Place Market, and some great shopping and unique restaurants/bars. Like I said, I'd recommend, but only if you get a good deal.

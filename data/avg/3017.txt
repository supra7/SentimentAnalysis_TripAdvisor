hotel location is good...except is popular area for ladies of the night...the room was very small...the shower was very small....no breakfast....only 2 staff people spoke english...stayed there 8 nights so got to meet several of them...they did have free internet...saving grace..otherwise would look for another hotel next time in madrid...

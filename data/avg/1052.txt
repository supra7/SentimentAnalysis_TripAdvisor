For the price, the W Hotel offers very little to bring me back here. The daily parking rate of $37/day and $15/day for internet - no coffee or tea in the room, no turn down service - what's to make this a "luxury hotel"? There are many other hotels in this price range that offer so much more! The prime location isn't enough when I feel I'm being "nickeled and dimed" while staying here. There are better hotels in the area that offer much more - keep looking and skip the W!

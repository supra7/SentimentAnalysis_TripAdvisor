This hotel is very overpriced for what you get...the rooms are a bit dingy and dirty, and very small. Our first room smelled like cigarette smoke (it was a non-smoking room) so we had to move. The location is pretty good, next to the Olympic sculpture park and right on the water, but it is far from everything else you might want to do, including any restaurants within walking distance. The concierge was not friendly or helpful when I checked in or later when I asked him a question. Also, he sent us to the 3 top tourist trap restaurants in Seattle...so if you want authentic and where the locals eat, do not ask the concierge! Also, the noise from the train is pretty loud and it runs throughout the night, the train tracks are adjacent to the hotel.

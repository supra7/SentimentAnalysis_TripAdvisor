Deciding to stay in Hollywood for a night, we chose to stay here because it was close to the walk of fame. And it is not that far from the walk. Check in was pretty quick. Front desk staff nice. The property was clean. Room was clean. Nothing fancy. Was not crazy about paying over $200 for the room and $22 for Valet Parking. And that was a room facing the wall of the pool. Breakfast about what is standard for HIE and personnel working the Breakfast bar kept up pretty well. Probably worse places to stay, but knowing what I know now, would pay to stay somewhere cheaper away from Hollywood and take the public transportation or drive in a pay for parking. Checked "no" for free parking but I think you can get a package which includes free parking.

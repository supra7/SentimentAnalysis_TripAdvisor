We visited Seattle in the first week of September. Awesome weather, so not having an AC or screens on the windows wasn't a problem. Prior to arriving, I discovered that parking would be expensive and that the hotel could provide a airport shuttle for $45.00. We decided to take a cab, with little or no traffic slow downs it cost $56.00. The check in process was very nice. We arrived 3 hours early and Ashleigh was most helpful getting us in a room early. The desk staff was most helpful with directions to nearby restaurants. There is no elevator. There are stairs before you get into the building. There is a very strong and helpful door/bellman to carry the bags up. The room was clean, adequately furnished with a mini kitchen. The bathroom was clean but should be recaulked. I realize times are tuff, but a nice caulk job would make a world of difference. I'm not a professional, but even I could do a better job. We missed the afternoon wine tasting, but the continental breakfast was adequate. The courtyard garden was quite beautiful. I think I liked the location of the hotel the best. The City Center (Space Needle area) and Pike's Market are within walking distance. There are many nice restaurants within a three block area. We were spending three nights in Seattle before catching a cruise to Alaska so the washers & dryers were most convenient. We felt that for the price we spent we got a really good value.

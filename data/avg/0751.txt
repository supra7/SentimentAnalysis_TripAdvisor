We stayed here with our senior parents for one night as we were booked on the Clipper to Victoria, B.C. the next morning. We got a Junior Suite close to the lobby. The room itself was basic with city view, a nice package price, and our parents were very pleased with the amenities. However, when time came for us to pull out the hide-a-bed we had nothing but coils to sleep on. Our parents were already settled in so we tried it, and got very little sleep. The other surprise was the $400 pre-auth on my credit card (for one night), which I had to have adjusted the following morning before we went into Canada (at 6:30 a.m.) We did eat in the lounge, and found the Happy Hour menu affordable. The Greek salad was very good. This was our third time staying at this facility, because the location is so good. The management does have a comment card from us, and we await a response regarding the "hit & miss" experience we have had with this hotel over the years.

We have just returned from our Hawaii vacation, first one week in Maui, then 4 days on the big island. We were looking forward staying at the Hyatt for one week, but there were a few things we did not like and were disappointed as this is a 5 star hotel. Construction was the biggest thing going on, right next to the pool, it was not nice at all and the view from our oceanfront deluxe room (Atrium tower) was disturbing by this construction. We had been to Maui 8 times before and always stayed either in Kihei or Wailea and now we know why. Lahaina and Kanaapali is not that great, it's overrated and extremely busy. So seeing this, we only stayed 2 nights and then went to the Marriott in Waile, which was fantastic. The Hyatt needs a desperate upgrade of the rooms, they are old and not very spacious. For $750 per night I did expect a lot more in the rooms than we had. The property however, is fantastic, lush and has great gardens and the pool is phenomenal. So, once they upgrade and renovate the rooms, it should be back to its 5 star ratings.

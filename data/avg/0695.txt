I had bought an internet coupon for my stay. The hotel was lovely and the staff was friendly. However, when I buy an internet coupon I expect it to be honored as such. After buying the $259 voucher for a two night stay, the taxes/fees and parking amounted to an addtional $205 upon check out. I felt ripped off. Though the staff was friendly and the hotel was clean,it was NOT worth it.

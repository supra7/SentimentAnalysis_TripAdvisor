The hotel itself is beautiful, even with the construction which really wasn't an issue. We stayed in the smallest of the suites. For a suite I found the bathroom a little small. The vanity mirror was also so high up I could use it, I know I'm petite but it would've even been too high up for my boyfriend. Other than that I thought the room was very nice and the room attendants did an awesome job. The pool areas were also beautiful, very clean and chic looking. I read some reviews on how the water wasn't heated- its Mexico :) The water in the pools wasn't cold. The beach is what everyone said, disappointing. The ocean is covered in seaweed, we didn't even go in. The food was alright. The themed restaurants seemed to have nothing to do with the food. For example, there was nothing Mexican about the Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend ordered lamb, from the Mexican restaurant, and it was awful. The staff also had a hard time with English, so I spent a lot of time ordering and translating for my boyfriend. In the buffet area, we were asked several times by several different people what our room number was and one woman was very rude about it. The pool side food was pretty good. The drinks were also made well :) I also was confused by the wrist band system. Some people don't have them, those without all inclusive have one, people with day passes have a different color, and those with time shares have a wrist band depending on whatever. Maybe if everyone had a wrist band or if they made it all inclusive they wouldn't need to have a wrist band system and prices on the menu. I also noticed people with some wrist bands were paid better attention to, etc. I think considering how expensive this resort is, everyone should be treated well. I would recommend for someone to go in two years or so, when everything flows better and staff works better together. All in all its a beautiful resort and once they iron everything out I think it will make for a great vacation.

24-hour concierge service - Very helpful with everything. At times they where very busy but always took the time to help you find location and service. Valet parking - always seemed to take over 15 min to get our car and that was at slow times. A number of times we said we would be back in 10 min because we wanted to drop off our shopping and they went and parked our car. Evening turndown service - Did not use and Was not offered to us Gourmet dining at DJT Restaurant and Bar (lobby level) - Did not use. H2(EAU) poolside bistro and bar - Closed at 6pm Sparkling swimming pool and sundeck with private cabanas - Closed at 6pm 24-hour In-Suite Dining - Did not use. World-class spa, salon and fitness center - Did not use 5,960 square feet of elegant, indoor meeting space - Did not use Business Center - They had one and they charged extra to use it because they said it was out side company that provided the service The house keeping service was awlful. They never cleand or freshen up our room. We left at 10am on Wed and returned on Thursday Morning at 6am. Our bed was stripped and left bare. Did not clean or replace any towels. Left the room in a worse mess then we did after we left. They just didn't care and I stopped tipping the house keepers. I will stay there again. Make sure you get the name of the persons that you request house keeping from. Also set up a video camra to see who and what they do in the room.

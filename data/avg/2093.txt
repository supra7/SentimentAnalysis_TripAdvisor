The hotel was nice enough for the money we paid. The bathroom was slighty gross but even a slight hygiene freak like me had no problems there. The breakfast wasn't anything special, just cornflakes, muesli and toast with cheese/marmalade but filled you nonetheless. The public transportation connections were good especially the Piccadilly and Victoria lines nearby. Would go there again.

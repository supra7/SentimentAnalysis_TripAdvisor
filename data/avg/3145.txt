I was in this hotel for New year's Eve. We book ed two night through a voucher we had received as a gift. We got there around 12.30 and we expected the room to be ready. it was not, because it was a busy time - they said - but we were offered to upgrade to executive floor at 50 Euro per night. Wireless and minibar use included in the upgrade fee. When we got to our room it was clearly below expectations for an executive room. Definitely big and spacious but carpet flooring and poor refurbishment made it look a bit dull. The only plus was a very nice king size bed. The bathroom was basic, the tub a bit dirty and to our surprise, this included minibar consisted of 2 bottles of pepsi, two beers, orange juice and water. There was complimentary coffee (3 shots of espresso with a tiny Nespresso machine) and tea. Location: although 2 train stops away from Schiphol Airport, the city centre is quite far away. There is indeed a tube station in the nearby and a tram (line 4) that takes you directly to the heart of town but it is a 20-min journey. On New year's Eve then, trams stop at 8 pm (of course, they would be set on fire by irresponsible people firing petards and fireworks everywhere around) so to go back we had to take a cab and the journey was charged 30 Euro!!! Overall I think this hotel would make a great stop over if you want to be somewhere near the airport and not too far away from the city centre but it is such a pity to stay here if you want to enjoy Amsterdam, there are many hotels, B&B and pensions that would offer you a much better location.

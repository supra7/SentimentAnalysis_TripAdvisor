Tiny room. Rather intereresting design choices (neon green mixed with hot pink!). Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice wine bar upstairs, wher you can also sit outside. Do not have breakfast, it's not at all up to par and the air-condition makes the dining room freezing. Other than this minor minus, I'd stay here again.

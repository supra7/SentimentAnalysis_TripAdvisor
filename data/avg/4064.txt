With all the great hotels in Boston, regretfully I don't think there's much reason to ever stay at the Marriott Copley Place. I chose it out of convenience since it was close to the Convention Center where I attended a meeting. In today's recession, very few hotels are worth $259/night (my "promotional" rate). For that, I got: - Long lines at check-in - Appalling $12.95/day for low-speed wi-fi internet (which was quickly and courteously waived at check-out) - Spotty cell service in my 6th floor, ballroom roof-view room - 1980's Colonial decor in the small room and smaller bathroom - Long enough walks to get everywhere outside the hotel that I might as well have stayed anywhere else to be equally conveniently located to my event Boston is a great town, and there has to be a better hotel room for that price or much less. To be fair, it wasn't all bad. - Newly renovated lobby which was bustling with activity - Immediate, enclosed access to vast Prudential Center shops which is especially good at night/in rain/cold - Within walking distance to the Convention Center, Boylston St., etc., though lots of hotels fit this bill - Consistently friendly and accommodating employees In the end, I deserved what I got. I didn't do my homework. I thought it would be easy, especially for one night. It simply wasn't the hotel for me, and I missed a great opportunity for an outstanding night somewhere else.

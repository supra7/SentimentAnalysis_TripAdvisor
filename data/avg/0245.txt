Got a room via HOTWIRE for the 1st week in July 08. Im not sure what sort of room they would call it, but it was probably the standard accommodation for 2 people. It was small yet efficient. Perfect for a one-night stay, but probably better to opt for a bigger room if staying longer. Also, the dcor is traditional  not the usual modern or contemporary that Id prefer. The bathroom was tiny but the water pressure okay. The location was ideal. Walking distance to several of the downtown attractions. Concierge, check-in/out and bellhop service was efficient and professional. Although I dont have any complaints about this hotel, Id probably opt to stay elsewhere only because the dcor of the room did not suit me.

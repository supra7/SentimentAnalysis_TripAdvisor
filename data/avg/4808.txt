The hotel is well placed - the room was fine even if the view was a brick wall and the wash basin badly cracked, but given the Loop is outside it was blissfully quiet. Registration was slow to put it mildly - just two receptionists and a long line of weary people trying to be patient. The staff attitude is perhaps best described as 'take it or leave it' - both on the desk and in the very expensive Lobby bar. Except for the people on the Concierge desk who were unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful. My main compaint was access to wi-fi and the cost - none in the rooms and a $7 per hour charge which had to be paid by credit card each time - for overseas visitors this means transaction costs each time. AND if you only use thirty minutes of the hour you have paid for you lose the rest - no mechanism for logging back in to the time you've paid for.The Starbucks in the hotel charges the same even though another branch a few minutes away, as usual, doesn't charge at all. Overall The hotel made me grumpy - portrays itself as up market - in price, and it is an interesting building, but until they stop making guests feel they're being ripped off they can't claim to be 'up market'.

My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel in the winter time. We only paid $52.00 through Priceline (most others paid double). The price was very acceptable for what we got. The lobby is very nice and large, and there were enough staff on hand to check us in quickly. The door to our room and all the other rooms had a weird half-cylinder like shape to them. Maybe that was for security precautions. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The bathroom clearly needed renovation, but were nonetheless accptable. The staff was friendly and we had no problems when we were there. The room service food was great. The location is excellent, just a one minute walk to Boston Common. I would stay there again, but if your looking for more upscale accomodations, try somewhere else.

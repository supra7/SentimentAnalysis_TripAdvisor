the hotel is very well located: walking distance to the central rue st catherine, in the middle of shopping downtown and really close to the hotel you can also find the bus stop to go directly to the airport. The staff is very kind and always ready to help you we were 3 and we had a superior suite.. honestly too small for 3 and the view was quite bad.. it was on the backward and no view at all!!! .

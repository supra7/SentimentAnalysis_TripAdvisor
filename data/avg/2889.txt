We took an extended vacation and spent our time in 4 different hotels throughout Tenn. This hotel was kind of a let down compared to the other 3 we used during our travels. It's a pretty average hotel, the carpets were dirty (bottom of my white socks were dingy after the first evening....kept my socks on the remaining time there). The staff was nice and friendly and helped us with directions to attractions, etc. I felt safe in this hotel, but it was far from the local attractions (Beale, Graceland, etc). Overall, very ordinary stay; and compared to the value that we received at the other hotels, felt that this was overpriced for what we got. Overall, probably a good place for an overnight stay, but wouldn't recommend beyond that.

My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. It is not a fancy hotel, but we spent so much time exploring Seattle, it didn't matter. Yes, there is an adult book store across the street, but I say-loosen up! It is in a great location and the staff were very friendly and helpful. If you can get this hotel at a rate under $100, take it!!

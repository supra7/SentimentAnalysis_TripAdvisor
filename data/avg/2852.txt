The hotel recognized platinum members, with a free snack, water and points. All requests were granted. Breakfast had a good selection to choose from. Waffles, hard boiled eggs, muffins, selections of breads for toast and english muffins. They also had great selections for cold cereal, granola and hot oatmeal. The cooler had milk, egg sandwiches, corn dogs, mixed fruit and grapefruit. Coffee and juice. The area for breakfast is too small, people kept getting in each others space. The room needs updated, you can tell it is off an interstate. Hotel staff, friendly.

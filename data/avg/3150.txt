Its a hotel of contrast. Looks grand, contemporary and very modern when you enter. Its got a big lobby, nice sitting and waiting area, big breakfast room. However when you take the lift to any floors it depicts a slightly different story. Not so clean carpets, very basic rooms with mediocre beds. I have stayed in much better 4 star hotels in Amsterdam at a cheaper price than this. Overall Novotel Amsterdam is a decent hotel, but its room price and the 4 star tag is simply not justified.

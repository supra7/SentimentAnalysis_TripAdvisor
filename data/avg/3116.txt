Normally when I stay in Hong Kong on business I get a serviced flat, but as I was only in town for 3 days my office booked me into the W Hong Kong. The W has all the exemplary things you expect of an Asia hotel - beautifully clean, impeccable service, well appointed. I only had about four real issues with it. (1) Most annoying thing: There are only three elevators linking the entry area to the lobby. Thereafter you connect to a bank of six elevators to take everyone to their rooms, bars, restaurants, etc. Predictably enough, at "peak times" you have to queue to get into the bank of three to get up to lobby to access the second bank of elevators. Again, very annoying when you are tired at the end of a long day. (2) It is eye wateringly expensive. You get what you pay for (or, in my case, what your firm pays for), but Aye Caramba... (3) It is decked out an awful lot like a waiting room to a trendy nightclub. Music, lights, energy. Extremely bling. If that is your thing, then great. If you just want a quiet bed after a hard day at work, or are with a family, it may not be your thing. (4) You have to pay for wireless in your room. That always irritates me. Especially at those prices. You do get free WiFi in the "lobby" (use that word loosely) area.

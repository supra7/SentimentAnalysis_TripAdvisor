I was excited to stay in a hotel named after an individual for whom I have great respect and admiration. However, the room was a disappointment. We stayed for three nights early December. The resort fee was a surprise to my boyfriend, but I had read about it prior, so I told him to not worry. However, the resort fee didn't include simple things such as Internet access. I had to pay several dollars for an opportunity to print out our boarding passes, as I didn't have the conformation number ahead of time and had to print from my private email. Secondly, I was very disappointed that I found a bathrobe hanging in the bathroom when we arrived, so I placed it on the floor with the used towels in the morning, and viola! it was layed out on our bed when we returned to the room later that day, along with the two robes hanging in the closet. I agree with an earlier posting about the washcloths. We had loads of hand towels, and two facecloths. The temperature control didn't seem to work accurately either. It was extrememly hot in the room and we were glad it was December and a little bit cool. We did get to see many of the runners out of our window for the Rock and Roll Marathon. I am not sure if I would recommend as it had too many issues to be tied to the name Trump. I was dissapointed to say the least.

10 of us stayed here in Oct.2011 .Happy with room and breakfast 6 of us waiting in the lobby for 2 cabs which took like more than 1/2 an hour. I got up to ask about the delay of the cabs, my sister's handbag was gone with money ,passport, etc. She and all of us ran out of the hotel but of no help. The hotel staff did not do anything and behaved as if nothing happened. We did the usual police station, report. As the Embassies are closed on Saturday no passport could be obtained till Monday. My sister and her husband could not join the cruise without the passport. They extended their stay by another 2 days. The hotel, gave the rooms but at a much higher price, not at the rate we had booked for the earlier 2 days. It was really disappointing. Going to the police is also a farce and waste of time and effort. We felt unsafe even inside the hotel .I would not recommend this hotel.

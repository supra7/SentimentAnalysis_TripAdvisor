We stayed here for the wknd for a romantic getaway. The location iis great, so if you're not planning on spending much time in your room, it'll do. The price is right ($160/nt) and like I said, the location can't be beat. We had cold but clear weather, so we weren't in the room much, which is good b/c the room kinda sucked. Great views, but the bed was way to soft (the "heavenly bed" seemed like it was past its prime), the room was dated and ugly, the technology old, and the bathroom was on the small side. It was decently clean and an okay size, but the staff was hit or miss and the food was bad. It was quiet, which was nice. Overall the experience was just "blah" and I wouldn't go back. Go eat at Canlis if you can get in!!! :)

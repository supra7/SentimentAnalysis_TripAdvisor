This hotel is in a great location and rather affordable. They are currently in the middle of major renovations (but you do not find that out until you get there). It seems like it is going to be very nice upon completion. They have a great little free business center in the lobby. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would go back after the renovations are complete, but probably not until then.

If you're looking for a cheap getaway to Seattle this is a good place to consider. Very basic but very clean. Two blocks to Westlake Center, a few more down to Pike Place Market. For $76.00 in the heart of the city on a Saturday night, you can't beat this place. Staff was friendly, let us check in at 1:30 pm as the room had just been cleaned. I will absolutely stay here again.

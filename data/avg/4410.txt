I used Priceline and I was initially really irritated to be booked at a Doubletree Guest Suites, which I don't think fit the bill of 3.5 "upscale deluxe" or however Priceline described the option. The hotel is oddly located if you are a "walking tourist," it's right off the highway and a boring 1 mile walk to the subway. We did have a beautiful view of the Charles River, but our room was really weird. We had a suite, but the main room had nothing but a HUGE conference table. So I'm not sure we really got a good deal, since over half of the suite was completely unusable unless we wanted to re-enact the final scenes from "The Apprentice." However, the room was really clean and everyone at the hotel was really nice. If you are traveling with a family or don't like to eat out. It's nice to have a fridge in the room and there is a Whole Foods just across the River Bridge. We were there during the marathon and it appeared that the hotel was really well organized to help participants and their families.

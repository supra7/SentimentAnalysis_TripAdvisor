Location of the hotel is fantastic, very close to good shopping, easy walk to Boston Common, Newbury Street etc. I arrived very late at night, Front Desk clerk was friendly but no services available (eg could not get room service, no-one to assist with bag etc). I believe hotel can provide more services when they are advised of a late arrival, apparently my travel agent didn't tell them my flight time. My room was on a high floor and at the back, and was very quiet and clean. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Room was very small and bathroom in particular was tiny, however totally functional. Had room service 1 night, however food was very average and I didn't repeat. Only real annoyance was when I asked the front desk for advice about visiting a particular local attraction. The person I spoke to showed little interest in assisting me, he spent the majority of the conversation typing and looking at his computer screen - I initially mistakenly thought he was looking up the information for me, however it soon became obvious that he wasn't. After telling me I could catch a train to the location, and being unable to answer any follow up questions I had, I went to the train station where I was told that there is no train that goes to this attraction and I needed to get a bus. I was pretty annoyed that this person clearly didn't know how to get there, but didn't just say "I don't know" or check with a coworker or on the internet. Definitely wasted my time that morning. On other occasions though I had really good service from the Front Desk (from different people), so it very much depended who you spoke to as to the level of service you would receive. Overall was ok, for location I would definitely highly recommend, for service and facilities I would think that similar or better could be obtained in nearby areas.

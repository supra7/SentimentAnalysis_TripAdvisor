on the plus side, the design is wonderful, the ipod dock and netspresso machine very comfy, the view from the top floor is astonishing (behind the huge iron grid)! the bar is also nice. the staff also speaks english... Room design is magnificent but there is not much room for put your stuff. also no smoking on top floors...! small swimming pool, and a bit noisy. This light that you see above the bed does not have a switch to turn OFF. Yes, its nice when you see it on a photo, but not nice directly on your face! To turn it off you need to switch off the main power supply to the room (and open bathroom light) the neiborhood is very ethnic. lots of ethnic fast food (open at night) and stores, few bars, some prostitudes and a bit dangerous. Location is good, Barri Gothic has more bars, Eixample is the expensive part of the city, all close with metro and lots of walking around, especially to find a good resturants.

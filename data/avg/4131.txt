This is a really nice hotel in an excellent location right by the Harbour and near to the historic City centre. We got this one night stay for free by cashing in frequent user points, and as such were delighted by the nice room, which included flat-screen TV, iPod dock, nice furniture etc. We walked into the City for our evening meal. It is a shame we didn't have more time to explore this impressive and historic town. If you are a Brit like myself or European, be prepared for the "Classic" US Hotel experience at this place. By that I mean, when you park your car the valet wants a tip, when you try and pick up your bags you are intercepted by a porter, who wants a tip, then he summons another guy to take your stuff to your room, and he wants to prattle on about Florida and generally get in the way and then get a tip. When leaving, if you try and grab a luggage trolley yourself the girl on reception will try and tell you you aren't allowed to. If you ignore her reasoning that you are the customer and can do what you like, you will garner the hate-filled stares of the crowd of uniformed tip-vampires loitering around the entrance. And then you will still have to tip the valet to get your car back. I must say the tone and body language of the porting staff were generally condescending, and I feel cheated by effectively having to pay them to go away. To say again, this is a very smart hotel in a very good location. But you will be shelling out a constant stream of green-backs before you get any peace.

I recently spent 4 nights here. The check-in was wonderful, the staff great, and the hotel itself was nice. The room service was horribly overpriced-- not only do they charge 18% more than listed price, the listed prices in the rooms are ALREADY higher than in the restaurant ($2 more on soups and $3-$8 more on entrees/burgers). And they add a $3 tip on top of the 18% (and then all the regular taxes are there, too). So a burger and soup were $32, and it was a very. VERY average burger. Total rip-off with the excess charges. I did not use daily housekeeping and was able to get what I needed when I saw them in the halls. And the women I met were very, very friendly and polite. But the bathroom was not so clean and it's a huge let-down for a hotel like this to be so neglected. I did email Rissa, who took a day and a half (and two emails) to respond to me. She said all the blahblahblah and offered to change rooms, but I was halfway through my stay and changing rooms is a pain. This was a business trip so I was not looking for compensation on the room. I thought she may care a bit more with the pics as proof, but I guess they hear complaints all day. I did make sure to include all the positive I had to say as well. The internet fees are a HUGE scam-- $12-$15 for 24 hours. There is no way that they aren't banking money here. Parking is another point of contention but I did not park so not really going worry about this one. Overall, if this were MY money, I would NOT stay here. With the $20 a night parking, internet fees, and insane food pricing I would expect a much more modern, bigger, and clean room. They don't even have microwaves or fridges in the rooms. Even most motels give you a microwave.

Look its the Copley Marriot. It's gorgeous, it's in a prime location, it has a high end mall attached to it, what's not to love? Well, the rooms have been chopped down after renovations. I get it, more rooms, more guests, more revenue. No pool, ok. But really, did you have to take away the robes? I love the robes. Luxury should mean luxury.

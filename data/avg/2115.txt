We arrived at the Hotel Pera Tulip on Good Friday at around 4 p.m. Certainly not the last to check in we were given a room at the back on the first floor just above what we thought was only a restaurant. We did hesitate, but accepted the room. What a mistake! When we arrived back after dinner at around midnight our room was literally in the middle of a disco. We lay listening to the drone of the music and then the staff clearing the tables until around 4 a.m. The night manager wouldn't change our room (he said they were full), but did offer us a drink! He admitted to knowing about the problem. The next day we were able to change, but this is not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel. They should not have sold these rooms! The hotel itself is otherwise fine. Small, but cute sauna, hammam and swimming pool, nice breakfast and the location near the Tunel in the Pera district is perfect for eating out at night and also reaching the city in the day time.

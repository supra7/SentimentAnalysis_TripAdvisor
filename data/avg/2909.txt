I came here for a 3 day conference also being held in the hotel. The location was fabulous, and there were a lot of great places to eat within a few blocks. My room was comfortable and roomy, and the price was reasonable. My only complaints are that this hotel is in serious need of some updating. There are only 3 elevators and they are painstakingly slow. It was not unusual to have to wait 5-10 minutes for an elevator, and by that time there was such a large crowd waiting that I often had to wait for a second elevator. I had no desire to walk up 25 flights of stairs either. The plumbing is very old, and very LOUD in your room. I heard noise every time my neighbors flushed, showered, etc. The ice machine was a few doors down from me and sounded like someone was pounding on the wall with a hammer each time it was used. The meeting room left a lot to be desired, but that probably wouldn't be an issue for most people staying here. I'd probably look elsewhere for my next Chicago stay.

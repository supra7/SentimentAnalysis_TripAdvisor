We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour package, so I can't say if it was a good value or not. Our room was clean, nice looking, and quiet. However, we had asked for a twin bed room and were given a double bed instead. Fortunately the room included a pull out sofa so it wasn't too much of an inconvenience. The lobby has a nice gift shop.

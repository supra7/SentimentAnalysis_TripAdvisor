and here's why...We stayed during December 2011 for four nights.The front desk staff was very friendly and helpfull.This was the best thing about our stay here.The lady helped with our flight bookings and the doorman kept our luggage untill the rooms was ready,also managing to book us a desert safari when we could not find availablility.We had rooms overlooking the very busy highway,despite booking months in advance and asking for a nice view and quiet rooms....the noise is terrible...but to be fair,one gets used to it and it did not really affect our sleep.I think that the advert this hotel have on their website is misleading as it is a block away from the marina and has no view of it.The beach is within walking distance but with all the beach stuff etc its really too far to be a comfortable walk.The same with the Metro stop-one can walk but its a bit far with shopping bags etc.The hotel has no bar!!So no nice cold beer after a hot day...a definate thumbs down!The rooms itself is nice and comfortable with all one needs-but the decor is so bland!!Get a new interior designer,please!Beige on beige on beige!!The pool area is not inviting and looks as if nobody cares....All in all,not what I had expected and too far away from central locations.Some small shops near the hotel can provide one with self catering foodstuffs and there are restaurants near.We did not eat at the hotel but had a meal and drinks(!!) at the Yacht Club overlooking the Marina which was nice.All in all we would not stay here again,sorry.

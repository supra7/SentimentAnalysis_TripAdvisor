After reading the negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised with room . I found the staff to be very helpful. Continental breakfast is plentiful. I had no problems with parking my vehicle during our week's stay. Travelodge also provided free computer access . It is an older building & hallway carpets do appear worn in spots. Felt the area was safe for us to explore the neighborhoods. This motel provided all the services I expected.

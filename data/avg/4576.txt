Stayed here just one night on a weekend on a business trip. The hotel interior was very nice and the staff friendly and helpful. Our room wasn't ready at check-in at 5:00 PM, but they gave us a complimentary drink and appetizer and called on the cell phone when the room was ready a short time later. What was disappointing was the exterior and the area around it. To get to the street was circuitous and then you had to go back upstairs (carrying wheeled luggage), so awkward on checking out and meeting my car service. The area around it was fairly seedy and dark on a street way off the mainstream, so a bit uncomfortable at night. The weakness of the staff is that they weren't particularly helpful in providing advice about nearby restaurants, so didn't travel too far in the dark. The next morning, discovered nice restaurants nearby and that we were only a few blocks away from Boston Commons and the theater district. Who would have known.

The location of this hotel is perfect and the lobby is lovely, but it ends there. We had a similar experience to a previous reviewer. The rooms are dated and in need of a makeover and do not have that fresh look. There were only 2 small and rough towels for 2 of us (things do not dry quickly in the Seattle climate) and I called to ask for more and that we be given 4 towels daily. Well, I had to keep calling and if they got the towels delivered, they did not replace the shampoo and soap. The maids barge in quickly and barely give you time to get to the door. My sense is that there is a cultural and language barrier. We would not stay here again. The Lobby bar is great.

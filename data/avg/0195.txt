i scoured the net trying to find a place to stay in seattle cheaply. Just needed one night close to where I needed to pick up my car the next day. (i got in to late to get car the same day) This hotel was the cheapest and closest walk to car rental place. I got the room for 99 bucks. thats a deal in seattle....it had a little mini kitchen in it too. But I wasn't there to use it. It is very noisy (in my terms) from road traffic...so I put the fan on to drown it out. Its not the Hilton, kind of worn down but if looking for cheap digs not bad. People at front desk very helpful and nice. Great grocery store right up street...metropolian....I LOVED that store. Around the block was many bars, stores and restaurants. Close to space needle and not far from the water. Not sure I would stay there again. In fact I had to book a place to stay last night of my trip before flight out next day and I was going to stay there again but went with Warwick instead....but that was $179. awesome spot....but thats another review.

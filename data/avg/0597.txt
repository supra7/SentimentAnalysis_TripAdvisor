The renovations are now complete, or at least we didn't see or hear any construction. We stayed at this same hotel a few years ago. The hotel is nice, and even nicer now. However, the service is still poor. We paid a lot for our room ($200/per night). We choose the hotel because of the location. It took over 45 minutes to get our bags from the door to our room(and then we called to find out where they were). The room still had trash from the previous guest. Parking is $35/per day. We felt for the price we paid, the service could be better and the staff more friendly. A little extra could go a long way.

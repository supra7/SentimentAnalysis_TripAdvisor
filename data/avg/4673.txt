I agree with many of the other posters. The hotel is very nice, and the staff tries to be very accommodating, but one feature over which they have no control is the noise--not only from the fire station right across the street, but the general street noise. The latter may be a problem in many Chicago hotels that are adjacent to a major street, but it is certainly a problem here, accentuated by the fire station. We had to leave the hotel, and they were very pleasant and understanding of that. If this is ok for you, then a good point of their location is their proximity to Lou Malnoti, a Chicago icon for deep dish pizza--not just for tourists, but for locals. It is delicious, famous for their corn meal crust; located a short walk away from the hotel.

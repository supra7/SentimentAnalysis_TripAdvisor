The Palmer House Hilton is one of the old, classic hotels in the downtown Loop section of Chicago. The best things about this hotel are its grand lobby and its convenient location within an easy walk to the Art Institute of Chicago, Millenium Park, Grant Park, buses and trains, and plentiful restaurants and stores. The front desk check-in was efficient but not warm and friendly. The hotel is huge so I had a long walk from the lobby to my guestroom. Many guestrooms are noisy due to the close proximity to the El trains whicgh run right next to the hotel so if you're a light sleeper you can ask for a room away from the El. My room was an interior one overlooking a non-descript courtyard. The room was very small and the bathroom was so tiny I could barely close the door without hitting the toilet ... probably the smallest bathroom I've seen in North America and even small by European hotel standards. The hotel charges for using its WiFi signal and the while there is a Starbucks on the ground floor of the hotel, this Starbucks does not have a free WiFi signal either for Starbucks cardholders. The hotel does have a business center which allows guests to print their boarding passes for free. This hotel would not be my first choice but the convenient location is indeed a plus.

Hotel is great in terms of facilities. Free parking is adequate and secure. I had a spacious room and almost everything was in greart working ocndition. Did not try the bar/restaurant, but it looked like a great placve for cocktails. Problems are with the service. I checked in at night close to midnight. Front desk person had a no-can-do attitude. I just did not feel welcome as i was not offered water nor a wake up call. Very cold person at front desk. The following day, whenever I called the front desk to request information about services available, the staff would sound tired (I spoke with at least 4 different people) and no one ever says who they are. The following day I called front desk for a wake up call. Person who answered seemed really tired and/or unhappy. Called later as the desk phone in my room did not work. It took 2.5 hours and 3 calls before it was fixed. The first 2 times I did not know who answered. By the third time I made sure to ask whom I was talking to. (A different person answered every time.) Mabel identified herself and finally someone showed up within 5 minutes of my call and fixed my phone in 5 minutes. As I understood the hotel was at 100% capacity. I requested a shuttle ride to Love Field airport... With the hotel at 100% capacity, the hotel only had one driver scheduled. I know this because the reception staff kept complaining about this out loud. The ride to the airport I requested becuase knowing the shuttle would be impossible, I decided to rent a car. In all the hotel is great, the FRONT DESK staff I interacted with is not. Thank you!

Just stayed at this hotel and read all of the reviews on this site prior to our stay. This isn't the greatest hotel or the worst. I've stayed in other Westin's recently including near DFW airport and this just isn't as new or modern. On the other hand it wasn't falling apart either. Lots of goods tips from other reviewers including the cheaper ($18 per day) parking on the north side of the hotel along 5th Ave connected by the 2nd floor skybridge. Pulled into the drive-thru area on arrival and they allowed us to leave the car there for 15 minutes while we checked in. That was plenty of time as there was no line at the counter. At other times during our stay I noticed short lines at checkin - luck of the draw like any hotel. Check-in was friendly with certainly no hint of an anti-Priceline bias as one reviewer claimed. We were given our choice of towers so we went with the north and asked for a view if possible. We ended up on the 30th floor and did in fact have a good view of the Sound. The room was fine. We went with the King and put the kids on the pull-out sofa. Thanks to another reviewer for that suggestion. We used the pool a couple of times with the kids. The top row of tiles needs a good scrub but it seemed fine otherwise. I couldn't bring myself to use the big hot tub. There was a healthy dose of foam on top and it looked like it needed a good dose of something. Top Pot Donuts on 5th Ave just north past the parking garage is a great place for good coffee and truly excellent donuts. We thought the location was good and excellent for walking around Seattle. We all enjoyed the Olympic Sculpture Park and waterfront.

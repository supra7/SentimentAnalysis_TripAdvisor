I booked this hotel as it was my only option left the day of arrival. It is right next to the Space Needle and we did walk from the hotel down to Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square. When checking into the hotel, the front desk clerk was very friendly and helpful. Every staff member that I encountered was in a great mood and smiling. The room was not the best that I've seen and definately not the worse. There were two beds, a fridge and I think a microwave, although I can't remember for sure. The beds were comfortable. The room was a bit noisy with traffic, but I was able to sleep. The bathroom was small. The whole room could use a paint job and some new furnishings. They do offer a continental breakfast but I didn't get to check it out. I paid $114 for the night which I can't complain about. Would I stay there again? Possibly. Would I recommed it to you? If you're not too picky, then give it a chance.

Perhaps the most over-designed space I've ever been in. The ground level entry with the huge backlit 'W,' giant stylized tree trunk and horse sculpture made out of speakers is is cool, but from the minute you step on the video-screened floor of the the elevator to get to the reception level, things start to go a bit crazy. There's simply too much going on everywhere you look. The design concepts are completely disconnected and it's a shame because some of the elements are rather interesting. Reception was very friendly and efficient. The hallway to the guest rooms was great and had a sort of Alice in Wonderland feel, kitted out like a private library shelved with various books and personal items all sculpted in white. (Good luck finding the elevator call button which is hidden in the design.) The room was spacious and fairly cool with sliding walls that could be moved around for heightened bathroom privacy. The bathroom was large with separate bath, shower and toilet areas. Like the rest of the hotel, there was a bit too much going on in the room design-wise, but it was nowhere near as disjointed as the public spaces. The room had a nice view of the harbor, but don't expect the the postcard picture; this hotel is nowhere near the iconic waterfront of Hong Kong. In fact it's not near very much you'll want to see as a tourist (except the rather outstanding mall that it's attached to) but it's only about a twenty minute walk to the ferry. The rooftop pool is a highlight of this hotel. The view is mostly blocked by the neighboring buildings, as is the sun after about 1PM, but if you go early it's a great place to hang out and recharge. The giant wall mosaic is a standout design feature of the hotel and reiterates the 'down the rabbit hole' theme of the hallways. Overall we enjoyed our stay here, but next time I'd opt for a better located hotel that's not trying so hard to prove something.

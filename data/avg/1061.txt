I'd long been curious about the W's, never having stayed in one before, until now. It always seemed like it was more fun inside from the outside, I was wrong. Instead its a dark den of hype and you're better of staying elsewhere. Front desk wasn't overly friendly, and not at all effective in dealing with 3AM noisy neighbours in an adjacent room. The walls in this hotel don't offer much of a sound barrier, we felt like we were IN the party next door. When I later visited the front desk in person to again mention the all night party, I got lots of apologies but no action. Only after insisting that an apology wasn't good enough was I offered a free breakfast or a few dollars off the room... Good thing I didn't have to strong-arm them to remove the double-charged parking fee from my bill. Pros: Nice location, decent bed, good restaurants in area (try Purple, it was great!) Cons: Ineffective/indifferent staff, valet parking $40+/night, valet/parking entrance is a zoo, NOISY room, dirty room service carts were left in the hallways for hours

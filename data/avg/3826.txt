The hotel was very very clean. Rooms are spacious huge beds lovely bathroom Shame we didn't have a car as a bit far away from things The lovely Joy at the concierge was really helpful and helped us make the most of our few days there Not much to do their outside of LA live but some nice restaurants arounds

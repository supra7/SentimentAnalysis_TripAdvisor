I had a mix feeling about staying here. I arrived around 23rd. in London and stayed here with my friend. the rooms were small but fine n clean but the bathrooms were a bit too small for my liking or my friends. Its a no frill hotel/lodge and we had to pay 75pounds around about for a night's stay which I totally loathed..Had I got the room for 19 pounds( the price they advertise at) I'd be glad to stay there then.

We spent 4 nights at this Marriott. The hotel is just an average Marriott property. It was clean. We only encountered staff members at check-in and she was friendly. The hotel's location is great for shopping and dinning. It is also an easy walk to Beacon Hill and The Commons. Backbay subway stop is about a block from the hotel's lobby, making the hotel very accessible to all areas of Boston. Although we didn't encounter any problems during our stay, I'm not sure that I would stay here again. There are many other hotels in Boston in the same price range that are not only nicer, but have staff that go out of their way to welcome you. Plus it's location, between two shopping malls, does feel a little odd when you are in the lobby area and elevators.

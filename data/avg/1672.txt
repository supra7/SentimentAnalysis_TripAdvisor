It was a lovely hotel in a nice position, ideal for gas lamp district, which was gorgeous, but unfortunately the hotel was a let down, but poor and unhelpful staff (except car vallets, who were excellent.) everything seemed to incur extra costs, eg, parking, wifi, water in the room, which given the cost of the Hilton, was disappointing. Swimming pool was very small and limited sun beds, think there are better quality hotels at a better price than the Hilton, which let's itself down..

Stayed for two nights in July for a company meeting. The location is great as it is in the inner harbor area and near Little Italy. There's a Whole Foods three blocks away, and other places to eat/drink in the area. The room was clean, well appointed with flat screen TV. The maid service and the service in the breakfast area were great (the conference services were great as well). You have free access to a state-of-the-art gym which is FANTASTIC! As for the weaknesses, I have to agree with other posters that the hotel must either replace most of the front desk staff or Hilton has to do some serious customer service training for those folks. They just don't have the right attitude to work at a hotel front desk. Also, while the hotel offers free wireless and LAN internet connection, I found the strength of the connection very weak. I also use a Verizon cellphone which I couldn't use inside the hotel due to a very weak connection. I have never had ANY problems with Verizon coverage, and I travel quite a bit. But my my colleagues on T-Mobile also had connectivity issues . We had to go outside to make calls. Anyway, it's a nice hotel physically, a nice location w/free access to a fantastic gym. If they fix their connectivity issues and train their front desk staff, then the hotel would be much improved.

If you are looking for a quiet location East of Barcelona city near the beach (10 mins walk) then this may be for you. Not up to 4* standard and more a business than leisure hotel. Staff were very unfriendly, no atmosphere whatsoever. Rooms very clinical and whoever thought that castors for beds and chairs on laminate floor was a good idea - think again! If you lie on the bed resting on wall you get launched across the floor. Minimal toiletries provided (one very small soap, one shampoo and one shower gel), nothing but water in mini bar, although lots were provided. No corkscrew, no writing paper, no tissues, no robes or slippers, no area guide. The Ramblas Poblenou is just round corner and has some good restaurants/bars with street tables and shops. The area feels almost villagey despite the fact the gentrification is half complete and there are piles of rubble everywhere. Apparently tour of the nearby East Barcelona cemetry is worthwhile (sadly we did not have time to visit :-) ). Come back in 10 years and I reckon this will be a cracking area to stay in (and maybe the hotel staff will have attended the charm course by then too). Did not eat anything in hotel as it was so soulless. Metro is 5 mins away but when you first come out you do wonder what kind of area you are coming to as it is very run down.

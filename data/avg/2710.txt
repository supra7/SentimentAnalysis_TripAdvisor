I'm not blowing this out of proportion. There is a fire station a block north of the hotel and it is quite active. It seemed like there was a call at least every hour, usually southbound particularly on Saturday, even at night. Our corner room on the 22nd floor sounded like those fire trucks were coming thru the hotel. Noise from the interior of the hotel was minimal, but from outside, well I guess that's why they call it the big city, but this was our third trip to Chicago in the last 3 years, with 2 stays previous at the Hilton GI. I don't remember it being that loud there. The room was modern and spacious, everything was new and clean. Check in was great, they let us in at 12:30 pm, the staff helpful and attentive, although we had to call for maid service on Sunday after 3pm. Breakfast was OK at best. Some of the pastries and bagels we had seemed past day old. Based on our experience, I think I would pass on this hotel if the opportunity to stay here again ever arose.

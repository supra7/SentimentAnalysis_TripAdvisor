The hotel was in obvious need of an extreme makeover, but the staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed on the fifth floor and the elevator and planes leaving the airport were noisy after 3 a.m. Breakfast was better than expected..simple but adequate. Overall...I would stay here again for the cost, but if your looking for trained ducks you better stick to the Peabody.

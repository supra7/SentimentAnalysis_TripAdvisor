I stayed here for one night in January 2010 on the back end of a vacation. The first 5 nights we stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park on 5th Avenue, and switched for one night to be at a conference held in the Sheraton. The Vintage Park was a far better experience for about 1/2 the price. The rooms at the Sheraton are top-notch: large, clean, comfortable, everything you would expect. The hotel is beautiful though a little difficult to navigate. My problems were with Internet access and the help desk. I tried to log in using the ethernet cable provided. No dice. I ended up talking to an off-site tech support guy for 30 minutes before giving up. And wireless internet, if I wanted to use it, would have been $12/day. Seriously, $12/day for something as standard as wireless internet. My other complaint was the staff. I asked one when to get the airport shuttle and was told 5:58 AM. I come the next morning and ask a different person who says no shuttle until 6:15. Huh? I wait outside anyway. The guy outside says the shuttle will pull right up. It didn't, instead stopping on the street. Even though nobody was around and there was a staffperson 10 feet from me, he didn't move to tell me the shuttle was there and certainly didn't bother to help with the 3 heavy bags I was toting. All in all, this hotel didn't seem worth the cost. The Vintage Park was much friendlier, with effortless internet connection and fast, courteous staff.

From Sea/Tac you can take the light rail to university. Then walk 3 blocks (left side) to the hotel. There is no way of accessing the lobby from the street but you have to go up an elevator. The lobby is the smallest plainest one I've ever seen!! Staff were friendly Access to the exec lounge was available (HHonors) and the food was plain and the soft drinks were free but you had to pay for all others. The view from the Top was nice though. The bedroom was tiny and dated but the bed was comfortable. Breakfast the next day was really quite good and eating at the top (28th floor) was an added benefit.

Clean rooms, great location. We went to a concert at the Moore Theater so the hotel location was very convenient for walking back and forth and close to restaurant options. I had two dissatisfactions after our stay there - one was that there was some very slight damage to the bumper of our car after we used the valet service. The bumper looked like it had been pulled away from the car and one of the clips was broken. I noticed it as soon as we got to our destination after check out and called about 20 minutes after picking up the car. The response from the hotel was ok, but after the "investigation" we were basically penalized for waiting until the next morning to bring it by to have the hotel look at it and not immediately after calling. Who wants to drive all the way back downtown when given the choice of coming in the next morning when it's more convenient? If that was going to be an issue when investigating what happened to the car, then say we needed to come right back to have them look at it. After looking into it the manager felt they weren't responsible and it really wasn't a huge issue - more annoying that anything. The other annoyance is that they overcharged us after the fact and said we ate some of the food in the room. It wasn't a huge charge, but after the car thing and having to call twice to have it credited back it would make me think twice about staying there again.

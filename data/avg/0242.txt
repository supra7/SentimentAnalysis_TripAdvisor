Cleanliness: Broken tiles, dust, some film in the bathroom... It wasn't bad but not great either. Service: Friendly and helpful from the bellboy to the front desk. They gladly held our luggage when we needed and valet was polite and efficient. Location: Great as it is right downtown Seattle so in walking distance or short ride away from all major attractions. Value: I booked through Priceline so got a good deal but that also came at a price (see rooms below). Rooms: I think because we got a good deal that we were also given the most terrible room in the building. Firstly, the room is completely dated - it looks and feels as though it was built in the early 1950s. TV is old, bathrooms were small and dingy looking with terrible looking tiles and a very small tub, plumbing could use some work as the water was either too hot or too cold and made a lot of noise when showering, carpets seemed ingrained with dirt, small room and the only window we had was facing the air conditioning vent and nothing else. We could barely see skies outside our window. I would never wish this kind of room on anyone. We even switched hotels after one night since we couldn't believe this is what we paid for. I would recommend to stay away from this hotel if possible. I don't know how people could give this place 5 stars when it is just so old and outdated. Staff are very friendly but the rooms were just atrocious.

I would stay at another Hilton property in Chicago. My favorie is The Drake but other great choices are The Palmer House, Hilton Chicago & Hilton Suites Mag Mile. I wouldn't stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again. My checkin was delayed...they first said 1:30pm (I arrived at 12:15pm). When I came back at 2:15pm they said it would be another 1/2 hour. I complained and they did get me in right away...well sort of, they gave me the wrong room # and the corresponding keys to that persons room!!! Once I got to my own room I found the tv wouldn't work for more than 2 minutes before it lost its signal and blacked out. The heating unit was very loud as well as the hallway was super loud. Paper thin walls and heavy closing doors. I was on the 23rd highest floor so didn't hear street noise. Can't imagine if that would have been a facor too... Stay at The Drake :)

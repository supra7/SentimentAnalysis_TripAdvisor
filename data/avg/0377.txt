This is one of the more dilapidated and rundown Renaissance hotels that I have stayed in. The hotel feels more like a mid-tier level than what one would expect from one of the flagship Marriott properties. If you are paying full price (i.e. not Priceline, Hotwire, etc.)...look somewhere else. Personally, for $150+/night, I would recommend the Sheraton. Like other reviewers have noted, the Renaissance is not exactly convenient to most of the downtown attractions. The hotel is up on a hill about 5-6 blocks from the closest attraction. Its not horrible...but the Sheraton and others are closer. I got this hotel via Priceline...and I felt that the Priceline price was more acceptable given the rundown condition of the hotel. The Renaissance lacks a dedicated lobby entrance (i.e. place to pick up taxis, etc.) and I felt every time I went outside for a taxi was an adventure in and of itself. Be prepared to be hit up by "private" limos instead of the usual taxis. I made this mistake...once. You will not get a good deal with the private car. It almost feels like the parking staff out front is getting a kick back. As others have noted...this hotel has to have the oldest elevators known to mankind. Seriously...I thought I was on the Tower of Terror ride at Disney. My room was adequate but nothing special. This is a good Priceline hotel...but spend your full $ at a location closer to downtown attractions with amenities more fitting the price.

The hotel room was fairly clean, though a bit small for American standards. The location was central, close to Boston Commons, Legal Seafood, and in the theater district around the corner from Macy's and Chinatown. I had a nice view from an upper floor of downtown Boston and one of the windows opened slightly for ventilation which was a plus. My biggest surprise (dislike) was the fact that there were price tags all around the room, e.g. $250 cleaning fee if there was smoking in the room (not that I had plans to do this), if even a thing was moved (not consumed) from the mini-bar/fridge I would be charged for that item, $25 cleaning fee for storing any of my own drinks/food in the fridge -- ridiculous! The A/C was a bit noisy and old, the bathroom clean, but somewhat dated. Also, as other reviewers have noted, the separate elevators for the lobby (not at street level) and the rooms was slightly inconvenient. Internet is $10/day in room, much better price than the business center which was kindly pointed out to me at the front desk. The staff were friendly, but almost erring on the side of too casual. I read that the hotel had laid off a bunch of their housekeeping staff a short while before my stay by replacing them with non-union outsourced cheap labor... so this might explain some of the behavior/attitude of the staff. Though, I got a nice deal from the hotel to the Boston Logan via a private car (Escalade) from one of the senior bellmen, $25.

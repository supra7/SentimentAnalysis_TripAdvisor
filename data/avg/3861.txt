The Belltown Inn is a charming, recently renovated five floor building that seems to have a lot of quality for a VERY reasonable price. This hotel has many more positives than negatives, but it all depends on what you need. Close to everything downtown, the Belltown is right on the bus line (both good and bad). In the heart of a broad choice of great restaurants, safe and secure. That being said, here are a few of the positives, and a few of the negative...... Positive: Great location, secure (all halls monitored) building, laundry on site, many nearby restaurants, super staff, comfortable beds with kitchenette, plenty of hot water and good water pressure, expanded cable TV lineup, easy access to bus line in "free" zone, nice desk and work area, nice view from rooftop deck, non-smoking facility, limited pet-friendly Negative: Lot's of street noise ranging from loud talk and yelling to sirens and bus noise, small refrigerator, limited storage & closet space, only one mirror in the room (bathroom), typically expensive parking in lots and very limited street parking, VERY expensive neighborhood grocery in a less-than-desirable climate late at night Recommendations: Carry a lot of change for the panhandlers on the street (or a really good excuse to say no), try to get a courtyard room (quieter and a fountain provides white noise), earplugs might be beneficial. Parking about $250 a month for reserved parking in a secure garage (many available nearby) I would heartily recommend this location - easily the best value downtown!

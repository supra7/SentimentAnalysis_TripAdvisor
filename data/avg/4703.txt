I just got back from a dental convention in Chicago and decided to stay at this Hilton Garden Inn. Let me start by saying this hotel is perfectly located in the heart of downtown, close to the red line train, shopping and numerous great places to eat. The check in was polite and fast. I got up to my room and was surprised how clean and modern the room was. Flat screen T.V. king size foam bed, comfortable enough for me but if you like a bed that is on the firm side you may not like this one. The room also had a fridge and microwave which was nice! The bathroom was spotless! There were two concerns though, one was the common halls had an echo and some guests don't seem to think of others at one o' clock in the morning yelling slamming doors etc. Second the AC/HEATING UNIT kept coming on for 10 or 15 seconds at a time all through the night! Annoying! And very loud! This was after I switched it off! After the first night I went down to the front desk to notify them of this problem and they sent somebody up to the room(I guess while I was out) to try to fix this, but the second and last night I stayed the same problem happened again. The front desk staff did ask me if the problem was fixed but after I said "No" she didn't seem to care to much. I would recommend this hotel if your a "deep sleeper."

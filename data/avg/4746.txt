After staying at the Monaco in Seattle, the Chicago Monaco is not as nice -- nor the staff as helpful. The concierge was a joke. Recommended mostly all the places you find in the glossy hotel magazine for dining. Room was bizarre in its layout -- very difficult bathroom to use as the door barely cleared the tub and sink and the smallest shower I have ever used -- including on a cruise ship. This was the Mediterranean Suite. Doesn't hold a candle to the one in Seatte. Will not stay here again. Too many nice hotels to choose from. Great location, though.

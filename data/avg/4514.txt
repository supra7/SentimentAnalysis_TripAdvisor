We stayed at this hotel because i had a staff discount but otherwise i would probably opt for something a little more luxurious and couples friendly. Overall hotel is pretty nice. Staff at the front was a little "dry" if you ask me. Pros: -The gym although a little out of the way is very good with cardio machines, weights... -Swimming pool is great and not busy in the mornings...So is Sauna and Steam Room -Breakfast buffet is so delicious! The "omelette"station was quick and you can choose your own toppings as well as ask the lady ( she was super nice!) to use egg whites... -Central location of the hotel: access to major tourist points in the city Cons: -The room was fairly small -Security in the downstairs lobby is pretty strict about letting guests in ( which is good and bad i guess) and demand your room key.... -The hotel has more of a business feel to it and i wouldn't recommend it to couples looking for a romantic getaway.

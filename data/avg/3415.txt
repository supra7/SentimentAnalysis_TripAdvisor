We stayed at this hotel as it is located in Singapore's Changi International Airport and we decided to transit from Kuala Lumpur and stay overnight as we had an early flight out the next day. It is very convenient and easily accessible from all the terminals of Changi Airport using the inter-terminal Skytrain so that it is not necessary to leave the airport building at all ! There are a couple of restaurants and bars in the hotel as well as many other eateries in the airport concourse areas. However, it must be emphasised that this hotel is only accessible after exiting Immigration. Changi Airport has another Transit Hotel located within the airport without need to exit Customs & Immigration.

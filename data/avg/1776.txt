This hotel is great for babies/little non-swimmers and for older kids. If you have an avid swimmer who loves the beach, the pool and slides, but is under 48 inches...don't disappoint them. Our 6 year old is 47 1/2 inch and although we stated (every day) that we were okay with him going down the slide and he is a great swimmer, the hotel refused (their policy). They told me that he would love the kiddie slide....um, no he did not, too many babies. The beach is very small (eroding)....you have to take a bit of a walk to get to sandy area to play in the surf....it's doable. Great hotel for honeymooners and folks with little ones. The rooms are very clean and spacious.

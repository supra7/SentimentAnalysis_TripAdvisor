We booked online and got a great rate for our five night stay. After the first night with a "city view" room and three freight trains in the morning, we upgraded to a water view room for $50/night. The room was larger, had a balcony and a great view of the harbor and the Olympic Mountains beyond. Breakfast was not inexpensive but was very good as was the view from the restaurant. I thought the four stars was a bit of a stretch - the rooms and hallways were in need of some updating. In all - a great stay.

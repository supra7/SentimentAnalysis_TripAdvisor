This is a perfectly acceptable hotel. We stayed here to position ourselves close to the airport for early morning flight and to be very close to the light rail system from downtown Seattle. Hotel was perfect for these two reasons. Other than those two things, it's a perfectly plain hotel. It's not really like a typical Hilton - in fact, the rooms (furnishings, bath products, plastic glasses, etc) seem more like a really nice motel room. The only exception was the bed - it was extremely comfortable. We didn't hear any noise from airport. However, we did hear noise from the hallways of the hotel. We attempted to get to bed early the evening before the flight - but seemed to be awoken by people checking in late. Not their fault, soundproofing could have been better. Shuttle service to the airport was excellent, timely, and quick. Hotel bar sells Starbucks coffee. If you are coming off light rail to this hotel, the entrance is somewhat hard to find. I think another reviewer mentioned this. The exit puts you close to a Hilton sign - however, that's the employee entrance. The real entrance is on 180th street. We weren't the only ones lost during this visit - there were also two men walking around looking for the entrance. We passed them several times, not knowing what they were looking for, and we all ended up at check in desk.

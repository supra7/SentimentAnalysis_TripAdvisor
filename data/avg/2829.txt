Stayed for 2 nights mid week Jan 20-21st, got a good last minute price from easy to book. We were pleasantly surprised by the location. Right near the museums and upmarket stores, also some chic little bars nearby. It is really close from the tram stop, 1-2 min's walk max. It has been well refurbished, decor is good, has a boutique feel. The negative things to mention are mainly to do with noise. You can hear next door through walls, I was woken 4am by next door getting jiggy, this was soon resolved by hotel reception, they gave us earplugs (so I guess this a regular complaint). After that I didn't hear a thing. Building opposite is also getting refurb so builders are working from early am (again wasn't an issue when we had the earplugs in but thought it only fair to mention). Obviously this will be a short term issue. The hotel is clean, the bed was comfortable with nice plump pillows and crisp white linen. Our bathroom was not like the one on the website pictures, a lot more basic but clean. All in all not a bad hotel in a good location, would consider staying here again.

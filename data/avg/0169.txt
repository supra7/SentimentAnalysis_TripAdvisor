Room was bigger and more nicely-appointed than I'd expected. Lobby is OK--no real common space. Clean and safe hotel, just not elaborate. I have absolutely no idea why some of the negative reviews have as much energy as they do--some folks seem not to have inquired very much about the hotel, its services and the costs before assuming they were, or should have been, free. As others have said, parking can be very difficult and expensive in downtown Seattle. You can save a lot of money by driving across the nearby I-5 overpass and parking in a lot within a five to ten minute walk of the hotel. A good, basic chain hotel experience.

We stayed here for a long weekend. The building itself is interesting and historic and had a certain charm. It is also in a great location, walkable distance to the Boston Common and there are plenty of restaurants around. The room was cozy but a bit old. The staff was very helpful to us and it's easy to grab a cab back to the airport. The temporary fitness room was pretty good: fairly spacious and with a several treadmills. The main drawback I found was that a felt I was being nickled and dimed. WIFI was availble for a cost of about 10$ a day. I"ve been to cheaper motels that offered such service for free to their guests. Also, the ATM on premises charge $4.00 per use. I fully expect to pay a fee when not using one of my own bank's ATM, but $4 seemed high. I've seen NYC convenience stores, not known for being customer conscious in terms of price, that charged a much lower rate. Not a big deal, but I think they could do better by their guests with that ATM. I'd consider staying here again, but I'd also look around, too.

The Hilton Back Bay is an average hotel with high prices. We booked a Corner King Deluxe Room for 258/night. I booked through the hotel b/c I wanted to make sure we received a corner room b/c the view was important. For $258/night the view was the only thing we got. The King bed was not very comfortable and the room was musty. The bathroom was very very small. The view was great but was not worth it. We could have stayed at the Sheraton and gotten the same view and a much better room. We didn't have any problems with the staff, in fact they were very helpful. The bathroom towels were very rough, sounds picky, but when it actually hurts to dry yourself off there is a problem. I had breakfast at the buffet one morning, an average buffet, and it cost $50 for two people. Next time we visit Boston we will most likely be staying in the Marriot where at least we know they have excellent beds. Would never stay at an overpriced Hilton again.

I love Kimpton Hotels, but I do think that their room rates were too pricey for what they offered ($250.00). The rooms were very small -- almost like a large walk-in closet. The gym downstairs was cramped, as well, with just a couple of cardio machines. They do have an agreement with Gold's Gym where guests can use Gold's during their stay with Hotel Monaco, but be prepared to hike a few blocks down the street. They offer free wi-fi, which is good. They also had a cocktail hour in the lobby at 5 pm at which they serve beer, wine, sangria and other non-alcoholic bevs, in addition to some finger food.

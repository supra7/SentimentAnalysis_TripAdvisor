I stayed with some friends at the Hilton during the San Diego Comic-Con. We chose the hotel because of its close proximity to the Convention Center and because it looked so upscale. Which it was. But there were a lot of downsides to staying there, too. First of all, they charged for everything they could. I couldn't believe that at over $325/night (incl. taxes), we were expected to pay for the gym, for internet (per computer, not per room), and for the business center on top of that. And I'm just relieved that we didn't drive because it was between $20 - 30 for that per night. And for the amount that we were paying, there should at least have been good housekeeping provided. By the third day I actually had to leave a note for the maid to please sweep the bathroom floor because it hadn't been done yet. Despite the fact that my note was perfectly cordial, they responded to this by sweeping the floor and short-changing us on towels. Real mature. You really can't beat the location if you're attending a Padres game, or a convention. But I just don't think the high cost is justified, despite how upscale the hotel is. I'd have to think long and hard before I stayed there again.

I stayed at the Dana Hotel and Spa for a girls weekend away. The location of the hotel is fantastic, close to it all. We got a good deal for a rate and the rooms are fabulous. The beds are a little hard but I think most people like them that way. We had some issues with a few minor things, nothing that would make us never stay here again. The biggest issue was no microwave available to guests. We had leftover food and all we wanted to warm up on a cold, rainy day and they were not willing to help us out at all. They only give a few creamer and sugar for the coffee (which the only choices are dark or decaf) and it wasn't enough for two people. We called guest services for more and it took them more then two hours to bring it to us. The rooms are decent size and I love the wood flooring and floor to ceiling windows. What I don't care for is the fact that the wall between the shower and the room is glass with just a curtain over it. I get it and it would be cool if you were staying in a room with one bed...but for people traveling on business, or in our case, with friends it's a little creepy. I don't need to see shadows of my friends showering. I don't know why they would have that in a room with two beds. If you have trouble sleeping because of noise, bring your Ambien. On weekends the hotel gets a little loud ( a cab driver told us it's a known party hotel) and the street below is very busy and noisy. I guess I would say that guest services isn't all it's cracked up to be but I would stay here again if I got a deal on the rate.

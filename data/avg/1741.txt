It looks nice in brouchers and the service is fine...what they don't tell you is that the hotel is currently being renovated...which means if you plan on spending any time in the hotel pools you'll likely to hear drilling in the background... Also very annoying is the car park which is possibly a 10 minute walk from the hotel...the hotel provides a shuttle bus...but who wants to wait for a shuttle bus to the carpark?! Also there is not much of a beach outside this hotel...the wider bigger stretch is on the end of Kaanapali closer to Sheraton hotel...

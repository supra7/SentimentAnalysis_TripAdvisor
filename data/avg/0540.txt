Good location next to the Convention Center, and a great lobby. Friendly staff, but that's all that is good about the place. What's bad: 1. Small room. 2. Not a clean room. One of the two beds in the room looked like it had already been slept in before we arrived. The covers were wrinkled. And the bathroom sink wasn't clean. 3. House keeping apparently forgot about cleaning our room. We talked with housekeeping as we left for the day -- but at 4:30 pm we returned to find our room hadn't been cleaned. A call to housekeeping resulted in quick (if minimal) action -- but the call shouldn't have been necessary in the first place! 4. Sheets don't fit the bed -- and result in a very uncomfortable night. 5. free internet only from the hotel lobby. Too many other choices in the area to consider. I'll try one of the others next time. No, not recommended

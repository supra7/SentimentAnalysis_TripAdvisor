I tend to stay here when I have a flight back home early the next morning.it beats fighting traffic from Bellevue (where I have business)..Steakhouse downstairs is open for breakfast and theres a shuttle to/from the airport that runs every 30-45 minutes.Never had a bad experience, but Im pretty easy to please..

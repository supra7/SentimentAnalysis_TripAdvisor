Just came back from this hotel, staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast very good variety. The rashers and sausages were abit greasy though. Free Internet at reception came in handy. Beds were so comfortable :) Mini Bar in the room expensive, a small bottle of water for example was just over 2euros. Quite dining area lacked atmosphere. All in all is a nice hotel though. From Airport get the train to the central station(main station in Amsterdam) and get off at the RAI Station which is the second stop from the airport. Cost of ticket = 2.80euros. RAI Station is literally a few mins walk from the hotel can't miss it To go to the center of Amsterdam which is called "The Dam" you get tram four which is literally 2 mins walk from the hotel.......downside it is a good 20/25 mins to get to the main centre, so it's close to the airport but not that close to the centre. On a night out prepare to pay 20/25 euros from the Dam to the hotel. My boyfriend and I use to haggle and try get the fare for 15 euros which worked sometimes!!! If staying in this hotel you will be using the tram alot if you don't have a car so buy a strippenkarten which works out cheaper as suppose to paying per journey from the hotel to the Dam. I use to buy the strippen karten at a souvenir shop for 7euros. All in all nice clean hotel, close to airport not that close to the Dam

We have stayed in Seattle once before and made the mistake of staying too far away from the centre. We found the Sixth Avenue Inn to be a reasonable compromise between location and the price we had to pay. Hence we were not too surprised when the room looked a little tired. Don`t get me wrong, it did everything it needed to do well enough, but the carpet was ready for replacement and the bathroom needed redecorating. None of it was BAD, just past its best. Our only gripe was that previous reviews had suggested asking for a 6th. Ave side room to avoid the noise from the "Gentlemen`s Club" behind the property. However the road noise was pretty loud. I don`t think the windows were double glazed - if they were they were from a different era. However, apart from that it did the job perfectly well and we would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a hotel room at a reasonable price.

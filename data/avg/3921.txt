we had a room overlooking the street - on the 5th floor it was very noisy, we could hear all the traffic, and the vent was noisy too. very nice surprise to find a full kitchenette in the room - we could have cooked our meals. very nice terrace on the 5th floor,small gym (but nobody used it), very modern, and nicely furbished rooms

I really REALLY didn't want to write a negative review. The staff at the Paia Inn truly are friendly and helpful, and did their best to be kind and helpful. But I feel I should offer a bit of balance since the other reviews, which we relied on to decide on the Paia, now seem overly gushing in their praise. First for a few of the other positives (in addition to the great staff), which are undeniable. The Inn is nicely located in a small town on the North Shore of Maui. Through the rear of the property it is possible to reach the beach, and most visitors will rightly appreciate this. We were given a suite on the ground floor behind the main building, which was quiet and pleasant. The furnishings are comfy and modern. What's not to love? Unfortunately, we found the rooms to be rather cramped or poorly laid out even in our otherwise large suite. Not really a big deal, but for the high price ($360/night), I think we should expect not to bark are shins getting in and out of bed. This was a minor problem in truth, however. Most regrettably of all, I must report that the rooms were not as clean as they ought to have been. We like to walk barefoot, but the floors were in need of a good scrub and our feet became dirty walking about the kitchen area. There was sand -- beach sand to be sure, but not just a little in our shower when we checked in. The shower could not have been properly cleaned beforehand and it wasn't while we were there either. Overall, this wasn't a disaster. If you stay at the Paia you will be happy, but you might spend a good deal less for something just as suitable and cleaner.

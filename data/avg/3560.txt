Stayed here for three nights in room 210. The place is totally remodeled, the older traveler photos are outdated as this place has been completely updated. I am submitting new photos with this review. The suites are large with comfortable sitting area, 56" flat panel TV and modern appointments. The rooms are quiet considering how close this place is to the busy expressway and I did not experience interaction with any children as noted by a previous submitter on this site. In room climate control worked well. There is a mini-fridge and wet bar area in the living room side. The bed, however, I think was not updated in the renovation of the property. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and difficult to get much sleep on. After three nights I went to get a massage who found I had 7 knots in my neck and shoulders. If you can sleep easily on such a bed you may just love this hotel. Everything other than the bed is perfect. Beware that the extremely limited breakfast offerings and coffee are removed promptly at 9am. I have stayed in Hampton Inns and other places where they at least leave the coffee available, not here. There is a Starbucks at 635/Coit, about 1/2 mile away, if you need to perk up. There are computers with free internet and printer access in the lobby - that is a nice touch! I would stay here again if I could get some assurance that the bed was swapped out.

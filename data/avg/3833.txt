Great location for us as my daughter was attending the Taylor Swift concert at th ec Staple center. Hotel was nice but not as nice as expected for a JW and the rate of almost $300 a night...I know Marriott has worked hard to build this brands reputaion. I was agrivated that they still charge for WiFi in this day and age I know the revenue I big marriott...but get a clue...its 2011 and most properties dont charge! To me tgis is not a trivial matter. I wanted to use my droid with a nic ec fast connectio. I know about hotels with over 21 years in the biz..

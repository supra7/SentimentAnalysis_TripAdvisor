Stayed here for 15 nights from last month. Loved the look and sound of its description. On arrival, the receptionist was jovial and welcomed us (hubby, daughter and I) to a two bedroom luxury apartment on the third floor in tower one. Our arrival was pretty late so we made use of the "welcome coffee" that awaited us and retired for the night. We had noticed that the walls were in need of refreshing- a splash of paint to cover the many-scuffed and stained walls. However, we have stayed in worse places. I found it hard to get to sleep because of a droning noise. I turned off the A/C but that wasn't the source of the drone. I discovered that right next to the building, there was a small building that I think was a powerhouse or pump for the pool or electricity. I bought earplugs from Walgreens and problem solved! However, I now learn that the higher the floor, the less the noise. In daylight, the many stains on the carpet was very obvious. I was put off a walking in socked feet bit. However, we decided not to complain as we didn't want to waste time looking for another suite so close to the Halloween rush. We made a point of staying out as much as possible. We did make use of the lovely swimming pool and hot tub and also their shuttles to Disney were excellent! The maids came in every day to make the beds and empty bins as promised. We were taken aback by the resort fee as other, who have pointed out on this site. To conclude. The Point is an OK place but in dire need of a lick of paint. The carpets need steaming and the third floor tower one is noisy. The pool is nice as is the hot tub. The shuttles are dependable. I did expect better cleanliness for the price I paid for the suite. I would go back but only if painted and deep-cleaned carpets but not tower one third floor.

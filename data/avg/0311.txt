We go to Seattle often, but this is our first time staying at this hotel. We got a deal through expedia that made it less than half price, so we thought we'd try it out. The deal made it worthwhile, but I don't think I'd stay here for full freight. The recommendations on here that decry the small rooms, smaller bathrooms, paper thin walls and slow elevators are accurate. The service was good though, very friendly. If you can get it cheap it is an ok place to stay. Don't stay here if you expect $225/night quality.

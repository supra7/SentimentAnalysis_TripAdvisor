The location is gorgeous, but there are quite a few deficiencies that need to be corrected IF this is truly a four star hotel. First and foremost, I arrived at 11:30 pm. There were no self-parking spots to be had anywhere. The self parking lot is dark and the spots are cramped. I parked in the valet lot, and the walk from the parking lot to the hotel is dark and dangerous. Secondly, maid service is not up to what I considered four star. I had to contact the management at 2:30 when my room was still not cleaned. In all fairness to management, a basket of goodies was sent up to my room. Nice, but not necessary. And in fact, my room has not been made up before noon, any day since. Third, the rooms are somewhat dated, as it the bathroom. More importantly, the bathroom smells of mildew and mold. I could not see black mold, but the smell was ghastly. The bed IS very comfortable, on a positive note. Fourthly, lunch options do not exist! I am here for a conference- I am basically held hostage here. There is only 1 restaurant, and that is a self-service pool bar! Very noisy, crowed, and no real choices---and I am here for 8 days. There is NO room service after 10 am and before 5 pm! How disappointing that no other options exist, not even at the neighboring hotels. Breakfast at Son'z at Swan court is interesting. Typical hotel buffet, however, the view is beautiful with the swans and other birds. BUT, the small birds are a big nuisance and quite annoying. They fly around all over, and if you leave the table to go back to the buffet, the birds swarm all over your plate and cup. YCCH! Lastly, customer service needs improvement. The valet guys are helpful, the housekeeping staff try hard, but the front desk staff, at least in the evenings, need some help. And the people at Umalu are not too helpful.

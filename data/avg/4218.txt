I stayed here one night last week before an early morning flight. I had booked one of the "plaza petite" rooms since I was traveling alone, and didn't need much room. These rooms are TINY, but it was very cute, had an older charm, and seemed clean. I have never seen a shower as small as the one in this room. It was literally 18" wide, but I managed. The real problem started when I tried to sleep. At first, I thought there were airplanes flying over the building. The noise was loud, and I soon realized it was far too frequent to be airplanes. The elevators were directly on the other side of the wall, and the noise was coming from them constantly going up and down. I tried to sleep through it, but it was just too loud. Just before midnight, I called down to the front desk and asked for a room change. The woman who answered was extremely nice, and was aware that the elevators often caused this problem. She quickly assigned a new room, and had someone deliver the new key to me. While I was waiting for the new key, a manager did come up to check on the situation, and she too was extremely friendly. The new room was much bigger, had a normal sized shower, and was really very nice. I was able to sleep a bit easier. I'm not sure if I'd ever stay here again, but if I did, I would have to insist on a room away from the elevators.

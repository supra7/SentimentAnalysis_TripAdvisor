The Palmer House is in an excellent location, for walking to MIchigan Avenue and to several site seeing places. I liked it because it is so historic..They make a big deal about the beautiful lobby, and I agree with them. However everything wasn't perfect. The real problem is that they are under a massive construciton project to completely bring this classic hotel back to the "grandeur" it once had. This means some days you may hear noise in the morning..depending where your room is located. We were at the hotel with small children. At 9 a.m. we received a knock on the door from some people who wanted to install a safe in our room. The warning we got was a note put under our door, in the middle of the night, which we never saw. Picking a room is very tricky..The rooms have been redone now..I think that project is completed..but most rooms are VERY small..All the bathrooms are extremely small as well, although nicely updated. Only one person can stand in the bathroom at one time and there is little or no counter space to put your toiletries. To get a bigger room, ask for at least a room with two queen beds. I looked into some rooms that had one king..and they were very tiny. We had two adjoining rooms..One room, to my surprise, was huge!..It was much bigger than a normal sized room..It had two closets as well. The other room was not real tiny (as some rooms are), but it was small. You need to ask for the largest room they have. Ask for a room with two closets and that might get you the big rooms. We stayed on the 13th floor. The huge room was room 120..If you get that room you will be lucky! They were remodeling the food venues..So there were not good food options at the hotel, but there are dinning options walking distance from the hotel. Once the hotel is finished with all the construction..it will be worth going to.. But, if you want a hotel with decent sized rooms you will have to make sure you get the few larger rooms they have.

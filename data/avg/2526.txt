Paid approx. 100 a night, but can't help but think this is overpriced for what you get. Rooms are nice enough - ask for one with a view of the pool/city. Staff at front desk are polite, but seem to lack the personal touch. Petty point, but towels are awful - clean and plentiful, but felt like rags and smelt of bleach. Guest laundry facilities for only a few dollars and they provide free washing powder and fabric conditioner. You need to drive if you are staying here (free parking) and downtown is probably a 10 minute drive, with the wharf a bit closer. There are a few decent places to eat only about 2-3 minutes away, including Thai, Pizza, Greek, Sushi cusine as well as a Starbucks. So, whilst the hotel is o.k, it could probably be better or reduce its rates to bring them more in line with the standard you get.

If you have never stayed in a 5 star before you may be happy, but if you go hoping your expectations of a 5 star are met, then you may be disappointed. There are many excellent things about Secrets, the entertainment programme, the beach but I didn't expect to queue for breakfast every day, have to ask why there had been no turn down (eventually 3 nights out of 11 we did get turn down!), to ask for mini fridge to be replenished, dirty glasses left in room. The food at breakfast was brilliant, huge choice, lovely fresh fruit, couple of egg stations, nice waiters once you got seated. Men HAVE to wear sleeves or they wiere given a shirt to wear, but standard of service didn't match this. Service around pool and on beach brilliant, for food and drinks, lovely waiters / waitresses. Lunch excellent. Evening food - choice of restaurants but all menus quite similar! While we were there there were a number of private functions on around the pool in evenings which felt a little odd. Spa ok, but expensive and have been to much better. Watch out for the sales pitch - not 'time share' apparently..... Generally a lovely hotel but let down by some things that could easily be sorted. I wouldn't go back.

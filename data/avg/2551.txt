Stayed two nights for sight seeing\theatre visit. Room smaller than other travelodges have stayed in, but this was the centre of London. Got a good rate as booked early on an on line offer and pre booked breakfast so good value. Travelled on cheap offer train tickets as well (40 return for two of us from Yorkshire) No left luggage at travelodge, so used left luggage at Kings Cross- made mistake of taking two small bags, but have to pay for each bag. Our room got no noise from outside, bed was comfortable, got extra pillow on request. Shower tray not very deep, so water flooded onto floor,and had to use a towel as bath mat. As requested we left the other towels on rail/bathroom hook as didn't want clean ones for second day, however, we returned to find one set of new towels only. Reception apologised and quickly gave us second set. Didn't spend much time in the place as out after breakfast and only back to freshen up before out for the evening. Bar in basement and was also where you had breakfast. Would recomend for a basic no frills accomodation to travlodge standard, we would return for similar visit in future. We were there during riots, saw no trouble and felt safe walking back to travelodge from St Pancras tube..Found people we met in London friendly and helpful.

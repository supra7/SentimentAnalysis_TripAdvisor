Stayed for one night on a business trip, had stayed with friends a year or so ago. Check in was fine, quick and no fuss. The room was a good size, spotless and had a good bathroom/shower. The bed was comfortable and once I had coaxed the remote into life the TV was fine. Not so great points - the blind didn't really exclude all of the light so I was woken early by the sun and the room was noisy, I use earplugs so slept OK. I don't usually bother with the breakfast at these places but it came with the rate this time. The cold stuff was OK and the hot stuff looked awful, I'd save your money and buy a much better breakfast at any of the cafes around the area. Obviously a good position, slap on the tube and mainline station and the surrounding area isn't bad. So, overall not a bad stay for the price (cheap in comparison to the other London hotels I use) but nothing to get excited about. To be fair, when I stayed previously I had a family room and it was much quieter and had better blinds. For a family on a budget to London it isn't a bad choice.

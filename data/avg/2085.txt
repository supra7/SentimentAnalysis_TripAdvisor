Interesting building, good location, decent business hotel. Located in the old Bayer AG headquarters, just on the edge of downtown, this new Flemings Deluxe hotel was a pleasant -- but not extraordinary -- place to crash at the end of a long business trip. Although the ground floor of the building is less than impressive, sharing space with some photo-supply store and cracked paving blocks, the entrance and foyer is stunning. The staircase looks like something straight out of an Escher drawing. The old, pre-elevator conveyor lift is also available, as a novel and nostalgic way of getting up to the rooms and back. The terrace provides a lovely view of Frankfurt, and the food was quite good. Also worth mentioning is the small spa downstairs, which seems to have been added as an afterthought -- though it has some very nice elements, there simply isn't enough space or privacy for it to be enjoyed if more than a couple people are there. The coin-operated tanning bed and plastic, modular steam room were hardly up to par for the kind of spa and fitness services 4 and 5-star business travelers expect.The room was good, but nothing extraordinary. Decent mattress and pillows, and very soothing lighting scheme. Unfortunately, the remote-control for the blinds and lights lacks any real clear directions, and more than once I found that the blinds had decided to re-open themselves long after I thought I'd shut them.The glass-enclosed shower in the room was fine -- though it might be a little bit uncomfortable if sharing a room! Overall, not particularly memorable. If available at a reasonable rate, however, this hotel should definitely merit consideration over some of the other business hotels closer in to the river. By losing an U-bahn stop in proximity, you could gain a lot in terms of comfort, and quiet.

Stayed at the Warwick again for the third time, this time just for a night. I was by myself and thinking - ok for myself - but I probably wouldn't book it again with my spouse or family. It is starting to feel a bit old. Desk chair that should have been replaced years ago. Old vintage tv you may be lucky to find in a thrift shop. Shower is about a foot too low for a 6' guy. On the other hand, it was cheap, quiet, friendly staff and the bed was comfortable. If you are travelling to Seattle as I did this time, and are hardly going to be in the room, and don't need to catch a game on tv, it really isn't bad. Be prepared to pay an extra $30 for parking and another $10 for internet for a day when taking the cost into account.

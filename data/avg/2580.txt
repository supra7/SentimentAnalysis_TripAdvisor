I accept that rooms in London can tend to come small when we're talking budget hotel, however my room reminded me somewhat of a prison cell. It was an odd shape with little space around the bed and very little space where the 'desk' and wardrobe were. It was also sauna-like, with no chance of opening the window and no way to make the air con go colder. The room was spotless, which tends to be very high in my list of priorities, but the stay was also marred by a massive crack in the outside glazing the window and a pretty uncomfortable bed. Add to that the poor state of the double glazing and it led to a rather bad night's sleep for me. The place does the job but only if you can get a cheap room rate and you're not staying more than a couple of nights.

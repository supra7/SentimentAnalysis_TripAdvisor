I booked this hotel on a short notice. I absolutely love the quality and price (and hot breakfast) that Hampton Inns offer, however I was not too impressed with this hotel. One of the major drawbacks was that there was no fridge and no microwave in the hotel. Usually Hampton Inns have this as a standard. The valet parking was a bit pricey, but what can you expect in the heart of the Windy City. I was not too impressed with the hot breakfast. The eggs and fruit had an after taste. The belgian waffle was the best attraction and that was average to say the least. My hotel card kept getting de-magnetized which became annoying after the 3rd trip to the front desk. Especially since you need to insert your card on the elevator to get to your hotel floor. One of the positives of this hotel was that it was very convenient to the nighlife, the Taste of Chicago, and shopping. Overall, I would recommend this hotel however there needs to be an upgrade in the amenities.

Watertown was booked, but was able to get a great rate here. Rooms are your average hotel room, except they do have a mini fridge---which I think is a huge bonus. Also appreciated the bottled water. I'm not sure if I missed something, but My room was not cleaned one of the days. The next day I told the front desk staff, and they wrote my room number down, but there was no apology. Also, my room door was open when I checked in, which sort of freaked me out. It's a good place to stay if you have to be in the U district. One last problem---I forgot my key, and they didn't make me show id to get a new one. That's a little dangerous!!!

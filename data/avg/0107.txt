The location is fabulous if you want to be in the center of Pike Street Market. However, I had the absolute worst room in the entire hotel. They said, "city view". I had a view of a red brick wall. After a long day of travel, I wanted a bath. They had given me a handicapped room. The room was larger than say a Hilton and nice appointments, but nothing special. No one ever asked how my stay way or I would have told them. If they had let me know the room was so so it might have helped. I don't think they were even close to full either. I was on the floor with the conference rooms. What a joy in the morning. Thank goodness I met up with a friend to walk around Seattle and stay out late - Wild Ginger is fabulous!

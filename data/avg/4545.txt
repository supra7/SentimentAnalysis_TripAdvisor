I recently traveled to Boston and stayed at the Hyatt Regency from September 25th, 2009 to September 27th 2009. You enter the hotel on street level, then there are 3 steps down (even though a sign besides the sliding glass doors states Handicapped Accessible???) to a lower elevator level and then you have to take an elevator to go up to the 3rd floor for the Reception Area and then another set of elevators to get you to your room.YIkes!!!! Decor is dated, rooms are quite standard and for some inexplicable reason- I was put in a handicapped room. Furntiure in the room is definitely showing wear and tear and whatever they put on the top of their mattresses, some sort of padding, does not even extend the whole length of the mattress. To boot, I could not get the phone in my room to work properly as I could only manage to work it with the speaker micro on. Additonally, their minibar bar prices are stratospheric. The bar and resutrant in the Hotel Lobby is quite generic with nothing to make it stand out in one's mind. I stayed there because when I think Hyatt- I hink of a pleasant Atrium Area but, if there was one, I did not find it. The exterior of the buuilding is also quite ugly- like a grey concrete fortrress- nothing charming or elegant about it whatsoever. I ewill definitely NOT stay there again.

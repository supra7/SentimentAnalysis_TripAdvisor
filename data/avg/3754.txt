I work at a Marriot and I don't know of any Marriot having any unprofessional employees. IThe front desk clerk, Kevin, was rude towards my husband and I. He would watch over us like a hawk. I don't appreciate someone looking over me when there's no reason to. He rolled his eyes and huffed when my husband asks for some laundry soap. He did not have a sense of humor at all. That would make any guest not come back.

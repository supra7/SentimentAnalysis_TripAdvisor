Given its central downtown location and low price, the Moore is a very good value for a two-star. For the price, it's not fancy but adequate, clean, and roomy. The elevator and hallways are small and rather dingy but the rooms are fine. Beds are good, TV has sufficient channel selection, telephone, bathroom normal size with adequate motel-type towels/face cloths, soap, no shampoo, etc. There's no air conditioning, but there's a small fan in the room that was barely sufficient. Being from a rural area, we didn't find the street noise to be bad at all and we were on the front of the hotel facing 1st. Ave. It's about what you'd expect for a city but not objectional - running the fan for some "white noise" helps. We would definitely concur with other reviewers that an upper floor (5 or higher) is definitely recommended. They have free internet service in the lobby as well. The staff was not overly helpful or friendly but provided acceptable service. The best thing was it's central location to Pike Market, good restaurants, and all the downtown sites within the free bus ride area.

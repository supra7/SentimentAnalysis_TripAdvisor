Stayed 3 nights in this hotel. The rooms are very spacious, the staff is extremely helpful. The location is ok, convienient to get into the city center with tram. Free WiFi is fast and easy access. My room was very dark and the wardrobe door seemed dirty, but bathroom was cleaned and the floor, lining etc also. You could also park under the hotel, but have to be paid for. Have to be sad, it is a scraffy old hotel and found the price overrated. (as it is mainly in Amsterdam)

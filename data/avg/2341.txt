We had requested 2 rooms close together, 1 to be a King and late check out on our departure day. Our rooms were on opposite ends of the same floor despite the room next door being empty and being cleaned when we were unpacking. Neither room was a king- my husband is 6'4" and a double bed is not comfortable. The hotel had a very low occupancy during our stay. They wanted to charge us $50 per person for a late checkout for 1 room ($200) which was more than we paid for a full day. We are frequent travelers to Mexico and use the same booking agency. We always get our requests fullfilled and the most we have paid for a late ckout is $50 total. The housekeeping staff started early 7 am or so and prevented us from sleeping in No reservations were required at the restaurants, but the restaurants were not all open as advertised due to the low occupancy. The majority of the staff at the bars and eating establishments were great with a little tip. The hotel did not arrange scuba or jet ski rental, but we had a car and went into Puerto Morelos.

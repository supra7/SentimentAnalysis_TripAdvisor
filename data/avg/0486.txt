Travelled with 3 young kids, gramma and nanny. Had a suite with 2 double bed in one room and a king/crib in another room. Full kitchen. Great layout with one bathroom. Updated kitchen. Carpet was disgusting. Phones did not work and tv remote did not work. Had a pool but was down for maintenance and no one phoned us prior to us arriving to let us know it was down. One of the main reasons we chose to stay there. They gave us the room for $125 a night to compensate. Amazing price for the area, we walked EVERYWHERE. Free parking too. Free internet (super slow) and continental breakfast was the typical make your own waffle deal. In a nutshell we would stay here again for the price and location. We only we there to sleep so the condition of the floors, etc didnt' affect us to much.

The Maui Eldorado was less than expected. I had high hopes after reading reviews and seeing some photos. We were in B105 which is in need of a remodel. The unit is pretty much basic with sparsely operating amenities. Some lights were burned out, a ceiling fan did not work, some remotes had dead batteries, a dvd/vcr combo was not connected properly and the bedroom only had a vcr(who watches tapes). The shower area is seriously outdated and is in need of some remodeling. Housekeeping did a good job of keeping towels and bath supplies stocked, however, they came pretty early in the morning. The only thing going for the Maui Eldorado is the location and the beach, which is why we stayed there in the first place. The activity desk was not very helpful in trying to schedule island activities. We did not complain about the problems with our unit until check out, as I told the front desk that everything should have been addressed before we checked in and I did not want to deal with repair people while I was on vacation. That tells me about how the Maui Eldorado views there customers. The beach cabana is an excellent place to relax and enjoy. The beach area is awesome, lots of sand and no rocks. I like this area on Maui but will be looking for other possible accommodations. If you are looking for a fantastic beach without luxury accommodations then this is for you. If the condos were as nice as the area, the Maui Eldorado would be something.

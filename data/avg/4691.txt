I paid $207 including tax for a 2 queen bed room. For that money I would expect at least a free continental breakfast. T.V. was not working, although I didn't report that as I didn't want to watch anyway. Hot tub was not hot. Jets were just bubbling, no strength at all. The bill was supposed to be slipped under the door, that didn't happen. On the good side, front desk was good , friendly & fast. Room was very clean and convenient with mini-fridge and microwave. And the location was very good.

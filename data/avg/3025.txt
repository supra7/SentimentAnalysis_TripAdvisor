the size of the room was almost luxurious. we were shocked! :) big bathroom, fan available, no minibar. reception is on the 5th floor. the only problem it is a bit far both from the central station (it takes at least 15 mins on foot) both from the city centre. prices are average but we did not bought the breakfast so i don't know how it is.

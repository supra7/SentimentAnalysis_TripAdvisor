This place spends its money where it counts-the beds are fantastic, the sheets divine, the pillows cloud-like...and of course, the location can't be beat. But frankly, that is all that recommends the place--outside of what I mentioned, the rooms are rather plebeian, at best. We had a street side room, which was tiny, and the water pressure SUcked--could barely rinse my hair. The bathrooms need a make-over--they look like what they probably are--spiffied-up Holiday Innish. At the very least, make sure that the fixtures aren't falling off the wall. We had a TERRible tip from front desk staff about where to go to eat, so don't bother asking--they either don't know or they get a kickback--either way, they are not to be trusted. WE paid $160 a night, including valet parking, which for the location (and those sheets and bed--ahhhhh) still seemed reasonable for Seattle. Yes, I'd go back--just for the sleep and location.

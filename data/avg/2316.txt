We stayed here for 4 nights in November, the rooms are fantastic and finished to a very high standard. The pools and grounds are also very nice. A couple of things to be aware of the first is that this hotel is currently a construction site with noisy building work ongoing on at least half of the properties from what I could see and hear. Couldnt relax by the pools due to the noise. Would avoid staying here until this work is completed. Secondly this resort is quite a way out of town, not a problem if you are ok with driving in and parking but its not walkable in my view. One other thing is that I found the reservations department to be next to useless. When I received my confirmation it had an error, 2 emails, 5 phone calls later and despite promises I did not ever recieve a correct booking confirmation. if your happy with the commute into town this is a very nice place to stay just check that they've finished the building work. Also its on waterfront not beachfront like some of the other hotels in town.

Disappointing when hotels such as this still charge for wifi access. We didn't get notified verbally about the complimentary breakfast either although it was no doubt in the fine print somewhere. Rooms were nice and clean although a little boring and the bed not that comfortable. Can't fault the location, it was very easy to get anywhere with the subway station a few hundred metres away.

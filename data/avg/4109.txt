The Good: downtown location a short walk to Newberry St. shopping/ Boston Common and even Freedom Trail / Harbor area, very comfortable bed/ linen, clean, quiet, small but nice pool/whirlpool/sauna, $80 / night via priceline was a great deal, supermarket across the street The Bad: room decor not especially stylish for a 4* hotel, room was somewhat small, windows badly needed an exterior wash Bottom Line: A great choice if you need a quiet, clean, comfortable room convenient to downtown area (especially if you catch a deal), but you may want to look elsewhere if you're celebrating an anniversary or other special event and want something with style or luxury.

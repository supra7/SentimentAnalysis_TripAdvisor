We stopped at the Hilton Downtown for 2 nights prior to a cruise. The hotel has vastly improved since we stopped there a couple of years ago, but is still only average for a Hilton. The location is convenient for the cruise port and Bayside, but there isn't really anywhere to eat or drink in the locality. You need a taxi to go anywhere and it took over 40mins for the bell boys to hail one on a Friday evening when we wanted to visit Lincoln Rd.

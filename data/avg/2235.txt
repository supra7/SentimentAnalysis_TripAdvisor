The Trump is highly over rated. It was supposed to be elegant, but I found that, other than the lobby, to be rather average. There is no casino, which is ok, but then you would think that they would have other things to do. The pool looked like a Holiday Inn pool. Not spectacular on a Vegas scale. No real lounge area to speak of. The bar was ordinary. The food was very expensive ($16 burger) and so were the drinks ($8 cocktail). Charge of 18% gratuity plus $5 service charge for room service! Outrageous! Beware $15/day resort fee for use of pool and workout room, and "complimentary" coffee service. This hotel is not elegant and is a total ripoff. With so many other 5 star hotels in Vegas, don't choose the Trump!

The hotel is just ok. It was quite far from downtown (to be expected for the price), but not a long walk to the subway which took us right downtown. We arrived at night and couldn't find anything nearby, it seemed quite isolated. In the morning, we realized it was close to Chinatown so we ate well after that. It's not particularly comfortable, but not uncomfortable either for the price. You could do better, you could do worse.

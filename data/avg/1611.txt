Good location - one day I took a walk to one direction of Gran Via street and visited all the places of interest of Madrid of this side, and other day I took a walk to the other direction of the Gran Via and visited all the places of interest of Madrid. All these places are reachable by walking. The hotel is not very clean. The room vith a basin is good advantage. The walls between rooms are rather thin, so I had to punch it when a guy behind it started to sing. The orientation of windows is to the Gran Via street, but it just a little disturbed my spleeping.

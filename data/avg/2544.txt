I stayed here with a group of friends. We booked the TL as it's well priced for what we needed from a one night stay. The rooms were as expected, basic but reasonably clean the breakfast however was.........poor by any standards. The choice was ok having some fruit juices, tea and coffee. Sausage, bacon, some kind of egg and ........ Oh this is where we hit the moldy bread, and moldy croissants ! A massive turn off and a rather rude female staff member when this basic faux par was highlighted. A complaint was sent to TL but no response! It left us thinking what else have they overlooked? Maybe this is why 3 of the group were bitten by something leaving them with rather large blotches on their legs and arms! Overall basic, comfy bed but go out for breakfast!

The hotel itself is nice and clean -- the food was good at breakfast, and things seemed to work efficiently. Nice views of downtown from our 16th floor room. Wish the housekeeping staff could "find" my coat -- it (with certainty) was left in the coat closet but somehow has disappeared. Too bad -- otherwise was a great stay!

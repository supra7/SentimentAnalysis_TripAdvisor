Typical Holiday Inn Express - no surprises as far as amenities (check in desk spoke decent english, free breakfast, etc.). Carpets (both hallway and room) could have been cleaner. Two internet PCs in the lobby were functional but so infected with viruses and spyware that you wouldn't want to use them to access anything that required you to input personal information. The hotel is two blocks from the Metro (in a non-tourist area), so getting around was very convenient. Full supermarket one block away.

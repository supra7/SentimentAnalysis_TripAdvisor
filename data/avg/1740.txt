As Hawaii residents we head over to Maui every couple of months for mini-vacations or to meet friends. We had stayed at the Hyatt in May and were quite pleased with the staff, service, accommodations and the hotel in general. This trip however has been an extreme disappointment. The construction situation, taken very lightly by the staff, was very noisy, and inconvenient. We even came back after a lovely dinner in Kapalua to a note stuffed under our door advising that the AC would be shut off at 7am and not back on until long after we had checked out...no courtesy cocktail or free cup of coffee voucher, just tough luck and open your sliding door to the breezes... The self parking lot was as expected, but on our last trip we were also able to use the rear lot to sell park. Not this time....the rear lot is now valet only and the valet staff was "curt" at best and bordered on "rude" at worst. I recommend not using this hotel until the construction is complete and we will certainly look at other hotel options for our next trip. We got a reasonably good deal on our room through priceline, but I think these folks were lucky we came along to pay anything for a noisy room...

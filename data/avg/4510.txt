The location is great the the doorman & valet parking people are top-notch; very attentive and helpful. I would give 5-stars in those areas. However, for the price paid, we expected an IMPECCABLE room, and that's not what we got. Everything was just so-so; nothing special. The beds were small, somewhat comfortable, but nothing said "high-end luxury" except for the price! To top it off, our bathroom had two unsightly problems that really should have been fixed before renting the room to anyone (and we stayed on a weekday night, so it's not like they were SO full that they HAD to use that room). We had just finished the "Freedom Trail" by foot and were sore, weary, and had to figure out where to get boarding passes printed out before getting cleaned up for dinner with friends, so no, we didn't re-pack all of our belongings and drag everything down to the 3rd floor reception area to ask for a different room. No time or energy to tell them how to do their job; as they shouldn't have put anyone in a room that was not up to par in the first place. According to the hotel website, they have "Business Services" but nothing about printing documents, so we had to walk to the nearest UPS store to get it done - AFTER paying another $9.95 to the Hyatt Regency for internet. Geesh! Even hotels that charge half what you do come with free internet these days; what's up with that Haytt? They also kept all the hallways uncomfortably COLD; we dreaded the walk from our room to the elevator. Bottom line, we felt we didn't get the high-end luxury experience we paid for, and we'd look elsewhere if staying in Boston again.

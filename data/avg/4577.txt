Got a good deal on Priceline, so it was worth it. Room and particularly the bed are outstanding. The hotel itself is very nice. The location is very nice, all downtown attractions are walking distance. Only a couple of points: . it took 4 ours to have our luggage in the room and the bellman asked explicitly for tip even if the service was horrible. . they gave us a non-smoking room that had a strong smoke smell . they do not have parking spot and no convention with the adiacent parking...self parking is 26USD for overnight stay, but you are charged every time you go in and out (8USD per hour) Valet parking is 36USD.

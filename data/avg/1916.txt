I booked the Kaanapali Beach Hotel for 12 nights for my honeymoon. This was my 5th trip to Hawaii (Maui) and the hotel was very nice. This is an older hotel located between more upper class and newer hotels. It's a perfect location because you can walk to the Whaler's Village to shop and dine. The Kaanaplai Beach Hotel staff were very pleasant and accomodating. The rooms I found to be very clean, as was the property outside. The maid service was good and the rooms cleaned as expected. The breakfast buffet was good, but the same food is served everyday with no variety or changes. The breakfast buffet was convenient and it was included in the price of my stay. The hotel offered Lei making lessons and hula lessons, among other free activities. My wife enjoyed these classes. The food in the restaurant at dinner was excellent and priced good, we ate there 4 days out of the 12 we stayed there. Overall, this is not a high class hotel. It's location is a plus and the staff is friendly. The beach is excellent and there are many activities available on the hotel site such as booking excursions. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends. Do not expect Ritz type service or first class food. This is an affordable hotel in a great location. One negative thing to say is that the noise from ajoining rooms can be disheartening. When I wake in the morning and can hear the person in the next room taking a shower it loses some appeal to the honeymoon. The plumbing is loud when your neighbor showers. A sign of an older property. Expect to be charged for daily parking and for using the safe in the room. I find the fee for the in-room safe a real negative.

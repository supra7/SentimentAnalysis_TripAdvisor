We stayed there during our world trip back in January. The owners were very accomodating when we missed our flight and we had to delay our arrival for one day. The hotel itself is ok. It is very hot, they don't have any AC. If you can try to get a room on the street side, yes it is a little noisy, but you will take the noise over the heat in the summer time. The room never got cleaned in the one week that we were there. We had to ask for fresh towels after 4 days, which were handed to use without any issues. They could at least pick up the trash on a daily basis. The in room microwave had some issues. Overall the rooms are worn. The Wifi, which is not free is spotty and had several issues. The location of the hotel was good. It is about 5 minutes from the metro station and close to restaurants and shopping. We would recommend the hotel to young travelers who are budget conscious. Overall for the price we paid and compared to other hotels in Australia I think it is ok.

Based on the rave reviews here - we stayed at this Inn in early December for a business trip. The hotel is quaint and in an excellent location. However, we found the service to be lacking and the ground floor room not as expected. The rooms are right on the boardwalk - so you can not keep your shades open to look at the view without risking being in a fish bowl for every passerby. All rooms are on the ground floor and those facing the harbor are right/ directly on the boardwalk. To enjoy the vista you will have zero privacy. The bed was very uncomfortable and the pillows were really bad! They are stuffed full of lumpy cotton. When we asked if we could have a flatter pillow (honestly these pillows are cheap and overstuffed), they told us that was all they have. You can get a better pillow at a Hampton Inn. The bed and the pillow are important to a successful stay. All and all we were disappointed. Would not stay there again!

Nice looking central hotel. Grandiose lobby and entrance area and rooms nicely done and spacious enough. On the down-side, we had to ask 4 times for the cot that we'd pre-booked to be brought to the room, the only lifts can be a very long walk from your room and the service for breakfast in the Oak Room deteriotaed over the 3 mornings from ok to very poor.

Very dissatisfied with the lack of commercial attitude and unflexibility. The "promotionnal" price I had initially booked through the website for my 1st night (a Sunday, when the hotel was almost empty), was eventually increased by 60 just because I came to attend a conference. And the so-called conference price for the rest of the stay was discounted by less than 10% of the public full price obtained from the Accor website. So overall I only saved 10 on a 800 hotel bill for attending the conference: absolutely ridiculous and the worst thing is that there was NO WAY to discuss or speak to a supervisor (in spite of my asking there were just repeating like robots "sorry this is not possible"), to get the price for that 1st night back to its initial price. It's a shame as other than that the hotel offers good standards (but obviously not cheap!) That was a very ill advised attitude from the Novotel reception staff. Accor should know that they're not going to see me before long in their hotels and that I have widely publicized the story to friends and social networks I'm part of, and also let the organizers of the conference in my company know abt this and my dissatisfaction.

Before I begin with my experience please understand that the resort itself is nice, it is what happened that is not. As we arrived our 2 rooms that we requested were neither ready or the ones with the hot tub as planned. We had to wait an hour and during this time were pressured into their timeshare presentation. About an hour later we were told to go to our rooms without the bell boy (who came 40minutes later with luggage) no hot tub rooms and were told they had none available and acted like no big deal. 10hrs of traveling so I was not in the mood to argue and kid's were already upset(what a way to start a vacation) next day we did the timeshare presentation...WARNING!!! DON'T DO IT! it took 4hrs and they bring you to what I call the "Torture room" at the end. We were promised 2 people paid golfing and they even set up the tee time. The next day my husband and son excited to golf find out AFTER they get to the unpromised golf resort that it was going to not only cost them another $100 bucks but also $60 for shoes...now remember they were sent to another course that was not as good. I voiced respectfully my concerns and the resort did not care. I was once proud to be going to HTR but now realized they only want you to buy into them. Beach is horrible and steam hut not working and half the activities not available as they say on website. I am not a hard person to please but this trip was a very special trip for my family and I work hard for my money so when I spend that much I do expect quality and you don't get what you see on website.

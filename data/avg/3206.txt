The Parking there is lousy,They are greedy and try to get as many cars in that lot as possible.When I pay for a room i expect a Parking Spot.I dont like the ideal of them cramming all these other cars in the lot that doesnt even Have A room there ,just to make a buck.then you got to worry if your cars going to get messed up. My friend came to visit us for the night and they charged himand his girlfriend $50.i went out to my car to get something no more then 3 minutes after they got there and the same guy was charging other people $20 for the exact same thing my friends got charged $50 for. WHATS WITH THAT

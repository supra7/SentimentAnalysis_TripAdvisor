I chose to pay to stay at this hotel prior to a conference I was attending even though I had a free room at the convention hotel. I kind of regret it. The hotel is nice, no doubt. Has that edge of coolness that one would expect from a W. However, it is a bit rough around the edges. It seems like a really cool designer, designed the hotel and the execution was on the cheapoops, have I just defined the W brand? Kidding. I live in Dallas and the W in Dallas is one incredible hotel. Definitely not on the cheap. I asked the manager about the state of the hotel and he replied that they were one of the older W hotels and realized their competition and image in other cities. Hopefully they will react and change some things. Unfortunately the things would be hard as they relate to their public areas, etc. These will involve a costly change. I have to throw my thanks to the bar staff here. What a great group. I had so much fun in the bar. Kudos. Dont miss The Pink Door. Great pasta and, trust me, you will get some type of show Also, if you are a little adventurous, search out the restaurant Crave in Pacific Heights. The woman that owns this place is doing amazing things with food and you will delight in the 10 to 12 table environment. A little bohemian, but the food is amazing. You wont regret it.

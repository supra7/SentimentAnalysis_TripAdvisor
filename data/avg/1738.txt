I recently stayed at the Maui Hyatt on my Honeymoon in October 2011. The property itself is well maintained, the lobby is airy and open. It was covered in scafolding, however so hard to appreciate the full beauty of it. Pros: The overall hotel property was very nice, including the pool area. They have an awesome waterslide (yes, even for adults), that my Husband & I went on several times. The views of the beach are beautiful. There was a nice selection of restaurants with fair prices (keep in mind I am from NY though so may be consider pricey to others); good food & good drinks. There was also a great breakfast buffet (which was included in our room rate). Awesome selection and yummy food! We rented a car and it was a very nice central location. We were able to explore the island in both directions and it was a short trip to downtown Lahaina, which is a fun place to go to eat, shop and enjoy the nightlife. Cons: We booked through a travel agent who wrote "HONEYMOON" on every piece of our travel itinerary. Despite that, the Maui Hyatt put us in a room with 2 double beds. When we complained, the hotel staff essentially said - too bad, we don't guarantee rooms. The rooms themselves were very old, the bathroom was the worst part - small, dark and the shower barely worked. After coming from the Trump in Oahu, I was shocked by how much the Hyatt failed in comparison. When we checked out, I expressed my displeasure and was told to write a note on a piece of scrap paper. Needless to say, I never heard back from Hyatt. We travelled to the Hyatt in Kawaii after Maui and that room was world class! I think they need to lower their rates in Maui while they complete their reservations and come to terms wtih the fact that the hotel is NOT top notch. My advice - stay somewhere else! The rates are not worthy of the crappy accomodations you get in return.

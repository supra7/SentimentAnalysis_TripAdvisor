My schoolmates and I were here for a conference in Feb. We liked its location, close to Newbury St, the Arlington station of the T, and Boston Commons. We even managed to walk to the Charles River and MIT and Harvard in Cambridge (though it took us an hour). The hotel is old (apparently every American President since 1928 has stayed at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel), but quite charming. The rooms are not very big. We had a double room with a cot, and there was barely enough space for the three of us and our three luggages. Closet is pretty big though, and bathroom, though slightly cramped is clean. We quite liked the decor in the room too. As a conference venue, the hotel served our needs well, with high-speed internet and nice rooms. We didn't have any meals at the hotel, choosing, instead to have breakfast at Au Bon Pain a few metres away, and lunches and dinners on Newbury St or Government Center. We did feel, however, that the overall experience did not justify the rates we paid for the hotel.

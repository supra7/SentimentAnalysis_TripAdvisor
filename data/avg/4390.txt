We stayed at this hotel because we had planned a night out in Allston. Don't even contemplate this hotel if you want to enjoy what Boston has to offer. When we arrived the staff at the desk were efficient and we got to our room quickly. Even though this hotel is a little expensive I was going to give a glowing review, however ....We had planned to travel into Boston and use the T to get to the airport to begin our journey home using the hotels advertised shuttle service. When we enquired at the front desk about the service we were told their was no shuttle service. So we decided we had better get a cab to the airport so would take further advantage of our prearranged late check out and stay in our room a little longer. We were called at 2.30 (late check out being 4pm) and asked to leave!! When we left the hotel to get our cab the shuttle bus was parked outside!!!

It's certainly not meant to compete with top-end hotels. For the price ($99/night + tax), the queen of art boutique room met our expectations and needs for a two-night holiday in Seattle. We never took advantage of the two happy hours, with discounted beverages and appetizers. We did make full use of the Aveda toiletries and Torrefazione in-room coffee. The fitness center is quite small (a few treadmills and dumbbell weights), and the free business center has two computers with printer. We could walk easily down to Pikes Place Market (although buses were free in this zone), the Underground Tour in Pioneer Square, and Capitol Hill bars. I was also able to walk to a nearby Budget Rental Car facility to pick up a car en route to the second half of our trip in Vancouver, Canada. Overall, I would consider Hotel Max for a return stay, although it might be quite tempting to play the "what's-new-in-Travelzoo-or-TripAdvisor" game.

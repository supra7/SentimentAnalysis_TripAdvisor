Cons: pool IS NOT CONNECTED to the hotel. They give you a key and directions to a pool their guests can swim at 2 blocks away-and its only accessible 11am-5pm. They do not explain that on the website. We just snuck into another pool next door. Minor issue for us, but just fyi. NOT A FAMILY HOTEL. The place is in real need of TLC. Carpet in halls is very dirty-although pretty clean in the rooms. walls are a little gross and desperately need a coat of paint. deck chairs are raggedy and half broken. Rooms are SOOO small. Lots of partying college kids. Shower water is lukewarm from 3-6pm. any other time- its feels great. No complimentary shampoo's. People at the desk aren't THAT friendly. Pro's: My husband and I were only staying one night by ourselves, so this was a really simple place with no bells or whistles. wich was fine- for us. with his military discount the total was $90.cheapest place ON the boardwalk. LOCATION is THE BEST! Right on the boardwalk -in the middle of all the action-with perfect ocean view. Couldn't be in a more perfect spot. Lots of cable channels. Bathrooms are nice and newly remodeled but some have no tubs. only showers. ice cold A/C. Beds are simple but clean and we slept well. Microwave in the lobby. no bugs. no bad smells. parking provided with a little permit slip they give you at check in.

The Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Boston, and listed on the National Historic Register. This is both a plus and a minus for this hotel. While the lobby and the building itself are beautiful and grand, the hotel rooms are very small, the amenities sparse and the bathrooms tiny. When my husband and I arrived there was no bellman to greet us, open the door or help with the luggage. This was a huge disappointment for me for a hotel with a 5-star listing. The first room we were given had a very foul smell, but it was late and we stayed in this room until the next day. My husband requested a room change very early that day, but when I "checked" on the room change at 11 am, the desk clerk told me "he had forgotten about us and lost the note!" We were given a new room, with no foul smell, but you could barely turn around in the bathroom and the air conditioner could not keep up with the heat outside. The best part of this hotel is its location, central to many sites, shopping and restaurants. The concierge desk was helpful, but more than once I was given directions that took me way out of my way instead of a more direct route. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again if given a choice, but would choose a more modern chain.

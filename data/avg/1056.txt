Our experience started off with a room that smelled like dog poop. The way the wanted to fix it was with air freshener. Called for room service several times, made calls every time 45min - hour later to check if they were still coming. Not a good experience with service. Hotel location is great and if you are coming for a wedding, the coordinator and staff are wonderful. Nice hotel but very over-rated...

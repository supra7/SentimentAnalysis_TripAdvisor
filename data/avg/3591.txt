- We were supposed to check out on Friday. On Thursday, when we were in Seaworkd, we got a voice mail from the resort saying that we were supposed to check out on that day but we did not. We did not know what happened since this was shocked to us. We went back to the resort right the way. My husband spoke to the front-desk person, and at the same time, my husband saw 2 papers on the front desk (the sign-in slip and the billing statement). The front-desk person showed us the statement staying the Thursday was the last day, but she totally ignored the sign-in slip which clearly printed out the check out date was Friday. If she paid a little more attention, our day won't be screw up. She even expressed that it was not a big deal that everything could be fixed on the phone. It was not true! If we didn't went back to the resort and my husband saw the slip, we will be charged for a higher rate. We were also nervous with our belongings. Finally, a supervisor level personnel finally came out and apologized. -The kitchen was missing quit a few items. We informed the front desk that we only need a wine opener. Very bad experience to try to get one from the resort until we went to Walmart and bought one. -The DVD finally hooked up in the last day after speaking to a supervisor level personnel. - Madatory fee for the resort charge. - Our unit is in building 4, first floor. 2-bed room. The view around us is a cluster of central AC units.

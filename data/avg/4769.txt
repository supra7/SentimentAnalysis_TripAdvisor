After reading the reviews, I am wondering if my standards are just too high. We booked 'up' to a west view suite for our stay. I expected a spacious room with spectacular views. We got a room w/a king bed, a desk and 2 chairs. Somehow, that does not equate to a suite, even judging by the diagram given by the hotel website. We were on the 22nd floor which should be a good view, no matter what side of the hotel you are on, but our view was into the adjacent condos...shades of "Rear Window'!!!!! The a/c worked, but minimally, leaving the room very warm at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, and the a/c ran all night. A plus was that the windows did open, albeit only 3 inches, but that helped rid the room of the heat. The room was clean, tidy, and well supplied. Housekeeping was great. Overall, just a C+ on the stay.

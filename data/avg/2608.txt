Besides the bed bugs and limited space... this would be a nice hotel. Let me start off by telling you what I liked about the Wyndham. Pretty appearance on the outside and located in a good location. Inside lobby is nice as well and they have very a friendly and helpful staff. First flaw you will notice is the very narrow hallways with bubbling carpet. When you enter your room, you will notice that it's as big as medium sized bathroom or large closet. But, keep in mind that most hotels in New York are similar in size. I had a very hard time sleeping due to the thin walls. I could hear my neighbors on the phone and people in the halls all night. No security at night so don't bother calling front desk at night because they only have one person on duty. Then there were the bed bugs. I noticed bug bites the first couple of night and thought that they were mosquitoes, then I found giant bed bugs under my pillow on my last night. Not a good experience.

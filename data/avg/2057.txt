Just home from our stay in Rome. Had booked the hotel Sonya, but were given a room here. This hotel has alot of pro's, but unfortunately for us the con's out weighed them ! yes it is only five mins from Termini, a minute walk from Via Nazionale which has bus connections, friendly enough staff and is very clean. However while we were there we had the following issues - - drip from towel heater in the very small bathroom was reported 3 times over 2 days before it was finally fixed. We had to put towels down on the bathroom floor so we wouldn't slip, and had to lay awake ( even with bathroom door closed) listening to the drip drip drip drip aaarrghghh. - room was very cold and by the second morning we asked reception if it was possible to turn up heating as aircon controls didnt seem to be working. ( didnt complain the day before as in true irish style we didnt want to seem like we were complainers and were more concerned with the constant drip at that stage !!). Anyway the reply from reception was that a technician would be here to fix it today, they were aware of the prblem, was a bit annoyed that we were put in a room with these problems considering we hadn't even booked this hotel. -small breakfast room and 2 of the 4 mornings we were there we had to wait for a table, dont know how many rooms are in this hotel but there are 2 tables that seat 4 and 4 tables that seat 2 in the breakfast room. -mouldy fruit in the fruit bowl, and same cakes there for 4 mornings, gradually getting staler. -check out is at 11a.m, my husband asked how much it would be to keep the room til 4p.m, we taught 70 was excessive, considering the room with breakfast was on average 84 per night if paying cash. - 2 computers with free internet access in reception area, but with very slow connection and often bombed out. I'm sure its possible to find a better hotel for the price paid in the termini area.

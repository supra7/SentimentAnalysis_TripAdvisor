Older hotel in great downtown location. Rooms are updated including the bathrooms and shower area. Beds, bedding, towels are all great. Room had flat screen TV and a window you could open. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Lobby and lobby bar are partially updated and as a result not the newest but not really old. Had salmon salad in the bar one evening for dinner and it was better than expected. Also a convenient location for printing boarding passes in the lobby. So with all this why an Average rating: The hotel is just a little dark and dated and common areas seem dingy. The conference hall for my meeting had really poor lighting and was also--well just dingy. Fitnees area has windows and was just okay. I was unfortunate enough to be stuck in an room with a common adjoining door with another room. I could hear every word spoken in the adjacent room. So MAKE SURE you do not get a room with a shared inner door. Unless you enjoy having someone else dictate when you are going to sleep. This happened late in my third night at hotel--too late to want to make a change as I had a 4:30am alarm.

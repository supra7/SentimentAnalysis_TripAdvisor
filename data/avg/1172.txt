Stayed at the Hotel Max for the American Library Association conference in January 2007. The decor was really lovely, and I loved the art in my room. My room on the second floor opposite the elevators was particularly small, but having stayed in many European hotels this didn't bother me. I loved the design of the separate shower stall and the separate bathroom and the layout of the room was well done to make the room feel bigger than it was. There were bigger rooms on the 2nd floor as my colleague was in one. The plusses for this hotel were definitely the decor, the TV and the comfortable bed. The small gym with two elliptical trainers and two treadmills (all with personal TV) was nice and conveniently on the second floor. HOWEVER - there were two major minuses that really detracted from the experience for me - a very non-picky traveller: 1. It was very cold in Seattle, even for January, and the only heating for the room came from an in window heating/cooling unit. Without the heater on - cold air did come in through the windows making the room quickly cold. With the heater on - the small room was so noisy that I couldn't sleep or hear the television with it on. 2. The walls, at least on the 2nd floor, are extremely thin. I was kept awake at night by people talking/watching television in the next room and my colleague had the same experience being woken up by next door early risers. Neither of us are particularly light sleepers. So if you get a good rate - this is a hip hotel in a very convenient location. Make sure small rooms don't bother you and that the weather is warm - bring some earplugs and you should be fine.

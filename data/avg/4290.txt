My husband and I stayed here during a conference last week and it was alright. The concierge was very informative and the front staff very polite. The room cleaning was questionable though as they did not remove empty water bottles the whole time we stayed. They also only dumped the garbage, they did not replace the lining. I think that towels were just refolded and replaced instead of giving new towels. The showers were actually very small although there was excellent pressure from the showerhead. We didn't dine at the hotel, although we heard firsthand that there was one restaurant that was very slow in service (main course took 2 hours). The location of this hotel was good, the subway station was not too far away. If I had to go to Boston again, I may look elsewhere to stay.

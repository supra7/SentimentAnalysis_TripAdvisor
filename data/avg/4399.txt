Hotel has an open interior, so was concerned about noise, but bedroom is far from hallway and was very quiet. Very comfortable bed. Good size room. Two tvs. Room was dusted and vacuumed but needs a good "spring cleaning". Worst thing - went to go to sleep first night and discovered sheets were NOT fresh sheets - EWWWWWWW. Seriously? How that can be overlooked?Lady who came from housekeeping was very nice.

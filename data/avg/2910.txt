we came during 'Lolapolusa' so all of the rooms were booked up fast so instead of getting 2 double beds we had to get a king suite with a pull out couch. We thought that since the hotel was "Good" & "well respected" we thought that the pull out couch would not be bad..but when we pulled it out and layed on it, you could feel each and every spring coil on your back, because the bed was worn down to a thin peice of "padding" and was very uncomfortable. we told the front desk and they gave us a complimentary roll bed, it was better but not great. In addition the staff was very helpful and the pool on the 40th floor was very nice, a bit windy but very nice view! Hope that helps.

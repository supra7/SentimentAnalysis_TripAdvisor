Great hotel, not cheap and considering the price paid I'd have hoped to get internet access for free in this day and age. But no. $10 a day for a very slow connection and $20 for the faster service. And guess what! That was only for one device. We both had laptops and they wanted us to both pay. Then they offered us a bundle with unlimited wifi and breakfast for $25. My gripe is that they didn't offer this till we made a fuss.

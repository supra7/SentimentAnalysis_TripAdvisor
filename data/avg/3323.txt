Can't fault the service at this hotel, albeit a little slow in the bar. Rooms are nice, well equipped but decor is very dark everywhere which doesn't really help the overall feeling being a little claustrophobic. The entire hotel is encased in metal gridding, so all views from windows are restricted by this as you look out through a mesh. There are however, good all round views from the roof terrace, but this in reality, is much smaller than photos would suggest (they must have had them taken by a good estate agent!). The roof "pool" is nothing more than a large hot tub that isn't hot, there are tables and chairs to sit and admire the view, but these obstruct the way round when people are sat at them, and to be honest, you can't see much sitting down anyhow as the sides to the roof terrace are about 4 feet high. Stairwells are very dark indeed, so use with caution or wait for the slow lifts to arrive (only 1 of 3 go to the roof so it can be quite a wait), corridors very dark and the room lighting too. There is no privacy in the open plan shower, particularly with the mirrored doors too, so only share with someone you know well! Happy to report there is a sliding door to the loo! Not a great deal of wardrobe space if you're staying more than a couple of days but the beds are very comfortable indeed. Overall a decent contemporary hotel, a little bit weird in it's choice of dark decor everywhere, and more than a little bit odd given the location. The best way to describe this hotel is it's like being inside an alien spaceship that has crash landed in a ghetto. I know others say the area is no so bad, but the appearance is dreadful, grafitti everywhere and washing hanging over every balcony, lots of dodgy looking characters hanging around and doesn't feel safe - regardless of whether it actually is safe or not, it doesn't look safe or feel safe. An odd experience indeed!

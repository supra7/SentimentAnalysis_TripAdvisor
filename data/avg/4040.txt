We received the deal through priceline for $135, very excited about that! The location is awesome especially for a family with three girls and my husband simply wanted to be near Fenway. We ate at Champions bar and had a great meal at an affordable price, without a wait. They didn't even bat an eye when I paid with a debit card, check in was ridiculously fast and we ended up on the 25th floor with a city view. The rooms were not as large as some we have had in the Boston area and a little dated but they were in great condition and exceptionally clean. Which is all we needed. Our youngest enjoyed the pool. Boston is a great walking city, with excellent shopping. I can't wait to go back.

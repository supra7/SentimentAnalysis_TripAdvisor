We stayed here at the end of our holidays around Florida. The hotel was nice and clean and what we expected but the hotel would not cash a traveller cheque nor accept one as payment! The breakfast was very poor, consisting of single serve cereals( complete with plastic container) and the manner of service left a lot to be desired!! The other staff we encountered were equally uninterested in ensuring our stay was enjoyable and overall left us feeling thoroughly dissapointed with the place.

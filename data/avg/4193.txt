We had 2 queen rooms and stayed for 2 nights in early Sept 2011. The hotel is very large and has several nice restaurants inside it. It's also located by the T station which we used ($9 for an all day pass per person). The rooms each had 2 bathrooms however they were TINY. I cannot emphasize how tiny! The toilet was wedged between the bathtub and the wall - there was literally no room between the toilet and tub - as a woman is was not comfortable. The room needed updating - walls, paint, bathroom fixtures, etc. The bed was comfortable. Parking was very expensive - $44 per night. The front desk was very friendly and helped guide us. Overall, this hotel has the location going for it. Unless the price is around $100 per night (reg price was $180) I'd recommend staying somewhere else (more modern) downtown.

We had spent six great nights at the Mediterranean Inn in Seattle, but since we had flights at 6 a.m.--and thus had to be at the airport at 4 a.m.--we decided to spend our last night at the Radisson Gateway. I had been impressed with the Trip Advisor reviews that said it was within walking distance of Sea-Tac. We used an airport shuttle to get from downtown Seattle to the Radisson, and the shuttle driver laughed when I said I'd read that the hotel was within walking distance of Sea-Tac. "I think they may have been exaggerating," he added. When we checked in, we asked how far it was to the terminal, and were told it was a good 15 minute walk, which is not something I want to do with a suitcase and carry-on at 4 a.m. (Ok, I confess, the only thing I ever want to do at 4 a.m. is sleep. Ever.) The front desk clerk said there was a 24-hour-a-day shuttle that runs three times per hour, but because it ran on the hour and at twenty after and twenty of, we had to get up even earlier than I'd anticipated. The room was nice, as it should be for $190, including tax. Sleep Number beds as mentioned elsewhere, with upscale bedding. The restaurant in the hotel gave us a decent dinner for prices similar to what we'd paid in the rest of the Seattle area. The pool was small but clean, and there were plenty of towels available pool-side. The hot tub was nice and toasty. When we checked out at 3:40 a.m., the staff was very pleasant, there was coffee in the lobby, and the shuttle driver was ready and waiting. I feel as though I overpaid, expecting to be closer to the terminal. Any hotel in the area with a 24-hour shuttle would have been adequate.

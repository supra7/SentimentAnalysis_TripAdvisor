I stayed at Palmer House 3 years ago during renovation and was back again on business. The street level is beautiful, as is the lobby. Lots of convenient bars, shops and restaurants on site. There is much to like about this historic hotel, including personnel who are responsive and pleasant. The fitness room is excellent, and the location is convenient. However, annoying service issues and average furnishings detracted from the stay. First, the service issues. I waited 25 minutes to check in, and I was lucky. The line was twice as long when I finished. They were grossly understaffed on a very busy night - an inexcusable way for a guest to start their stay. The elevators on my wing were unreliable, and I got stuck for 10 minutes one evening. On the way out, I waited 10 minutes for what apparently was the sole functioning elevator to arrive on my floor. My room (a suite) was spacious and well-appointed, but the furnishings were somewhat dated, including TVs that must be 8-10 years old. I was alone, which was fortunate, because the bath was tiny. (Conversely, there was a nice walk-in closet) I am sure this has to do with the age of the property, but given the size of the suite, I would have expected something more contemporary. Be advised that one side of the hotel faces the elevated rail.

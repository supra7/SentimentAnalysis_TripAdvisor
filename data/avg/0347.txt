We recently stayed at this hotel for a weekend trip. Overall, the hotel was just alright, as the location is fairly convenient, but after saying that, if you find any hotel in the downtown area, it will be convenient. The hotel is clean, the staff is pretty friendly, and the rooms are very small, especially the bathroom, which was terribly small. Our air conditioning unit wasn't barely working and it was pretty loud at night. The elevators are very slow as well. I am not sure if there is free wireless internet service but there is one computer for public use. Anyway, if the was price is right, i'd stay there again but this wouldn't be my first choice.

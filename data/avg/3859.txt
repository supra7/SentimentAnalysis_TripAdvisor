The location to different tourist attractions is great for the price. However, there are many bars around this hotel and around 2:00 am when they are all closing, all the drunks come out and are very loud on the street. Unfortunately, the windows aren't well insulated and you get woken up. Also, the hotel is on the main bus line (3rd ave), so you hear the buses come and go all day and night. There seemed to be a lot of people on the street asking for money also. The hotel itself is great. Clean, fridge, microwave, free internet in the lobby.

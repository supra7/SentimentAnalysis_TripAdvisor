I spent 5 days at this hotel recently and even though the hotel is okay, the location is terrible. It is too far from the centre and many of the taxi drivers did not even know where it is. It's at least 30 minutes on the tram and then 30 minutes on the underground metro to the centre. A taxi should be about 15-17 Euros, but watch out for dodgy drivers who will try and say 20 Euros before they even set off. There's a supermarket 5 minutes walk up the hill which is good for most things. The pool and pool area is quite small and is quite hard to find as it was obviously an afterthought when they built the hotel, although it was always quiet when we were there. The rooms were okay, but could do with a good dusting in some of the corners. The staff are quite slow, and there's often no-one on the bar, so I would get some beers from the supermarket and keep in your room's fridge (which hardly works). I would not stay here again or recommend this to hotel to anyone.

This hotel isn't in a bad location, but you will definitely need a cab to get there. There is a shuttle that runs into the city from the hotel, but they do not pick up after 8pm and you have to know where to get it. Don't be dazzled by the seemingly modern details. The rooms are indeed tiny and some of them don't even have windows. Things are kitschy and basic. The hotel isn't awful, but I wouldn't stay there again.

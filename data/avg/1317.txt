I stay at Sea-Tac Marriott on 06-11-10 because of an early flight the next morning. Was picked up at the airport after dropping off my rental car. The shuttle was very prompt and I learned that it ran every 15 minutes from the hotel. At the hotel check in was very fast. My family was given a room over looking the indoor pool. Previous reviews that said it was loud if you have a room facing the pool were correct. The rooms are not large, but have stayed in ones that are smaller. If you want a quiet room request a room facing the exterior. When flying out the next morning the shuttle to airport was once again prompt and it was a short 5 minute ride. One recomendation to the hotel would be to add insulated windows to the interior rooms.

The hotel is ok for a business trip. Not really top notch new interior, but basically clean. Stayed here the second time in one and a half year. Construction is still!!! going on. They should finish that one. Although I must say, no direct negative impact on my stay. Free-of-charge Wireless LAN in the Lobby is very ok. Less ok ist the miserable quality of the coffee in the lobby coffee shop. The parking fee is outrageous - 16$ per day is too much, SEA Airport vicinity or not. Dont go here for vacations in the SEA area - too far away from everything but the airport. Welcome cookie is good and is a nice gesture.

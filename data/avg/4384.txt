I'm perplexed as to why this hotel is so highly rated here on Tripadvisor. Given our two night stay, I think it falls short primarily for two reasons, noise level and issues with comfort. It does, however, outshine many other hotels as far as personable employees and making a solid impression in letting the customer know that the staff is more than willing to provide all they can to make ones stay as enjoyable as possible. Because of that, I give the hotel a solid A+ for their focus and dedication in trying to provide their customers with the best possible service and experience. The hotel although very tastefully refurbished, is still an old hotel. We stayed in Room 511, a king suite (and do agree with the previous reviewer's complaint regarding the uncomfortableness of the pillows!!). Suite was well appointed, no doubt about it, and roomy, too. But for us the catch was the noise factor. The street noise is UNBELIEVABLE through out the night into the wee hours of the morning -- from the constant sounds of irrate horns blowing, sirens wailing, the after hours bar crowd laughing and yelling, etc. - it is definitely over the top. Not sure if it was due to old walls, windows or what. We have stayed directly across the street numerous times at the Marriot, and this has never been a problem there. Another pet peeve was the inability to get the room temp to our satisfaction -- the bed is equiped with a sheet and a duvet -- so you find you are either too hot or too cold. I hate sleeping with just a sheet on, but that's what I ended up doing. Given just how pricey the hotel actually is, these two issues were deal breakers for us. On the positive side, the location is really phenomenal. If you are someone who can sleep through just about anything and are not picky about the comfort of the bed and pillows that you sleep on, then I say, have at it.

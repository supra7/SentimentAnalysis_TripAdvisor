The Hotel Executive is a good hotel for the price. Dont go expecting anything fancy but the location is wonderful and the rooms are fine. However there are a few things about this hotel that are not mentioned when you book a room that are important to know. First of all the hotel parking lot is almost 30 dollars a night. Second they do NOT have any sort of AC until May. Thirdly, and in my opinion, most importantly do not stay in room 801. The 8th floor is hot, stuffy, and gets very little ventilation. The 8th floor is very hot and and with no AC it is kind of an uncomfortable stay. Also you have to keep the window open, which happens to overlook the parking lot, which means it is also very noisy. However the one thing that was just ridiculous was the room, 801. We were booked in this stuffy and warm room with no AC, but that was bearable. However, 801 is also adjacent to the elevator motor. If you stay in this room I guarantee you will hear the grind of the motor starting every time someone uses it. Therefore we had the window open, the motor of the elevator, and drunks in the hallway (not the hotels fault), all night. Was my worst hotel night stay ever (and that includes sketchy hostels in Europe). However when I called the front desk at 4 am crying because I couldnt sleep they moved me promptly. Therefore my biggest advice to people staying here is to request any floor but the 8th and DO NOT stay in room 801 unless you like constant noise. I cannot fathom why they do not rent this room sparingly.

This Westin is pretty standard. Decent location downtown, walking distance to basically anywhere you would want to go (25 min walk to Safeco Field). Old, twin tower-style Westin, room on 20th floor had a decent view. Bed was fine, crappy flat screen t.v., bathrooms are small, poor amenities, but clean enough. Expensive parking, but Ive decided people who park in those garages generally dont care about the $20-25 extra they pay for parking (which is cool). So for those folks, there is a valet,(although it looked like your typical hotel/valet/garage mess at peak times). Not a terrific value, but downtown Seattle is not cheap in terms of decent hotel rooms, so not a horrible either. Only stayed 1 weekend night, did not eat or drink at hotel. Bottom line: your typical, B/B- Westin.

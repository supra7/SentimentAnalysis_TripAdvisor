With so many good hotels in Chicago (Ritz-Carlton, Sofitel, Park Hyatt etc) you would have to have a very good reason to stay in this rather disappointing flagship of the Hilton group. The refit which is nearing completion may have restored some of the original features but in the process the lobby, with its magnificent ceiling, has been left a little like a train station lobby complete with escalators. The room sizes vary greatly. In my group one person had a very large room with a sofa whilst I was left with a modest sized room largely taken up by the double bed (queen sized). A few gripes include filthy towels, even dirtier bath, no mini-bar or fridge, expensive internet ($20) and message light that would not go off. On the plus side, the position in much better than the other Chicago Hilton (although the rooms have no decent views), the decor is fresh, the bath amenities nice and the bed comfortable. Breakfast was nice although other than the buffet, there was only a very limited choice. Service was generally good especially in the bar which was lively. Overall it is an adequate hotel but there are much better in Chicago, often for the same money.

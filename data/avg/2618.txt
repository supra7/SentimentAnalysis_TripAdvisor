-Overall, we think the hotel wasn't toooooo bad, but the bedding was gross. there were hairs in the bed, and brown marks on the pillows.. and I don't think you would want to sleep on that. -The breakfast was okay, but the server got my toast stuck in the toaster, and he still gave it to me after, even though it was burnt. -Small bedrooms, not a lot of room for luggage, but very modern -There were no counters in the bathroom, only enough room for a toothbrush. -My friend left her washcloth in the bathroom during the day and the cleaning lady took it with the laundry, and she didn't get it back. -Some guy came to our door to tell us to be quiet and we weren't even being loud. -Don't sleep by the window, you will freeze your butt off, and you won't sleep a wink, because it was so loud outside.

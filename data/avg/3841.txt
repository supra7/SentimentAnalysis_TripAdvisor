The rooms are well appointed and the bathroom is very large. However there is no tub and the shower head is so high that a short woman 5'3" can barely adjust the settings. Everything is charged extra and the food is limited and expensive. If you are on a restricted diet it is hard to eat here. Service was so-so. Breakfast was mixed up three times and finally after that we got a free breakfast. I was told over and over that it was a training problem. But the staff just doesn't work smoothly. I wanted to go to the pool and discovered that it was closed--a large sign said closed 3:00PM so we did not return and later found out that it reopened at 4:00 but the sign did not say closed between 3-4. Also some of the food outlets were closed limiting availability . Absolutely not for a family--what would the children eat and where would they bathe?

First off, the parking is terrible. It's very confusing to find parking garage. The check-in employees are not helpful at all. Never gave any information about the hotel whatsoever. Then when we got to our room, there was a definite smell of smoke in it (it was a non-smoking room) and it's obvious that someone noticed it becaus they had the window open to try to get rid of the smell. By that time, we were hungry so we just kept the room. The location is nice but I would not stay there again because of the parking, and lack of friendly employees.

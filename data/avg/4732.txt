We were impressed by the Hotel Monaco's earlier reviews and chose to stay there for our get-away weekend. While the hotel is certainly comfortable, we were a little taken aback by the worn-out condition of the room and the hectic pace of the lobby area, in which the staff seemed frequently overwhelmed. First, the location is quite good. Located on the northeast corner of the Loop district, the Hotel Monaco is just two blocks from the Magnificent Mile and one block from any of the public transit trains. Also, the guest floor public area was quite charming and warm, with big, mahogany doors, bright carpet, and lime/cream striped wall paper. Once inside our room, though, we were a bit disappointed. The curtains would not close completely, allowing beams of sunshine to burst in at sunrise. The curtains were also tattered, with holes and tears plainly visible. The seating chair was threadbare and the carpet could use a good steam-vacuuming. On the plus side, our bath was quite ample, clean and well-maintained. The lobby seemed over-run with people when we came and went (perhaps they all heard we were coming and wanted to catch a glimpse? Ha!) While some of the crowds may be contributed to the evening social, hour, we also saw some fairly significant lines of guests waiting for desk service. The staff, particularly the doormen were quite charming, though we felt they were overwhelmed at times. That's not their fault, but we felt a little sorry for them. All-in-all, a good choice, but we'd likely explore another of Chicago's boutique options on our next trip.

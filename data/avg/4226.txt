This was a business trip so we loved the location. It was close enough for us to walk to our first meeting. It was nice to be surrounded by so many restaurants and near Boston Commons. I liked being near the prime downtown shopping areas too. But the hotel rooms were unbeliveably small. The room was just large enough for a full sized bed. And the bathroom was really small. I've never seen a shower (no room for a tub) that narrow before! It is an old, elegant historic hotel with a great history. It used to be a Statler Hotel back in the 1920's. It has that old, grand hotel look about it. The room was very clean and nicely decorated (except for the big old TV perched on a wooden stand). A room that small really should have flat screen Tv bolted to the wall. I was afraid I might bump the TV off the narrow stand going to the bathroom. I could also lie in bed and listen to the hum of the subway. It didn't bother me but it did bother my coworker who was one floor higher than me. If you don't care about the size of the room it's an OK place to stay. I give it thumbs up for the location & cleanliness. But it's also a bit pricy and parking is expensive too. There is a parking lot down the street that costs a little bit less. Not many places to park inexpensively downtown.

We are very frequent travelers and decided to have a weekend getaway in Seattle. The hotel is nicely done, in a great location to Pike Place and Shopping District. They put us in a handicapped room. (no we aren't handicapped) next to the train and we asked to be moved and they couldn't do it until 4pm the next day, but ok. Very slow internet. Nice hotel, very unusual ambiance. Staff in almost every area had some chip on their shoulder. Arrogance abounds here...very odd. Simple requests are moaned and groaned about. Not the usual customer service you would expect from a hotel of this expense.

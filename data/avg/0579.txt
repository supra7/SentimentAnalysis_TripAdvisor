Very good convention hotel with nice lobby and newer Union Tower in great location by tourist area and convention center. Room was particularly good for a Sheraton. Gym and pool are nice. But there is an annoying issue that gets in the way of really enjoying this hotel--they overcharge for the basic necessities of business travel. Examples are $38 per night for fairly slow valet parking (front desk has an "it's a separate company" shrug), $10 per day for internet, $5 per day to use the gym. At comparable downtown Seattle hotels at which I have also stayed, parking is under $30 per night and the internet and gym are included in the room price.

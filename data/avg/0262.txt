This hotel was a convenient, low-cost old hotel. The place is a bit the worse for wear but clean and quiet. The staff seemed a bit confused however, gave me the wrong room key then argued with me for several minutes before providing the correct key. The rooms were relatively spacious considering the age of the place and cost per night. Plenty of clean towels were provided and the water-pressure and water-heat were impressive. I had a nice stay and enjoyed this very walkable area of the city. There was no cell phone coverage or internet in the room.

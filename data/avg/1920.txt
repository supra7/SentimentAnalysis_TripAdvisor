My husband and I stayed here for a week on our honeymoon. It's not a ritzy hotel, but pleasing, clean & comfortable. We felt like we were tucked away from the hustle & bustle; it's very calming. The beach is right there for swimming or snorkeling. All the staff are very friendly and happy. We even had a bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived. We stayed in an older wing of the hotel, which was fine, no elevator. But I'm sure the updated rooms are lovely. We bought beverage holders and liquor when we landed, then filled them and brought to the pool with us. More affordable. The location makes it very easy to drive around on the island. Cell phone coverage was great. Internet access for a fee. There's an in-room safe too, definitely made use of that.

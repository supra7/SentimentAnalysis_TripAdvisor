Went to Curious last November. Thanks to google street view, we found the hotel right away. Room was ok and clean. Think ibis style. Regarding the location, the touristy type is satisfied with proximity of the Ramblas. The more cultural minded person is satisfied with the proximity of the MCAB and the vintage and designer shops in Born. I can recommend buying Phaidon Barcelona. During our stay, we were woken up early due to construction nearby. That was a bit uncool, but it was compensated due to the fact that I became the Mayor of the Hotel on Foursquare, which resulted in a nice discount. All in all, I'm coming back soon!

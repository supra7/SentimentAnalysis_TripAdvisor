We just needed a basic room to use after a late concert at Key Arena. We checked in around 4:00 and the staff was very friendly. We were very thankful for the free parking as well. The hotel as a whole is older and a bit dingy, but it was good enough for us. Our room was quite small, barely enough room to walk around the two double beds, with a table, chair, and TV crammed into one corner, but since all we needed was a bed and bathroom, we were fine. The bathroom was small too, but clean, and lots of hot water. The air conditioner also cooled the room very well. The free breakfast had a good selection and tasted good. In short, if you need a no-frills hotel close to Seattle Center, and don't want to pay for parking, this is a good place to stay. If you want big and fancy, you won't be impressed.

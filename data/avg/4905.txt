In general, the Palmer is a nice hotel in a great location. Specifically, the staff at the Palmer lacks attention to detail. We were traveling with a large group and had some special needs that were not met by either front desk or housekeeping. Some of our special requests were fulfilled after we asked twice, but others were either ignored or not handled correctly. I would recommend it to couples who just need a nice room in a good location. I would not recommend it to anyone who may need a little help or special treatment.

Although we only paid $126 for the room with a King bed, we didnt realize we had to add the amenities to the cost. WiFi was $12.95 for the night and parking was $32 dollars. Doesnt that make the cost really more like $171.00?? I'm thinking I could have had a better room elsewhere for that price. The rooms iron was broken as well and it took 30 mins for a replacement to show up. Dont they check that kind of thing before renting the room? They should

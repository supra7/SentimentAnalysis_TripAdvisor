This is a great hotel to use as a base for exploring Seattle. It's really well located - there are some great bars and places to eat if you are into punk rock/alternative culture just around the corner. Because of this, it is a little noisy at night, but hey you're in Seattle so you should be out enjoying yourself! The rooms were clean and the hotel staff really helpful with restaurant recommendations and calling taxis etc. They also have free internet access.

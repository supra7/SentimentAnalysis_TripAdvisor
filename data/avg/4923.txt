Stayed here for a week for business in late July. Tons of people always running around everywhere. Very busy. "Regular" basic rooms were nothing to write home about. Just your basic average hotel room. The elevators situation were definitely an issue, but presumably this is only the case during the summer months, during the week, when conferences and conventions are plenty. Paid for an upgrade to the concierge level, which was worth every penny. Rooms were nicer, the food/snacks at breakfast, dinner time were well received and needed. Would still recommend the hotel -- just know that it is not the Drake, etc. Pool is quite small, and there really is no fitness center to speak of, just fyi. Parking is outrageous, so find parking elsewhere (such as the public lots under millenium park) and save a ton --- unless your company is picking up the tab and just don't care (which is a shame).

The positive side of the hotel is that it is centrally located with 10 minutes walk to all the popular places, like Grand Bazar, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, etc. and the hotel staff is very helpful. During our stay, we had one person at the front desk, named Ozeguer. He was very friendly and willing to help. But the negative side is that the breakfast was very basic and the fruit and vegetable trays were not refreshed each mornings. You can tell that the trays are repeated for many days in a row which is not hygenie. The rooms are not sound proof as you can hear outside noise and people walking on your floor.

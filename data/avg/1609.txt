This one had the strengths of other Comfort Suites: Big, comfortable, clean, modern room,with good bedding. Very nice staff. It's right off the highway, but not really close to downtown Indianapolis. Lots of dining options in the area, however, the entire neighborhood smelled of fast-food frying. Breakfast also wasn't quite as good as I've had at other properties of the same brand, and they weren't as good at keeping it stocked. Slow, unreliable wireless connection with many interruptions was a disappointment.

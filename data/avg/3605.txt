My teenage daughter and I stayed for 4 nights at this well located hotel. We stayed before at Staybridge suites in Houston and San Antonio and this was very similar. It's very nice to have breakfast in the morning and to be able to take it to your room. This particular hotel does not have a table or similar to sit down and eat, we have to do it at the sofa with the coffee tables, which was a little bit uncomfortable. We experienced some troubles with our door lock but were immediately transfered to another room which was fine, and the staff was very very courteous and helpful. Close by is a Walmart so you can fill your fridge and prepare dinner. We definitely stay again in any Staybridge.

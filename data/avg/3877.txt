Like the other reviews have mentioned, the staff and the cleanliness of The Point are outstanding. But that's about the only thing that sets this apart from any other hotel. The breakfast is $9, and the eggs are powdered. Coffee is $2.75 per cup. There are no vending machines...so make sure you bring your own groceries. The washer and dryer were very nice to have in room, but not necessary. The suite was very big and spacious, and the bathroom was too! The shower was huge, but the shower head was awful with little pressure. This "resort" charges a $10/day resort fee..I'm not really sure for what. The maid only empties the trash and makes the bed, breakfast is average (fine if free, but not worth paying), and they claim to have a shuttle to Universal, but it only runs once in the morning and once in the evening.

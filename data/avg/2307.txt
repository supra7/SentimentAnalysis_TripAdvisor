Stayed for a week. Hard to sleep with next room so loud after midnight. Further from Duval than we were led to believe. We couldn't get food on the property after 6 pm. Worst thing was the surprise $150 resort fee at the end of the stay. We were not told of this fee when making reservations. This is not what I would call a resort. I would not recomend this place to anyone.

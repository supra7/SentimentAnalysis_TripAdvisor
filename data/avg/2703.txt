Stayed here for 5 nights mainly for work on my first trip to Chicago. Room had everything I needed, comfortable bed, fridge, good desk space and sofa area. But no safe box. I had a room on 15 floor facing East. The view was good but not spectacular. There is a fire station a block away and the sirens from the fire trucks were slightly annoying. The free wireless was pretty slow and the free breakfast food itself was mediocre but I liked the relaxed style - you could come and go as you please, take the food back to your room and they kept the coffee bar open all day. Service was good. Front desk staff were helpful and there was a very pleasant waitress in the breakfast room. The only thing that would keep me away is the other guests that stayed here. Call me snobby but I found there were too many noisy families with lots of young kids running around.

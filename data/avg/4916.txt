Our conference ends tomorrow, but when we booked, we thought that it might be nice to stay an additional couple of days and enjoy the weekend. After spending a week here, though, we changed our minds and advised that we would be checking out tomorrow with our colleagues, and we just found out that we either have to pay an additional 150.00 early departure cancellation fee, or stay for the weekend. So here we sit, in an overpriced, very small room, without even a coffee maker, no bar fridge, and a small bathtub that won't hold water. Leaving our pop and cheese, etc in the open window works fairly well (if we were camping it would seem like an adventure). Expensive parking, expensive food, expensive internet, Do I detect a trend here?? Oh yes, don't forget to return the glass you brushed your teeth with to the ice bucket table, or you will only have one remaining clean glass for the rest of the week. Ridiculous! Hi management, we're up here in 12-202 any time you might like to chat.....

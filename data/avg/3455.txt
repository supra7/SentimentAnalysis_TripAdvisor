We stayed at this hotel for two night in the beginning of october 2011, so we got the chance to know this hotel quite good. We were exepecting much better hotel for 4 stars  The room we stayed in was quite small, cca 16 m2, and the furniture looked very used. It needs a good refurbishment. The front doors leaked and all the time we felt a breeze in the room (we stayed in groundfloor, looking at the garden). The same goes for windows. Among all the things the breakfast was the most positive thing that happend to us, but if you came late or in a rush hour then you had to wait for the table. Some waited even more then 20 min. The location is good, you had to walk around 10min along the coast to get to San Marco square. I would categorise this hotel as maximum of 2-3 stars, breakfast for 3-4 stars. Beat Western has a lot things to do in this hotel.

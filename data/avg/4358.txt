After buying my nonrefundable vacation package I was horrified to see some of the reviews of the Park Plaza. My experience wasn't terrible at all. Staff seemed polite, the room was on the small side but quite clean. As far as I could tell, it had a standard sized bathtub/shower. The bed was VERY comfortable! Our only disappointment was the obviously worn condition of the carpeting and most of the common areas. Little things, like the glass entry doors had fingerprints all over them, and paint was chipped. This is definitely an older hotel and upkeep is not what it should be, but by no means was this a bad experience. I would stay there again, at the bargain price I paid.

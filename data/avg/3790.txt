I was very perplexed when we checked in here. We always go for Best Western due to a very exceptional experience in Houston. First, this is the first Best Western that doesn't have a typical hotel building (all rooms in a single building). I didn't know that it was formerly a Days Inn which we are also familiar of. That probably explains why we have to go out for the continental breakfast and why the walls are so thin. ACTUAL REVIEW: Price: cheap considering it is in a city. Location: very convenient to the places we wanted to visit. Cleanliness: Rooms are clean. Bathroom and bathtub are clean to soak in. Staff/ Service: They are courteous but nothing beats West Chase at Houston. Nobody went up and beyond to make sure we comfortable, not that they didn't take care of us. Just not superb. Rooms: The walls are thin. Our room is on the ground level and every step of the occupant upstairs are heard. I didn't sleep good due to this. Continental breakfast: Average menu plus a waffle maker. Safety: The area felt safe, it's the other guests that makes me nervous. They are very noisy in the middle of the night. TV/ Internet: Very average. Best Western is a good place but this isn't the best place to stay in Dallas.

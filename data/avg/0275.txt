I spent two nights at the Moore. I'd really like to give it a 3.5, but I can't. The Moore is a really cool old hotel in an excellent location to walk around Seattle and see the sights. Also in a good spot for nightlife and funky restaurants. I checked in late the first night, and the staff was very accomodating. My room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable and I had a great view of Elliot Bay out my window (7th floor). Although I was right near the elevator, I could only hear minimal noise. No shampoo or conditioner, but ehn, I brought my own anyway. I just parked on the street, which is free from 6pm to 8am. At 8 I came out and paid the parking meter. $3 for 2 hours. Then I picked up my friend from the airport and we drove to Vancouver. We returned to Seattle for our final night, and our stay was slightly less great. Our room was still nice, freshly painted and clean, but the faucet for the shower was falling off and very difficult to use. The night staff on this night was also not very friendly. I interrupted a 20 minute conversation between the desk agent and a guest for some information (I was using the guest computer, while I waited) . The clerk was very unhappy, although the guest seemed relieved. It was great to have a guest computer, but a printer (for a boarding pass) would have been very welcome. And they will NOT print it for you. I'll stay again, but I'll save my questions for the friendly and helpful day staff.

I was staying in the W Hotel for a few days when I was in Hong Kong about three years ago. At that time, it was a brand new hotel, everything was nice, clean and attractive. Last week, I stayed in the same hotel again for 4 days, my feeling was totally different. It was very obvious that this place is running down rapidly. The washroom has a large, irremovable stain mark near the toilet - a very disgusting look as if some one just pee on the cement wall. Then inside the shower, same kind of mark on the wall. The sliding door was not able to stop the water from leaking out during shower, the result - very messy and wet floor afterward. There was a flood in the shower stall on the first night after I showered for just 10 minutes. After some investigation, I had discovered that the drainage was plugged due to a massive hair ball was clogged in there - an absolutely horrifying experience for a trendy hotel charging me HK $2,500 ($300 US) a night! Then the bedroom, the curtain definitely need a wash. The writing desk (made with the same gray cement/stone as the toilet wall) had the same ugly looking stain mark as in the bathroom ... and yes, don't go the Chinese restaurant called Xin Yin (used to be a steak house) for dinner at the lobby level even when they offer you a 20% discount if you are the guest of the hotel. It was a total rip-off, I regretted very much to go there with my friends on the second night of my stay. Food was average but the price they charge me was ridicules! The positive side is, this hotel is right above the fast train station to the airport so you can check-in your luggage at the train station before taking off. The high-end shopping mall, Element, is attached to the hotel and is a great place for shoppers for brand name products. Staff at the hotel are overall very helpful. Still, I will not go back to this hotel again. I blame it totally on the management, not the staff.

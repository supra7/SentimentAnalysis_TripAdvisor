Contiki tour group starting point, great location, newly renovated (at the time) and firendly staff. I was there in the middle of their coldest winter in 40 years and lets just say the central heating still worked even as I would walk in and out the sliding doors to have a cigarette (yes I have quit, disgusting habit). Friendly very well spoken (in English) staff and a good start to my European experience.

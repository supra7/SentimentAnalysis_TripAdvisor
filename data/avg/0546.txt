My husband and I and our 2 1/2-year-old daughter stayed here while my husband attended a convention, so it was semi-leisure, semi-business travel. The room was nice, and the beds were the most comfortable I have ever stayed in. The location is walking distance from the Pike Place Market and Waterfront. Parking is $33/day--probably pretty standard for downtown Seattle, but good to know. What really irked me was that internet access in your room costs $11/day! I don't do any business travel, and these days we use rental houses and condos when we travel, so perhaps this is the trend. But this seemed a very chintzy touch for such a nice hotel. It was hard to research fun activities to do with my two-year-old without internet in the room (luckily, chasing pigeons on the waterfront and visiting the Aquarium are plenty fun for her). Also, the flat-screen TV was standard-definition (not something I care about, but my husband does), and took a long time to turn on, and the "guide" was difficult to use--it was generally poor quality. Lest I sound nit-picky (and I realize I do as I read over this), I guess the reason I have these complaints is that the Sheraton is a nice hotel--maybe not luxury, but one that caters to people who are willing and able to spend a little more. This type of place was definitely a splurge for us and convenient to my husband's convention location. I'm happy in a basic motel or hut on the beach (as long as there's a beach). When we stay at the Sleep Inn I don't expect room service, and when we stay somewhere like the Sheration I don't need pillow menus or fluffy robes--just no cheaping out on the little and big details!

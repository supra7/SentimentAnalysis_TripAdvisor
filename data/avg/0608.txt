We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 5 nights. The best part is the location. The hotel is in the downtown shopping district and all the tourist stuff is walking distance from the hotel. I would not pay full price for this hotel but definitely look for deals on hotwire and other internet sites. The hotel claims to be 4 stars but it isn't. We had to carry our stuff to the room. They did not have much staff working late (we got to the hotel at 1145pm). The rooms and hallways are worn out but the location makes up for it. Would definitely stay there again only if we can get a good deal online.

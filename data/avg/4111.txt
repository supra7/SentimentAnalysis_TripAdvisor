We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February 2012. Its a nice hotel right in the thick of things that would be of interest to a tourist. The only fault I have is the noise. The way the hotel is constructed is to blame I believe. There is a large tunnel like space going up many levels as you walk into the hotel. As our room was close to this area, we suffered "funnel effect" noise. You could hear people coming into the hotel at all hours. The hallways are really noisy. At one point I got up to see what the problem was and the people were at the farest part of the hallway but sounded like they were right outside our door. Also the walls in between the rooms are made out of paper almost as you can hear people talking at a normal lever. You can walk to any of the attractions in Boston from here. The only problem on this trip was going back to that noisy hotel.

Its not a bad hotel, but I kinda expected a nicer room in a 4 star hotel. Maybe I am spoiled from staying in blinged out 4 star hotels in Vegas (serious bang for the buck there). The rooms are in serious need of an upgrade as they look very dated (popcorn ceilings and old carpet). There was also a musty kind of smell when we first walked into the room. That being said, the location is great, but there are many other hotels in the same area that are decent and probably cheaper (like Red Lion). I guess I can't complain too much since we got the room through priceline for $143 a night. We would probably try someplace else next time. However, if you can get a really good deal at the Westin, it is not a bad option.

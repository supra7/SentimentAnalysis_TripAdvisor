My wife and I spent the night at this Hilton last Wednesday using HH points. We went to bed about 10pm only to be woken up about 11 oclock by what we assume was a Garbage truck coming to haul off the garbage. It banged and beeped (back-up warning beeps) which lasted a good 30 minutes, Whatever it was I dont understand why it had to be done so late at night, you would think hotels would not want this kind of noise next to or below the rooms at night. It took as a long tme to get back to sleep and unfortunately we had a very early flight to catch the next morning so we got very little rest that night. I would not stay in that wing again (Room 1378) without assurances from the hotel that there was no Garbage Service or Construction going on at night on that side of the building.

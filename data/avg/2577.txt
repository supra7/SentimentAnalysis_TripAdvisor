The hotel was good and did the job for 1 night, I wouldn't want a 2nd night. The hotel I'm afraid was let down by the noise in the rooms from the roads outside. This is very disturbing and I do believe work is required to ensure that the rooms are a little more sound proofing. All night long traffic noise can be heard and this meant for a very disturbed nights sleep for all our family. The hotel needs to work on this as it has been noted by a number of guests who have reviewed the hotel. It is a shame as the hotel was clean, comfortable and very handy for London's attractions. It's a typical Travelodge, cheap and cheerful and if they could sort out the noise in the rooms, it would easily get 5 stars for value.

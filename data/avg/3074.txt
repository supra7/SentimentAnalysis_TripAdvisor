My husband and I went for a three-day break. The first night we arrived at midnight, and our room was tiny, with no chest of drawers, no chairs and only one bedside table. The bathroom was compact, and there was one tiny bar of soap and small bottle of white liquid with no label. We moved the next day to a bigger room, but it was not much more luxurious. The rooms are dimly lit, and the hallways are installed with light sensors, so it was always a bit dark. The walls are thin, so one can easily hear ones' neighbours. It's not a particularly inviting place to return to after a long day of sightseeing. Breakfast was simple and unchanging, with a Nescafe machine producing instant coffee, fresh bread and the standard olives, cold cuts and cheeses, whole fruit and plain yogurt. Bottom line is the service is friendly enough, the rooms are spartan but clean, and the location is excellent if you are trying to pack all of the big monuments into a short stay. It is not ideal for a romantic or relaxing stay.

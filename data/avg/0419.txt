Stayed at this hotel for three nights in July 2009, travelling with teenagers. Room were comfortable, but our room on the 12th floor overlooked I5, the main interstate south, and the noise was was shockingly bad - could not sleep at all the first night we were there. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a high floor, away from the Interstate. Minor annoyances: not enough towels in the bathroom, in-room Internet connection would not work properly, room access cards kept getting desensitized. However, friendly and responsive staff made up for it. The hotel is well located, some six blocks from Pike Place Market. However it is at the intersection of 6th Ave and Madison St, a very steep climb from the waterfront. You will really regret not keeping in shape!

The Warwick Seattle is a great value for a hotel in downtown Seattle. The hotel public areas and hotel rooms are clean and decent. The building has been kept up in good shape as have the rooms. Higher floors get some view of the city or the Space Needle, depending on which way you face. After two stays here I've found the staff friendly and very accommodating.

Bed was wonderful but only a double not queen. No handrails in tub. Got woken up at 5:28 am when shower next door started. Sounded Luke it was in my room. Old tv sets in armoir. Desk blocking one window so I couldn't get TP it to close curtain. Dust in bedside lamp. Easy to trip walking into bathroom because marble floor is not flush with carpet. In room breakfast was terrific. Fast response.

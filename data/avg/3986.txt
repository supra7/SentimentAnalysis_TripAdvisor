Used this hotel as a base for 3 days after spending a night in Golders Green. Rooms were clean with usual tea/coffee etc, and they were cleaned daily and towels replaced. Freeview TV in the room, adequate space and even had hangers in the wardrobe (even if they were a mixture of all sorts!). Bathroom was clean and shower was OK although seemed to lose a bit of water pressure occasionally. Didn't eat there as we were out round town but service was good, even though reception is a little odd with a security grill pulled down most of the time. However, it is located in Stratford which is understandable, a place you don't add to the tourist itinerary (and the Olympics are really going to be here!!!!). Before they built the new Westfield shopping centre which has just opened you could get the bus straight to Stratford station to jump on the central line or DLR into town. This isn't the case now. Best option is probably to get the 25 bus to Mile End tube or take it all the way into town (Oxford Circus or Holborn terminii). However, the traffic congestion that can occur at the roundabout in Stratford means you could well be on the 25 for an hour and a half when the tube takes 20 mins. Either way the bus stop is 40 yards down the road and the 25's run regularly day and night so getting back to the hotel is no problem. Best option for eating out locally would be the Goose or the Goldengrove (Weatherspoons). Cheap and a bit of east end character due to some of the patrons!

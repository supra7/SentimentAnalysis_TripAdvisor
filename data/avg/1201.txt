We flew into Seattle and arrived after midnight. After driving up and down International Bl. one time we decided on checking in at the Doubletree. All the other lodging options seemed to have dimly lit parking lots next to seedy businesses or something. It's an ok hotel by any other standards but nice compared to what's close by.

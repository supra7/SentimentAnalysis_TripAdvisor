Hotel is in good location, though don't expect a taxi driver to find it without a phone number handy. Our front desk service was pleasant during our two night stay, with one exception: needing a 4 AM wake-up call to catch an early flight, the hotel failed to ring the room. Thankfully I set my cell phone alarm. Otherwise, the rooms are very stylish, though our room had serious issues in the bathroom, with peeling wallpaper and poor construction finish throughout, including a very leaky shower. Bit cramped, but should be fine for most travelers. Breakfast was good; dinner downstairs suffered from indifferent service and OK food for the price. I've noticed the range of reviews on here and all are probably correct--it's just the luck of the draw I imagine. A few things here and there and it would have been great; a few more and it would have been a disaster. Hope they work it out.

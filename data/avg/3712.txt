The beds would have been wonderful if they had normal sized pillow. They were oversized to the extreme you could not lay your head on one and be comfortable unless watching TV. Not any smaller ones for sleeping. Door keys were hard to use and sometimes did not work. Ice Machine was down in the only vending area (27th floor) for entire stay. We were there for company Christmas party. The party staff and layout for the area were very nice and worked out great.

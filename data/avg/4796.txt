I went to Chicago for a conference the week after Thanksgiving and was very disappointed. I was there about 5 years ago and was booked at the Palmer House but it was overbooked and I was sent to another Hilton Hotel. The lobby is gorgeous! It is so vast and beautiful I thought I was in a palace. When I went to my room I thought I was in a prison cell. I was on the 15th floor. When you went into my room you walked about 3 steps and you were at the bed. It was so close to the hall (that was noisy) that I thought I was sleeping in the hall. When you were at the end of the bed there were 2 large wooden doors. One was the bathroom. The bathroom door could not open if you had the room door open since they were so close. The bathroom was tiny. The other door opened to a closet (or a very small square box). Again tiny. Outside of the window was a fire escape that obstruted any view you might have had. I guess the real disappointment was there were none of the amenities I have grown accustomed to when I stay at a hotel. No bottled water, no coffe/tea maker. Nothing! Next conference in Chicago I will be staying at another hotel.

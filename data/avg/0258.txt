This hotel's location was fantastic. Central in terms of downtown Seattle, and two blocks from Pike Place, which is a good starting place for anybody coming to Seattle. The room itself reflects the price you pay--not fantastic, but relatively clean and comfortable. The major problems I had were that the water temperature wasn't regulated at all--I was scalded and frozen within seconds of stepping in the shower. It was also a very small shower, which was manageable, but tough to shave in. The people at the front desk are mostly fun, but the wireless is awful everywhere except the lobby. All in all, unless the you have a ton of money to spend in Seattle, the Moore is a good value, especially as you will spend very little time in the hotel anyway, Seattle is FANTASTIC!!

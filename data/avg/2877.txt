THe staff was great. However the room and hotel itself left much to be desired. THe hotel was dirty and run down. the room itself ws clean, however there were dead roaches outside the door, ceiling stuff peeling and hanging. the carpets needed to be replaced. so, while the staff was friendly and engaging, the hotel was not worth the price we paid.

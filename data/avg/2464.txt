Very helpful and friendly staff, clean rooms, super nice linen and comfortable beds. However, fans were either on/off rather than with dimmer. Location is quiet most of the time, but on Saturday night, the salon/day lounge in front of the hotel blasts its music into 2AM+. Could not sleep with windows & door closed. Asked Mgt to do something about it, and they said they would. The guy stepped out of the hotel, stood around and wandered back in without confronting the spa/day lounge club. When confronted, he made up some story about the police being called, about him talking to the club owner. I had been observing him the whole time and he did none of what he said he did. If your customer complains, then either address it and tell them how you address it, or tell them you cannot fix the problem. Don't tell them you are fixing the problem, but in reality, doing nothing about it. The music did not end until past 2AM, by which time, I fell asleep fitfully.

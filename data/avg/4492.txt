I stayed at this hotel for a work convention. The location was great. We were within walking distance to many great shops and sights. The room itself was just average and the walls were paper thin. Now the lobby had a couple of restaurants and lounges which had a very nice atmosphere. I probably wouldn't stay here again because it was so overpriced.

We've stayed here many times over the past 5 years and have always had a great experience, but this trip showed the hotel is losing it's high rating. Their attention to detail (lack of maintenance) is showing. Carpets dirty, a disgusting strong perfume stench used by housekeeping to try and cover odors in the hallways. Smoking allowed in a non-smoking hotel. Many little details are being over looked. The location and view are still the best for hotels in this area but the room and maintenance are average at best. We will try other hotels over this one in the future - at 355.00 a night I was very disappointed!

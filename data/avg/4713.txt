Fortunately we paid a fair price for this room since it was deeply discounted for our four night stay. The location is excellent, in theatre district, across from Macy's and an easy walk to the Miracle Mile and Millenium Park. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean, however there were stains on the cover of the chaise lounge. The hotel has the history of being a medical office building that was converted into a hotel. The coversion was done well and gives the small hotel a unique ambience. Each room had been a doctors office or suite (ask about the connection to Al Capote). As stated by previous reviews the rooms are small, and the bathroom lacks counter space. Small like European small. The hotel was quiet with a slight buzz of outdoor activity during the day as you'd expect in any city hotel. The bed was comfortable, and the room had a thermostate with a specific tempeture setting. The disappointments included a lukewarm shower each morning and a bad television (very dark picture on an old fashion anlog TV) which could not be seen unobstructive over your feet as you lay in bed. (I did not complain about the water tempeture thinking that it would be corrected each day). Yes they have free coffee in the lobby but for some strange reason it is removed prompty at 9 or 9:30 am, and there is no coffee in the rooms. They have a strange policy of hanging communal ladies under garments - leopard printed teddy and panties - in your closet for use by the guest. This has to be the strangest hotel perk I've ever seen. Who really needs a one size fits all teddy for a romantic tryst? The bell person assured us that it is washed after each guest (yeah, like that was my concern).

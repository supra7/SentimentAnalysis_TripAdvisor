This is a good mid-range hotel in downtown Seattle. Modern furnishings in clean rooms are a plus. Andra promotes "free valet parking" when booking best available rate thru internet or direct with hotel. Upon check-in I was advised that parking would be +$39.00 since I booked "early rate" rather than best available. I thought the early booking rate was the best available. Apparently not so. Best available rate is actually $41.00 more than early booking. Sounds like the old doublespeak "up 10%, down 10%" flim-flam sales promo. I was totally confused and told check-in agent that this web site is misleading. The desk agent did the right thing however and agreed not to charge us the $39. We would not have taken our car if this was relatively clear. Hopefully Andra will "correct" this so others do not fall into the dilemna we had. Other than that incident, I would definetely recommend this hotel.

The hotel really needs an update! But if you want to be in a central location it will work. The problem is that there are so many other nice hotels in this area. The room is dated and the bathroom is old and tiny! So many little things that are a turn off..plastic cups like in a motel, plastic shower, the ac didn't work. The bar was so worn out and the closed at 11:30pm..even though it was packed.

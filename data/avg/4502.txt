Quite simply my biggest complaint was how they charge for every extra amenity that I have gotten free at even the dumpiest hotels. OK I did get my room thru Priceline so I guess in their minds it's OK to treat me like a second class citizen. First it was the $35 parking fee per day to use the garage ! $35!!! I know this is Boston but it's not like it's in the North End. Like many guests I just went 3 blocks down on some dark and empty side street - for free at the risk of a break in. Then it was the wireless. Fine doesn't need to be free in my room but no Hotspot in the building left me a captive unless I paid $15/hr. $5 for bottled water in the room? OK all that just left be bitter.. but $2. for coffee in the morning !!! REALLY. You can't throw down some free coffee ?? Is Hyatt going under? Because all this terribly cheapness makes it feel low budget.. I left the hotel soap and shampoo... maybe they'll start changing for toilet paper next. Probably going to go somewhere with out the Hyatt name that feels less like staying with a cheap relative.

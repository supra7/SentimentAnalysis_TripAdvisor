Booked two nights at $82 through Priceline. Much cheaper than the $200+ for comparable hotels downtown. It was an easy cab ride from Sea-Tac, $43 with tip. Staff was great, but was offered the same $30 upgrade bit as mentioned in reviews below. Actually annoying as hell to hear this pitch. (Just don't accept my Priceline bid if you need to upcharge me to get a room worth a crap.) And no one should be put into the rooms closest to the street unless that is the last resort. Room was #205 and was a long walk that took me as close to the railroad tracks as possible. Trains ran pretty heavy around the 9-10 pm window, but were pretty quiet after that. Truth be told with the sliding doors closed you could not really hear much noise. (Had to keep the windows open for a while to cool off the room that was hot as blazes) Overall I would liken it to a stay in any large noisy downtown. Room was okay, and bathrooms were nicely appointed. Breakfast was a priced appropriatley for a business travelerand it was nice to eat on the water. I would not book a romantic weekend at this hotel unless I was paying full fare...the priceline room with its view of the street, and eye level to pedestrians just would not keep a good vibe. Would not recommend this if you are expecting a 4star, but it is okay for a business traveler expecting a 3 star room and looking to save a few bucks. I have heard that a lot of operaters treat Priceline referrals like crap, this is the first hotel that has proved this myth true. Poor word of mouth is from the customers getting a "deal" is just as damaging as those paying full fare. Management here should learn to NOT treat Priceline customers as second class citizens. Sticking customers next to dumpsters and train tracks when you have better rooms available for "upgrade" is bush league at best. With occupancy down you need all the goodwill you can get. Guess I'll go back to paying full fare at Hotel 1000 for the rest of my stays.

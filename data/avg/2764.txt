Stayed here in september for 4 nights, the hotel itself is quiet nice,everything is clean and modern and the free mini bar was a first for me! My big problem with this place is the location,it is on the outskirts of the city in a very run down part of town,the reason we picked this hotel was it proximity to the beach apart from that it does not have a whole lot else going for it. On more than one occasion we felt unsafe walking in this neighbourhood espeically at night ,the area seems to attract a few ladies of the night! If I was going to Barcelona again I would not stay here, I would head up to somewhere closer to port Olympic.

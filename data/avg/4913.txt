The hotel is in an excellent location (at least to me); just a very short walking distance from the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. There are a few things that I was extremely surprised by, being this hotel a 4 stars hotel. 1. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR INTERNET CONNECTION. I have been in Europe in hotels with the same star rating and they offered FREE WIRELESS HIGH SPEED INTERNET (YES "FREE" and YES "WIRELESS.) 2. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR TV; there are some uninteresting videos for free, which last a few minutes at the most, but the rest is "pay per view" and very expensive, considering the quality of entertaining offered. 3. NO COFFEE MAKER IN THE ROOM... I found it nice to make myself a cup of coffee when I am back to my hotel room from a cold street... All in all, the hotel is a perfect place to throw your baggage and go. But the amenities are far from being welcoming.

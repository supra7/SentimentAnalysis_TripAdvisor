Pulling up to the hotel, one gets the wrong impression. The outside is gray, and looks like a place that is unkept. The lobby was clean but small. The staff upon checking in was pleasant and more than helpful answering any question we came up with. The room itself was spotless, but tiny. The bathroom outdated, but very clean. We had the wrong type of room, so they immediately came up to bring us new keys and assist in moving the luggage. They recommended good restaurants, and helped us navigate the city with good directions. The staff made it a pleasant experience. We were only in town one night, so it was fine. I would not stay for a week because of the lack of space and facilities.

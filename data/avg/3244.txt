The staff are all very helpful. Victor and Patrick in particular went out of their way to help me when I arrived and in moving some boxes I'd had shipped to the hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable however there's a lot of external noise so bring ear plugs. A real grubmle is the breakfast as it's provided by a different company. It took 45 minutes to get breakfast, which whilst good food was way to long. The staff seemed more interested in looking after themselves frankly. I'd like it if they had coffee in the rooms too but overall i would stay again.

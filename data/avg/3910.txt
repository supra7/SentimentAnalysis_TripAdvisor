Stayed 10/12 - 10/15 w/ my wife and 8-year-old son. The hotel was OK but it is no luxury resort; more like a Marriott Residence Inn. That's not bad, but the property isn't as advertised. The $9.95 daily "resort fee" is a rip-off. They have a nice pool, yes, but so does every decent hotel in Florida. The "fitness center" is four old machines in a tiny room. Mattress on sleeper sofa was thin and uncomfortable. Our son climbed into bed w/ us every night. Beware of shuttle claim: there's only 1 each day at 9 a.m. and the only return from Universal is 6:30 p.m. There aren't any sheer drapes on windows, only blackout curtains. This means it's pitch black or you're completely visible at night. The "bar" was open on 1 morning during a 4-day stay. Housekeeping was lacking. Had to call for towels 2 times and maid failed to wash our dishes 1 day. Business Center is a rip-off. $0.25/min. for Internet access. every hotel I frequent offers it free. That said, for $89 it was a good value. Tip: There's a Whole Foods nearby on Turkey Lake Rd. It has a buffet and excellent groceries. Good restaurants in the same plaza.

Okay Hotel in Mong Kok We stayed at this hotel for three nights after Christmas. After exiting the Mong Kok MTR station, it took us a while to find the hotel because we got out the wrong exit. If you find the 'Langham Place' exit, it is then only a 5 minute walk to the hotel. The hotel is not in a nice area. It is by no means dangerous, just not that nice. With that being said, the hotel itself is decent. It is clean, the front desk staff were helpful and there is free internet. However, the rooms are very small. I was able to stand in the middle of the room and touch the walls. Luckily we did not have luggage. Had we had luggage, there would have been no room to put it. The location is convenient to the Mong Kok MTR, but since most of the sights are in Tsim Sha Tsui and Central, it is kind of far. It takes about 15 mins to Tsim Sha Tsui and about 25 to Central. The times aren't that long, but the subway is always packed, so it isn't that comfortable. And, after a long day of walking, it was sometimes frustrating to have to travel that much further to get back to our hotel. The MTR is very efficient and easy to use, but if I were to go to Hong Kong again, I would definitely stay in either of the two aforementioned areas. In addition, the breakfast included was okay, nothing special.The hotel is affordable, clean and close to the MTR. But, like I said, it is isn't that central to the main sights. I would recommend other travelers to stay in Tsim Sha Tsui or Central.

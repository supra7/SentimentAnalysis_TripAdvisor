We stayed at this hotel for 3 days in March. It is difficult to find being down a side alley. None of the taxi drivers we used knew where it was. You are given a large suite. The bedroom and bathroom are large, comfortable and reasonably clean. I suggest you do not look too carefully in the lounge and kitchen areas as they are not as good. Same with the small pool area on the roof. There is no shade, limited sunbeds and no bar / cafe. A bloody band aid on the floor day one was still there day three. On the first morning we went for breakfast at 0930. Everything had run out and was not replaced. The second morning we arrived earlier and the breakfast was adequate. The hotel has no bar or restaurant. The coffee shop is suposedly 24 hours, but you have to look hard to find someone. We ordered tea and they could not find a lid for a teapot, they used foil. There are a few reasonably priced "dry" cafe's nearby but if you require alcohol use the Ramada Continental a 2 minute walk away. For eating and drinking consider taking a cab to Century Village, there are an excellent selection of bars and restaurants, better value than the 5 star hotel area. I recommend the St Tropez. This hotel is convenient for the airport. If you can get it for a reasonable price, for one night, it is worth considering. The problem for me was that my tour company, Cruiseclubuk sold it to me as a Superior 4 star holiday hotel. Check my other reviews and you will see that I rarely complain. However Cruiseclubuk are quite the worst tour company I have ever used. If you are tempted to use them, please feel free to contact me.

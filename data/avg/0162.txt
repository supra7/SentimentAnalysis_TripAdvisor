We had a great room with a fabulous view and the downstairs staff was great, from valet parking to doormen to desk. And the duvets, well, you'll sleep well. But housekeeping couldn't bother to restock the simplest things, and when I asked room service to bring us some ice with a meal (my spouse was sick and I needed to ice an injured knee) the guy on the phone simply refused - this is service I've gotten at any other hotel I've stayed at. Plus internet is expensive and inconsistent, and you can't even find a room service menu unless you pay to be online. There are great things about the hotel, but I think we'll try elsewhere next visit to Seattle.

We stayed at this hotel since we had an early morning flight out of Sea-Tac. It is located in a quiet neighborhood with a park and lake across the street. There were plenty of parking spaces and its proximity to the airport is a great advantage. There were also a lot of restaurants nearby. The rooms were decorated nicely with dark woods. The beds were comfortable too. It was clean and the staff were friendly. Leaving during early breakfast hour was a madhouse and it looked like there were not enough seating areas for the number of people there. We opted for their paper bag options of breakfast to go so I can't comment on the food quality. We didn't hear any of the plane noises and had a very restful sleep. We're Hilton Honors members so we usually stay at a Hampton Inn and this was one of the better ones we have stayed at.

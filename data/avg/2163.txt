We had a room on 40th floor in Sept. 2011. The room is exceedingly large compared to, say, The Bellagio's, with sink, stove, refrig, closet, bookcase, etc. and one king bed and a pull-out sofa. The bathroom is equally large with huge shower and "john" areas. BUT, the carpets are stained...both in room and in halls. Mattress left much to be desired. It has user-unfriendly doors, i.e., each room is partioned off with another room and one has to enter two heavy doors before entering their rooms. This resulted in late-nighters slamming the doors twice when they returned to sleep. Additionally, we heard "boom-boom" music all night. Another guest? We never knew where it came from. Then we were "hit" with their $22.35 "resort fee" on check out but only used one bottle of water that falls under that category. The dining rooms are far from "friendly" in atmosphere and the lobby is just a large "cold" area. A plus might be that one can jaywalk across to the large shopping mall. For $50 more, we'd select The Bellagio any time we revisit Vegas. There you get a clean room/floor with no noise, and it's gorgeous. The Trump is a mistake we will not make twice.

I stayed there last night, it , was quite average. Frankly, I thought the courtyard Marriott in Bellevue was better. Room was small, overpriced mini bar. It was clean, but there was ABSOLUTELY nothing special about it, VERY MEDIOCRE, never saw a gold fish in my room either. Smoke alarm started beeping in my room at 2am and someone had to shut it off. So, my whole purpose for paying for a hotel... was to sleep there, was not even fulfilled. When I tried to call the front desk, their phone did not work. Also when you pull in, the valet opens the door for you... not telling you that the valet service is $40.00!!! for 1 night!!!we went and found free parking a block a way on the street. I must say, they claim to be very luxurious and have great sservice, i didnt really see any of that. And I think got allergies staying there because they allow pets in their hotel, maybe the room was not cleaned properly? The service, i found them very average, kind of aloof actually. They must have great marketing people because it was only ok for me.

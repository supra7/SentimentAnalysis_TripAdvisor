The size/ design/ shape of the hotel rooms reminds me of student accommodation (they can't help it being previously a school and then student hostel), but they have jazz it up with funky design (check out their website) . It's very clean overall, nice & quite location on it's own away from the hustle and bustle, 5-10 minutes walk to Outram Park MRT (it's very near), and very near Chinatown & Clark Quay (less than Sing$10 taxi cab ride away). We stayed at the Family Suite with sufficient space for 4 adults to move around, sufficient storage for suitcases & clothes, and they have 42 Inch LCD TV & DVD player in the room. Nice bright clean bathroom with a bathtub and L'Occitane shower gel/ shampoo (I heard only for more expensive rooms). Staff were helpful, there was something wrong with the light and they came to fix it right away when called. Also when asked for small things like to reset safe/ extra towels etc, no fuss. The price is a bit high for such a hotel, kept me wondering if staying at Studio M would be better (it's about 10 minutes walk away), as this hotel has no pool and not as posh for the price.

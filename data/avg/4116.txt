This hotel is nothing to write home about. The rooms were pretty average for a higher-end hotel, although the beds were very comfortable. The service was okay. The water in the bathtub did not drain. They did send someone at midnight to repair it and everything was better in the morning. The location is good. There's a lot to do right there. Plus, it is only steps away from the Blue line which you can take to the airport, only 2 stops away.

First vacation for my family in 2 yrs. Continous problems since arrival. Most of the staffs ok not outstanding or friendly. They are more like machine " Yes sir, No Sir and so on. I booked a Deluxe Ocean Front room but ended up on the Deluxe Trees between Ocean Front roon at level 14 which is the lowest level. of course other rooms are not available because all the deluxe ocean front room are sold out for the entire week i was there hahaha. Not a great view from this room found 2 roaches dead one on the floor and the other just a piece of leg on the table. Amazing to find some of the staff border line rude. On the positive side the pools are outstanding the lobby and the first floor areas are outstanding and cleans. I love the in house Macys Department store. The staffs fail to make this a true 5 stars hotel from the front desk, buffet breakfast staffs, poolside bar servers, housekeeping and concierge services. Our First time using Hyatt hotel this time my wife is right, i should have just stay loyal to the Starwood Brand.

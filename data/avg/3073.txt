I booked a "superior single room with see view" in this hotel through the site "hotels .ca" for two nights. When I arrived there from Canada they said that they had not had any reservation under my name and they could give me only a normal single room but not "superior single room with see view" for which I had paid $50CAD extra. Fortunately, On the check out time they had got the reservation information and I did not have to pay twice. They told me that they would do the arrangements with the agency I had used to do the reservation to refund the extra money I had paid for "see view room". But any effort form the hotels.ca customer service to get the refund from the hotel was useless and the hotel refused to return my $50CAD. Unbelievable that they risk they reputation for $50 CAD.

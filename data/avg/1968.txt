The raving reviews of the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel make me think they were either written by the owners or by tourists who don't know any better. We stayed there 1/12/05. The hotel is marginal at best. The carpets have a horrendous smell. Really. It almost smells as if someone who has not had a bath for a week or two is standing next to you when you walk out into the hallways of the hotel. Yes, the grounds are pretty, but how many of those who have stayed there actually spend any good beach time there? The surf is way too rough for kids, there are signs all over the place warning the guests about the surf. Trust me, there are lovely places to stay on Maui that are A) Cheaper, B) Have a better beach, and C) Are not rediculous tourist traps. We will never be back.

If I hadn't gotten the room way below listed price I would probably be requesting some form of refund. The first night was miserable. The AC wouldn't stay on and the room was sweltering. I had to get up turn it off wait a bit then turn it back on for it to work. Then repeat every 30 minutes. They did seem to fix it for the second night, but it wasn't cold enough for my liking. The rooms were decent, smelled very strong of cleaner, I couldn't help but wonder if they were covering something up with the cleaner smell? Pool wasn't opened yet, but that was due to still being early spring. But they did have a decent hot tub, but it had a lot of dead bugs floating around and dirt in the seats. The free "high-speed" internet wasn't very high-speed, either. I guess I might be picky though when I am putting out money for a hotel. I didn't specifically choose this hotel, I booked it through hotwire, where you don't get to choose your hotel just the star rating.

This hotel is located at a quiet area except for the construction activities during our stay. Luckily, I have my putty ear plugs which blocked out all the early morning noises. The beds need new mattresses. Bathroom is large and very comfortable after just having stayed at a hotel in Amsterdam with a bathroom about 1/10th the size of the bathroom at Best Western Hotel am Spittelmarkt. Location is not ideal for sight seeing as one has to take the U-Bahn to reach to most sights, and that too, you need to change trains. The cleaner enters your room every morning at 10AM without knocking or at least saying "Room Service!" first before simply unlocking the door and walks freely into your room. So, don't forget to put the "Do Not Disturb" sign as we kept forgetting to do this. Taxi from TXL to hotel is approximately EUR21-23 which is very reasonable if there are three or more of you as it takes half the time compared to the bus services to Alexanderplatz.

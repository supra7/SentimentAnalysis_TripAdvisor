Reserved through 1800hotels, got a good rate, and probably a larger room than we had actually paid for -- birthday trip. After that, the watchword was "Their hand in your pocket, constantly." Had we been eating at their Oak room [very pricey] from outside, the in-advance coat check was $2. Internet was $13.95/day. The mini-bar and a snacks tray were well stocked, with anticipated prices, PLUS tax, PLUS a 10% restocking charge. The feeling everywhere was that the welcome was extended to one's wallet. For a hotel in a chain with world-wide presence, the over-all feeling was not world-class. Not a big thing, but decor seemed more nouveau riche than elegant or classic. Overall, far more pleased with the Mandarin in Kuala Lumpur, and the Jefferson in Richmond. Would not go back to Copley Plaza.

This hotel is in a wonderful location - near Millenium Park and the wonderful Cloud Gate Sculpture. The rooms are smallish but comfortable and the staff genuinely helpful and friendly. My only complaint is that - like other high end hotels - they nickel and dime you with fees for things that less expensive hotels give away for free, such as Internet access. Some higher end hotels offer free wi-fi in the lobby, but not the Palmer House. Use of their busines center will cost you, too. They even charge to the use the gym. As someone who travels regularly for business, I rely on hotel gyms to stay fit. For this gym fee alone, I wouldn't stay at this hotel or recommend it to others who want to stay healthy while traveling.

I think this hotel is the best place for value for money. You have complete peace with walking distance from the market. Even though the hotel is small, it is good for those who stay for short time say one to 2 days. You have manu restaurants for food nearby areas with a lot of variety and hence no food in the hotel makes very less difference. Good hotel for budget travellers.

We stayed at this hotel based on the price and proximity to Safeco Field. The hotel had multiple issues that I wouldn't have expected for something that is advertised as "luxury and boutique". The room was very small, 2 full beds (not queen), no table, no chair, basically nowhere to set your things. The bathroom was the same. The single 6" wide shelf was over the toilet, so you really didn't want to set personal hygiene items there. None of the vending machines worked, leaving you to have to walk 8 blocks to get something to drink at night. The air conditioner couldn't keep up. The tub didn't drain properly, leaving you standing in 6" of water. On the converse, the front desk and valet staff were VERY nice. Unfortunately, they have to deal with the lack of concern that management must have about the property. I would probably not stay here again.

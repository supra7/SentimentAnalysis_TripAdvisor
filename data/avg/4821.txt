I stayed at the Palmer House during the Lollapalooza Music Festival weekend. The hotel is extremely close to the new Lolla main entrance and substantially less expensive than the Hilton that faces Grant Park. The CTA lines are also very close to the hotel. To the hotel's credit, the check in line was huge, and they passed out free champagne and bottled water to make the one hour wait pass more smoothly. The hotel lobby is gorgeous and will remind you of a different era in Chicago's history. People compare this hotel to NYC's Waldorf, but I would say that is a major exaggeration. Now the negatives. The rooms are very outdated. The dining options on the lower retail level of the hotel are poor quality. But most shockingly, the charges for extras (internet, parking, gym, etc) are outrageously high. I travel a lot and don't usually get sticker shock, but I actually thought they had mistakenly added an extra day to my bill when I saw it. One suggestion for Lolla travelers, if you're leaving town Sunday night after the final performances, you can buy a one-day pass to the gym and spa, check out of the hotel, check your bags at the bell desk, go to the final day at Lolla in Grant Park, come back and shower at the gym, and pick up your bags before heading out of town.

We were going to attend a charity event downtown (We live in Seattle), so we thought we would get a hotel just to be able to stay downtown. We got our room off Priceline for a good price $85 for a 4 star. The problem is I would not classify this hotel (at least our room) as 4 star. There were stains on the carpet, The bathroom lights were covered in dust, the furniture was the type of furniture you would find at a Days Inn. We opened our drawers to put our clothes away and the previous guest had left food in there that was not cleaned out. When we checked out the hotel was paid for by Priceline, but they went ahead and charged my card anyway and I had to have them correct it. They don't have wireless internet and the internet in the room was super slow. Overall it was fine because we got the room for cheap and the location is great, but I wouldn't stay here if you are really expecting a nice room.

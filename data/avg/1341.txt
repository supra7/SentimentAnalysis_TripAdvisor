We had no problems with out stay. The room was clean, and in good working order. It wasn't anything fancy, but fine for an airport stay. The free breakfast was OK--there was cereal, pastries, fruit, hard-boiled egss, and a few other things. The shuttle to the airport was great. It was on-time and the driver was friendly. The staff were all polite. There was really nothing wrong with this place. If I had to come up with a complaint, it would be the hollow walls.

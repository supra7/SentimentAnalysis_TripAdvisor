Stayed one night at this location with Mariott points. Would have been highly disappointed if paying cash as the rates are very high. Room was average sized with nice bedding and bathroom that was clean. However, the rest of the hotel needs an overhaul. The windows were difficult to look out from (not sure if they needed to be cleaned or if the seals were broken) and the communal areas looked tired and dated. Pool area was dark and overly chlorinated. Disappointed that breakfast was buffet only without the option of ordering from a menu or ala carte. Location was great. If going to the airport from here take the water taxi. Made for a fun experience.

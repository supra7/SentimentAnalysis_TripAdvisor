We have just checked in last night being here on our honeymoon, and at the time of booking we requested a balcony with a marina view. We have instead been given a balcony directly over a busy main road. We asked last night if we could change to a quieter room with a marina view and were told to phone this morning and they will change us. This morning we have now been told that all of their standard studio rooms overlook the road! We were extremely disappointed as the website would lead you to believe that you get marina views! We are also disappointed that we have had mixed messages from the staff. The hotel is clean and comfortable and in a good location but we would not have chosen this hotel for our honeymoon if we'd have known how noisy the rooms were going to be!

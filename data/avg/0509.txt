As many reviewers said, the hotel is centrally located, close to every tourist attraction. My husband and I enjoyed the environment very much---fresh fruit from the Pike Place Market, wonderful French cuisine at the Champaign Cafe, and all the department stores and book stores. But the hotel is a bit disappointing. The restroom looks old. Only glasses are provided in the room, no decent cups for tea or coffee. In other words, it is more like a cheap hotel than a 5-star one. I think it's such a pity. If the management works harder and attends to details, this hotel can be easily a great one.

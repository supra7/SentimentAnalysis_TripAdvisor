For the price, I was pretty impressed with the hotel, service, spa, food, and rooms. The beds are heavenly. A lot (though not all) of the food is downright good (the grill, Mexican, and Italian restaurants). They're doing nearly everything right, but here's the thing... the beach is just not nice. I know that doesn't seem like that big of a deal. You're still at a gorgeous resort and there's an absolutely lovely pool, not to mention the fact that you'll also be swimming in unlimited margaritas. But my husband and I have stayed in Playa del Carmen before and now I realize that the insanely, unreasonably beautiful water is the main draw for us. We walked down 5 or so resorts and you're not just a few beaches away from something nice, although it gets nicer the farther away you get from HTR. I would recommend making it a shorter trip or taking a half-step down in hotel quality in order to stay at a hotel on a great beach. The nice beaches in Playa del Carmen are among the best in the world. If you can't? You'll probably enjoy the resort, but avert your eyes from the beach while you're downtown or you'll be heartbroken.

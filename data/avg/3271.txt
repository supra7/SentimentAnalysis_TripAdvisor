The outside of the hotel was not much to speak of. We were very skeptical on arrival. The entry and what little there was of a lobby was new although not impressive. The employees were nice and polite. They always had a nice bowl of fruit on the counter which was a good snack. As we entered the elevator and went to our room we were not certain if we had entered maybe a space ship. It was very modern, grey, black and dark with blue lights. The room was neat and clean but dark, grey, black and sparse. There was a computer in the room and a flat screen TV. There was no mirror except a small one over the sink in the bathroom. The hot water was on a timer so in needing to get up at 6am the water was cold. Although the shower was excellent. The room was rather dark and depressing and had blue lights over the bed. The location was perfect in the old town area. Right across from the Market and Mayor Plaza with a close walk to Puerto del Sol. There was even a grocery store for snacks and drinks only a half block away. The breakfast was good but expensive. This property might appeal to men but not especially to ladies.

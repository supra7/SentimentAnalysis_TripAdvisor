I stayed at the Atlas for 2 nights and found it good value for money. I got there by car, and my Garmin gps wanted me to drive down the stairs from the Rambla to the hotel which you obviously can't do so I ended up parking in the underground parking at the Placa Catalunya at the end of the Rambla and bringing my luggage to the hotel from there. When I got there the WiFi wireless internet was down, and as it turned out it was down all the stay which was a major setback for me, as I partly chose the hotel for having WiFi. I got the room on 4.th floor (5th floor by American calculation) facing the street in front of the hotel, room 404. The photos are of that room. The location is amazing! Right next to the Rambla, just across from the Rambla is the Boqueria market and the Liceu subway station is right between on the Rambla. Tip: When shopping in the Boqueria, never buy from the stalls in the center walkway, you get considerably cheaper prices by going right or left a couple of aisles. I booked it without breakfast as I rarely get up in time for it so I can't talk about it, but you really don't want to get your breakfast there in any case, go into the narrow streets of the old Barcelona away from the Rambla and pick a little place there to have your breakfast, tapas and whatnot. All in all, if you can get a room at a decent price then it's a good choice for exploring Old Barcelona and the Ramblas area.

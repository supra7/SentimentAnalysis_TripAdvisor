Pros: large rooms; comfortable bed; large meeting spaces, lobby, and bar; free outside parking; six elevators and one was always available; close to galleria and good food. Cons: hotel showing a little age; expensive internet; free parking sometimes limited; location a little difficult to get in and out of. Overall, this is a fine hotel but nothing outstanding. We would stay here again without complaint, but I wouldn't pay top dollar for it.

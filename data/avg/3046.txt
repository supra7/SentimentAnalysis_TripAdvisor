The hotel and rooms including bathroom were very clean and nice, and a reasonable size for a city like Rome. Even in February the room stayed warm. Only complaints in room would be the small TV. The breakfast was more three stars than four. Fresh baked goods but no fresh fruit or vegetables or even proper juice! I might stay in this hotel as the location was very convenient and the smaller street quiet (Rome standard).

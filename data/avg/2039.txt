Copthorne Deira is in a good location, 150-200m from the nearest metro station, and Deira City Center Mall. It is also fairly close to the airport so just a short cab ride or metro ride, if you know the area. The bed was comfortable and clean, tea and coffee making facilities were provided and the TV had a decent range of channels. The room was very small - fine for a solo traveller, but the twin beds were so close together they were almost joining, so not really big enough for 2 adult friends to share a room. The room / bathroom was clean but not spotless. I found hairs on the wall in the bathroom, stains on the table etc. The room was a little run down and could do with an overhaul. I didn't use the facilities, but I noticed there are separate timings for men and women to use the swimming pool. I didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food and beverage. In my opinion this is a fine hotel if you are in Dubai for a few nights and need somewhere simple and comfortable to stay that doesn't cost the earth.

I have been to this location before children a number of times. However, did not realize how unsafe the inner balcony design was until my 22 months old son tried to climb. We almost lost him, I just turned around for 2 seconds to open the hotel door when I saw him half way up on the balcony. There is no safety measure built under, so it's a straight drop to a few floor down. It was a scary experience. Tried to write and talk to someone in the hotel regarding this matter but no one seemed to notice or care. Also, there were a lot of drunken people being very loud outside the corridor in the middle of the night.

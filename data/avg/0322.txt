If you need to stay in Seattle downtown for couple of night and your travel funds is limited - you can try to choose this one. However, beware of some specific points you will face: 1. If you don't mind dust everywhere including bathroom shelves - stay here; 2. If you don't mind brick wall in 10 ft distance from your window - stay here; 3. If you dont mind paper walls and enjoy listening your neighbors - stay here. However, the staff is extremely friendly. I suppose, they have to be friendly in any hotel, haven't they?

This hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the Berlin Hauptbahnhof and less than a 5 minute walk from Naturkundemuseum, which is the nearest station on the U6 line. By the time we arrived it was late and it was a bit harder to find this place as it is not a hotel on its own, but instead shares the building with other places and you have to ring the buzzer and then go to the reception on the S5 floor (the entry is a bit eerie in the dark). I believe the room we got was one of the larger rooms which had floor to ceiling entry doors and windows, so obviously the room was quite spacious and a good size. The overall impression though is that this is probably a bit more of a hostel than a hotel. The room has a small TV, towels, firm beds and in-built body wash dispensers. There was no tea or coffee making facilities and no phone to contact reception. Overall though the room was clean and provided the bare essentials. Our TV did not work at all when we arrived and the receptionist was very quick to resolve the problem. Free wifi is available throughout the building and you just need to get the login codes from reception. Location of this hotel is a bit further out of the city, but still ok. You can walk into the main city area in 20-30 minutes or train it in which is fairly easy. There are 2 small supermarkets about a 5 minute walk away (they close at 8pm), Subway and some other food places as well a bit further down the street (Chausseestrae). We didnt pay for the hotel breakfast as I didnt think it would be worth the 7EU each and we just got stuff from the supermarket instead.

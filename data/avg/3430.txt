We were on transit and the hotel was incredibly convenient especially as we had an early morning flight from Terminal 3. The room was comfortable and clean. The only issue was with the staff at reception. Having grown accustomed to Singaporean efficiency, it was a little disappointing that they kept insisting we did not have breakfast included in the room. We had prepaid for both the room and breakfast and ended up having to raise this on 3 separate occasions with different staff. It was clearly stated in our hotel voucher that breakfast was included. We've had better service at fast food joints. Thankfully, when they attempted to charge us for breakfast on check out, the manager happened to be close by and intervened. Apart from hassles with reception staff, the stay was pleasant and restful. The concierge was helpful with our bags and even transferred them onto an airport trolley.

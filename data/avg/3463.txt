This hotel is all round OK, if i had paid full price i would have been Extremely annoyed!!!! however having paid a reduced rate for a supposed suite ( or what i would call a very very average room) it wasn't bad value, but it was a good 25 minute walk into the centre, this isn't a problem though the walk is quite nice and the boats are very frequent and run until late. The hotel staff were a mixed bunch there were some that were extremely rude and unhelpful and a couple that were pleasant and quite friendly. The restaurant was weird! no music at dinner or breakfast! very odd and only one member of staff who i had to ask to come and serve us, the hotel overall had no charm or character and wasn't really that modern but you will be out that much during the day that it is ok really nothing major to moan about really. Bar wise i can highly recommend Central Bar!!! and we also enjoyed Bacaro Jazz both really lovely fun bars in a city which proves difficult to find nightlife this tip could be valuable! Had a great time here! Murano island is lovely and the Peggy Guigenhiem was really good as some extras after you have done the main tourist attractions which are really worth seeing!

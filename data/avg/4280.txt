Nice hotel, probably really nice at one point, but a little old now. Very elegant lobby. The rooms are a little small and old fashioned. We stayed in January and the room was FREEZING, the heat did not work well. I was impressed, for a smoking room, it was clean. Lots of restaurants in and near the hotel. Room service very expensive

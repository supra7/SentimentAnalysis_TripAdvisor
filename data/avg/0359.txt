We recently stayed at the hotel for a two day getaway and were quite happy with the place. The room was small but clean and had updated decor. We did not have a chance to eat at the restaurant, but it was trendy & the menu looked quite good. The hotel has a fantastic location, especially since we were doing the tourist thing, and walked all over the downtown area. It was 10 minutes to Pike Place market, the monorail, and to Pioneer Square (lots of street people). Since it's an old building the room was a little noisy during the night (doors slamming, pipes running, etc.) so if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs. The internet in the lobby was spotty and quite slow, so don't expect to do any work there. Service was very good & we liked that Seattle's Best coffee shop was just off the lobby.

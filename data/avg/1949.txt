We stayed at the KBH for 9 nights starting 2/20/07. We paid extra for an ocean front room and it was worth every penny. The view was outstanding from our floor (the 5th). Sometimes we just wanted to go nowhere/sit on our balcony. The furnishings were average but clean. We did kill a bug in the bathroom the first day but none after that so that was not too bad. Breakfast that was included not very good so next time we would probably book a package that did not include the breakfast. Champagne brunch on Sunday was worth the price - we were full the rest of the day. Next time we stay here we will most likely not rent a car. We did the Old Lahaina Luau (worth it do this once-need to book months ahead). We did the Road to Hana (a waste of a beautiful day) so the only other thing we would need a car for when we go back is to go up to the top of Crater. You can take a bus for $1 each way to Lahaina. The only problem is the last bus comes back around 8:00 p.m. We spent a lot of time on the beautiful beach in front of the hotel and when it was time to dinner went a couple of times to the Hula Grill and a couple of times to Leilani's on the Beach. If you eat on the outside patio the food is reasonable and the view of the sunset is outstanding. Also ate at Ruth Chris Steak House in Lahaina - excellent food and prices about the same as the mainland. Cheeseburger in Paradise was fun, but the food there was average. We did a timeshare presentation at 8:30 a.m. one morning. It was worth the 1 hour time. We got a "buy one, get one free" whale watching cruise (the Safari boat-excellent) and $29 for me and my husband to take a sunset dinner cruise (awful). We look forward to staying at the KBH again. Aloha!

The hotel itself, like Boston, is full of historic details. The lobby is lovely, with a feeling of grandeur. The staff were fine, but not overly helpful. The queen room was small, with not much space to put suitcases, or anything else. The bathroom was decent in size, but not much room to put toiletries. The shower was older, with the showerhead loose from the wall. Although one wants the "historic" feel, it just feels old overall, making it not quite comfortable. Pros: - convenient location near the Prudential Center, and Newbury Street, Boston Public Library - 2 blocks from the Back Bay station - duvet covers...no icky bed spreads! Cons: - no free wifi - small rooms - old feeling..."historic"? (thus, not feeling completely clean) I probably will choose a different hotel with more modern amenities the next time I come to Boston

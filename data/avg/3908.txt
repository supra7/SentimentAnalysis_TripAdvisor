We stayed for 7 days. Rooms were beautiful and clean bathroom, full kitchen, living room, bedroom felt small. *** BEWARE OF EXTRA HOTEL FEE'S!!! *** SERVICE IS NOT GOOD!! ** Guest services is only 1 person at a time and most of the time they are not sure what they are doing. Upon our arrival, I noticed that our linens in our bedroom had some strains of hairs which is not mine, because we didn't use it yet nor did we sat on the bed yet... the color is darker than my brunette hair. I asked guest services to changed my linen and they said ****"CHANGE LINEN IS EXTRA CHARGE!!!!*** ***POOR SERVICE***This is just crazy! I finally looked through the closets and found a bedsheet and changed it myself. Toilet ran out, when we returned.. was not replace. we had to look through the cabinets to find 1 toilet paper. they don't replenish it for you. (IS CHANGING TOILET EXTRA COST TO!!???) Hotel includes free parking, high-speed internet (not wi-fi, only accessible in living room), Refresh service - replacing towels daily, removing trash and making beds only. ALL THIS IS $9.99 which is hotel fee as an extra cost which is automatically put in your bill. So this is basically is ***NOT FREE*** but is charged to you. For other Full Maid Cleaning: (optional) vacuum, change linens and do normal hotel stuff but here they charge you for it!!! Junior/Studio Suite $10 per day One Bedroom Suite $15 per day Two Bedroom Stuie $25 per day This hotel has the potential to be 4 star but its " 3 STAR *.. With this beautiful hotel its a shame. It had sooo much potential. But with their POOOR SERVICE, EXTRA SERVICE CHARGES! they will continue to be 3 star. Not really a resort, more like renting a condo or an apartment. I would suggest this to my friends, but be very very careful and DON'T EXPECT ANY SERVICE OR HELP FROM GUEST SERVICES!! NO SAFE IN THE ROOM! LOCK EVERYTHING!!!! For the price, its better if you rent a house with a pool!!! They have a lot in florida that's a compound of house rentals with pool. Same price as this and also not much service. So better that than this! or CHECK OUT HILTON... One good thing is that "hotel is clean"!!! POOR SERVICE! ... SERVICE IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT IN HAVING A HOTEL AND ITS THE ONE THING PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER!!! .. HOW YOU TREAT YOUR GUEST!!!... though I complained about small little things.. but small things add up and its what stays with me.

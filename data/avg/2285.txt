There is nothing here that could qualify this place as a resort or justify the $25/night resort fee but overall this place was nice. The rooms are secluded and the busy traffic on the street is quieted by the well landscaped grounds. Parrot Key is located a little too far from Duvall Street and many of the islands activities, but if you prefer to stay away from the hustle and bustle, this place is a good bet. The hotel is located by the water but beach access is nill- the "beach" is actually sand seperated from the water by hedges.

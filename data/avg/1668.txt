My husband and I stayed at the Hilton San Diego Bay front for 1 night over the Labor Day Weekend. The hotel is beautiful and the location is fabulous. We arrived around noon and self-parking was a breeze. I did not think $27.00 was unreasonable, being that you had access to many different places. Check in was also a breeze and Ashley who checked us in was very helpful and professional. The room was clean and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was delicious. I was especially looking forward to relaxing by lying by the pool,listening to my ipod and reading my book. The pool is very nice and I loved the temperature in the jacuzzi (not too hot). I noticed when checking in that they would be having a DJ at the pool from 1-4. Sounded like a lot of fun. I love music and dancing but , YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! The music was so loud I could not even carry on a conversation with my husband sitting right next to me. I realize that you were trying to provide a party atmosphere but when you have many families with small children at the pool that decibel of music is not appropriate even if it's Disney Music being played. Why did it have to be so loud for 3 hours? I finally left with a pounding headache. I couldn't even read my book and when I tried to listen to my ipod I could barely hear it over the music. Would have been a perfect stay sans the pool situation.

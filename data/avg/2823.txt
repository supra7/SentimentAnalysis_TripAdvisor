Room was small for 2 people, but was clean and tidy. Hotel is close to tram line and in a nice area of town. We were staying on the top floor and the wifi reception was not very good up there, kept cutting out. Overall enjoyed staying here though. Reception was helpful, I asked if there was an internet cafe nearby as I needed to print a document and they offered to print it for me which was nice. Hotel has a vending machine for drinks

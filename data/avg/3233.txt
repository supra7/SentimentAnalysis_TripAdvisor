Upon arrival at the hotel, Jacqueline was the front desk attendant, was extremely helpful. I had cancelled my reservation due to sharing a room with a friend. However, I ended up needing the room. Jacqueline was able to reinstate my room. She was extremely patient and understanding. This sounds like the description of her job but there were other circumstances that required me to need my original reservation. She was able to defocus and defuse a potential hostile situation. This resulted into an enjoyable weekend. I also received excellent service from housing. Berrita was the housekeeper supervisor overheard me talking to another quest about my lost toiletry bag and before I could even ask for the items she had them placed in my room. I have never received this type of treatment at a hotel before. My sister works for the Marriott hotel company and I receive room rates at an employee rate and have never received this excellent treatment. I will never stay at any other hotel will in Chicago.

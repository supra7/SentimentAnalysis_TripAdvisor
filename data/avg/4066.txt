This is pretty much your basic hotel room for downtown Boston. The reason I chose it was for the location and ease of parking being in the city, garage is attetched. The room was well maintained, clean and we had a great view of the Prudential with it's Christmas lights and south from the 32nd floor. The buildng part of an inddor mall which was great considering that it averaged 25 degrees while there. The mall was the best way to find free internet connections, since the hotel charged $12/day, and it offered a great variety of fast food and decent restaurants along wiht climate conmtrolled shopping. The hotel was also a short walk to a T station, Boston Common and Public Gardens, Symphony Hall and many other historic landmarks and sites. The only negatives were that the bathroom lights were not very bright, the room was very diffucult to fit in the rollaway that we needed, the mattress was not the new Marriott pillow top that we expected and the concierge was not knowledgable as to what would be open to eat on both Christmas eve and day. The location did outweigh the negatives so I would stay again for just one night or two.

I stayed here last week in a recently renovated studio unit. Good value for the money. My main complaint would be with the staff. They were not very pleasant at the front desk. The first night we were there, a huge cockroach came out in the kitchen. When we called the front desk just asking for bug spray, they told me the location of the nearest store and said that I might be seeing more so get used to the bugs. One of the pools was a pleasant temperature, while the other two weren't heated. Unfortunately there isn't a spa on site. When I booked the room there was no parking charges, but the by the time we arrived we were charged. When we mentioned the previous parking, they just shook their heads and said that we could park offsite someplace and walk a mile. Other than these mild inconveniences, the location is great. Enjoyed my stay for the great price that we got.

We honeymooned in Barcelona 13 years ago and were excited to show our 11 year-old daughter the city that we love. After traveling over 20 hours to get here from Bangkok, we arrived tired, but happy and were initially very pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel and our clean and spacious room. At check-in, however, we were surprised at the 37 Euro cost of the extra bed. The bed is a narrow and short single that folds out from a low chair. Sergey, at the front desk showed us an e-mail the hotel had sent us 5 days before our arrival, even though we had booked the room almost 2 months before. When I checked our booking, I noticed that the hotel was offering our same room with free breakfast (not included in our booking). The slightly higher than expected bed cost was a small matter that I thought could easily be resolved by offering us the free breakfast, but when I proposed this to the front desk, Sergey basically told me to get lost. Upon my request, he said he would contact management of the hotel. We had dinner and went to bed exhausted. What happened next was a surprise. We were woken in the middle of the night by the night clerk and he insisted that we tell him then and now whether we wanted the bed for the remainder of our stay. I don't know if the staff had contacted management or decided to do this on their own, but there certainly wasn't any need to do this in the middle of the night. We were unable to go to back to sleep and that is why I'm writing this review now. I think this treatment by the staff mars an otherwise nice hotel and would keep me from recommending this hotel or returning in the future.

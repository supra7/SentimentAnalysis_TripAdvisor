This was a decent, quiet little hotel. Given that it was one of the cheapest we could find in the city, I should be giving it a much higher rating. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning decent (this was important given the heat wave we encountered). It is conveniently located a short walk from downtown. Athough as has been mentioned there's an incredibly steep hill you'll have to climb if you want to walk back. Okay neighbourhood, we never felt insecure about walking around at night. The staff were very friendly upon arrival and were able to give us information on local events and attractions. We only spent one night here and didn't try the restaurant. The rest of our stay in Seattle we rented a small studio/cottage on Bainbridge Island for only $150/night (highly recommended as the prices are cheaper than in Seattle and it's only a 30 min, $6 return ferry ride right downtown)

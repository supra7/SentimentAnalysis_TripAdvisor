The Hyatt Maui was generally pleasant  the hotel was clean and the staff were courteous. However, we were underwhelmed on arrival, after assuming it would be a luxurious honeymoon destination. It wasnt  it was average. The hotel needs a bit of a revamp; it looks seriously 70s with the avocado paint everywhere! Our room was supposed to be non-smoking, but had a strong cigarette whiff. The pool area was very nice, as was the beach front and garden areas. The prices for everything in the hotel were inflated - you're paying London prices for a beer, for example. The biggest annoyance was the 'mandatory supplemental charge' of $15 a day for things like tea and coffee in your room, a daily newspaper and use of the tennis courts. I couldn't find any reference to this charge in the small print, and frankly I would have assumed it to be included, or at the least certainly NOT mandatory! Also, we were charged $20 a day for valet parking  but after pointing out that we didn't have a car this was removed from our bill. Overall, I wouldnt have bothered paying the extra for the Hyatt. If Id have known I would have booked into the Kaanapali Beach Resort a bit further down the road.

We stayed here for the second time, with two children (aged 7 and 10) - one slept in the bed with us, the other on the sofa. Lovely room, and you can't beat the convenience. However, it is expensive, and the staff were not at all helpful when we were trying to locate a lost item. They also haven't accredited out priority points, and we are still trying to achieve this.

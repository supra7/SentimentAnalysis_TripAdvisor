The rooms were really nice but the location is horrible. You have to take a subway (underground, train) at least 8 stops to get to actual Rome. Although the rooms looked rather nice, there was a strong smell of cigarettes in the bathroom all three rooms which we booked and at night it was strikingly hot. Hot enough we didn't feel comfortable at all. The internet is not wi-fi, its a computer in the lobby free to use, but usually busy. Really, if you want to see central Rome, it's better to stay much closer than here. The rooms were pretty nice looking, nice tile flooring, flat screen TVs. However the "double bed" is really just 2 twins pushed together, which is rather annoying. As for the breakfast it's a strictly Italian breakfast, just toast, butter, croissants, and juice. I really don't recommend this hotel for families as the location is a bit scary at night, particularly walking from the subway to the hotel (which has large gates surrounding it and security cameras everywhere.

I like the hotel itself. It is very clean, comfortable, and has a very helpful staff. The restaurant (Bertucci's) is quite good and reasonably priced for this part of Istanbul. The only bad thing to say about the hotel itself is that the room can be too warm (I stayed in March). However, the hotel is in the Taksim district which is full of bars and restaurants. This makes the evenings noisy in the rooms. Add that to all that Taksim is infamous for, and you get a place that is not for those seeking tranquility.

Before you book- Napili tower is smoking and Lahaina tower is non smoking. We were booked in the Napili tower by mistake - I should"ve known because when we got in the elevators, the smell was of vomit, smoke and dirty feet- disgusting- when we got to our room it stunk of smoke. The staff graciously moved us to the Lahaina tower where we had a lovely 5 days. Bathrooms need an upgrade- tub drained very slowly, water pressure poor. Be aware- the little tray of goodies is on a 8 second delay- so if you pick one up you will be charged for the item- ( $3 for M/M's). One place to eat bfast- very pricey- go venture out for a cheaper bfast. Staff was nice- lots of aloha.

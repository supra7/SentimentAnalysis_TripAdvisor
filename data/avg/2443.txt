Stayed there one night while on a college trip with my son. The lobby reminded me of a nursing home. The staff was friendly. For the other single night stays of our trip we stayed in Hampton Inns. Because I read some good reviews of this hotel, I thought I'd try a Fairfield Inn just for variety. Not a good idea. All the beds in the Hampton Inns we stayed at were very comfortable. Here, the bed was too soft and hurt my back, and the sheets were thin: the kind that don't stay put on the mattress very well and never feel clean. Also in the Fairfield Inn there was no place to hang anything. For a budget chain the Hampton Inns were always comfortable, and seemed consistent. I was not comfortable here and when I saw the Hampton Inn next door from our window, I wished I was there. Luckily we were only here one night.

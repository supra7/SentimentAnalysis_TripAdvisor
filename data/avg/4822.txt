Nice historic hotel, but given lack of in room WiFi it is not the place to stay if you are traveling on business or have an iPad. You can get WiFi in the Lobby but even there you have to pay for it. Given the room rate internet access should be free. In addition, the TV was too small and the reception was poor. Rooms are clean, the beds are ok and the staff is friendly, but there are much better places to stay in Chicago, especially at this price.

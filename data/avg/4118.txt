Stayed here for 2 nights. Paid extra to stay on the concierge level and was sorely disappointed. Hoped to avoid the usual 'cattle call' of continental breakfast at other hotels but this was actually worse. Concierge room was way too small for the amount of people who had access (which I think was half of the hotel- people were coming from other floors) and the offerings were meager. On both mornings the coffee urn was empty (although it was refilled promptly after asking) and there were not enough seats. The room was adequate and clean and did have a very nice view. The location is great for sightseeing. I probably would noot choose to stay here again though because the general vibe was a bit too crowded and hectic. Didn't feel as though I were staying in the level of hotel I was paying the price for!

The CONS are you can only fit one person at a time in the bathroom, they are so small.The AC was not in proper working order,we had it at the coldest temp.but it was still hot in the room.The lobby and hallways to the rooms had a musty,molding smell.The hotel employees didnt go out of their way to help you. The PROS the king bed was very comfortable.The location of the hotel was perfect for our Memorial day wk-end. The Public Garden was a block away the "T" to catch a game @ Fenway Park was a short distance away ($4.00 ride R/T to park) and lunch @ Cheers bar was across from park. Overall, our 1st visit to Boston was pleasant. I dont think I would stay at this hotel again - the Radisson or Sheration were in same area so I might give them a try.

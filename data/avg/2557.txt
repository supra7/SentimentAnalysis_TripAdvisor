I stayed for one night in this hotel with my disabled mum - her wheelchair access room was in the basement to the rear of the hotel; I requested my room to also be at the rear after reading reviews about traffic noise on this site. Both rooms were perfectly fine and traffic noise wasn't a problem at the back of the hotel - it is a no-frills hotel, so take your own shampoo and hairdryer, but the cheapness of the hotel should easily offset that inconvenience. The breakfast buffet was great - loads of stuff for a fiver. My mum was really happy with the size of her disabled room - loads of space to move around in the wheelchair, and a large wetroom/shower space too. Couldn't work out if the bar did hot food or not, seemed to be conflicting info everywhere, but there is a wheelchair accessible pizza express five minutes down the road. All in all, a good stay.

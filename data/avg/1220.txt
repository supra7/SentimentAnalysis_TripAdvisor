This place has an exceptional staff - very kind and helpful. They need to be, because this is a tough hotel in terms of layout. It is enormous, and the signage isn't great for finding rooms. No wireless Internet in rooms (even for a fee), and many of the rooms have a funky odor. The place needs a serious upgrade. If you do have a room here, ask for one near the front desk (I think that would be in the towers) to save a hike. It's also easier to find your room in that section of the hotel.

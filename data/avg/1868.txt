We just returned from Maui where we spent 3 nights at the Hyatt. The resort area is very convenient. Whaler?s village with great shops and restaurants are within walking distance. The paved walkway all the way up to the Sheraton is fantastic. Great for morning or evening strolls, and very easy to get to a variety of restaurants. Lahaina is a quick 5 minute car ride, not accessible by foot. The resort pool is large, but very loud. There is no relax lounging. The waterfalls, kids and large groups of people are loud. The grotto bar, is not a swim up bar, but it's located "in" the pool under a bridge. It's chilly in there, and not a place to hang out. The resort grounds are very pretty. Lots of flowers and great fauna. There is good shopping right on site. The beach is pretty terrible. It's small, rocky and kind of smelly. The breakfast buffet is good, and on par with Hawaii prices. I have to admit however, I was surprised by no pancakes or waffles. Our first room was on ground level, and due to the recent rains we had an issue with little creepy crawlies. The Hyatt was quick to switch our room, all be it a terrible view, but away from the critters. The beds were comfy. Hotel staff certainly was not overly friendly, but also not rude. The common areas of the hotel were showing a little bit of wear, but the hotel was kept very very clean. Self parking in the evenings could sometimes be a pain with minimal spots and dark parking lots. Bellhops were quick and friendly. Overall, I found my stay to be pretty average. Nothing took my breath away, and nothing was terrible. I certainly would never steer anyone away from this hotel. Overall an average choice.

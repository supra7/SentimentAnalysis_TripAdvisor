The hotel was quite nice. The lobby was nice and they sold Starbucks coffee in the morning. The pool was quite nice (but small). The shuttle bus to various locations worked out great. Even a taxi from most parts of town was not more than $10 back to the hotel. The beds were awful!!! My back hurt so bad I did not sleep the first night. We actually thought a cot might be more comfortable. I am going back to Boston and will not stay here again.

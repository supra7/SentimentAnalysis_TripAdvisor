Stayed one night AC was broken stuck on room was about 60 degrees repair guy came within 5 mins and fixed it. After he left I turned the heat on and the smell from the unit was musty and awful. I turned the unit off and went to bed. Restaurant on 2nd floor wasnt bad. Hotel staff was friendly. Bed was so so.

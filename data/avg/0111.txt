This hotel is in a terrific location half a block from the Pike Place Market and within walking distance of most downtown attractions. It's located on a steep hill (see photos) with a courtyard and ocean view patio. Our room faced the patio and ocean - great for sunsets. The bed was memory foam so my pregnant wife loved it and slept like a charm. Very comfy. The bathroom was modern and clean. The only disappointing thing was the TV in the room was beside the bed - not at the end so it made watching TV challenging. Also, we thought the waterfront was a little closer. Turns out its a downhill hike under a freeway before you reach the piers. There's a great little breakfast place in the courtyard to try. If you want to stay near the waterfront, eat solid seafood nearby, visit the Pike Place Market and downtown for shopping - this is just fine. Pretty expensive place to stay - but cool.

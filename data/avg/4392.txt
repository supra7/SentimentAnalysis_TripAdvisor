I had to visit Boston for a conference for work, and they had a block of rooms at the Doubletree Boston Suites. It was an ok stay. The rooms were clean and had everything I needed, but nothing specatular to write home about. It was your average hotel. I was happy with the service, and everyone was friendly, but then again, noone went super out of their way. It was a good stay overall, and had no real complaints..just nothing over the top about it. The location was great to where i needed to be, so that was the deciding factor. The hotel was paid for by my company, and i honestly dont know what the rate was as it was all taken care of in advance. The fact that the hotel and my office had everything arranged was really helpful and took the stress of traveling off me. Overall i was satisfied with my stay and would probably stay again if i had to.

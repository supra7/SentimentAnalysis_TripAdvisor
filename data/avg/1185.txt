This was our second trip to Seattle w/in the last year. The first time we stayed at the Mayflower & would have done so again but for a friends recommendation to try the Roosevelt. We prefer boutique hotels to the big chains. The Roosevelt offered a senior rate which was an excellent value. The location was great  across the street from Pacific Place and an easy walk to Pikes Place Market (my favorite go-to in Seattle). My room overlooked the street and I thought noise from traffic & the restaurant below (Von's) would be an issue but it wasn't at all. Overall I would rate this hotel better than average in most respects; front desk & concierge staff were friendly and helpful. This was our second trip to Seattle w/in the last year.

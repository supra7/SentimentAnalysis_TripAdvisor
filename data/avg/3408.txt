The Crowne Plaza hotel is a nice hotel, ideally situated next to terminal 3 with very easy access to the MRT station. The hotel is nice but if you are only staying for one night and have an early start I would consider just using the transit hotel as it is better value for money. The staff were very helpful & honest, as one of my kids left their phone behind when we left for London, the staff held onto the phone for 3 weeks and where happy to return it to us on our way back through. Some of the rooms have a nice view over the pool

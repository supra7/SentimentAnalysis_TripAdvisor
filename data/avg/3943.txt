Well $160 bucks for 7 days isn't bad at all I'd say. It was perfect for me being a college student going down with his friends with every intention of being drunk and goofy the entire week. Grant it the two beds were basically touching and the room barely fit the 5 people living in it. and the bath room was smaller than my high school locker (exaggerating but its pretty fn small in there) Also my toliet flusher didnt work so you had to pull the chain in the upper section- for $160 a week for my share i was happy to do this. The owner (male) was very nice, the female owner was a tad rude to me in particular actually banning me from the hotel because she said I wasn't a guest even though I mean i obviously was- I paid and stayed there for 6 nights before sooooo I just used a different . The rest of the staff was mad relaxed- They helped with our problems and had a good time themselves so that was good. Look the place is a dive, but Ive lived in much worse conditions for longer, if you can take it for what it is a place to sleep without cops or beach goers harassing you and a place to wash/change- then this is the perfect place. Cheap, great location, pleasant crowd- enjoy your vacation at the beach, dont worry bout the hotel.

On first impressions an impressive hotel with fabulous lobby , landscaped pool, oceanfront pool bar and great restaurant but having come direct from the fabulous Halekulani at Waikiki we found the Hyatt rooms to be tired and the overall service ordinary. Constantly waiting in lines for reception, breakfast, pool chairs etc. Too many people for the facilities. The Sheraton nearby at Kanapaali looked a much better option.

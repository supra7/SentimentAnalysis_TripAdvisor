The good. Nice newer property, staff is friendly, good customer service. The down side is the rooms are a bit small for a new property. The property is concrete and steel with sealed shut windows so although it is on the bay you get to breathe the same stale air inside the hotel. Hallways are already starting to smell musty. At minimum hotels should put windows in that have a vent of some sort for those of us that like a bit of fresh air? Easy parking in the garage that has a walkway to it. Skip the valet parking. Short walk to convention centre (10 minutes) about 15-20 to the gas lamp area where all the restaurants are. But to get to the gas lamp you have to go down the street a bit to a crosswalk and sometimes have to wait for trains to go by. They are building a walkway closer to the hotel but it is not completed. There is a sports bar on the lowest level on the bay front but you have to go outside the hotel to get to it, same with Starbucks, have to go out to get to it. The hotel restaurant was dead most of the time as the prices are the usual Hilton you have got to be kidding prices, wait staff needs some training on customer service and seem to disappear for extended periods. Room service prices are again a bit high but that is what you get when you stay at a Hilton. If you ship anything to or from the hotel for an event be prepared for the usual gouging from them for looking at your package. Suggesting shipping off site. Even the UPS store on the property slaps on a hotel fee.

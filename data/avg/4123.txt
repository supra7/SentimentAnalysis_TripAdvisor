Booked this reservation months in advance because we were planning a family get-together and wanted to be close to ALL THE ATTRACTIONS Boston has to offer - true, the location of this Marriott is wonderful for everything in the area but, I've stayed at quite a few Marriotts (being a platinum member) and this one is just "okay" - nothing special! Our floor was right in the midst of renovations so the noise level was pretty bad and they appeared to start pretty early in the morning so that did not lend itself to sleeping late and their concierge staff were extremely rude and condescending to my family (including asking them 3x if they logged the drinks they were taking from the bar) and the food in the restaurant was nothing to write home about. On the plus side is the fact that it is next door to the Aquarium, the dock where all the boats leave from, the North End and Fanueil Hall and Quincy Market so......I would recommend it if you intend on visiting any one of those areas (all within a short walk) but I would definitely wait for the construction to end because, as I mentioned earlier, the noise factor is bad. As Marriotts go - this one should get more than a renovation to the property - try some of the staff as well. One last word - the front desk staff were extremely accomodating (since we needed some extra service during check-in) and worked on our reservation over 40 minutes so.....kudo's to her!!!!

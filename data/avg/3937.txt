The remodeling is really doing wonders for this place. Parking is a bit of a pain, but for the location of the hotel itself the price is well worth it. Oceanfront, queen, private (huge) balcony, remodeled bathroom/tub Sat-Sun $150. Didn't get to check out the pool located on another property, but at least its offered. We either lucked out with this one or some of the more harsh reviews were made by disillusioned people. Front desk/staff were friendly, not seeing the issue there, maybe we just didn't stay long enough. All in all I challenge anyone to find a place that puts you in the misdemeanor of the boardwalk, right at the waves, for under $200 a night this time of year. You get what you pay for, and I'm pleased with what I got.

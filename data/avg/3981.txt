Arrived early morning from Australia for possible pre check-in. Hotel wanted to charge an extra 720 dhms as 'day rate', which I thought was on the high side, especially since they had a vacant room available, albeit not a non smoker I had requested. On five other occasions Dubai hotels have waived additional charges for an early check-in. I suppose it depends on how hotels wish to engender customer relations with guests on arrival. The room was somewhat disappointing and was one of the least attractive in the hotel. It was on the second level and faced the Sheikh Zayed Road (the main freeway). There was no carpeting on the stone tiled floor, even by the bed. The noise from constant traffic meant that the balcony served no purpose. I couldn't even hear the tv because of the noise level outside and the tv had a very quiet maximum volume level. The positives: after some negotiation, the hotel did agree to reduce the day charge by 50%; the bed and bedlinens were heavenly and the most comfortable I have slept in; There is free wi-fi and the hotel staff were very good in asisting me with an internet connection. The hotel is within easy walking to Dubai Marina Mall and the marina restaurants, both of which offer an excellent selection of eateries. The beach and metro stop are also withing easy distance. I might consider a future stay in Radisson Blu only if the room was on a high floor, quiet and partly carpeted.

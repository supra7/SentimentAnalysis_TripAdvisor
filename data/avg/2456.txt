As far as Courtyards go, I expected a bit more, especially for a Marriott propery. The room was a good size and there was free internet. The internet did take about 5 minutes to detect my connection, which caused me some concern at first,, but was fine after that. The king-sized bed was confortable, although the comfortor-like piece on the bed made no sense--it looked like a table runner. The bathroom wasn't spotless when I came in. Not that my standards are THAT high, but I expect there not to be any hairs on the floor. There is only shampoo and soap offered--no conditioner, no lotion. The breakfast was okay (eggs, sausage, potatoes, fruit, pastries, cereal, yogurt), but for the price, there should be more offerings (juice & coffee are not included in the price of the buffet). The staff were friendly and I had no trouble with parking. It was an average stay and I wouldn't be opposed to staying there again if I couldn't find a better deal in the area.

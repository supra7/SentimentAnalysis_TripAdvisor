My boyfriend and I were in Barcelona for 2 days before going on elsewhere in Spain, we chose this hotel and got a really good rate! Now if your not comfortable with being a bit further out of town and having to walk a little (5 mins from the Metro) then this maybe not the place for you as it wasnt direct to find, infact if it hadnt been for the big lit up Confortel on the front of it i imagine we'd have gotten a little bit lost! The area around the hotel is also still under development and if your a lone female id recommend somewhere a little more populated. I think once the area is develped it will be great! HOWEVER the hotel is fantastic the staff were always really really friendly and helpful and although we were put into a smoking room you wouldnot have known! The rooms are lovely and modern and have really lovely comfy beds! The aircon is also amazing with the heat! There is a lovely pool on the top of the hotel and the hotel is a three minute walk to the beach! The hotel is also just around the corner from a fantastic road full of local spanish restaurants and cafe's and a lovely patissery is on the corner of the hotels road! You can also walk along the beach front from the hotel to the olympic port and further on but Bewarned when its 29Celcius take water and be prepared to stop a lot! I'd recommend this hotel is your ok with being further out of town and dont mind walking a bit from the Metro. We will definately think of coming back here again but may also look elsewhere! It was definately value for money!

In my opinion, this hotel is a 3 to 3.5 star hotel. The staff were friendly and courteous. I found a great deal on a one-bedroom suite. For the most part, the decor and furniture were above average. In the living room, the leather sofa was comfortable. In the bathroom, the shower head and curved shower rod were nice, but the tile was poorly laid and the toilet looked industrial (like in a sports stadium). In the bedroom, the pillows were comfortable, but the waffle texture of the blanket was somewhat uncomfortable. The air conditioning units were moderately loud and the sun made the temperature slightly warm during the afternoon. The complimentary wireless Internet was easy to use and the speed was adequate. The rooftop pool was basic and small. The hotel was located just steps from the heart of North Michigan Avenue shops and attractions. It was also within walking distance of Navy Pier and Millennium Park. I would stay at this hotel again if I found another great deal.

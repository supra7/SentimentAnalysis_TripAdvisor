My husband an myself booked to stay at this hotel.We are from Goa so were not very sure wht sort of hotel this would be. The entrance was not quite like a hotel as in Goa. But when we checked in we were glad we booked to stay in here. The room given to us was number 2 and was in the basement, i would say it was a clean n decent room just hoped the bed would b a bit bigger, the linen n the bath room were spotless.And since we were in the basement we had a easy excess to the kitchen n dinning area, the kitchen was well equipped and refrigerator was full too. I plan to vistit london back in nov and have already booked my room at the city stay hotel. They have also informed me that they are increasing the inventary of the rooms. The guys at the receptions were very helpful and friendly. I wish them all the best. Cu back in nov.

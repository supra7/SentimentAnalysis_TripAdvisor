Greeted by large glitzy foyer of yesteryear design (think enormous chandeliers, swirly carpets, ornate side tables and you're there) the Reception staff were pleasant and the check-in process quick. The key card worked first time (always a good start) and familiarisation with the room v easy (difficult to hide things in small box - felt NYC hotel room size). If there is one thing that all hotels need to be able to do that's have hot water always on demand - went for x3 showers: 1 v luke warm, 1 warmish, 1 hot - not good. The bed was v comfy and ultimately I was there for a couple of nights and for what I needed it for it was adequate. The hotel needs modernising though and for the price (approx 170GBP pn) was hoping for something a bit more memorable.

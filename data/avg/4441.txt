We stayed at the Hilton Back Bay for two nights while we were in Boston for Parents' Weekend at Northeastern. The room was fine, but for what we paid, we expected more. The bed was a little soft and the end of the bed didn't feel as if there was any support there at all. The bathroom is small and the toilet paper holder is in an inconvenient place for those of us not double jointed. We broke a glass and it was never replaced. The day after we checked out, we needed a place to store our luggage for 5 hours and the hotel refused. Next time we're in Boston to visit our daughter, we will be staying elsewhere.

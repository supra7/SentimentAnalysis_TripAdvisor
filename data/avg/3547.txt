Overall, I would say the hotel is okay for a few nights stay. Expect nothing fancy, however. The location was okay, but you would need a car or cab to get you to places, especially during the summer months (like even Dubai Mall, although it's very close). We tried taking the metro, but thought the 10 mins walk to the metro and the 4 Dhs. pass for one stop ride to Dubai Mall was really not worth it. Ended up taking a cab the next few times and it cost us about 15 Dhs. Did not try the breakfast, so can't comment on that. Parking was REALLY tight, especially since hubby was driving a big car. For driving a car such a Honda Civic or Corolla, I don't anticipate parking issues, although the parking does fill up quick on the weekends. Nonetheless, they do have two floors.

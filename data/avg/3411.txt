Arriving in Singapore at 1am, we thought to stay at Crowne for a night for the convenience. However they had lost our pre-paid reservation and it took close to an hour to check in (manager didnt bother coming out from the back room to talk with us). Beautiful designed and clean room. Can watch TV from bath which is a fun feature. Expensive internet ($30/day). Would recommend taking advantage of good traffic to get to another hotel if arriving late at night.

I booked this hotel through hotwire. It was the first time I have used them to book a hotel. I received a rate of $156 including fees and taxes. I found the front desk staff nice and friendly. They were having issues getting the rooms keys working with the computer system so she had the bell hop show me to my room and let me in. The room was very dreary and faced a large cement wall. The bedding looked like it was from the 1970's or from a Thrift Store. I walked went back to the front desk and spoke to the friendly woman and asked if all the rooms are like this. She said that because I booked with Hotwire - Hotwire only gets certain rooms, but she switched me to a different room and said to book directly with them to ensure a nicer room. This room was higher level with views of the Space Needle. I enjoyed the view. The bedding was the same as the previous room still the Thrift Store feel. The fitness center is good, 1 nice ellyptical, treadmill, stair climber and bike. They do have a pool but I did not use it. I did like the location and it was close to shopping and the Space Needle. I guess if you need a budget hotel stay here. I love the Inn at Harbor Steps and my husband likes the Alexis Hotel. Bigger price difference but the rooms are so much nicer. My husband stayed at the Alexis for just over $200 including taxes and fees and I think it is worth the difference.

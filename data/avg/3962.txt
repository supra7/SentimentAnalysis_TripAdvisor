Pros: perfect location, very clean, nice elegant design. Cons: The lock to the balcony door was broken the first night of my 4-night stay. I propped furniture against it and rigged a booby-trap until I could ask the front desk to take care of it the next day, which they did. On the third day, housekeeping put wine glasses in the dishwasher, and I opened the dishwasher to find broken glass shards staring up at me. The dress code forbids robes in the elevator and halls, and who wants to get fully dressed after using the hot tub or steam bath, just to go back to the room? On the last day, I discovered too late that the fixtures were reversed in the washing machine in my suite, so my attempt to wash clothes in cold water resulted in a hot wash and hot rinse, which anyone knows can damage delicates and cause colors to bleed. Finally, a temporary charge (which I was told was for "incidentals" - but which was well over $1,300) was placed on my credit card when I checked in and after I paid in full for my stay using another means, I am still waiting for this to be released one week later. Laughing all of it off, and I may stay again, but would have enjoyed my stay more if I had been on the lookout for all of the above.

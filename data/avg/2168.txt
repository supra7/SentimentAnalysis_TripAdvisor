Stayed here August 28-30..Valet Service and Bell Hop were quick and polite...Lobby was very clean and nice....Check-in was a breeze, we paid for a studio but we were given an upgrade to a one bedroom suite on 29th floor. Bedroom s big, two bathrooms with large showers in each room..A bathtub in master bath big enough for two comfortably.Only downsides to my room was hearing the train blowing it's horn early in the AM, and the pull-out sofa bed in living room had a mattress where the coils felt like they were in your back.. We had room service the first night as we got into Vegas real late..Service was pretty fast and delivery of food was excellent..Servers were very polite..The pool was fine, alot of umbrellas to shade you from the hot sun..My only real complaint which unfortunately will prevent me an my wife from staying here again is their pet policy..As much as I know people love their dogs, I don't need to sleep in a bed, or take a bath where someones dog may have been and possibly have gone to the bathroom..Pet Lovers may think I'm nuts but I think it's gross..So Donald Trump get rid of the pet policy and we'll come back on our visits to Vegas, otherwise I'll stick to The Vdara Hotel which I've stayed previously and is another beautiful and clean non-gaming hotel, except no pets..

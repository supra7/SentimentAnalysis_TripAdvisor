The location is excellent but no way that you can sleep with all the noise going on outside all night and early hours in the morning. The personnel is very nice. Accommodations, well, you get what you pay. I was suppose to spend 6 nights but after 2 nights sleepless I checked out. If you are going to stay one night, FINE! But, there is no way that you will sleep.

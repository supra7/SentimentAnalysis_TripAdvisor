We arrived at the Maui Eldorado, and were put in unit L102. This unit left a little something to be desired, and didn't have a dining room table, which proved to be an issue with an 18 month old and Four year old. I let the front desk know right away we wanted to move and I was told I had to wait for 2 days until availability. I was a little ticked that I wasn't offered a free upgrade because after a long day of travel, I was quite disappointed in the accomodations. I did let the front desk know several times we wanted to move and felt I was being pushy about the subject. The day there was availability, I asked to see the new unit, which was B103. It was lovely and the staff was quite helpful moving our bags, food, etc to the new location. My question remains this... why is there not a standard of quality for each suite maintained through the Outrigger? We had a great time at this resort, the grounds are great, we were steps from a pool and a short walk to the beach. I would stay here again, but I upon arrival, would ask to see my suite before moving in.

Stayed here with my misses for new years in London. Pros: Hotel is easy to find. 15 min walk to tube. Near many supermarkets. Hotel was clean and modern. Was like a motel style hotel. Great shower. Good ventilation and heating. Great price. Cons: Took around 15 mins to check in as there was a mix up using onhotels.com they did not send a copy of the booking to the hotel, so after looking and re-looking at all his bookings I showed the guy on reception my booking reference and he invited me behind the desk to print it off his computer. Although it was a mix up and he was very apologetic it did take a while to sort out. Our room did not have any net curtians compared to others around us, so had to have curtains closed. Toilet plumbing had a prolonged dripping once used. Have to get a zone 4 travelcard. Did not have breakfast as did not get up in time but breakfast room was huge. Would stay here again was a bit out of London but easy to get into the center and a great price for what your getting.

Me and my wife stayed in this hotel on May's 2009 first week. It really is a very good option and has a relation price/quality quite considerable. The location is near the main central station of Rome, Termini, and is besides the Santa Maria Maggiore Church. The rooms are clean and so is the bathroom. The wardrobe could have some more space. The hotel doesn't have any lift which is an upside for disable or elder people. The breakfast doesn't have very much options but the food avaiable was very tasteful. Basically, when we return to Rome we might stay in the same hotel.

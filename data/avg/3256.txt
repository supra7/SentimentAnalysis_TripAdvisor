This hotel was recommended by friends. We had booked a double room & a triple room for 3 days (total cost:740 euros). Instead we got a single(probably) room with extra bed & a double room with extra bed. The rooms - especially the "double"- were too small with small baths and didn't reflect the money we paid. When the receptionist asked us how we found the room and I told him they were rather small & inappropriate to be consindered as double rooms and to the price we paid, he answered he could show me ... a smaller one if I wanted! The breakfast buffet was also rather poor & small with no fresh fruits & no variety, no omelets, no bacon, far away from the buffet our common friend described, but I must admit the best thing on that buffet were the stuffed pancakes. The suggestion of the hotel to eat to a good restaurant was totally far away of what we expected to find - we wanted to eat fresh fish & lobster spaghetti, but the price was twice higher as in Greece!!! - and the same for the hamam nearby (we had made a reservation for four for the last night and as we got to the place, we landed suddenly on earth -thank God- & cancelled it right away). The personel was friendly and cordial, the view from the roof was beautiful - can't argue with that - but, in general, comparing this hotel to the other hotels I've stayed in Rome, Madrid, Vienna, Amsterdam, I've stayed in better hotels and better rooms (double or triple) with less money.

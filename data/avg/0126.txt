I stayed here with three other friends in the summer. Let me first say that this is a budget hotel, so don't expect anything better than average. If it's comfort, convenience, etc. you want, you won't get it here. If, however, you're looking for a place to cover your head for the night, this isn't that bad of an option. We checked-in fairly quickly and took the stairs up to our room. We had two double beds and like any other budget hotel, you're first impression is "it's been used and abused." The good thing was that I didn't get that slimy feeling. The beds were okay, the pillows were skimpy, and the comforter was pilled. The washroom was okay. We had a courtyard view that provided an up-close view of the Needle. There is a decent size swimming pool indoors and a jacuzzi. I didn't use either but my buddies did try both. The jacuzzi kinda looked a little filthy to me but you can certainly smell the chlorine in the room, so maybe that'll ease your chill. The area is quiet and away from the city center (about a 30 minute walk). There are other budget hotels around the neighborhood. Next door is one of those local diners that serve excellent comfort food. We had breakfast there for a couple mornings and the wait staff were very friendly. Other than that, there isn't much around.

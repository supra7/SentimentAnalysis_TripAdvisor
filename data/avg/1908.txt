The hotel is not bad but after all the reviews read I expected it to be more clean and nice. When we arrived we were accommodated to a room which didn't smell fresh, and wasn't renovated for very long. I asked to move us to another room and fortunately (not easily) we were moved. It was nicer but I had to purchase some cleaning staff and wash the bathroom. It wasn't clean! We had lots of small ants everywhere and in the beds as well but they didn't bother us too much. There were many activities in the hotel which we learned about occasionally two days before departure and for most of them you need to sign up which we also learned about too late. So my opinion its not a bad hotel but Im not going there again.

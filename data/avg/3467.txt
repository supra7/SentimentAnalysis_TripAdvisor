Stayed at this Hotel on a Globus tour, the room was nice but small. Bathroom very nice, but a smell like sewerage started emanating from bathroom after a few days. Staff very courteous, but breakfast was the worse meal we had throughout all our 4 weeks in Europe. If you want a ATM or Supermarket you have at least a 20 minute walk, though we were informed 5 minutes. Two or three restaurants in area, but it is at least 40 minutes walk from St. Marks's Square, and other restaurants are at least 20 minutes walk. If you dont feel like walking it will cost you to take the water bus everytime you want to go anywhere. NIce hotel, but if you want to see the main sights of Venice and dont want to do a lot of walking, I wouldn.t recommend it.

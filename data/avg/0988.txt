I happen to be spending 2 weeks in this 4* hotel accompanying a family member who is visiting the city on business. Although the staff are super friendly and welcoming there are certain services they fail to deliver, like proper cleaning of the rooms and changing the bed linen. If you change the bed linen at least once a week in your house, why wouldn't you expect the same approach in a hotel, especially if it is 4*? The soap dish was clean for the first couple of days... like 2! From the 3rd day on it has been grimy due to the regular use and it was only when I kindly pointed it out that that was taken care of. Today it is grimy again! The laundry service is outrageously expensive, the most expensive I have experienced, like $2.5 for a pair of socks. Another expensive service is room service (I know, it is the case in all hotels). In this particular hotel I find the room service does not offer the expected value for money: The protions are tiny, the food is far from good and the prices are high. The rooms are spacious (single occupancy rooms have 2 queen size beds), the choices for room entertainment are great and there is loads of wardrobe and storage space. Another plus is the fact that they have a complimentary coffee service from 6-9 every morning, and a Washington State wine reception in the lobby from 5pm to 6pm every day. It is lively and the wine is always of the best quality. All in all, it is a good hotel, however I think they should improve a number of services.

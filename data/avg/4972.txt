This is an iconic, old Chicago hotel. Personally, I'd rather spend that money on a sleek, creatively designed modern hotel, of which Chicago has many. But I was looking for a location and competiitve price for a business stay, and the Palmer House fit the bill. The room was small, and windows were not so much. That said, it's old-world luxury inside. If that's your thing, you'll like it more than I did. For me, it was just okay.

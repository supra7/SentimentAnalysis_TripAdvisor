It's an ok hotel, as most Fairfield Inns are. The primary problem was people above us had their kids running amok. We called 3-4 times downstairs. First time we did clerk offered to move us. As we had already changed to pajamas and it was after 11PM and we were dead tired, I told her it was unreasonable to ask us to move, as we were not the ones causing the problem. She agreed and said she would call them. They did not want to do anything about it and she had to call the police to evict them. They made a huge amount of noise clearing out of their rooms and leaving the hotel a about 2AM in the morning. My son was told that they get a lot of folks from the city who use rooms to have fun on weekends. This problem is becoming more widespread, along with parents who refuse to have their children behave, even into wee hours of morning. This phenomenon is making us re-think taking trips. We need to be able to sleep when we go to a hotel. We asked that the room be comped and they agreed. Unfortunately, this may be only incentive for hotels to ensure rude guests don't ruin stay of other guests.

First of all, Le Reve is a charming small hotel with some very friendly staff and a great wedding planner. It is in a nice location and despite being by other big hotels manages to feel private. There are some nice staff there as well. But we left being annoyed at some serious aspects of the hotel. First, It has a cold pool. Secondly, we were paying a lot to be there and felt more than a litttle nickel and dimed. They should consider an all inclusive package, especially for weddings when the hotel is bought out by a group, which would make for a more relaxing experience. We understand that it was not an all inclusive but it still felt negatively because one of our boys got sick likely from the food while there, and after getting a bowl of broth sent to our room, I was annoyed to be charged $10 US for the soup. I would feel more positive about our experience had they sent the soup gratis with a nice note from the staff saying that they hoped he was feeling better. They knew he was very sick and we became trapped inside the room for two days with him. Simple gestures would have been nice and would have gone a long way with us. We also got constantly nickel and dimed about drinks (for example, being asked to sign a ticket for even untouched bottles of water, and even at the wedding when there was an open bar we got approached to sign a bill ticket for a cocktail). Finally, we had a bug infestation in our room, and suffered dozens of unsightly bites. The hotel admitted they were going to bomb before we got there to deal with the bugs but had decided not to.

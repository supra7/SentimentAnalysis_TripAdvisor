We were so excited to stay at the Omni based on feedback from friends & Trip Advisor. It is a great location, making it easy to make your way around Chicago. The check in went very smoothly and the service at that point was excellent. We were checked in to room 918. Very disappointing. It had water damage around the pillar (on the ceiling) and stained carpet around the perimeter of the room. It also smelled very musty. This was not the first impression we were expecting. We called and asked to switch rooms, explaining the problem. Christina at the front desk apologized and switched our rooms without any hassle. Room #2- 1118. It looked good- we felt we could go & explore Chicago. After a few hours we returned to the room for a rest prior to meeting friends. When I pulled back the bed cover & sheets, there were 5 dried blood stains on the white sheets. (Along with small holes in the sheets). This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel? I called the desk and asked for a room without blood stained sheets or a musty, water damaged room. Christina apologized and said she would send up the housekeeping supervisor. A gentleman entered the room and told me the blood stains were "rust due to the washing machine". Completely insulting.... you could see the imprint of the blood. Why would rust stains be on sheets and why would they put them on a bed in a hotel room? Especially with the hype about bed bugs at this time. I was not impressed by this man at all.... Christina then moved us to room 2518. It was finally clean..... The rooms are poorly laid out. (Closet in the bathroom) I would not rate this hotel 4 stars. We stayed at the Hyatt 3 years ago in Chicago and had a much better experience. (Omni has the better location) I will not stay here again. For all of the great reviews, we were very excited for our trip to Chicago. This is the first time in 10 years I have disagreed with the Trip Advisor reviews on a hotel.

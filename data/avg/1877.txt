The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel has an excellent location on Ka'anapali beach, near both Whalers Village and Black Rock. The hotel is ok, but could use some updating. The staff is very friendly and helpful, though there was a communication barrier with the housekeeping staff when I called to see if an item left behind had been found. The grounds are as expected beautiful and meticulously maintained. The big disappointment comes with the nickel and dime approach to the resort, not that others don't do that, but it is annoying. For instance, $9 per day to part, $1.50 per day to use the in-room safe, $9.95 to use the wireless internet - that only works near the pool and cafe, etc. It would be a refreshing change for Maui resorts to simply give the total cost at booking and include the things that most travelers expect.

Pera Tulip was located very centrally and we could not have been more happier with all the fantastic restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and attractions that were close by. However - The room was unbelievably small ... we had to almost sleep ontop of each other and barely fitted our bags thru the door, not to mention how exposed the toilet was, I mean the wash basin was outside!!! This is suppose to be a 4* hotel and for the obsence amount of money we paid it was not worth it. I know Istanbul is a Mega City and space is limited but the size of this room was the smallest I have ever come across all around the world. The furnishings and bed linen were fine. We had to ring down for fresh towels 3 out of 4 days as the maid never left us anyway! (maybe there was no space?!) and the front desk staff were functional but unfriendly.

First of all, I had absolutely no problems with the service here. The front desk personnel, bar and restaurant staff, the valet/bell staff, and various employees I encountered in common areas were all extremely friendly and helpful. This was actually some of the best service I have encountered. The location was terrific. You can walk to Pike's Market, downtown shopping and restaurants, and to the monorail if you want to go to the space needle. I thought the food was terrific. I had breakfast there once, lunch twice and appetizers in the bar twice. The breakfast was a bit overpriced, but the lunch was worth it and the happy hour appetizers were a steal. The mixed drinks were just okay- I would stick with beer or wine. And I think the happy hour drinks were not that great of a deal. The city view from the room was spectacular- especially at night. There were negatives, though, which definately counter balanced all that great customer service. First of all, the rooms are worn and outdated. The furniture is nicked up, the wall paper was peeling, the carpet seams were lifting- and this was in a "executive suite". The elevators were loud- I actually appreciated the loud heater because it drowned out the noise from the elevators and hallway (you could hear every conversation through the walls and doors). There were not enough working lightbulbs for the lamps. The lamp shades were askew so I don't know how housekeeping missed that. The elevators were extremely slow. More than once I waited almost ten minutes to get down to the lobby. I was there on business, so I had a schedule to adhere to and the elevators really were a problems for me. If you want good service and a great location, and don't necessarily need a newer, well maintained room, this is a great place. For the overall cost though, I don't think this property was up to par.

I am a member of Starwood Preferred Guest so naturally I opted to stay at The Westin during my recent visit to Seattle where we used the port for an Alaskan cruise. It was disappointing. While the hotel was not bad; it did not meet the standards I had hoped for based on its reputation and price point. During the first part of our stay, we came in from a day of sightseeing to discover that our room had been left open; it was a miracle that nothing was stolen. The hotel was nice enough to offer a complimentary breakfast when we reported the problem. We also witnessed a domestic altercation on our floor. On our return trip from the cruise we were able to check in early, which was nice. However, the room spelled like someone had cooked Indian food in it. There were no robes, shampoo and other amenities. We had to track down housekeeping staff to secure the shampoo. Robes never came even though the hotel website uses that as a selling point. We stayed on the Starwood preferred floor, but am not sure what that means since there seemed to be no difference from other floors. While the visit was not bad, it was simply not what we had hoped for.

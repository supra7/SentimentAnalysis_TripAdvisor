I stayed for 3 days on business. I thought the room and view was fabulous but the bathroom and public areas felt pretty dated. The 'restaurant' which I only used for breakfast was a bizarre set up being essentially a coffee/sandwich shop open to the public but within the hotel real estate. Food was fine but it wasnt great to have to queue to order food and pay at a till. The concierge service was great save for the fact one one evening they recommended the Red Fin restaurant which was only a block away. The food (mainly fish) did not taste very fresh at all. All in all it was clean and had good views buth otherwise felt pretty basic.

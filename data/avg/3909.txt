My husband and I chose this hotel becuase of the reviews on Trip Advisor and we visited Orlando for a convention. The rooms were indeed large and clean and new but after two nights staying there, our backs were killing us, I think the beds were too soft. They seemed comfortable but were not after a couple of nights. The location is weird, a few miles from the convention center, kind of in the middle of nowhere and there is absolutely no view. The view from our room was an auto body shop. There is no gym, so if you would like to use one, the only machine operable in their so called gym is an elytipcal machine. That's it, everything else is broken. The food in the cafe was pretty bad, we tried that once for breakfast, they could not even toast bread. The front staff was very helpful though and our room had a microwave and a fridge and was clean. We checked out to stay at a Marriott hotel for the remainder of our trip, as we always get comfortable beds there...

We were spending four days in Seattle prior to flying to Alaska, and after reading many reviews of different Seattle hotels, I chose this hotel on the basis of the Tripadvisor reviews. Every review I saw was glowing, and I also liked the location. We travel frequently and have stayed in many different hotels, both chain and otherwise. I have to say we were somewhat disappointed. The location is very nice, true. The hotel was nice inside, but we never saw the reason for the glowing reviews. The room was nice but not exceptional. The men who bring in luggage and get you cabs went to great lengths to help us. The desk staff was certainly very pleasant and helpful, but at least two of them didn't know how to put us in touch with a company who could take us to Mt. Rainier. There are no brochures available in the lobby, and when the desk person went looking in a drawer, he had difficulty finding a brochure for this major attraction. I finally suggested Gray Line myself, and he made the phone call for us, but then gave us incorrect information (and I saw later why he thought that he was accurate---I don't blame him for that). My husband found out later on that there was a concierge somewhere on site, but in four days we never saw him/her or even knew of his/her presence. The hotel needs better visible information for tourists---at the very least, brochures should be somewhere. In addition, once we did book our tour, we asked for a wake up call that never came. Fortunately I always set my cell phone. We came away feeling that while our stay there was fine, we had had similar "fine" experiences in the chain hotels all over the US. We felt that it wasn't worth the extra money.

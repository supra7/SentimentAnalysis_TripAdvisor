This is a fine hotel if you can get it at a discounted rate from Priceline or some other service. Clean but small rooms; well-located in the middle of the Loop next to several subway lines; pleasant staff. The only thing that bugged me is that it's one of these places that tries to charge you for things many hotels include in the price of a room. Wireless Internet? Sure, sir, we have three different price tiers. Gym? Of, course. That will be $18. I got there at 9 a.m. and was charged $25 for early check-in. I was told that if I didn't want to pay to check in early I would have to wait until at least 1 p.m., but that they couldn't guarantee me the king bed I had requested. However - lucky me - they had one available now for the extra charge. All of this was done in a friendly, professional way by the nice lady at the front desk, but it still left a big of a bad taste in my mouth.

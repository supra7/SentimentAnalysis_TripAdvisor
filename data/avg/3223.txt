1 - The staff is a little too sociable upon check in. There were at least 10 people in line waiting to be checked into their room and the staff somewhat lagged in that area. They talked to each other about non work related issues, talked with other hotel employees, and to other guests staying in the hotel. We were in line for at least 20 minutes trying to get our room. 2- They checked us into a room that wasn't clean. The rooms are a decent size (plus there), but to be checked into a room with the covers all over the floor and other things in disarray was not a good thing. We should have known better when we overheard them saying that they checked someone else into a room that was occupied as well (before we checked in). They quickly rectified it by switching our room and upgrading us. 3- The restaurant, while the ambiance was nice, left a bit to be desired. They list their hours as opening at 5:00 pm for dinner but at around 5:15 after seeing a few employees standing around and the door being locked we knocked on the door and asked what was going on. They "forgot to unlock the doors." Stay away from the onion soup, was not good AT ALL, but the scallops and rissoto were actually pretty good. If you're on a budget and need a decent place to stay then by all means stay here. But for what you will spend in cab rides and food (because there is nothing good in the immediate area) you might as well stay closer to where everything is.

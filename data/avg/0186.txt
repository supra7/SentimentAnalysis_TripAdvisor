We stayed here for a conference. Our view from the 18th floor was of a highway spaghetti bowl. The beds were excellent, the room was spacious. Elevators still stupidly slow, and it wouldn't have mattered if the hallways hadn't smelled terrible - like sour milk. Other folks told me this was true on their floors, too. Earlier in the week we'd stayed in a motel on Bainbridge Island for $80 a night. I'm not sure what the extra $150+ for the Crowne Plaza got us besides a downtown location and a little more floorspace.

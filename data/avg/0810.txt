"Wait!", you might say, "I thought Westin's are *four* star hotels?" Not true of this establishment. I came here for work and while it met needs for a quick one day stay, it was as if I were seeing an old friend after 20 years. They were still pretty but the cracks were evident. In this case the rooms were old and moldy, mini bar had planters peanuts, wine was something cheap. Little details like buttons on elevators were used up and didn't light up. The clock radio was an old GE thing from 1985. Seriously?? No i-pod clock radio to charge your phone or MP3 player??? I would not recommend this for a vacation getaway unless you have a big family and need to save a few $$$. The pool was a nice touch for the kids although I don't have any so how does this help Miss AbFab_nyc?

This is a great hotel for access to the station and exhibition centre. The reception is impressive and the dining/bar areas are spacious, modern and clean. Unfortunately thats where it ends - once you get into the elevator you step out onto a lack lustre landing, camel beige carpets, drab decor. drooms are small and pretty much like a travellodge - harsh not really the bathroom is plain and dingy, toilettries -well you might as well not bother. We decided to eat in the restaurant as the mixed menu of East versus West, was really tempting - the food was ok, service a little slow but was not deserved of the price tag. Would i use this hotel again - yes, for the ease of getting to the airport, town centre and exhibition centre . It's not that the hotel are doing anything particularly bad - its just not upto the standard of other Novotels.

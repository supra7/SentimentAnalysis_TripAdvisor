first off, great location especially if you have a sea facing room, but heres my first niggle: after a long wait to check in (I was in the VIP line as I am a HiltonHonors silver card holder) I was asked if i wanted a "room with a view" for only an extra $20 per day - annoyingly. colleagues of mine who are not HH members were given similar rooms for free!! the next morning we were told there was a 20 - 30 minute wait for breakfast when we could see plenty of empty tables, i.e. they were understaffed. but a too small fitness centre where they wanted to charge $4 for ear phones - How annoying is that?? I much prefer the Manchester Hyatt just up the road. Apart from that, no complaints and a generally good hotel to stay in,

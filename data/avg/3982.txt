The rooms are attractively modern with big flat tvs. The beds are comfortable and there is free wifi. There are some design flaws. Firstly the bathroom didn't have enough lighting. The modern sinks are so shallow you get water splashing back on you. One of the bedrooms had a light switch in a very strange place hidden behind a headboard. The washer dryer is strange. Washed my clothes but the drying didn't seem to work. They should have separate washers and dryers. The beds have rather sharp wood frames that can make for painful knocks. So be careful. Location: there is a supermarket in the next service apartment. The setting is not that attractive - its on the main road not the marina itself unlike some other residence hotels. The Thai restaurant is attractive but the food was expensive and wasn't good. I left a souvenir behind in the room when I checked out and called the hotel to check on it 2 days later. They said they would call me at my new hotel to let me know if they found it but they never called back. It wasn't valuable so I let it go but would have appreciated a call back. Bear in mind there is a lot of competition in the area eg Marriott, Dusit etc so shop around.

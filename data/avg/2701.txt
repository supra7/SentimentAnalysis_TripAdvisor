Overall experience at this hotel was nice. On the positive side, great location, clean rooms, pleasant and helpful staff (with one exception), nice continental breakfast which was well stocked. On the negative side, I requested early check-in, but did not arrive until 4:15pm (check in time began at 3pm). My room was not ready and the excuse given to me by the front desk clerk was that the hotel was "usually busy". Granted, my stay was during the time between Christmas and New Years, so the hotel was busy, but I worked for a hotel for 2 years. We knew our busy times and our slows times. I have a better term for this: Mismanaged. While the pool/whirlpool does have a nice view from the 27th floor, it's on the small side given the number of people that were there. Also, because of how busy the hotel was, there were lines to get what you wanted at breakfast and it was hard to find a place to sit. Would I go back again? Probably. Maybe during a different period where the hotel is not so busy.

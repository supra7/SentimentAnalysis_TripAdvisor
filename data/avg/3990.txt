Best things about this hotel - cheap, breakfast included, conveniently located. We booked it via totalstay.com and got the room for 40 a night (for two of us, including breakfast). The room was ok - quite small, and could have done with a lick of paint and a dusting (and the mirror was cracked right down the middle - bad luck!), but otherwise ok. Bathroom was modern, room was kept warm all the time, and had freeview on the TV, so plenty of channels. Breakfast was basic - plenty of toast and cereal, tea and coffee, jam and plastic cheese. Did get a mouldy yoghurt one day, but overlooked it, and otherwise breakfast was ok. Staff on the desk quite friendly. Great location - get a day travelcard and you're sorted. Quick bus to Stratford, then Central Line to the shopping centre of London (Oxford Circus / Tottenham Court Road) or Jubilee Line to London Bridge for trains to Gatwick. Also, Sainsburys and Tesco very close if you don't want to eat hotel breakfast. All in all - if you don't expect perfection, and you want a good value, convenient place, book this.

This hotel is a four stars, NOT a four stars Luxe. That mean you can't hope the same service. For exemple, WIFI is free... But only in the main lobby. In your room, you need a laptop and to borrow a cable. At night, no room service. And around, nothing open ! There is at 200 meters a vending machine for chips and coke... But you need small coins and nobody is there to do the change ! The location is okay if you like to be in a calm area. But you 'll have to walk 30 mns to reach the city center. Or to be dependent of public boat transportation. It was my choice and I don't regret it. But that can be borring to be so far and not to be able to do a quick passage to your room in the middle of the day to change yourself or to leave your buys. Rooms are okay, a little bite old and really too expensive for the quality and the service proposed. You need to negociate a better price I got, because 650 euros for 2 nights was definitely overpriced.

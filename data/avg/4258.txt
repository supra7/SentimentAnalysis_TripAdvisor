I stayed two nights at the Boston Park Plaza hotel and was overall satisfied based on the price we payed. We got a good deal through Hotwire for less than $60 a night which, at this location, would be hard to find otherwise. Regarding the hotel itself, the common areas are very nice and well appointed, but the rooms are very dated and show lots of wear. The bathrooms looked like they belonged to a 2-3 star hotel and did not have bath tubs. The beds were very comfortable, though. In all, I would stay again in this hotel only at the price we payed. On a more positive note, we did try the 3-course tea menu and was absolutely outstanding. Not only the quality of the food was great, but the service was superb. They went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed it and even customized the menu for my wife, who could not eat many of the included items.

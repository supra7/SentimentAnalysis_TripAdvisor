This hotel was extremely hard to find, but once we did we realized what a gem of a location it was! That was basically the only good thing to come out of the hotel. The staff member who checked us in was very friendly, however the night/morning staff who checked us out was extremely rude. We were told there would be a breakfast buffet, there was none. We had to drop off our key each time we left the hotel which we felt was unsettling, so we all carried our money and passports with us. They were also supposed to call us a taxi to the airport and forgot to do so! The room was decent for the price and location. Good for a short stay, but would not recommend for anything longer than 2 days!

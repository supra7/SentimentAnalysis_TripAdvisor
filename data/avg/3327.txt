Just back from an interesting stay at the Barcelo Ravel, as others have said the hotel is very stylish, some of which works very well (lovely rainfall showers & extrememly comfortable beds) others which don't (no sockets by the beds & see through walls in the shower). My main two gripes are the location, next to an area occupied by streetwalkers (where we were approached by potential muggers on 2 occasions) and the level of service from the front desk. Having booked a Double room, I naturally expected a double bed but was given a twin (I was told this needed to be specified on the booking form, why, it was a Double room not a Twin room) and later found out there are only 4/5 double bedded rooms per floor. On trying to resolve this I was told we couldn't be moved until the following morning but we would be upgraded to compensate. No upgrade was forthcoming in the morning and the front desk were unaware that any move had been arranged when I went down to check, nobody in authority would talk to me so I emailed the hotel from my room & that was ignored as well. I couldn't tell anyone that this was a good place to stay based on the cost, location and poor service, I would suggest you look elsewhere, away from the Ravel district.

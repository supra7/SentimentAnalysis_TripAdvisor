The staff was very friendly and helpful, check-in was a breeze, car was too big for their garage, so we received a voucher for complimentary parking at the Hilton (3 blocks away). The pool and hot tub were the best part: on the top floor with great views. They obviously remodeled this area, it was the most up-to-date in the hotel. The interior of the rest of the hotel and the rooms were clean, but a bit worn and dated, time to refurbish. Overall a decent experience for a priceline booking. Pros: - Friendly, fast service - Pool and hot tub, views and open late - Fairly clean Cons: - It's in the business district downtown, so it's few blocks walk to things that are open on weekends, but not too bad - Interior is somewhat dated, but okay

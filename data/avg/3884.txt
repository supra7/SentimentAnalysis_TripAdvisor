We stayed at the Point Orlando Resort at the end of July. We were in Orlando for a ballet performance and were not interested in the Disney Parks - if we had been, then this would be a great location for those activities. We were in the Junior Executive Suite and it is spacious. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were nice and my daughter slept on the pullout couch without complaints. They did provide a small coffee maker and did provide packets of coffee on request. The room was quiet and we were not bothered by noise from guests (we were on the 2nd floor directly above the pool) after 10:00 at night. Cons: There was only one mirror in the entire "condo" (in the bathroom) and this proved difficult for three women. There was only one outlet in the bathroom. When you turn on the light in the bathroom, the fan automatically turns on - this made it difficult to hear above the fan if you are talking to someone outside the bathroom. If someone wakes earlier than the others, the only way to not disturb the others who are sleeping is to sit in the bathroom because of the way the lighting is arranged. There is no continental breakfast provided or free coffee in the lobby. There is a charge for using the business facilities or using the computer in the business room. There is a charge for using the phone in the room. You may be charged if you over use your towels. There seemed to be a lot of hidden charges and we were careful to not do anything to incur a charge. The staff was not as friendly as most hotels where I have stayed. This hotel is less hotel and more condo oriented. I would have preferred a Hampton Inn even though a Hampton Inn room is not as nice.

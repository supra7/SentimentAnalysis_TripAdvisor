We stayed at this hotel as part of our honeymoon. I knew it wasn't going to be out and out luxury but I expected it to be better than it was. I was really disappointed with how dated the hotel decor was, especially the reception area. It looks very 80's now and I dread to think how much it would cost to update it because the hotel is massive. Swan Court is especially dated and we spent most of the week having breakfast in the Pavillion to avoid looking at the decor. The grounds are beautiful though and the location is good - right on the ocean. The pool complex isn't too bad but some of the hotels up the road have better pools and are much more modern. My advice would be that you need to think seriously about whether you are the sort of person who would enjoy these huge, resort style hotels. I personally thought that they were very impersonal and not a bit intimate. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for a honeymoon. I would also consider speaking to a travel agent in detail so that they can advise you on what type of hotel is on offer. If you like luxury and modern decor, I believe the four seasons is the place to be. It has just been refurbished and if I had done my research properly, I would definitely have stayed there. Maui is a really beautiful special place and if you're from the UK, it's a long way to go and very expensive so do your research and make sure you know what you are getting.

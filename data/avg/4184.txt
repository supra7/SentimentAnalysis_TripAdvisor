Our stay at the Boston Park Plaza was "ok"--not horrible but certainly not the standard I would expect for the star ratings and price found on most websites. The real downfall was in the guest bathrooms, they are REALLY showing their age. Beds were comfortable and clean, location is great with a T station nearby and lots of restaurants out of the back side of the hotel.

Location is very good ! Some staff are really nice and some not so nice. The rooms are small but its well divided and the decor is very nice.. subtle and elegant. Our complain about this hotel is the housekeeping. The bed has curtains beside it and they did not clean that part since it cannot be seen its very dusty. We did not complain hoping they will clean it the next day... still they did not clean it and the day after it was the same. There was a day where housekeeping did not put any toilet tissue in our toilet. We requested from reception & the next there was tissue alright but the plastic wrapper of the tissues housekeeping left it in our sink... i think they must have forgotten huh ? They don't change the sheets everyday. One time i spilled a bit of drinks on the sheet we requested the sheets to be changed. Guess what when we got back housekeeping just wiped the white sheets with wet towels & probably dried it with a blower and never changed it ... the stains are still visible on the sheets but it was wiped down and to think we requested change of sheets. I also notice Ovolo housekeeping works really slow... by the time go back to your hotel at maybe 3pm or 4pm your room is still not cleaned!! we have to wait downstairs to have our room cleaned and this happened 3 times while staying in ovolo. This hotel is nice but i think management needs to change housekeeping or have them properly trained.

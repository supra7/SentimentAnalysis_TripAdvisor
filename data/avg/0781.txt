The first thing you notice about this hotel is the gloomy lobby. It is all dark wood and low lighting. And forget trying to read anything over breakfast in the restaurant, unless you get very close to a window and, even then, you need a light above you. There is little natural light in any of the communal areas, and this is my biggest criticism of the hotel. The rooms themselves (I was in a regular room, not a suite) are just fine, with an extremely comfortable bed, lovely linens, and nice touches such as real coffee and a real coffee press. The view was of a parking lot and concrete, but when I tried to change rooms they said all the rooms had poor views 'because this is an old hotel'. Like most places, some of the staff were great, and some were less so. When my room still hadn't been cleaned by 5pm one day, the man at the front desk unapologetically told me it was a Sunday and this was to be expected. For $300 a night, you would expect better. A lot of people talk about the character of the place, and this is certainly better than the big chains, but even in August it just felt gloomy.

We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and when we first got there we were a little shocked by both the area and the hotel. We drove down the street to witness a mugging happening just around the corner from the hotel. When we first saw the hotel I was shocked at how small it was, and the rooms were no different. It's a very boutique style hotel, but there was hardly room for two suitcases. The room was very clean and the bathroom was a decent size, but only had a shower. The continental breakfast was excellent and the hotel staff were amazing and informative! One of the other pros is this hotel's proximately to the subway - just around the corner! Once we settled in we never felt unsafe in the area - lots of people always around, but we did see a number of prostitutes and drug deals happening nearby. This hotel would be great for someone who isn't spending much time in their room and who is familiar with city life! Oh and one final thing - the wifi was incredibly slow and it was often more convenient to just go downstairs and use the business center.

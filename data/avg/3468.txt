Mixed thoughts about this hotel. Booked a deluxe room through the hotels web site and went with high expectations having looked at the photos on the web site. However was very disappointed to be given what must have been the smallest room in the hotel - not even a bath but only a shower! Air con was also a problem as it was not possible to get it below 20 degrees and this was too hot for us - we had to sleep with the window open.Reception assured me we had been allocated the correct standard of room and yes they did give a top floor room as requested. The larger rooms looked much better. Breakfast was okay but again not the standard I was expecting. To add to this on our first day we were offered a seat at the bar to eat breakfast as the room was full. The hotel is used by an american tour operator and this means it can get very busy - it also means that they are up and out early and we were wakened every morning by this. We liked the location of the hotel as it is a lovely walk along the front to the busy areas and as everyone has said the water bus stop is close by. I thought the hotel was okay but not good value for money.

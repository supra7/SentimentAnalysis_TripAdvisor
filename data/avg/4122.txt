Loved the location - I was travelling with my daughters and their 4 young sons - we had adjoining rooms which were convenient, but the rooms and bathrooms were rather small - the large windows with terrific views of the pier and harbor made the rooms feel larger. A stone's throw from the Aquarium and Duck Boats - the kids & adults loved both. Within walking distance to the North End for great Italian restaurants & bakeries, Faneuil Hall for shopping & a 'Food Court' that the boys enjoyed, and the historic sites and parks of Boston. We knew there would be construction when we booked, but the open atrium of the hotel makes for very loud construction noises seemingly everywhere/at all times. The service was aloof, most seemed not to really want to assist - parking was rather pricey at $40/day. I think I would return for the convenience and uniqueness of the location, just wish the overall service would have reflected a desire to want my return!

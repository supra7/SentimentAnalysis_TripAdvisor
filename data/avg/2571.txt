Spent one night in this hotel as needed to get to Bolton by 9.30 next day via Euston. It is what it says - a very basic hotel. Modern TV but no hair dryer in the room - ask at reception if you want one. I left before breakfast as not served till 7. Fire alarm went off during night. I was awoken by a noise that sounded a bit the the white noise - thought a neighbour had left TV on as noise stopped, then started again about 5 mins later, then stopped, then started again by which time I realised that something was wrong. Went down stairs and could smell smoke. Most guests outside with fire engines. Finally let back in - alarm still going. Smoke drawn in through ventilation system from fire outside of building. Staff did apologise for distrubance but would prefer to be disturbed than caught in fire. Not my first choice of places to stay in London when travelling alone but very handy for stations.

The hotel is contemporary and nicely designed. And the staff was generally very friendly and helpful. However the internet does not work at all (admittedly by some staff, a common problem). Although you can initially connect, you get kicked off every 5 minutes +/-. The only help the staff gave after numerous calls was "try rebooting the router" and "really? it should work..." (UHM, OBVIOUSLY!). Otherwise there was no concession or sympathy... SO if you require online connectivity, do not stay at this hotel. Also the "gym" is an extremely small room (maybe 10feet by 10feet +/-?) with one treadmill, one elliptical, one stationary bike, and one cable home gym. There are no free weights and this small exercise room is extremely uncomfortable to work out in if you are not alone. Accordingly I had to spend another $15/day (per person) to workout at a local gym. Many other hotels have more complete gyms included so those who are physically active should strongly consider staying elsewhere.

For a brand new hotel the facilities are excellent but the tour operator they use for their trips is poor both in quailty of coaches and guides. Nice hotel as it is new but be aware that building work is taking place on both sides of the hotel. Executive room nice to have use of but is open season to local people after 8o'clock who get access to a service that guests pay extra for free Expensive internet facility but good value hotel considering its new features

We picked the Westin for it's location as it was right in downtown Seattle also the pictures on the website looked like it was a very nice hotel. Before we travelled we were sent an email offer to upgrade to a deluxe room with a view, we decided to do this as we had not been to Seattle before and it would be nice to have the view. At check-in the girl on reception must have been having a bad day she wasn't that friendly, we were never offered any assistance with our luggage so took it ourselves. We were put on the 47th floor which did give us a great view but the room was disappointing it was a bit older in decor than we expected from the pictures. The bathroom was clean although there were 3 long hairs stuck to the wall of the bathroom and probably are still there now !! if we could see them I'm sure the housemaid could as well. We had an issue with drycleaning, not the hotels fault but we sent drycleaning for same day service and by 9.30pm had to phone to find out where it was. The drycleaning company had a power failure and we were told it would be another hour before it was delivered, we were happy with that but the next morning it still had not arrived and we were checking out once again we had to chase it up and it was sitting somewhere in the hotel and was then bought to our room.

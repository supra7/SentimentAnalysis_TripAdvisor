The title says a lot. Location is good. Hotel's exterior, the entrance and the restaurant area are fresh. The rooms are different and do not match the looks of the hotel (bit musty). Wireless is on and off. Staff is professional and not exceptionally kind. I will only go back to this place when offered a great deal and if I need be in that area.

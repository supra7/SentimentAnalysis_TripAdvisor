Old very big hotel. i booked a room thru a conferance very early. when i got the room it was on the interior of the hotel no view at all. i opened the door and hit the table next to the bed. you had to go outside to change your mind. plumbing was noisey all night. for +$250/night it could have been better. Eleavator service at checkout time was terrible. My wife liked the pool.

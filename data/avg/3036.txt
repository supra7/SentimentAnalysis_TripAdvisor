I like the location close to Termini just off Via Cavour and we got a great price booking in advance with Travel Republic (131 B&B for 2 people sharing a double room for 2 nights), so above average for the price and location. Room was clean but small (no problem for our 2 night stay but watch out if you plan a longer stay) and there were some irritations. Lights in our bedroom were either all on or all off - no way to have bedside light alone switched on. Sticky cistern had been leaking long enough to stain the china and was quite noisy till we worked out how to make it release fully (gentle wiggle of the "push to flush" panel) and stop constant dribble of water into the wc. TV very small so hard to see from bed even in a small room, and there were very few channels, but nice to have it and we did get to watch the Australian Grand Prix coverage on Italian TV. Service was courteous at all times (but maid woke us at 8am on our last morning - best remember to put out the "do not disturb sign" - we didn't!). Wifi coverage seemed quite good but was chargeable (fair enough given the room rate). Breakfast was fine and a nice bonus to have it included at this price. I'd happily go back to this hotel if we got another good deal on price, but I will look around and may choose another in the same area next time I visit.

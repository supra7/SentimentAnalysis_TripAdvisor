Don't get me wrong, this place it's clean, new and would be a great value. The only problem they have, is that the walls are too thin, you can hear everything that happens around the hotel (People talking in the next room, the construction workers from across the street and even the cleaning ladies yapping in the hallway) All those noises woke us up at 8 in the morning, so if you don't mind being awake at that time, or going to sleep after the restaurants nearby closes, this is your place.

The hotel was very good, nice rooms and friendly staff. Staff were able to speak english and were very helpful with directions. The hotel is located quite far away from the city centre however it is easily accessible by tram (four), which is a 5 minute walk to the tram stop. The tram passes could be purchased at the hotel, which was quite cheap at 6.90 euros for 5 trips (15 strip pass) as each trip uses 3 strips. The breakfast, at first, seems very appealing with a large variety of different foods however after staying at the hotel for a few days the variety just remains the same. The cost of the hotel is relatively similar to hotels closer to the city centre, and would recommend looking for hotels in that direction.

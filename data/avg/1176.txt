We like the Roosevelt for its great location. Very close to Paramount Theater...steps from shopping and good eateries. Bed was very comfortable and price point for rooms was good. On the low score side is really poor water pressure, dated room finishings, and no mini bar or hotel consssion stand for sundries and/or snacks&water.

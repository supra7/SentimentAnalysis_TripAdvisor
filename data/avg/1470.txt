We were very disappointed with this resort. We had high expectations given the ratings this resort had and how much it cost, but obviously the ratings are slightly inflated. I will start with the disappointments: First off, the week we were there, our AC in the room was hardly ever below 78 degrees! Then we realized the entire resort restaurants, Lobby, & rooms were all at that temperature. Hard to ever cool down. Mosquitos are absolutely horrible at this resort. You would think they would be handing out mosquito wipes right and left and stocking them in your room, but it was like pulling teeth to get them to give them out. The last resort we stayed at, stocked are room with hard alcohol and beer. This resort says bar in the room, but only gives you beer. You have to call room service for hard alcohol and they only bring it in shots. The jacuzzi tub in the room spit out chunks of rust, which made it not appealing to use. Room service was mediocre, food was very small portions and tasted like frozen food, not fresh.. We had no hot water for a day and when we complained they acted like it was unusual. But after talking to other people, was actually a common problem. The balcony area was very small, and not very comfortable furniture to sit on and not very private. The resort hot tub was like sitting on gravel and had chunks of rock pebbles all over the bottom. We had to put our towel in the hottub to sit on to make it comfortable. As for the good points of this resort, the resort itself was very clean, the restaurant food was good, the beach was a nice beach to swim and play at, the staff was nice, the entertainement shows at night were good, the swimming pool was nice and there was no curfew on the swimming pool at night. We were disappointed overall but still had a great time because we love going to Cancun. We do not plan on visiting this resort again, we will look for another resort for our next stay down there.

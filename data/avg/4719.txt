Our stay at the Hotel Burnham was just average. A little dissapointing for a 4 star hotel! Their Standard rooms have a queen bed where as most hotels have 2 singles for their Standard. While this was fine for my husband and I, our 2 friends that vacationed with us were not happy to have to share a bed! Construction across the street gave a horrible view. (Not the fault of the hotel) Service was average. Nothing beyond our expectations. Stayed at the Swisotel same time last year. Would much rather stay there then here!

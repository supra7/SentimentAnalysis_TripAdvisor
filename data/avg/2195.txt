What is the most important component of a hotel room,,,THE BED! The bed in our room was so bad you could see that the one side had a large depression in it even with the comforter on top. The other side was better but so soft your core area sunk leading to a very sole back by the morning. I did tell the front desk about it. They indicated that they would check into it. No change when we arrived back at the room that night. Rest of the room was fine. Except for the bathroom the rest of the room was a low 4 star. Noise from adjacent TRAINS is early and loud!!. Be aware of the shuttle operating times. It is hourly and stops early Sunday - Wed. STAY AT CEASARS FOR THE VEGAS EXP!!

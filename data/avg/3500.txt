I booked this because it was well priced and based on the web information...but what I found but was free minibar means a can of Coke and a packet of prawn chips, free cable TV was about 8 channels with only 3 in English. Bizarrely decorated in Orange & Purple. Close to Chinatown but not much else. On the plus side, Internet was good (and included) , Bed was comfortable and a shuttle to the closest staion (Outram Park) Probably would not stay there again, the bright colours were a bit much for me!

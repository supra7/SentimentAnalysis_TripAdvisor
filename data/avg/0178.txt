This Hotel needs a refit, it is rather old looking and a little worn. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. the cleaning staff were also friendly. The rooms looked as though they were old and tired compared to other Hotels in Seattle. Also there was a smell of rubbish in the passage ways. I went to get some ice as they have no refridgerators in the room and I found that the smell was coming from the room the ice machine was in. they had a rubbish bin and empty room service trays were also put in this room until they were taken back to the kitcken, thus the smell. Believe me it was an unpleasant smell and made me dry reach. I would not recommend this Hotel when there are better ones in the same area that are better and did not have that awful smell in the passage ways.

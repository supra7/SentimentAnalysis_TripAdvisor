If you dont mind hearing your neighbours talking then its fine. We had an interconnecting door to the room nextdoor of course it was locked but I could hear them talking as if i was standing right next to them fortunately we were only there for 1 night so we just put up with it. Room is very basic but clean. Room was very dark, hallways dark not inviting at all. 2 out of the 3 Staff at the front desk were friendly enough but 1 of them really didnt want to be there and couldnt be bothered helping us so we just made sure we didnt go to him again. Food in the hotel looked nice and very reasonably priced but we didnt eat there as we preferred to eat at Darling Harbour which was only about a 10 min walk to the heart of it which was good but its about a 35-40 min walk to Circular Quay.

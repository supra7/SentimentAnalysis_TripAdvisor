Just an FYI to management that they need to be more aware of the condition of their hotel. The air conditioning units need to be checked and serviced in each room. The first room I checked into had a broken air conditioning unit on one of the hottest days of the year. It would also be a good idea if management checked the kitchen tiled floor for cracks and poor grouting. One of the tiles in my kitchenette was cracked and wobbled whenever I walked on it. Also, the third floor hallway and the elevator were not air-conditioned and made the trek to your hotel room a miserable one. This hotel definitely lacked the quality and value found at other priority club hotels.

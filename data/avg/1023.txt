I stayed here for three nights for business and also attended a conference in the hotel. As for the conference, the food was good and the water was very refreshing (they put a mint leaf, lime, and strawberry). As for the hotel itself, check in was a breeze and the staff at the desk friendly. Though, i called down once to ask a question and nobody answered which was a tad annoying. I was on the fifth floor and the room was very spacious as was the bathroom. Loved the Bliss products. Even though i was near the elevator, my room was quiet. The one thing that was frustrating was maintaining the heat at the correct level, half the time i was burning up even though i kept turning it down. The gym was nice, lots of machines and weights. I went in the evening when it wasn't crowded, though heard it was packed in the morning. I didn't eat at the restaurant, but had conference food which was very tasty. I did hang out at the bar, which was a nice atmosphere with the DJ and popular even with those staying at nearby hotels. Service was attentive from the bartenders as well. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and i would stay again. One thing it takes a while to get used to is the dim lighting, it is hard to find people you are looking for in the bar until your eyes adjust. I had the same problem in the room, never quite the right lighting. They charge nearly $15/day for internet which is a bit obnoxious. The location is easily walkable to some of the prime Seattle attractions, though since it is in the business district, things die way down at night and coffee shops aren't open on the weekends. Something to consider. Though, within a few blocks or short cab ride are lots of other choices for dining and entertainment.

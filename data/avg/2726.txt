I stayed in August for 5 days in Hotel 91 and I appreciate the cleaness of our room. The ratio between price and quality was good. Obviously for that price this hotel is suggested. The position is really close to Underground station to visit Manhattan. We stay in the hotel only to sleep so it was perfect. But the smell of Chinatown area is really terrible. Despite other customers comments we didn't hear train noise during the day.

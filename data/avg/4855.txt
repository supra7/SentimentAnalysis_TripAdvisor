We stayed here for professional conference in early March 2011. We booked the room through Priceline for $80 per night. The total, including tax, for our four-night stay was $380. (Yes, this was a very good deal.) The big advantages to the hotel are (1) its location, (2) its historical value. On the first point, the Palmer House is a quick walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park and only a slightly longer walk to Michigan Ave and the great shopping. On the second point, it's a historic building, and the lobby and decor are really fun and charming. You can tell people you meet in Chicago that you are staying at the "Palmer" and they'll know what you're talking about. The big drawbacks: First, the hotel is huge but the rooms are small (like, New York City small). Tiny, stuffy, cramped...there's not much room for two people to move around comfortably. Second, you have to pay for things that should really be included -- specifically WiFi and the fitness center. (The fitness center, if you go, is actually really nice...but they charge $10 each visit.) Third, I pity the fool who tries to stay at this hotel while there's a large conference going on. We were part of such a large conference and, needless to say, attendees for our conference were everywhere and took up all the free space in the lobby and the elevators were mobbed. I felt badly for the poor tourists trying to get around. Overall, it's a nice hotel and a great catch on Priceline if you can get it. But it does have some drawbacks that nicer, perhaps less historic properties don't.

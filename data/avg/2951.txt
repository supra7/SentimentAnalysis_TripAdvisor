Its not really a Hotel, its RESIDENZIA, because theres no lobby with a gate to the street, and no sign outside to locate the hotel, but the room is very spacios and clean, totally renovated with satelite LCD TV and Fast Internet free. The bath is big and havea great shower and hair drier. The location is best near Fontana de Trevi and theres a Metro station 700m and a bus station a few step outside. Theres a lot of Italian Cafe on the neighboorhood and its close to famous Via Del Corso. Safe plase to stay and walk at night. The best way to come from the airport is by a shuttle an you stopin front of Ciro Restauranton Largo Chigi and the owner contact the hotel lobby. everything you need if o looking for a place to sleep after a day walking for Rome.

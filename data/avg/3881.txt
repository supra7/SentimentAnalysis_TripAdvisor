We initially booked a one bedroom suite, and when we walked in we were impressed. The kitchen is fully equipped including dishwasher, washing machine and dryer. The master bedroom had an enormous bed and the bathroom was beautiful. Then we had a look at the pull out bed for the kids (age 12 and 14) and realised that it would not permit them to sleep. If we were staying for one night we would have made do, but 3 nights was too much. So I went down to reception and upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite. This gave us 2 king sized beds so was perfect. We went right round southern Florida over 2 weeks and stayed in 5 different hotels. This was the only hotel where we had a problem with the second bed. If you are with a family do not book the one bedroom. On the positive side the facilities were excellent, the kitchen and dining area allowed us to have a cheap breakfast by stocking up at the local wal mart. And the location is excellent. We had combi universal and wet n wild tickets. We took the taxi to universal, 8 dollars each way, and walked to wet n wild, the location does not get a lot better. The service was fine, without being outstanding.

The rooms are very comfortable and the location is convenient to Love Field, but customer service from the management and the sales department (Steve) was horrible. After spending nearly $4,000 at this hotel, you would expect to be treated well, but that is not the case here. I was given a quote by Steve in the sales department for a three month business stay, but when I called back to make the reservation with him, he pretended not to know me and refused to honor the quote he gave me. When trying to resolve this situation with management, I was treated poorly and ignored.

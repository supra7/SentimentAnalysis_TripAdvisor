We stayed one night on August 3rd at the end of our family vacation. We had two rooms with one of them an upgraded corner room on the 25th floor. We stayed there in order to walk to a baseball game. We had a special rate for a Visa promotion that saved us 25%, but still paid $260 per room. Overall, the hotel is very nice - mainly since it's new. Rooms are nice, but aren't anything special. The view was fantastic. Things started out poorly when we drove up and the Valet parking guy wouldn't take our car. He was too busy. So, we self parked - which is cheaper and easier than the valet anyway. Check in went smoothly. Rooms were ready a little early. The rooms are average sized. The beds/pillows are nice. Our main complaint was that housekeeping knocked on the door at 8:00am. We forgot to put out our privacy card on the door, so I could understand that. BUT, they called 3 times between 9:00 and 12:00 and hung up. I know it was housekeeping because the did the same thing to my daughters in the room next door. This is a totally unacceptable practice. If you plan on staying here and sleeping in, forget it. I was furious by the second phone call, but decided to just let it go since I was only staying one day. Other than that, the stay was OK, but if you pay full price you're wasting money. We stayed at the Embassy Suites the night before, right down the street, and it was MUCH nicer and about $100 a night less - plus it had free breakfast.

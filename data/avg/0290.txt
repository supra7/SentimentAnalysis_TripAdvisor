If you are on a tight budget and don't feel like spending much time in your room---this is the place. The rooms are very dated and sparce with thin towels and no ameneties(blow dryers-shampoo-irons) All of the linens, however, were very clean. When I plugged in my blowdryer in the morning---the lights dimmed from the power drain...the windows were very thin and you can hear the sirens going down 2nd and Virginia through the night..Luky for me---my visit to the Liquid lounge by the Space Neddle provided me with a little extra sleeping power. The location can not be beat---Walk to Pikes and the waterfront as well as the mall and the Monorail. The Rail stops at 7pm and the taxi ride back from the Space Needle was only $4.50 exc. tip. The front desk was very friendly----What the Moore lacks in sparkle--it makes up for in service. If old means "charming"and peeling paint means "vintage"---you will like the Moore---The price and location can not be beat---just don't expect a mint on your pillow :)

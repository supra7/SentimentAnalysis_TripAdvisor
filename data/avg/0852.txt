We stayed here on a family vacation. We paid $200 per nite plus the valet parking. Our first room was disgusting. I thought it was a smoking hotel. The carpets were dirty and old. For $200 per nite I knew better. I was not impressed with the lobby either it is so outdated. Doesn't seem like a place to "hangout" and have a drink. We had just been at the Hyatt Alicante on Harbor at Disneyland and wow, what a difference. Our rate was such a better deal there. Anyways, we were moved to the 30th level floor. and the room was better. The hallways in this hotel are so dated. Sorry for the complaints but I've stayed in Hyatts, Hiltons, Sheratons, Omni's, Marriots, and this place is a dive next to these chains. I had to voice my concerns. Thanks for moving us but how about a renovation?????

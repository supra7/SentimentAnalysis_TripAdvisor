Stayed here back in June of 2008 and really enjoyed it. Now it seems a bit weathered and not as clean as previous. Some of the towels were stained and the bathrobe in the bathroom also had a stain on it. Housekeeping just did not pay attention to details - for instance, one day there were three washcloths left on my suitcase. I believe they left them there by accident but it struck me as odd. Next day the bed wasn't totally made. Seems like they just left before they were totally finished cleaning the room. Not very impressive for a W. Will try the Westin next time

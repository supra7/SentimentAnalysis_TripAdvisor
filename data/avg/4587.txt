I stayed alone in the Medussa Hotel for three nights in September 2011 whilst sightseeing in Istanbul. I booked this hotel after reading positive feedback on this site. I paid Euro 60 per night for a single room with breakfast. The hotel is in an erxcellent centrally located location. You are 400 metres from the Sultanamet are which has all the historical sites. The Grand bazaar is 100 metres away. My room was simple but clean and the bed comfortable. I didn't find the staff to be as helpful as other reviewers but they did enough. Breakfast was, in my opinion, poor. I didn't bother after the first morning. If you want a cheap place to stay in the centre then this is fine. If you want more comfort and a better breakfast, go elsewhere and pay a bit more.

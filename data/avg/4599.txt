I stayed there during the time between Christmas and New Years. The location is just fantastic as is it in the middle of everything. Had booked a superior room and was upgrading to a better room. There was a lot of confusion in checking in. The room that was available was a room with King bed (when I had asked for 2 queens). And it looked like somebody had jumped on the bed after making it. They then moved us to another room and said it had a fireplace and was better - but it was again a room with a King bed and no fireplace. Finally got a room with 2 queens and a fireplace - but this was no better than a regular fairmont room. The fireplace didn't work, the room faced Copley square but the window was beside a bed. The bathroom was small and it had two walk-in closets?? Also there was no coffee machine or kettle. To make it worse, it smelt like a smoking room. But we were tired and didn't want to move again. So just stayed there. Ended up paying for a superior room, wasting an upgrade certificate and all we got was a regular room. On the plus side, the concierge service was excellent. She knew the area well and gave great tips. And the meal in Oak Room was fantastic. Would love to go back and visit again - but will try the other Fairmont this time!

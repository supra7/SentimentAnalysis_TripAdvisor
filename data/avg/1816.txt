You need to be aware that the beach in front of the Hyatt has completely eroded away. There is no beach or beach access in front of the hotel. This is the ONLY hotel beach side in Kaanapali with this situation. You can hoof it over to the public beach park next store, but you will not have access to a chair or umbrella unless you buy them at Kmart. Or you can go in front of another hotel. Both options are inconvenient. Also, our room was positioned directly above the "Drums of the Pacific" Luau. Since it was Thanksgiving week and the Maui Invitational Tournament, there was a luau or event every night. The sound is deafening. Lasts from about 5PM-9PM. But if you are on the wrong time zone (like us) it seems like the loud music, MC, and drumming goes on until 1AM! The property is nice and the resort pool great. But we will not stay here again since we like beach and quiet

When we arrived at the Boston Park Plaza around 12:30 we were told our room was not ready and would be ready around 3:30. After eating lunch we arrived back at the hotel at the 3:30 and our room was still not ready. Finally, around 3:50 our room was ready. When we arrived at our deluxe room, disgusting was the only word to describe it. There was a stain on the pillow case(which looked like drool), the floor was ripped up, and there was hair all around the toilet. The TV was nowhere near the bed, making it impossible to lay down and watch tv. We complained to the management and they were very kind and upgraded us to a Towers level room. In the Towers room we got free internet, free calls, and a special lounge with free food and drinks all day. The room was much better, clean, tv was near the beds, and beautiful bathrooms. The first room was horrible but the second was great which is why I would give this hotel a half and half review.

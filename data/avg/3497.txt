1. Limited carpark lots with huge ants crawling in one particular lot 2. Long waiting time at the reception as only one receptionist was mending the counter 3. Room is small, complimentary mini bar is a total letdown with only small packet of twistie, prawn cracker and two non chilled coke 4. No provision of cotton earbud in toilet 5. Telephone set instruction unclear, called guest service to ask for extra shower gel and waited for one hr before I made a second call 6. Selection of DVDs is limited and most of the titles are unavailable 7. The only good thing about hotel re is their signature laksa and chicken pie. Bonus is they carry loccitane toiletries! 8. I will not pay close to $300 for such a business room

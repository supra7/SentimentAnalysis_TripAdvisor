Good about this hotel: Fairly good price. The rooms are modern and clean. The beds are really comfortable. The hotel is quiet, only little noise from the corridor. The hotel is located central in Berlin. Subway is by far the best way of getting around in Berlin, and the nearest subway station is only a few hundred meters away. Not so good about this hotel: The rooms are tiny and everything else than colorful. The nearest surroundings are Berlin-grey buildings, making the view or a walk in the neighborhood not very enchanting. You get the feeling that the hotel is much further away from the center than it really is. Rooms have no minibar, no pay-tv, and the hotel have no bar. The most negative with the hotel is the staff; the cleaning ladies came into my room not less than three times even if I hang the Do-not-disturb sign on the door; the receptionists were not friendly, helpful or interested in providing any service. I think it is important that the staff in a hotel actually likes working in the hotel business My conclusion is: Its a great hotel to stay at if you are in Berlin on your own, if you are looking for a cheap and central place to stay, if youre not a demanding customer, or if you are in Berlin for business trip. I would not recommend the hotel if you want a bit of luxury, if you want to live close to bars, nightclubs or restaurants, or if youre staying in Berlin for a romantic weekend. In the last case I would much rather stay at Hotel Berlin Meli.

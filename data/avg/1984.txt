We scheduled this week-long vacation in Maui to recover from family losses. My husband and I traveled with his mother who had just lost her husband to cancer. I called ahead to let the front desk manager know that we really really needed to have a good vacation and hoped that our room selection would be the best quality. We arrived late to find that the front desk manager had tried her best to find us a higher quality room and offered us a choice. I appreciated that she heard us and did her best to accomodate our request. The rooms are given A ratings or B ratings depending on how the owner had refurbished it. After considering both options, we chose a B rated 1 bedroom condo (E103) because it was SPACIOUS!!! It felt a little dingy and a bit outdated, but it provided the room and privacy that we needed. We're not luxury-type ppl anyway. The room was perfect for 3 ppl as there were dividers that we could draw between the 2 queen beds and another one between the bedroom and living room. Traveling with a mother-in-law is not easy, but this place made it bearable. CONS: no hot tub on premises PROS: golf cart that takes you to/fro room to Cabana on the beach, daily fresh towels, TIPS: You could probably walk to great snorkeling in front of the Westin hotel from the cabana. We drove to the beach, only to look down the way and realize, "hey! that's the Eldorado cabana!" It's also a nice walk to the Castaway restaurant where we enjoyed a nice oceanside breakfast (not as good as Gazebo, but no wait either).

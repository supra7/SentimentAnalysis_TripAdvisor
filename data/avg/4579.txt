Stayed 8/5/05-8/8/05. Easy to access, close to Commons and T, but not on par with other Hyatts. The entrance is little more than double doors tucked into the side of a building - we almost passed right by. During our 3 days there a doorman was on duty only intermittantly, and never at night. Twice when a doorman was actually on duty he ignored us as we got the door ourselves. We were allowed to check in at 10 AM; we found the desk staff was very friendly and one actually shook my hand and said "thanks for coming". The room, however, was not the product Hyatt normally offers. First, it was small and lacking any special character. In our other Hyatt stays we've found unusually shaped rooms and other amenities that set Hyatt apart from other chains simply offering a "nice" room. Not here, nothing other than the great Hyatt King Bed distinguished the room. Additionally, the AC was not quite adequate given that I like my room cool at night. The thermostat may have read 60 degrees but the room was considerably warmer, not uncomfortable, but not 60 degrees. Also one of the just two light bulbs in the bathroom was burned out and it's unclear how the maid could not have noticed given how dark it was in there. Finally, the ice machine on the 17th floor was empty our entire stay - my suspicion was that it simply made noise and not ice. In total, our complaints were minor; but it's the little things that the premium establishments get right. If the name on the front of the building had been Holiday Inn we would have said "very nice", but the name was Hyatt and accordingly, we expected more.

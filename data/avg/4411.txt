My sister and I went to this hotel as home-base, from where we could explore Cambridge and Boston during her birthday weekend. I did get a good price on Priceline, and since budgetary concerns were more important to us than a fancy hotel, I suppose it did serve our purposes. The hotel and the room were immaculately clean, and the room itself was ginormous (a big living room, big bathroom, and big bedroom - all separate!). On the flip side, I did find the hotel to be lacking some personality, somewhat stripped of any major decor, and in a really odd location....we got off the freeway and were right at the hotel, which would sound ideal, but in actuality we had to maneuver our car into the hotel's driveway despite being surrounded by other drivers going a billion miles an hour. Once we were in the hotel, however, we found it to be relaxing and quiet, with comfortable bedding, and a fairly receptive staff. We did use the shuttle service, which is wonderful and convenient. On the other hand, it runs on a fixed schedule, so we found ourselves having to plan around the shuttle schedule (still convenient, but important for other guests to be aware of). I did feel that it was worth the money - however, in contrast, I have had the wonderful experience of staying in another hotel in the heart of Boston that was bursting with personality and staff members who were eager to help. Would I stay here again? Yes, but only if I got a good bargain again.

We enjoyed our stay last weekend in # 216 ; pleasant check in around 11:00pm ,unfortunately the bar was closed ?... The room was modern and "different". The bed very comfortable..great shower. The AC was noisy and so was the mini-fridge..could be the echo in the room ? Unfortunately the carpet was also stained in a number of places. It was very difficult to open the coffee pouch, thanks to my trusted Swiss knife.

This hotel is located about 10-15 minutes walk from the Stradtford Tube Station and a couple of minutes by the bus the 86 and 25 which stop in front of the hotel (if you buy a travel card or Oyster card you have unlimited bus and tube rides). There is a Shopping Mall in front of the Stradtford Station where you can find supermarkets, clothes stores and fast food chains like McDonalds, Starbucks, KFC and Pizza Hut. There are two supermarkets very close to the hotel where you can buy fruits or drinks. The room was clean and there is an instant coffee and tea maker in the room. The breakfast was very basic. The receptionists were very friendly and willing to help and last day we left the luggage in the front desk while we went to downtown because the check out was at 10:30. Cons: The hotel doesnt offer Wi-Fi and is a bit away from the center. Pros: Good value for the money.

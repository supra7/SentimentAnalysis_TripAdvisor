I was apprehensive about staying at the Inn after reading a lot of bad reviews, but had a good stay regardless. I loved the fact that it was close to the Seattle center and great restaurants (mecca cafe, pagiacci pizza). The room was well kept, with a proper kitchenette which was always clean. Had to request extra pillows, but the staff couldn't have been nicer about it. There was also a free continental breakfast with muffins and bread, but I couldn't get up before ten. If you are a light sleeper I'd advise bringing ear plugs, since the exterior noise can be a but much sometimes. Also getting back to the hotel from the downtown area can be a bit confusing, since the monorail isn't working, so picking up a bus map would probably be a good idea as well, if you decide to go exploring. Otherwise everything was great.

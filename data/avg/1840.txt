After reading many reviews about the problems with mini bar . I decided when I check in to have housekeeping lock the min bar and remove all contents. Which they did. As I check out 11/3/07 You guessed it they 564.87 of mini bar sevices on my bill. I never even touch this thing which I know is motion dectected. After fighting with the front decks they removed the bill 45 mintues later. On 11/5/07 I was looking over my visa bill on the internet and found they charge me another 48.00 on my credit card for my last day at the resort. THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS.

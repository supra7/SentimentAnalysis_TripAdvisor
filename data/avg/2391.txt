I booked this hotel at the very last minute an event in London. I was looking for a cheap comfortable hotel as close to the centre of London as possible. The location of this hotel is fantastic as its only a 2 minute walk to Kings Cross Station. I booked this hotel on a third-party web site however upon arrival they had no booking for me. They were very friendly and found me another room which was available. The rooms are very small however they had ensuite facilities (shower dribbles) and television in the rooms. The hotel web site says parking is available outside the hotel HOWEVER it is 6 pence per minute and please take note that you can only stay for MAXIMUM of 2hrs with no return. On Saturdays after 1330 and all day Sunday it is free to park there for as long as you like. Another point to note if driving, both ends to Argyle Street are no entry as its a one way system. I found my way in via Crestfield Street and Argyle Square! I went out in the evening and didn't return until the early hours of the morning. The hotel is 24hr access however I had to stand out side ringing the doorbell for 15 minutes before anyone answered! For a cheap hotel this is a fantastic stay. I only paid 50 for a double ensuite room and I must say even though there were faults, you definatley get value for money for central London. Overall, a good clean basic hotel which is fabulously located only 2 minutes from Kings Cross Station. The staff are very friendly and helpful.

We just stayed 2 nights at this hotel. It was so fun being on the waterfront side, watching all the activity in the Bay and the cruise ships...beware rooms 264 and 266, they are over the bar area of the hotel and they have bands on Friday and Saturday night...LOUD does not describe what it does in your room. They do stop at midnight, but if you are trying to sleep before that..you wont! No cups in the bathrooms for rinsing your mouth or drinking the tap water....view is amazing at night from the lounge/restaurant...service in lounge area very slow...pretty bad...BUT, I would go back here knowing what to ask for now!

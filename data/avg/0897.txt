we stayed at the westin seattle for a long memorial day weekend. As soon as we walded through the door we noticed cardboard taped to the floor. At the service desk when we checked in teh furniture was all piled areound the perimeter of the lobby with the center area taped off. I asked upon check in if they were under renovation and was told they were just finishing up a lobby carpet project. When we got to our room we were not displeased but not overly excited about the room. We were on the 18th floor and had a great view of the space needle and the bed was awesome but other than that the room was nothing to write home about. We went to the swimming pool for a soak before getting ready for dinner. when we got there we found the entire area closed for renovation. I went to the customer service desk and was told that they don't tell people that the pool is out when they make reservations unless the customer asks. There was no sign at the desk upon check in to inform guests of the situation either. The man at the desk informed me that we could go to one of two other hotels to use their pool since they had arrangements with them for the time the westins pool is under renovation. I just feel the situation was completely unacceptable. I do not feel we received adequate customer service. We stay very frequently at hotels. I do not expect the red carpet treatment..just a reasonably comfortable stay with fair service. I will never stay at this hotel again...and I suggest if you are to stay there..inquire about the pool when you make your reservation. Also don't waste your time with the concierge or front desk...anytime I called the phone rang a minimum of eight times and then I was put on hold so long I hung up. parking was expensive ($38 per day I think). Internet was $6 per 15min in the lobby. I am not sure how much in the room.

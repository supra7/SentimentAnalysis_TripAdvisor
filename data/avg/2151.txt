Sorry Donald ..I wasn't impressed!!! Front desk service was ok, concierge lady was great!! I waited pool side for a drink ...no one came! Hall ways weren't very clean. My room restroom wasn't to clean either. Scum on the shower door. Toothpaste on the crevasses on the mirror Ewwwww! The walk to the hotel from the strip wasn't easy. No Shuttle back from the Wynn, after certain hours. Not to mention no casino. Sorry I expected so much more from the "TRUMP"!!

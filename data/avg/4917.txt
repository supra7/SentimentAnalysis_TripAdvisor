Beautiful Hotel - Poor Service Yesterday, we arrived at 11am (early) - front desk upsold us to a suite - beautiful suite. Told us it would be ready in about an hour... would put a rush on it. It was ready at 3pm. When I asked why it took so long when they 'rushed' it, I was told they did not have to guarantee any room until 3pm. What a spirit huh? They are offering Thanksgiving Dinner today, reservations only. There is no advertising of this... So, I asked at the front desk if we could get reservations. Sorry, all sold out. Can you imagine, not making dinner available to your own customer on Thanksgiving? I am very turned off by this hotel. Mgt can reach me in 16-250 if they wish... I will be here thru tomorrow (11/27) Regards, Ray

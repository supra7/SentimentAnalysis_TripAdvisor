The hotel lobby is terrible, it would not take much to renovate it and make it more luminous and fresh, it gives the impression of being dirty and dated (which I suspect it is). The hotel advertises its spa and hammam but surely you can find much better in Istanbul, I did not try either. The breakfast is so sad, only pre-packaged stuff, served inattentively in a dark room, most people opt to have breakfast outside on the street (where cars pass by) but you have to bring out all the stuff yourself. They have a great terrace but I guess is too much work for the staff to prepare it That said, the room was clean and fairly modern. The bathroom was clean although small. The strangest thing was that in the bathroom one could hear all the conversation going on in the next room.not very nice!

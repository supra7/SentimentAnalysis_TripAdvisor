I stayed here about ten years ago when the hotel first opened and was perfectly satisfied with my stay. Read a lot of negative reviews on TripAdvisor, but despite this we booked again given the great location and reasonable price. We were upgraded for some reason to a two room suite which had a view of the Sydney CBD. Generally the room was fine, there were just a few issues: 1. The air conditioner in the bedroom was extremely noisy and it was impossible to sleep with it on. It got rather hot and stuffy around 4am when I got up switched it on for a bit and then turned it off and went back to sleep. 2. The internet service in the room is extremely expensive - 55 cents a minute with a cap at $27 per day. And given that it isn't even wireless. Also you had to use the ethernet cable provided (as it couldn't be removed from the socket) and it prevented working in a more comfortable location in the room (I brought my own very long cable). 3. The hotel has parking underneath the building but it is more expensive than the car park at the other end of Thomas Street. Also when we showed up someone was parked across the entrance so we couldn't use it anyway. It's good we weren't already parked in the carpark and couldn't get out!

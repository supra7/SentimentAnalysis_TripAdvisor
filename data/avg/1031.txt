Stayed at the W in Seattle last weekend. The location is very good but I find the hotel to be overrated. The parking is expensive, $45.00 / night with taxes. The bathroom has no shelf space, only the top of the counter around the sink, the television does not show what programs are playing only the channel listing, the room is listed to be large yet 1/4 of the size is the front hallway which is wasted space, the lobby is very dark, there is no WIFI in the rooms, the feather pillows are awful, requested foam and they were slightly better. None of these issues are serious, but I expected better.

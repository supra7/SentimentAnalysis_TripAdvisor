We stayed at the Omni with 3 teenagers in Sept, 2009. I very clearly requested adjoining rooms and the front desk confirmed this at check in. The rooms were not connected, however, and when I pointed out that the word adjoining means connected, the front desk manager told me that in this hotel, that is not what the word means, so I had no reason to expect it to be so. She then assured me that the rooms were next to each other (adjacent), but not connected (adjoining, as she acknowledged we had requested). On arrival to our assigned floor we were disappointed to find that the rooms were not connected and not next to each other, they were on opposite sides of the hall. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, the reply was, essentially, "too bad." There was no attempt to make it right or otherwise satisfy us. This is quite a contrast to other hotels of similar grade where when a mistake was discovered, I received a quick apology (instead of a foolish argument) and a token offer (rather than "too bad"). Finally, I did receive an email from the Omni inviting my comments after our stay. I sent in the above and promptly received another email thanking me and "you will receive a response in 48 hours." That was a month ago. Location is good, rooms were clean and there are plenty of equivalent hotels with better service within walking distance. We stayed at the Sheraton around the block a couple of years ago and had better service; we didn't return because the Omni was closer to a family gathering this time. We'll walk the extra block and avoid the Omni in the future.

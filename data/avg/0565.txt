I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for two days attending a convention at the hotel. As previous reviews have stated the location is excellent. Easy walking distance to shopping, Pike Place Market and a short cab ride to stadiums, etc. There are two towers in this hotel - the newer Union St. Tower and the original Pike St. Tower. I had king room in the Pike St. Tower. The room is spacious but starting to show signs of wear and tear. I was dissappointed with the bed compared to comparable hotels - sheets had extra starch. Housekeeping could use some training as floors were not vaccumed, bathroom counters not wiped down etc. Front desk staff friendly and effecient. Great fitness center with modern equipment on the 35th floor. For the money, I think there are comporable hotels that would provide more for the same money.

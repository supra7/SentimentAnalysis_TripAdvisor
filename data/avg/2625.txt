The Wyndham Garden is in a very convenient, quiet loction on a side road. The rooms are small but perfectly formed and are very clean. Only gripe was that only one lift was working for the duration of our stay (6 days) which was annoying and the desk staff didn't appaer to care. Overall a good, clean place to stay.

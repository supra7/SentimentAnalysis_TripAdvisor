I stayed here on a business trip and was suprised how expensive the rooms were- I paid $189 for a group rate for a conference at the hotel. I've stayed in much, much better hotels for similar rates such as the Hyatt Regency in Scottsdale (during off season) and the Gaylord Palms in Orlando. The hotel itself and rooms were ok but I'd expect more for this rate. The rooms were recently updated and were fine. The pool was tiny but the hottub was dirty and the jets didn't work. There wasn't much at the hotel to enjoy; no great scenery or grounds, nothing to do in the hotel. One major dissapointment was the hotel's main restaurant. It seems as if they are trying to be a 4-star dining experience but the dining room was dingy, dirty, and outdated. There were stains on the chairs, napkins, etc. and we were sat at a table that had lots of little ants walking around on it. We asked to move tables and strangely enough they didn't remove the ants but sat another couple there a little while later! This couple noticed right away and asked to be moved also. Also, for some reason there was a portable heater blowing hot air near our table even though it was in the 70s outside. The food was sub-par and it seemed like the dining room was an extension of the room service as we were given small bottles of coke (instead of coke in a glass) and miniture sizes of mustard, etc. Doesn't seem 4-star to me! We did get room service which was fine but our steak came out rare when we asked for medium. Of course overpriced as in most hotels with an automatic $3.50 surcharge and 21% gratuity added on top. I saw them charging $17 for an omelette and $15 for three pancakes- crazy! The only thing going for this hotel is probably it's location to alot of other dining, nightlife, shopping, etc. Oh yeah, one good thing was the toiletries- they were by the salon brand Rusk and very good. I'm sure you can find more elsewhere for these rates!

So I hate going to Baltimore (frequently) as the hotel choices are pretty shabby - most need work! I was excited that this Hilton just opened and the rooms were clean and the staff was nice. But they still have a lot of work to do- the little things were missing. No robes, slow room service, no bottles of water for purchase anywhere (not in the room, not in the vending machine) and I refuse to use those nasty glasses in the room. I def recommend the upgrade otherwise the view is awful. And it was one of the best hotel gyms I've ever worked out in - very large, big, good machines and great view of Camden Yards. I would stay again, but if it were any other city I'd be at a better hotel ina second. For Baltiomore it's top notch.

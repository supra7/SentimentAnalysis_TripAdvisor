I stayed at the Mikon Eastgate Hotel for a long weekend to attend a scientific symposium at the Natural History Museum (Museum fr Naturkunde) of Berlin. The hotel was perfectly located being located less than a hundred meters from the Museum itself. The main reception which is open 24 hours a day is located on the fifth floor of the building, near the terrace and the breakfast room. Breakfast is well priced at 7.5 Euros and was buffet style catering for everyone's tastes. The single room was clean, very large, light and comfortable with two large windows open on an open space between the buildings, a desk, cupboard and a large en-suite bathroom. The hotel also offered free high-speed WIFI access in the room which is always greatly appreciated. The hotel is situated less than 20 minutes easy walk to the centre of Berlin and the main tourist attractions. I would most definitely return and stay at the hotel especially for business purposes, but maybe not for a romantic escapade.

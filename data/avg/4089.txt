I'm here right now for a business event . I was unimpressed as soon as I walked into my room. It looks a little old (early 1990's maybe) and not in the "colonial" way they probably intended. I found hair (not my own) in the bathroom sink. I've stayed at nicer hotels for a fraction of the high rate here. Not impressed.

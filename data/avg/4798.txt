Stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for a conference. The lobby and conference facilities were beautiful, and the location of the hotel would be hard to beat. But the guest room was pretty depressing. Dingy, poor lighting, peeling paint, a window looking across a small courtyard into other guest room windows. One shouldn't expect a room in an older hotel to be large, but the layout of the furniture was a bit ridiculous - the space between the desk and armoir (leading into the bathroom) was perhaps 14 inches! If location is important to you, this might be a good choice. But I wouldn't recommend the Palmer House for any other reason.

Sat in my room at Hotel Max as I type - lovely from the outside (both from the street and the great art touch to the halls) and I couldn't have found the staff more helpful when I checked-in. My room is 'cosy' but I think really quite a fine size - bigger is not always better people! There's less of a focus on art once in the room than I expected, but not a deal breaker. The bathroom is small but clean and I can say that mine at least has character - blending old marble flooring with steel and charcoal design features. Sadly my stay in this double aspect room is marred by: - The restaurant industrial fan outside my window (I'm on 5th floor) which kicks in every 10/15mins - One of the windowed walls looks straight into an office opposite and it's close...real close - Below the same window is the office back lot with dumpsters which several vans have pulled up to and used well after business hours - I also had 20 mins of cleaning and hoovering in the room next door at 10.40pm which I only object to because the walls are so thin! Would have to caveat any recommendation to friends and family with all of the above!

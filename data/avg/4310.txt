This hotel is on a grand scale and built in 1927. It's typical of it's era and looks very impressive outside and also when entering the foyer. However, the rooms are pretty average and unless you wish to take advantage of the ambience of the ground floor facilities (piano player in restaurant etc) i would look elsewhere. Cost was around 200 dollars per night (special rate). Elevators seem to take an age to arrive even though 6 are available. If a nice room is important to you look elsewhere in Boston as there is better value for your dollar.

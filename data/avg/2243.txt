I got this hotel off of Hotwire when I had to go to Las Vegas last second. The price on hotwire was great ($100 a night) and it was a good value because of that, but by no means is this a five star hotel. Valet service took forever. It was a strange check in, just not the feel of a nice hotel that knows what is going on. We had all of our confirmation papers from Hotwire, but they could not find my reservation. It took about ten minutes, which was fine, but they acted like it was my fault. Their rooms were really nice when you walked in, but there were a lot of little things that were broken (marks against the wall, broken handle to the bathroom, stains in the rug). I was just in Vegas on a quick business trip, but I would not have like this hotel if I was on vacation. There was not an option to park your car other than valet, which you were charged for, there was a hotel/destination fee that was not included in the rate (which did not include use of internet or gym) and you had to pay to get into the pool...which I have not heard of before. Anyway, I would stay here again for the same rate, but would not pay rack rate for this hotel as a "5 star" property

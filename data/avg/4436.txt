My daughter let me out with the luggage and then disappeared into a maze of one way streets to get back to check in with me. Very unusual that there is not room for another car to pass. Check in very efficient,noted Hilton status,got free Wifi,water etc.41 dollars for parking does seem excessive,even for Downtown Boston. Comfy room even if the overriding color was "biscuit", "taupe", it just looked brown to me.Fridge didnt work ,bedside light didnt work,telly didnt work.Engineering fixed the televison. Bathroom o.k. no grab bars but I didnt request an accessable room,just thought of safety as opposed to accessability. Great to have Starbucks in the lobby.

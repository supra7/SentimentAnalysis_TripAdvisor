This is a run down Sheraton geared for business travelers with expense accounts. They have spruced it up a bit with fabulous new beds, but the pop corn ceilings and worn out carpet (our carpet was seriously worn out if not nasty) remind you that this property is old and dated. Plan to pay a princely sum for parking. Location is central and excellent.

I am baffled by all the five star reviews this hotel has gotten. It has a great location and the bellman/valet personnel are wonderful, but the hotel overall is average. Nothing special about the service or the hotel. It is a small, somewhat tired property and we were surprised to find ourselves in the handicapped room. The front desk attendant failed to ask if this was acceptable (which, in my experience, is always usually done...even at the Hampton Inn level hotel). My husband couldn't get his head under the shower head without bending over and since it was the handicapped "removable" type shower head it had trouble staying in place. It would slip out of the holder and proceed to flood the bathroom floor since there was no shower ledge separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom floor. We wouldn't stay here again.

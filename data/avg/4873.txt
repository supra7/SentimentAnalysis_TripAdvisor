Find a cheap rate for a king size room at the Palmer in Chicago. Was very excited until I stepped into the room. The bed was taking all the room space. We always bumped into the tv stand or the desk. We could hear the neighbors taking their shower or watching tv. Ok the lobby was nice and beautiful, but we don't sleep in the lobby. No Wireless Internet in the rooms as well. The location was perfect since it was on Monroe and State Street and the cab only cost $5 to go everywhere we wanted.

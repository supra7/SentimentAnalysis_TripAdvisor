the hotel is in a great location, the room was good, not the most spacious ever but good. you couldn't swing a cat in the bathroom so if you like luxurious bathrooms this is NOT the hotel for you. The housekeeping service had a tendency to call very early to make up the rooms. The reception staff were less than welcoming when we arrived before the check in time of 3 (only 30mins before). Overall a good but fairly standard hotel

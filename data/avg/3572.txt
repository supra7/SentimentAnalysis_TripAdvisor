The walls are very thin, so when the neighbors next door came back at midnight and talked until 2 am, I heard every word (even though I put earplugs in and had a pillow over my head). Also, my room was in the same hallway as the management offices, so during the day, there is a lot of talking and conversing back and forth across the offices, which makes it very noisy as well. For some reason, they don't close the doors to the management offices. Also, be aware that their restaurant doesn't open for lunch, so you have to grab something elsewhere for lunch. It is a pet friendly hotel, and they have a lovely dog that greets guests at the front desk...but be warned if you have pet allergies. I had read the reviews about the shower in the middle of the room - it is very odd that the shower is adjacent to the bed except for a sheer curtain.

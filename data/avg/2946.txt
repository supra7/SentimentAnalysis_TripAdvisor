We booked this hotel because the reviews commented on the fast internet. However, our ethernet connection was extremely slow (and we could never see the wifi from our room). The lobby was crowded with people complaining about the Internet in the lobby on our first night because it didn't work at all, when we got it back on the second day it worked but extremely slowly. This is how slow it was during our three-day stay: half of the links off of Google news didn't work, I couldn't lgo into my yahoo email account, and anything that needed to be secure failed (purchasing anything online, checking accounts). No videos could be streamed. The workaround was to go to the publicly available computer, but this is an annoying workaround. The receptionist at the desk admitted that the hotel rooms were on a different system than the publicly available computer, and didn't seem surprised when I said that my hotel room internet was slow. Another couple at the hotel said they could watch videos on their iphone on the wifi, so maybe if we could have seen the wifi access point, it would have been faster. We had one of the more expensive rooms which was clean and spacious and quiet (but maybe it was too far away from the wifi access point?). If you're the type who travels with a laptop, I would not recommend this place.

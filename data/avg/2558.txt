Basic but clean and great value for money. Stayed with a friend and our 2 young daughters for 2 nights. Had a room facing Euston Road the first night and managed about 1 hours sleep max - horns, sirens, buses outside the window all night and the double glazing was shockingly poor as we could hear people's footsteps out on the pavement. They moved us the next morning to a much quieter room and we had a blissful nights sleep. Moral of story - email ahead and ask for a room that does not face onto the street!

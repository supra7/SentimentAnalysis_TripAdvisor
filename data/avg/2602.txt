The Wyndham Garden offers simple accommodations with a minimum of frills. The lobby is small and congested, so if there are several people coming/going/checking in--as there was when I checked in--it can be a bit of a mob scene. And for those of you who might need a business center--or even just a station to print out a airline boarding pass--there's a small computer shoehorned into the corner of the lobby as well. Such "busyness" also lends itself to some frustration. The two elevators are routinely in service (often by cleaning staff), resulting in long waits up and down. If your room is on a lower floor, you'd be better off taking the stairs. Also, housekeeping tends to work well into the afternoon and early evening, leaving towels/sheets stacked or piled in the hallways and stairs throughout the day. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but when exiting the elevator, there isn't a lot of room in the hallways to maneuver. The room itself was fine. The flat screen TV was a nice feature, and the work area well lighted and comfortable. The only downside (and one to be aware of) is that my room--on the 5th floor--faced out to the street. It was very noisy at night, and especially late at night when garbage trucks were making their noisy rounds. You may want to ask in advance how removed (or not) your room is relative to such activity.

I want to start by saying although I am a born & bred Okie....I have been a Red Sox fan my whole life. So, I always wanted to go to Fenway for a Red Sox/Yankees game. At 47, my husband finally made that dream come true. Glad I went, but will never go back. This hotel was o.k., but NOT as great as the price shows they are. We have traveled a LOT in our marriage & Boston has to be the most rude people we have ever met. We got royally screwed right off the bat by a cabbie. He made us pay more than what the meter showed....has anyone ever heard of that?? The only folks more rude than Boston people were the Yankee fans that were there. I am so glad I got to live out my dream...glad I got to see the Green Monster....glad I got to chant "Yankees Suck" while wearing my Ellsbury jersey in Fenway Park. But, sometimes things are better as a fantasy than a reality. Wish I would have realized that about Boston!

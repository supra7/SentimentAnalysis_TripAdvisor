We stayed at the Magnolia for a wedding. The service was fantastic! Unfortunately the crazy elevators are one of the main reasons why we would not stay there. We requested a king size bed and they only have those available on the top floor. It would take a minimum of 10 -15 minutes to get a elevator for the 26th floor. And then the ride would make you a little sick to your stomach...fast then stop then rattle. Second was the temperature in out bedroom. We ended up having to sleep with no covers because the room would not cool off. Texas can be hot, but the weather was in the low 60"s so it shouldn't have been that warm in the room! Overall great service, but we wouldn't stay in the Magnolia in Downtown Dallas again.

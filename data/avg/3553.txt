Accommodation good and most of staff very friendly and helpful. Location is good and owners have put a lot of thought into detail. Nice restaurant area and seating areas. We were in the third villa which unfortunately does not have internet but there is a business centre. Our only gripe was that we had no hot water on two mornings of our six day stay. Really not fun taking a cold shower at 7am before heading off to the airport!

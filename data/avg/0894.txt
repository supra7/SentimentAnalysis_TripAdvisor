My husband and I just got back from a long weekend in Seattle. We stayed at the Westin downtown. It has a great location, easy walking to all the fun stuff that Seattle offers. On the down side, it was not up to usual Westin standards. The buildings are round towers, so the rooms are pie shaped and very small. The bathrooms are equally small, barely room for one to use. The beds are the typical Westin Heavenly beds and very comfortable. The carpet was stained badly and our room was never cleaned until four or five in the afternoon. It is a very busy hotel with lots of convention and cruise ship traffic. We had asked for a view and were told our room had a very nice one, we were on the 37th floor, but looked across at the hotel's other tower. There is no sit down place for breakfast or lunch, just a starbucks type coffee shop. We ate at Coldwater Grill one night for dinner, very nice meal, but also pricey. One thing to watch out for, the MINIBAR. They do mention this when you check in, You touch it, you bought it. You get charged if you take an item out to read the label and put it back, so be warned. My husband and I booked this hotel as part of a package deal, so the price was right, but no way would I pay over $200 a night, the regular rate, for this hotel.

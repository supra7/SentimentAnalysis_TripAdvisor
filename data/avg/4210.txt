I booked a junior suite at the Park Plaza for our family vacation. Upon check in, there were no junior suites, so we were upgraded to some fabulous 2-room suite on the 15th floor of the Towers. It was lovely and the 15th floor suites include complimentary evening appetizers and morning breakfast. The 2-room suite accomodated us nicely and we were very gracious for the upgrade. However, the airconditioning would not go below 77-degrees (It was set to be 64-degrees when we arrived)!. Granted, on day one, Boston got hit by the near 100-degree heat wave. On day 2, i made 3 requests between 9 am and 10:45 pm for the AC to be looked at and i also requested a portable fan for the room. Sleeping night number one was miserable, difficult and hot! Anyhow, after my 3rd request for assistance, and it was now 11:15 PM and I needed to go to bed, so i walked down to the front desk and nicely explained my unhappiness and discomfort. The desk clerk appologized profusely and gave me her portable box fan from behind the counter. I was happy to have a fan at last, but displeased that my 3 earlier requests were disregarded. On day number 3 the room temp with AC would still only go down to 77, although the weather out was pleasant and mildat 78-degrees. We opened our windows and slept with them open because it was cooler out than in. All other aspects of the hotel were grand. The location right by a T station and 1 block from the Boston Public Garden can't be beat. The hotel is not cheap to stay at, and we were still paying a good chunk of change to stay there regardless of recieving an upgrade, so it is not accecptable to disregard a guests request for room comfort. Still, despite the AC situation, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again.

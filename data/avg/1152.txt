I was in Seattle for company meetings. When I'm in Seattle, I usualy stay at Marriotts or Starwood hotels, however, for this trip we stayed at the Hotel Max to keep our lodging costs down. The hotel is an older remodeled hotel. The interior is very nice and the design and decor are modern and contemporary. Being Platinum with Marriott and Starwood, I felt out of place at this hotel. I'm accustomed to a quick and friendly check-in, a club lounge and a spacious room. However, at this hotel, the staff doesnt even make an attempt to make your stay any better. I advise other business travelers to stick with your loyalty hotels. When I checked in, the front desk staff was dry and not very friendly. I then proceeded to stay in one of the smallest rooms I've ever been in. FYI, don't book a Queen room. The room is barely big enough for the bed. There's hardly any room to walk around. Since there's no sitting space, you're forced to spend the day sitting in your bed. The bathroom and shower are extremely small and separate from each other. They converted a closet into a shower. The bed linens were old and uncomfortable. My biggest complaint about this room was the temperature. There was a window unit that wasn't regulated by temperature. When it was on, it got really hot and stuffy; and if you turned it off, it got really cold because the windows are poorly sealed. So there's no happy median for the temperature On my second night, I asked to move to a king room. It was a little better. The room was a bit larger and more like a normal room. Great hotel for younger budget minded folks, but not for the picky business traveler. If you do stay here, book a king.

The Warwick is an average hotel in a great location. The service is always very good; the rooms are very average - nothing terrible, just an "old" feel to everything. Like the hotel could use a great makeover someday soon! But it's located directly across the street from my offices (I live in Denver but my company is based here in Seattle). You've got the view of the Space Needle, a "smoking" floor, and very good service. The downstairs restaurant, Margaux, is very good, too. I could stay at other hotels when I'm in town, but they're all more expensive and further away from "work." So I usually opt for the Warwick. Most times I have a cheese and fruit tray waiting on me upon arrival. So it's a comfortable business alternative. Not sure I'd recommend it for vacationing families, though.

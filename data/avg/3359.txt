The rooms are actually small studios, well designed, sufficiently spacious and in our opinion about the only highlight of staying at this hotel. This said be careful which room you get as our room looked out on to a large building less than a small street's width away and consequently it was extremely dark with absolutely no view. Don't expect too much of the Bose sound system either. The hotel is ideal if you have business in the City / CBD but for a weekend break, we suggest not as it is particularly quiet in that area, the location requires you to walk quite some distance to find decent eateries that are either open / have clientele, probably be better when all the development in the immediate area is complete .. probably 2 years away.

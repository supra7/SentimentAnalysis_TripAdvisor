I expected more from a hotel of that caliber. You have to pay 22 bucks for overnight valet, but right around the corner there is overnight parking for 8 bucks. They need to inform their guests about their parking options. The only reason I was aware was because I did my research before. At no time was I told that I would be charged 22 dollars to park overnight at the hotel by the valet or the front desk. I booked two suites for me and a friend. I requested that they be on high floors and in close proximity. My friend was on the 8th floor and I was on the 23rd. In the bedroom, only 3 of the 4 windows had blinds and one set was warped. Besides these little hiccups, the staff was nice, courteous and I had a great time. The room was nice, the valet service was excellent and I would not mind staying here again.

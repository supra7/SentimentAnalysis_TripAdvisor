The hotel is just 10 to 15 minutes walk away from orchard road and the nearest mrt statuion (somerset).hawker foods just across teh street. fairprice supermarket just right beside the hotel. watson and the hotel restaurant are just downstairs. Rooms designs are very dull and typical of the 3 star budget hotels. the elevator is very difficult to use ad higher floors requires the card to be swiped before you can push the buttons. The free wifi internet is very FAST. Buffet breakfast is OK (not a variety of selections).No free bottled water in the room, good thing that the supermarket is minutes away.

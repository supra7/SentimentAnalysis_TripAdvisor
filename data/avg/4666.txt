The good: Comfortable room and bedding Great location in Chicago (except for noise) Friendly, helpful staff Free internet The bad: The fire station next door answers 4-6 calls per night. If you are a light sleeper you will be awakened. The free breakfast is atrocious. Dry scrambled eggs, toast and cereal in an overcrowded and dirty room.

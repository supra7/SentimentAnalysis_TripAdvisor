I recently stayed here for a convention because it was recommended by our convention coordinator. For a 4-star hotel, it did not quite meet my expectations. The rooms were small and amenties such as coffee, etc were sparse. There was a coffee maker with coffee but no creamer or sugar and we had to move it to find a place to plug it in. It was on a shelf in the closet. The small refrigerator in the closet was nice though. The shower made so much noice when you turned it on I thought the pipes would burst through the walls. Not quite what I expected for this level of hotel. The shuttle service that was promised was basicly non-existent, unless you wanted to walk 2-3 blocks to the Adolphus to be picked up. The front desk was nice and helpful. Overall, this hotel was nice and clean, but for the price, I would stay somewhere else.

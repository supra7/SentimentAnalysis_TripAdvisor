Check in to this hotel wasn't nice. The Girl on the front desk seemed Bored and not really in the mood to deal with us. The Hotel lobby is small but clean . Althought this hotel is new. its wearign badly. The hallways are dull and the carpets need a good clean. The Rooms are a good size, but once again the carpet was stained and needed a good clean. the bathrooms were spotless . the beds were very comfy and a good size. the hotel is only 5/10 mins walk from the beach. 5 euro in a taxi to the las rampas area. I think for the price that i would stay here again.

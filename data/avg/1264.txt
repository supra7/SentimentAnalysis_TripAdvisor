This is a great place to stay if you want to go to a Seahawks game. The hotel itself is mostly quiet. My only complaint is that others guests lets thier children run around the multiple floors and elevators playing tag and this went on quite late. We had a corner room and didn't hear the clatter and screching unless we were in the front room. The other noise came from road resurfacing that we COULD hear in the bedroom, this however was NOT the hotel's fault. The breakfast is decent. Internet access charges, PARKING fee, and TV/movie fees make the hidden charges mount up fast. All in all this is a good place to stay with friendly staff and VERY close to the starting station of Seattle's light rail. The hotel's shuttle will even take you there free. Lots of shopping close by if you desire.

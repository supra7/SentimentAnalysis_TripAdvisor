I won't restate what has been said in earlier reviews. This is a stay overnight for a cruise hotel. I am on business and an $8 cab ride to downtown. The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace. The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies. The one issue i must stress is do not--I repeat--do not take the overhead train cars to or from the hotel area after 6pm. Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone. If you don't know the system you will go around in circles and the cars are invested with local hoodlums and drunks. There is no police presence...ever! Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight. They don't get off they just ride in circles and look for trouble. There were two young girls on board that were terrified...I told them to get off the tram with me--they did and I put them in a cab to their hotel. I have been travelling to Miami for years and it just gets worse every year. The downtown is a ghost town except for a couple of hotels and Bayside. Do not wander off the main strip! One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste. I complained to the "manager" and she told me that it was "their culture". Huh? So, if you are staying one night and then heading to the cruise terminal it is fine...anything more than that look at a more upscale place in a better area of town.

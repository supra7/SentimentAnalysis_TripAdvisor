We stayed at the Seattle Westin on July 22 and 23, 2010. We booked through hotwire. The location is excellent. It is very close to Macy's and the main downtown shopping area, as well as the Pike Street Market. However, our room was somewhat disapointing. The bathroom was not particularly clean. There was a strange ventilation- related whistling sound present in the bathroom at all times. One of the phones did not work. Having paid only $108 per night for our room, however, we still considered the room to be good value for the location.

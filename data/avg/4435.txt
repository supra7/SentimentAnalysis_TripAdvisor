I recently stayed here for two nights. I chose this location due to its proximity to the Hynes Convention Center were I was taking a very stressful licensing exam. I had many issues with my room including overly hot temperatures, dirty pillow cases, a mini-fridge whose temperature was set too high (all the contents became frozen causing a soda to explode all over my exam materials), AND a bathtub that was not properly set in its foundation. I honestly expected more from this hotel, and it added more stress to an already stressful two days of exams. However, despite all these issues, the front desk and engineering department were great. Mario in engineering should receive an award for his patience he had with me. Although I was offered another room for my last night, I decided against it because I needed to study. I think it's important to voice your concerns in order for the hotel staff to do their best possible to remedy their situation and for the hotel to improve/learn from their mistakes. The great customer service at this hotel is worth noting, and I hope that all the issues in room 1207 will be fixed for the next hotel customer. I hope the Quality Assurance takes note of this experience.

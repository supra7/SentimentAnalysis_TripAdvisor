Nice private bath, comfortable beds, freedom of easy access to Rome sites but this B&B just wasn't quite all we had hoped for. The breakfast is a sweet gesture but not sustaining. The rooms didn't have a/c but the fan was a welcome addition. The host and other help was very kind. You won't go wrong but it may not be perfect.

My wife and I stayed here for two nights as a stopover enroute to Europe after a vacation on the West coast. We did not really know what to expect but had figured out that the Inner Harbour was the place to be. The Hilton Garden Inn appeared to fit the bill and it did. We had a comfortable clean room and the location was excellent for the exploration of all that the inner harbour has to offer. The breakfast was average and as reflected in other reviewer's posts this hotel could benefit from a bit of "tightening up" The dining options in the inner harbour were a bit disappointing - plenty of choice but very definately 'corporateland' with their standard offerings. Perhaps Fells Point offers better options - we did not have time to find out. The Water Taxis are a great way of getting around and the tour of the Orioles ball park was a highlight of our stay.

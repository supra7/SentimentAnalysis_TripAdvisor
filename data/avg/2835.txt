This cozy hotel is located perfectly close (10 min walk) to the train station. Also, it is in close proximity to most attractions of Rome. The rooms are spacious and clean. If you're like to get a room that doesn't faces the street, this is the place to stay. We were not that lucky! We barely slept 2 of the 4 nights we were there. Maybe some better isolation or better windows can fix the issue. Other than that, no complains. The breakfast was awesome too.

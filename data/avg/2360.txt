Stayed here early August 2010. Resort: nice layout, traditional u-shape with a little over 250 rooms. Bonus is the 300 acre Eco park. Swam in the cenotes. Kayak and excellent nursery area. Great to se a resort working on so many green initiatives. Beach: eh, not my favorite in the area, there are workers that work extremely hard to keep the area weed free but there is a slight build up in the water. Bali beds were semi shaded in the afternoon which was fantastic. Pool: adults only area had lots of children by the tail end of the day, appeared child free most of the time. Plenty of chairs and umbrellas available. Meeting space: clean new area with ability to do several configurations and set ups, great for a large Corp or incentive meeting. Separate from hotel but close enough that you can still run back to your room or for a bite to eat. Food: lunch at the buffet was good, dinner not so good. Pizza was ok, cheese had a different flavor than US pizza. Lots of luck with room service, made up our own dishes and they were delivered with a smile and tasted great. Overall very clean and spacious rooms. Ability to have king bed suite tied to a two bedded queen room, great for a family or large group traveling together. No pool bar which was disappointing. No real bar to meet friends or your group for an evening cocktail, there is a game room with a bar attached but didn't go out in the evening to se the scene there. Recommended for families looking to introduce green concepts to their children, water conservation, recycling, flora and fauna nursery and Eco park within the resort. Would not recommend to couples or groups looking for nightlife.

Very disappointed in the Internet, not even free in the lobby. Luckily, I had a room overlooking the Courtyard Marriott next door, who offer free Internet and have very good signal strength! The rooms themselves were awesome. Big and comfortable, great bed. Housekeeping did a great job. Prefer the breakfast buffet over the Embassy's line up, but it is a good trade off to get the cook to order eggs.

We stayed here June 2011. Had a problem with our toilet not working properly. This was a problem that occurred the whole week we were there. Every night we had to call the front desk to send someone up to fix it. They were happy to Come up and plunge the toilet every time we asked , but still..... One day I came back to the room to find water all over the bathroom floor. We would not stay here again. One of the "engineers" that were sent up to help said the toilets don't work when the hotel becomes full. Also at this resort you will find overcrowding in the morning at breakfast. On a positive note, the resort has a wonderful pool area which my 12 year old thoroughly enjoyed. Food is nothing but just ok.

a) No 'Shuttle Bus' for the Airport. Taxi Fare to Barajas, Terminal #4 was approx. 30 Euros. This was double the cost of a Taxi to Plaza de Colon. Same distance. b) Volvoreta Restaurant not opening until 8.30pm. Could benefit from an earlier opening at say 7.00pm ; possibly losing foreign guests going out to eat externally ? c) Spa treatments ridicuously over priced, even by London Spa standards. d) No 'Movie' Channel Service on offer. The great points are ..... a) Excellent King Size Beds. b) Good Basement Bar c) Excellent service from ALL Staff

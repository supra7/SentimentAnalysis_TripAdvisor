First off, this is possibly the only Marriott in Latin America without wifi in the rooms. Not sure I understand why it is not offered. When I checked in there was no ethernet cable in the room, I had to call the front desk to get them to deliver one. Second, the drain in the bathroom between the toilet and the tub emits a weird odor (room 1221). Third, I have yet to figure out why this Marriott insists on you signing a "bill" in the executive lounge that has a zero balance. Not sure there are any other Marriott's that require this, it is possibly a ploy to get tips. I now have to travel to Mexico City on a regular basis and am quite loyal to Marriott, but this hotel just is not up to the standards of other Marriott properties.

This hotel was adequate for what I was looking for. The price was right and there was ample space for 4 people. The full breakfast included in the price was satisfactory. Outside of the breakfast, this is a pretty no-frills establishment- no pool or room service, but that was fine with me. The location is a little shady, but the French Quarter is just a block or 2 away.

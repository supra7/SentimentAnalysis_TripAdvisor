We got the room on Priceline for $169 so saying that- it was good. If I had paid regular price I would be disappointed. The room was pretty clean, except for residual soap scum in the soap holder in the shower. The room was small but a great view. Our friends were on the other side of the building and they too had a nice view. Lobby was nice but nothing grand. The bed was AWFUL! There were 2 very large sags on both sides of the queen bed and the mattress was SOFT. Our backs hurt in the morning. The Bar/Pub was good- glad it was open late -at least 12am-as we were hungry when we returned after the Sox game. Great location to all the usual Boston sites. We walked to Fenway. We used the parking- expensive but not anymore than anywhere else in the city. Overall -it was good for the price. If you are willing to pay full price- I would look elsewhere. There are many choices in the area.

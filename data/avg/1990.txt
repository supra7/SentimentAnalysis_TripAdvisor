We stayed at the Maui Outrigger Eldorado in 2005 as well and it was average then. I don't understand how these people rate their rooms. They rated K112 as 4 star -yeah right - I don't think so. Maybe 3 star but more likely 2.5 star. If you have kids, this is an ok place to stay. Everything worked and we used the kitchen to make a lot of meals but this place needs updating in a big, bad way. Oh and we asked for our room to have a door so that we could shut the door on the bedroom when the kids went to sleep. Not sure what was so hard about comprehending that but we didn't get a door to the bedroom so we listened to our twin 1 year old boys scream themselves to sleep. Good times. The pools are ok - not very busy. The beach is great when there's no torrential rain storms going on. Whaler's Village is close enough to walk to, which is nice and Lahaina is a quick drive. The location is great but many of the rooms need to be rennovated. My husband's parents stayed in K200 and although it is a large suite, it needs to be rennovated as well.

The location of this hotel is perfect, if an overnight at the airport is what you need. Its located right outside Terminal 3. Check in always has a line (even at 4 am). Note - while it is a hotel, the corridors are open to the outside, with no ac. I now know this because my room was as far from the elevators as it was possible to be and lugging 2 heavy bags in the heat and humidity left something to be desired. My biggest complaint was noise and not just from the airport (which is to be expected). I had finally fallen asleep when the ipod machine went off full blast at 11:47 pm. Obviously, it had been set by a prior guest and woke me (and several other rooms) up, despite being turned off. I never got back to sleep after that, in part because of the party boys occupying the room next door, who seemed to feel that shouting, pounding on doors and running the halls at 1 am seemed like a good idea. All any of us wants from an airport hotel is a good nights sleep between flights. You won't get it here.

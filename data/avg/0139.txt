I live in the North Suburbs of Seattle and a friend an I wanted to have a night of fun in the city and to not have to worry about driving home. The location is great - right in the heart of Belltown and really only a couple of blocks from Pike market. The staff was friendly and helpfull the rooms were clean and efficent. They are going for a very minimalist modern thing so it is simple and austeer. We also got a room with a bathroom across the hall, there were many of them they were spaious and clean. My only complaint was the beds. The beds themselfs were lumpy and uncomfortable and the linens were scratchy. Otherwise a good experience.

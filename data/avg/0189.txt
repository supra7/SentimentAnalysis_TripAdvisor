Pros: 1. Great location, close to pike place market and two nice restaurants (tulio, wild ginger) 2. Valet parking.. at first I thought "holy moly, $28 per day for parking!" but then as I walked around downtown, I realized the rate wasn't so bad. Most of the parking dowtown is just as expensive or even worse 3. Clean rooms, clean hotel ---- Negatives 1. Wireless internet access is spotty at best. It was just so frustrating to get access even tho I went thru their tech support and a wireless bridge. 2. Walls are really thin.. had to listen to a super screamer two-yr-old all night. Very very frustrating. 3. Location -- soooo very difficult to get here from the 5 South at Rush hour.. probably 20 minutes drive after you exit the 5 b/c of all the traffic. The hotels parking lot is on SENECA, not 6th. So keep that in mind when you're planning your driving routes.

I stayed at the alfot on April 23 rd and again on May 1st, 2010. Was catching flights from Montreal. Was travelling alone with a young child. There was no-one to help with luggages on both occasions and on May 1st, there were even no cart to help with luggages. I foudn the rooms very well kept but the service lacking big time. If you are adult-only travellers and do not need help with your luggages that may be a great place to stay but if you appreciate the service and help with your luggages, I do not think this is the best place to go to.

Used the Quality Inn and Suites for a quick one night stay. We traveled to Seattle to attend a concert at Key Arena, and this was a great choice in terms of location. A 10 min walk takes you right to Seattle Center where you can find the Space Needle, Key Arena, the Fun Forest which has rides for the kids, and so much more. We walked 2 blocks over from Key Arena to Queen Anne street and checked out the little shops and various restaurants offered there. The hotel itself we could tell had been redone with granite fixtures in the bathroom, and updated tile and carpeting. The room we booked was for 2 queens, but the room did feel quite small. The hotel is on a busy street on one side, but that did not bother us at all excepting for the ambulance that happened to go by. We did get awakened by some sort of delivery truck at 5am, but the noise was brief enough that I could go back to sleep. The hotel offers a pool and hot tub which are open until midnight. The free breakfast in the morning consisted of pastries, toast, bagels, biscuits and gravy, cereals, yogurt, waffles, juice, coffee and tea. This was served from 6:30 -9:30 am. Parking was free, but was limited and the lot filled easily. The front desk mentioned that there was an alternate parking underground lot which required your room key as a pass to get in. The hotel overall was clean and the clerks at the front were very helpful with information and even gave me a toothbrush as I had forgotten mine. Check in/out times were 3pm and noon. The clerk did mention that if we wanted late check out at 2pm to ask in the morning for availability. This was not necessary for us, but a nice touch for them to mention. For the location and price we would stay again if we needed a hotel in this area.

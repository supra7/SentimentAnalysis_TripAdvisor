Last year we stayed here for about $70.00 less. They've since added on a $39.00 cleaning fee and additional fees which puts them close to the $200 per night room rate. You can find better deals closer to the parks for this price. Also, sorely disappointed in the selection for breakfast. Very bleak. Again, would choose something closer and other hotels offer a full breakfast spread included.

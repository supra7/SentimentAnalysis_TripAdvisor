They are going through renovations and so the restaurant is not available. Use to be an excellent place to eat. I hope the quality returns when the work is completed. My biggest complaint is the noise from the street. It travels right up the building and you can hear all the noise, cars and sirens. The building itself feels dark and depressing as are the rooms.

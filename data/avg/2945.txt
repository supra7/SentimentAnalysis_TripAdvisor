The staff were amazingly helpful, and they went out of the way to make things easy for us. However, the Hotel located in the Montparnasse area is not really convenient for sight-seeing. The nearest Metro station - Pernety - is 5 minutes away by walk, but it is not on one of the main Metro lines, which means that we had to change 2 lines to come in from the Gare de Lyon, and 3 lines to go the Charles de Gaulle Airport. On the 1 day, we were at the Hotel, we visited the Chateau de Versailles, and it we took the SNCF train from the Gare Montparnasse, which is a 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms are tiny, and we had to jump over our bags to walk around. Wireless Internet did not work on the 2nd floor, and although the staff tried to help us by giving a cable connection, it did not work. The staff were very friendly though, and if we do go back to this Hotel again, it would be for that reason alone.

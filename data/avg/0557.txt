The Sheraton was conveniently very close to the Seattle Convention Center where we had a conference to attend. It was a little pricey for an older hotel that didn't seem as nice as its counterparts across the street (eg: Red Lion). The room service/restaurant associated with the hotel was VERY pricey, but good. Overall room was good, clean, and had WiFi available for a fee. For the Sheraton, I expected more.

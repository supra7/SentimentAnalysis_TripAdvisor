The rooms are attractive and comfortable, but the house cleaning service did not maintain the rooms well. During our seven day stay there, we often come home to poorly cleaned bathrooms, floors and countertops. Several time we had to wait for towels for the pool area. (There is an additional charge for towels.) Often the receptionist at the front desk worked alone which resulted in frequent waits and brief, sometimes abrupt, answers. Overall the receptionists/ concierges were helpful but there needed to be more available for assistance and they needed to say yes, we can help you, more often than the no, that cant be done here, response that we got. For example, we asked for a chair for our back porch facing the pool and were told that we could not have one of the many that were available on other porches. Parrot Key has many restrictions such as no smoking on the facility and no personal alcoholic beverages in the pool areas. I chatted to a smoker hanging out in the Walgreens parking lot next door and he suggested Parrot Key provide a designated smoking area on the facility. Im not a smoker, but I thought that seemed reasonable. The managers and owners of this resort need to pay better wages to attract better employees in house cleaning and hire more employees to provide services commensurate with the cost of the rooms.

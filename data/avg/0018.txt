I booked this hotel on Priceline.com and bid $75 per night for 11/26-11/29.t Pros: Great rate, good location, clean, okay room - a 3 star max though. Cons: Parking is $40 per night - highest in area. I wanted coffee so asked the front desk on the way up is there a coffee maker in the room. "No, but the rest. is open." I said I want it in my room. "You can order room service". I don't want to order room service to get coffee in my room. "I'll have a coffee maker sent up". LOL. They keep them in the closets in the hall if people insist - otherwise they make a little more money on room service. The "buffet" for Thanksgiving was $40 per plate. Hmmmmmm. Restaurants were closed and they took advantage of that. 2 scrambled eggs for breakfast, $18. Bottom line: Shop around and make sure you factor in the parking as part of the room rate. Probably still a good deal so if you come be ready to fight back on their nickel and diming game. 1) Bring your own snacks and cocktails and stay away from their overpriced mini-bar. 2) Eat outside the hotel. 3) Make certain they bring you a coffee maker when you check in and bring your own coffee because you know you'll have to fuss everytime you need a new pack.

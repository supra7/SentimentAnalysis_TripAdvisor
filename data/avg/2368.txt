My family and I were there last week. Here is my honest review. The hotel is beautiful! The food is average to slightly above avg. Get to the restaurants early as they fill up fast. The staff was very friendly. Although the service did vary from day to day at the pool and beach area. Speaking of the beach , that was my biggest disappointment. The water is not the crystal blue water you would hope it would be. Therefore snorkling there is a waste of time. Even in the small rivers were the water is much nicer there is not much to see. An occasional fish, but mostly mangrove roots. Look into snorkling at reef encounter in the village of Pueblos Morales at the travel agent desk near the sports bar. If you like lobster ask about a lobster dinner. I wish i knew this but i didn't until I got back. If you want to do things like the kayak, bike or snorkeling tour make sure you reserve a spot the day before because they do run out of equipment. you can kayak on your own at the north end of the beach near the bridge if the kayaks are there just take one and head up the river. As for the cocktails I found them to be very weak. Don't be afraid to speak up and ask them to double the alcohol...You're paying for it. The pools are very nice and the night entertainment was ok. not much for teens to do aside from the pool , beach volleyball and tours. Finally, this hotel is very nice. The food and drinks are average. The rooms are very nice. It's a good place to go and relax, sit by the pool etc. but if you need to be busy during the day this is not the place to be.

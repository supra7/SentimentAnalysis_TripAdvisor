We stayed in a deluxe queen for 1 night. The room was nice and spacious, however the decor was a bit outdated in our opinion. There was a mirror along an entire wall of the room - which I thought was a bit passe. The sheets and bedding could use some updating -the sheets didn't feel very fresh. I'm certain they were clean, but I definitely didn't feel like I was slipping into a luxurious bed. Today there is such an emphasis on hotels providing a comfortable sleeping experience that I am surprised when there isn't a pillow-top mattress and cushy down duvets. The bathroom was average - with nice amentities from Aveda. The complimentary wireless internet was a great perk and the guest service was polite and efficient. If you are driving into Seattle and won't be needing your car all the time, there is a public parking garage right across the street from the hotel. I didn't check the prices, but I'm certain they are less expensive than the $26/day valet at the hotel. A satisfactory stay, but not the luxury boutique experience we expected.

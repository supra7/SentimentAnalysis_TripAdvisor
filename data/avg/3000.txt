The reception staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. The standard of the room was not accurately reflected in the pictures on the website. The room was very basic with old shabby furniture. The bed was uncomfortable hard. The location is extremely far from all the tourist attractions. It was about 45 minutes on the bus to Gold Souk. A plus is that it had a washer dryer & 1 very helpful member of staff.

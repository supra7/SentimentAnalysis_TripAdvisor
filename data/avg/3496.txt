stayed there for 8 nights in february. Room was tiny but clean. the location is a bit away from the center but you can walk in 10 min to Chinatown or 15 min to Clark Quay. it takes 10 min to walk to nearest metro station (Outram) or just take free hotel shuttle ( which we used a lot). Room service closes at 10:30 pm and your only option for a late night food is mcdonalds which delivers quickly to the hotel for $4 and is open 24h/7. Staff was helpful when needed, but never greeted you when you walk by the front desk.

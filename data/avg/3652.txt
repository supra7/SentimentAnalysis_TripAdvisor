We stayed here for 9 days over the christmas break. We were really only here to sleep, so it didn't matter that the place was like a ghost town until New Year's Eve. If you have the ambassador card, it is pretty useless here because they are redoing the 16th floor where you would normally enjoy extra amenities. We were on the 11th floor and beds were comfortable. The rooms were kept very clean in spite of us having a 6 year old who left goldfish all over. We ordered room service a few times and it was OK- nothing special but they were happy to accommodate. We tried to use the Starbucks in the lobby but it seems to be hit or miss as to whether they open for the day. We bought coffee in the hotel restaurant and it was pricey and not as good as other places. If you have a car, there are loads of places to eat and find breakfast that are much cheaper. You can even walk to Cafe Brazil which turned out to be our favorite on this stay. There was a coffee pot in the room but no microwave. The refrigerator is locked but contains high price snacks. The Sunday brunch seemed very expensive so we didn't eat there. There is wifi in the lobby, but not in the rooms.

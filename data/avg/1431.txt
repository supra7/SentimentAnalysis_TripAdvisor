We went to Montreal for a long weekend with 2 children. Hotel Le Crystal is in an excellent location - convenient to fantastic restaurants, Old Montreal and shopping. The hotel offers valet parking, which was helpful since we drove to Montreal. We stayed in a Deluxe suite - small bedroom, small living room, galley kitchen and a balcony. We wanted a suite for our two kids (10 &12) to share the sofa bed and for my wife and I to have a private bedroom. That worked out fine. The decor was minimalist - clean, but not sumptuous. The bathroom not too small, and not elegant. The sinks did not drain properly (we called maintenance, but they still worked poorly). The balcony is a cement stoop with uncomfortable furniture. However, the shower was great. Service and staff are extremely attentive, but our room was not ready (it took about two hours after it was promised). They comped our parking which was acceptable to us. Hotel parking is $26/day. The open, unsecured lot across the street is $8/day. The concierge was EXCELLENT - he gave us great restaurants except one. Eat at: Beaver Hall, Irish Embassy; Winston Churchill; Eggspectations, Pain Diore. Skip Trinity (Greek seafood - over priced, too loud). Valet and front desk were also attentive. Overall our experience was fine, we were expecting a five star hotel and Le Crystal is 4 at best. It is not worth $289/night which is what we paid. If we were to go to Montreal again, we would choose a different hotel.

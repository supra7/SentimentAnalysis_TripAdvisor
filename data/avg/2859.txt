In spite of the name, Fairfield Inn & "Suites", there are apparently no true suites. We booked on the Marriott web site and selected accommodations described as a "studio suite". A floor-to-ceiling closet partially separated the bedroom from the 2nd room, but the rest of the space between the rooms was open. This is fine for a single traveler or couple who gets up at the same time. But, if one person gets up before the other, it is hard to keep from disturbing the person trying to sleep. The living room area had a small sofa bed (loveseat sized) as well as desk and plenty of lighting. Built-ins for the TV and behind the couch made the room look like it was set on an angle and was esthetically interesting. However, it was an inefficient use of space. The desk and chair were cramed against the loveseat. There was no room for a recliner or easy chair & ottoman. The decor was updated (apparently in 2006), there were a micro & fridge (but no freezer compartment). The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of drawers and spacious closet. The bathroom needed updating but was adequate. Everythng was clean. The single heating/AC unit was especially quiet -- no loud fan or uncomfortable blowing. (The open arrangement --studio rather than true suite -- allows them to get by with one heating/AC unit for both areas.) We requested a room on the back side, away from I-40. Our room/studio was quiet. The internet connection was easy to make and never dropped but somewhat slow. Breakfast was as described on the Marriott web site -- plenty adequate but not special. There was a small pool and spa. There were cookies in the evening in the lobby. BEST thing was the staff. All were SUPER NICE. I would have rated this higher except for the disappointment of getting a studio, not a true suite. Perhaps this was my fault for not reading more closely or asking questions before booking.

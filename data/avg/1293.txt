Colony Bay Food was excellent.Hotel rooms are not a five star.Pool was O.K.Could not swim in the ocean as of the high waves. It has no coral reef and therefore noone was ever in the ocean while our stay was for two weeks.The sheets where way to short for the mattress. The bedcover was oversized and falling over the floors. The beds had no mattress covers .The staff was friendlyThe entertainment repeats it self the next week. Hotel has no free shuttle bus to another hotel or casino.I would not recommend this hotel.

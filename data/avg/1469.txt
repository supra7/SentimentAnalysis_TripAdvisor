First impression was good until they tried to force a timeshare meeting on me and my new wife - this was after a 10 hour flight...when I put my foot down and said no, he got the hump and was very off with us. Not a great first impression. We then had a stroll around the resort which left us a little stunned - DO NOT expect to see couples relaxing in the pool like it shows on the website... DO expect to see groups of Americans in their 40's acting like they're on spring break, and are constantly shouting, whooping, and high-fiving each other. It gets VERY annoying. Another downside - the entertainment staff... one letch in particular - Jesus. It felt more like you were on an 18-30's holiday in benidorm than on a 5 star 'couples' resort... he was very annoying, and poured over the women on the resort, and often referred to casual drug use as part of his 'act'. I'm surprised he hasn't had a punch..but it seems the americans lapped it up. Good points were the food was very good, and the breakfast was outstanding. Couldn't fault the service either. Bad points were the ones mentioned above, the incessant mosquito bites, and the pools that were too hot. Had a nice time when you could escape the brash americans and entertainment staff - but wouldn't return.

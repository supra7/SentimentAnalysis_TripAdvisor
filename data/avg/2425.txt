The Penn Tower only has a few floors for guests...it is primarily medical offices. When our child needed surgery at Children's Hospital, this hotel was ideal for us. We live 2 hours away from Philly and since most surgeries are now "same-day", this hotel let us keep close to the hospital overnight. It certainly was not resort material, but that wasn't what we were looking for.....knowing that we were just across the street from CHOP was our main priority. For peace of mind, I highly recommend Penn Tower for anyone planning surgery at either CHOP or U. of Penn.

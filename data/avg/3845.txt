I had a terrible experience when I checked in. The front desk was crowded and seemed disorganized. When my turn came after waiting for a while, a woman at the desk told me "I'll be back". But a white fat man just cut in and told her to take care of him. I was surprised that she handled his request right away very politely in front of me. It was sooo humiliaiting and unfair. After he left, I comlained to her and she apologised but her excuse did not make sense at all. It was definitely discrimination against a colored person. Other staff were very nice and the room was clean but I will never forget this experience. Besides, the "delux room" had no bath tub. I have to say "it is not worth your money".

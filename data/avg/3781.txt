We stayed at the Hotel Lawrence for 3 nights while attending a wedding in Dallas. Although the decor was nice, it was easily the smallest room I've EVER stayed in--not kidding. My wife and I couldn't stand in the bathroom at the same time. The door barely missed the edge of the bed when we entered the room. With that being said, we only paid ~ $60 night (taxes included). We booked on Hotwire. The staff was friendly enough and the cookies and milk in the evenings was a nice touch, but I don't think it will be at the top of my list when we go back next time.

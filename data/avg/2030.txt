We didn't find anything cheaper that would both have a private bathroom and be close to the subway. We were afraid that it would look really bad but actually it is a comfortable place to rest if you are on a tourist visit to Rome. The reception is always open and very welcoming. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is simple but it does the trick. The only problems I found were the bad shape in which the window covers were in (if we didn't put another piece of cloth covering the window, anyone who passed outside could clearly see everything inside the bedroom) and the constant sound of a machine working (presumably something related with air conditioning) that wouldn't allow me to have a deep sleep. Also, the walls are extremelly thin so you could hear everything that was going on in the water pumps (I always woke up when someone decided to take a shower at 6 a.m.). Despite all this, we didn't hear anything else like cars or people speaking so if you are somewhat comfortable with noise while sleeping, this is a good hotel to choose. Just don't forget to ask the reception to give you a room in which the window is fully covered.

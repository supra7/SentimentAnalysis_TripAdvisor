Stayed on the 14th floor on a Sunday night with my boyfriend. Location is amazing if youre looking to do some shopping and dining, the hotel i literally right next to the apple store :) Beds are amazingly comfortable and the rooms are really big. the place is kinda old but nicely remodeled, the water in the shower wasent as hot as i wanted it to be. I only had a problem wit 2 things - our view was overlooking heating and air ducts lol but its wasent a big deal since we live in the suburbs of chi and were down there quite often. 2nd - We wanted to grab some drinks at the sky lounge but found out it was closed for repairs, we managed to sneak in there at night and the place had amazing views and would have been awesome if it was open. overall got a awesome deal and really had no complaints :)

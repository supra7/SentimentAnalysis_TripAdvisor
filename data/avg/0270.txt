The Moore is an old hotel with a good city location, for a budget price. We stayed a couple nights over the summer and found it to be okay, if not great. Our room seemed reasonably clean, but the furnishings and facilties are clearly old. By old, I don't mean 1980's old - the hotel was built in 1907. That said, we had reasonable expecations and we were comfortable enough. The view of the Space Needle from the fire escape was also pretty amazing. Whether you enjoy the Moore or not depends mostly on you. If you're used to cheap places with a backpacker / hostel feel, you'll fit right in at the Moore. If you generally choose the Hyatt, you should probably avoid it. I would also avoid the Moore if I were extremely safety-conscious. This is not the building I would want to be sleeping in during an earthquake or a fire. Our biggest inconvenience was parking. We were in town for a couple weeks and had a car and a lot of stuff. We ended up paying a fairly hefty rate to stay at a skeevy parking garage down the street. By the time we wrestled the luggage up and down a (very dodgy) parking garage stairwell a few times, I started to suspect we might have been better off staying somewhere else. Bottom line, if you're travelling light and cheap and want a good downtown location, the Moore is probably a good choice. If you have a car to park, or a lot of luggage, or you tend to like newer places, get on Priceline or Hotwire and check out their deals on chain hotels. You can probably stay at a Hilton or Marriot property for about the same money as the Moore using this technique.

Stayed at the Hilton Bayfront for 3 nights while in San Diego for a family wedding. The hotel's location is good and the views from our room on 19th floor were amazing BUT, I have to agree with another reviewer that you do feel like your nickle and dimed for everything. We paid $199/night plus $25 self parking(pretty easy, don't bother w/ valet) but there was NOTHING complimentary. Wi-fi is $14.95 for 24 hours, bottle water in room is $4.50, no fridge. Also the on-line pictures of pool area look real nice because it's empty..wait 'til you go there and see all the blue towels draped over the beach chairs and empty cups littered around pool deck. I was never able to get a lounge chair and found the dirty dishes, empty drink cups, straws and bottles strewn on the trays to save a spot pretty disgusting. The Fox Grill restaurant food was mediocre but the Vela restaurant had a great breakfast buffet for $21.95.....and yes, that is per person. I only utilized the concierge once and found her to be apathetic. ....Overall, a swanky looking hotel that I would recommend based on location only but if you're looking for a good deal, this isn't the place.

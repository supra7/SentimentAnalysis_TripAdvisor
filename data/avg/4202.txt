On arrival we were told we could not have our original 2 bedroom suite as there was a "maintenance issue" from the previous evening, they offered us a different suite with a discount. Ok, fair enough. After long flight from UK we went to the suite, it is in serious need of refurbishment, old furniture, old bathroom etc, very tired. As were we. We settled fr the evening when at 5am our 2 children who were in sleeping in the living room came to tell me there was a grey thing on their lego toys....it was a MOUSE! Yes you read right! We trapped the nouse. We called recexption, they sent a bellhop to say we could change rooms. He didnt even know the reason we were moving. We were incensed! No apology...eventually a manager came up about 1.5 hours later. we were all sat in the bedroom awake with the kids during this time. The manager came with secuirty, she screamed. We moved room with no help, repacked, wheeled our suitcases to another suite. During the weekend there was no acknowledgment of this incredible episode! Of course it spoiled my stay as worried about other rodents. On checkout we mentioned this episode to a 3rd person as no one had acknolwedged this. We were offered the first night free......well make your mind up about that! We late stayed at the Sheraton in Boston and that was fantastic and we wished we stayed there initailly!

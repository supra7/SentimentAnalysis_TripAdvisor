We stayed here when flying in before leaving for an Alaska cruise the next day and stayed the following weekend upon our return before flying out the next morning. I got a great deal by using the advanced purchase option. I then read reviews on here so I was very skeptical about our stay, but since I prepaid I didn't have a choice to look for another motel. I was pleasantly surprised. The room was okay and while it showed some wear was clean and in working order. The first night they asked for a $20 deposit and it was returned the following morning. They didn't ask for a deposit on my second stay. I did arrange for a pick up from the Amtrak station, but they weren't able to pick us up once I called upon our arrival. We took a cab instead and actually saved money. They do offer 24 hour transport to and from the airport, but I wouldn't trust any other travel arrangements to them. For a basic, no-frills stay, I would recommend them. If you are looking for anything else then you need to look somewhere else to stay.

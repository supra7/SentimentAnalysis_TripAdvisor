I stayed 1 night whilst on business travel. Spacious room, if you are comparing to a hotel room, although not so, if you compare to a serviced apartment. There is a nice deep bath. Galley style Kitchen facilities although no table, you would need to eat at the desk. A couple of complaints, the bath towels were worn & dirty, and there is no restaurant, except for a breakfast service, which I didn't try. I arrived around 9pm, and there was not a lot open if you wanted to get something to eat. The hotel is situated in the business district and eateries/shops were largely shut after hours.

It was an older hotel and a little worn. We had a big room with comfortable beds. Everything was clean, and the bathroom was huge but it had a tiny shower. Very close to the airport and we understood they offered a park & stay, for people flying out or cruising out of Seattle. The breakfast was almost nonexistant. They only offered a couple of cold cereals, prepackaged sweet rolls and juice & coffee. This was located in the small lobby, so there was only a small couch & a small table & chairs to sit at & eat. The staff was very friendly though. They also had a computer in the lobby, which made it handy to print out boarding passes the evening before. There is a mini casino across the street and we had a decent dinner there. There was also a bus stop across the street, so we were able to catch the city bus & ride into downtown Seattle to sightsee.

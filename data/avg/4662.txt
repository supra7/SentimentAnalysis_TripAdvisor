This Hampton Inn was very centrally located so that we were able to see all the sites without too much trouble. With that said... location isn't everything. The rooms were nothing spectacular, in dire need of updating(ie; peeling wallpaper and icky grout) and very very dry! If looking to stay here bring your humidifier! Not only did we have trouble sleeping with sore throats due to the arrid conditions but the constant serenade of fire sirens from across the street kept us on edge all night... even with earplugs! Our mistake...we should have investigated the location better. Had we known upon reserving our room what we know now, we would have made a better choice. On the plus side, the staff was friendly the complimentary breakfast was as good as always.

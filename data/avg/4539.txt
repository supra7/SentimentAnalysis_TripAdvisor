I can't complain about price because I booked it for $70/night on priceline, but I'll cut to the chase with the positives and negatives of the Hyatt Regency Boston Pros: - clean - fairly inexpensive - very spacious bathtubs and showers - soft beds - nice toiletries - let me check in about an hour before regular check-in time Cons - LOUD - conjoined rooms have little sound proofing, especially in the doors - I could hear all the giggling and phone ringing of the people next door to me. Plus, situated next to the ice machine and maid's closet (seems to be common if you book on priceline). Additionally, kids stomping and running up and down the hallway constantly - though this is not the hotel's fault (maybe if they put families with kids on the same floor) and more the fault of lazy parents - Additional charge for internet - kind of ridiculous in this day and age - Could not find the entrance - enter on the side of Lafyette, take the stairs down, elevator up, cross the lobby, find main elevators, and go up to your room - very odd layout of hotel - No mugs in the room - the paper cups are wasteful, mugs would be nice - Old-school TV that did not rotate - would have been nice to turn it towards the desk or chair - no bathrobes, but the website indicated bathrobes. minor, but would have been nice!

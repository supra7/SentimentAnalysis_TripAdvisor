I wrote a review a few days ago, and I was really disappointed in my stay at the Crowne Plaza, as it was really unsanitary in unhealthy ways. However, with that said, I would like to say that management did everything to make it right. I was really impressed and enjoyed the fact that my problems had been pointed out and in the process of resolving. A lot of places would not do this, but I'm really happy about the response.

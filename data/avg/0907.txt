Luckily I got this room through Priceline for $125, but unluckily I was locked in for three nights. I would have changed hotels after the first night. I was on the 17th of 40 some floors. ( North tower, facing the sound). I could see the Space Needle off to my right but directly in front was a new building going up. Pile drivers and the sound of a groaning crane began at 4 AM. Even with ear plugs, you could not drown out the sound. Make sure that you ask to see your room first to know if you are facing this way. The new building is up to the 10th floor as i write this, but it looks like this will be going on for a while. If you are booking any time in September I would ask about this. Weekends might be OK. I was there Mon - Wed. Another issue is the lack of a little fridge. They only have a minibar so you are really stuck if you want to save a dime by having a few snacks of your own. They want you to eat in their restaurant, (Coldwater Grill). It was raining hard so I opted to eat there. It was pricey, but they had this wonderful dish..ravioli stuffed with peas and ricotta on a bed of really fresh broccolini. As others have commented, this place is fancy, with fluffy beds and good views, but it has as a huge, impersonal corporate feel.

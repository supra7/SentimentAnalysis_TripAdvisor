We arrived late evening and were only staying overnight before boarding our ship to Alaska. It was modest accommodations and worth the $115 price. Our room was on the 8th floor and had no air conditioning; however, the windows were open to allow for the cool night air. Note that the window have no screens! And, because downtown is very noisy at night, we heard the nighlife from the local clubs and delivery trucks well into the wee hours. Unfortunately, it was not a wonderful location for a restful night's sleep. The restaurant on the lower level offered a WONDERFUL breakfast and allowed us plenty of time to walk to Pike Place Market and enjoy some sightseeing before checking out.

Stayed at this hotel for four nights last week. The hotel was beautiful and the scenery was gorgeous. Things I did not like about the hotel were the pool was not heated, small beach area, beds were very low to the ground and had soft, uncomfortable mattress, restaurant food was below average, and front desk staff were not very helpful. When we go back, I will book a hotel farther north so we will be closer to Whaler's Village and have a bigger beach. They charge $9.95 a day to have internet. On the plus side, parking was free. This hotel is remote and a rental car is a must.

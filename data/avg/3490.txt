Overall, the location was ideal for travellers who want to stay away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. This means you will have a taxi ride of approx $10 to downtown. The hotel itself is rustic almost like a cottage setting. Very peaceful with trees around and birds waking you up. The cleaning service was poor - forgetting to put towels and toilet paper, not cleaning the room and washroom properly and the way the bathroom is set up the entire floor gets soaked in the process of taking a shower. Needs major work to equate to North American standards. The breakfast is not good for people on special diets - too much fried food and rice and pasta. Needs to be more diversified if it is to be considered breakfast. The management staff are friedly and they work hard to ensure your requests are met but there is little cohesion between the different staff on duty. You make a request to one and they forget to pass the information on to the other. Generally, a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Needs improvement to make it perfect.

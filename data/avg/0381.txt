We bid and got this hotel on priceline. The check in staff was very helpful and upgraded us to a suite which was wonderful however the concierge at night was not helpful and even rude when we asked about cabs to the rail system so we could get to the airport pushed really hard about using limousines outside the hotel instead of cabs or rail. Later found out that there is trouble with concierge getting kickbacks from limousine services. This was a spoiler for us......we will not return to this hotel

If you are looking for a good, clean, moderately priced hotel this is for you. The price also includes breakfast, which was decent. Comparable to a Hampton Inn breakfast. Great location close to Las Ramblas. The staff was very helpful and nice. The only drawback is it can get a little noisy when you are trying to sleep, and the room is your typical small European size. The bathroom/shower are good.

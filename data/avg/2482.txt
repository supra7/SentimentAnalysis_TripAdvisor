had a nice stay in a corner room with a fab view but the modern design of the rooms have a flaws including that fact that I could hear the people in the room next door as if they were in my room . Additionally, the half glass shower wall should be a bit longer. Water was all over the floor after my shower- even after I was intentionally/carefully trying to avoid on the second morning. The business center computers needed toner for the printer for the entire 3 days I was there- even after I mentioned it to the front desk.

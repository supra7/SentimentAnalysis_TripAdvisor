This is my second stay at this hotel. The hotel is basic, and surprisingly badly maintained given that it is only 18 months or so old. Despite this, the rooms are functional and acceptably clean. The hotel is great as a stopping off point en-route, but would not make a good base for a longer stay. I booked the room on a 'saver' rate, making it excellent value for London but the hotel is almost certainly not worth the 'standard' on-the-day rate.

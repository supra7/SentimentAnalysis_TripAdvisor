This hotel is located close to the Roma Termini even though it can be challenging to find as it is located in a small alley way. It is close to all the attractions and restaurants near the Rome main train station. We chose this place as we had to get up early the next day to take a train out of Rome. The hotel is divided into two parts and we stayed in the part across from the reception. It was a fair hike up stairs to our room so not good for people with suitcases, we had backpacks so it was ok for us. The hotel in general is dark and poorly lit, our room was clean and in general ok, there is no air conditioning and the shower was like a shoe box even for me a size 6, I kept banging my elbows on the glass door. This hotel is good for a very short stay or if you intend to spend more time outside than in.

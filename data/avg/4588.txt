This hotel has some good points and bad. The room was very very small with the shower in the actual bathroom (no screen etc just part of the room) so everything got wet when you had a shower. In saying that the rooms were serviced daily with new towels etc and kept very clean. Breakfast is included but is an interesting array of food, not your standard 'breakfast'' - think olives, cheeses, boiled eggs, fresh vegetables - but all very nicely presented and very tasty. Generally the service we received was very good keeping in mind there was a language barrier. Just a couple of points for example the fridge in our room didnt work and although we mentioned this to the management on several occasions it was not fixed but really its not a major thing. Would stay here again but would hope for a bigger room as I think we ended up with the smallest of them all!

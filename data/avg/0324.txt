One of my favorite things about staying at this particular hotel is that it isn't pricey and the location is great. It's literally a block or two away from the station (I took the Link Rail from Sea/Tac to Downtown in 30 minutes for only $2.50). It's a short 5 to 8 minute walk to Pike Place, a MUST SEE if you're going to be in Seattle for any reason. The location is also perfect if you're wanting to go to nice restaurants and close to several interesting bars. It is also a 8 to 10 minute walk to the two malls: Westlake Center and Pacific Place. As I spent most of the time in Seattle wandering around and taking in the sites, I was only in my hotel room late at night and in the early morning. The hotel was fairly nice, it wasn't dirty or gross, but it wasn't like I was expecting anything too luxurious and I wasn't disappointed. The only real complaint I have about the place is that the rooms get a bit too hot and stuffy. The weather outside was nice and cool and the temperature in the room was the opposite. The first night, I turned on the a/c thinking it would cool some while I slept, but I woke up several times because it was hot and had to sleep without a blanket. I was able to open the window a few inches, and even left it open the entire day while I was out, but the room's temperature was still a little uncomfortable. Other than that, the staff was really friendly. I asked someone at the front desk about good bars and restaurants to go to and he provided me with a map and circled all his favorite places. His suggestions were wonderful!

We stopped by this hotel to check prices early in Oct. 2010. We were told that there would be an additional $12 parking fee added to park our car. We went next door to Quality Inn. It was a very nice clean modern hotel and they beat Travelodge's room prices by at least $15 and they had free parking. Much better value in my opinion.

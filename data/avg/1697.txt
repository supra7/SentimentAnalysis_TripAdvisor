Stayed for four nights during a conference. Positives: 1. Rooms quiet and relatively comfortable (but on the smallish side) 2. Nice views from some rooms 3. If attending a conference at convention center, it is next door Negatives 1. There is a Starbucks in the building, but is hard to find. You actually have to go outside and around to the side to get to it 2. They charge a fee to use the gym 3. Service is restaurants is sssssllllllloooooowwwww 4. Lighting is somewhat stark in common areas Bottom line: I would not go out of my way to stay there again. On the other hand, it attending a conference and this was the conference hotel, would probably book there again.

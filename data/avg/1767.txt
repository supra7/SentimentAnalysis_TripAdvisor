We were at the Hyatt end of July/end of August. A family of four, kids 4 and 7. The hotel was way too crowded for my taste. After haivng been to Grand Hyatt Kauai, this resort failed to wow us. Crowds crowds everywhere, i know its summer vacation but this was not my style. I couldn't stand the crowds - at breakfast, at pool, the luau crowd competing for parking in the evening, tour bus size groups checking in every evening. The front of the hotel with valet parking is just crazy. While we were there with kids, it was ok but i wouldn't stay at this resort for a honeymoon or an adult only trip or for a relaxing getaway. Even the employees seemed overworked a bit. We were greeted with lots of Alohas and smiles at the Hyatt in Kauai from every empoyee we encountered. But here in Maui, not much of Aloha going on. While we didn't encounter any rude employees, the overall service was not much to speak of. The resort gardens are beautiful, birds and wildlife were an added bonus with kids. We did the astronomy tour and that was amazing. This place reminded me of the mega resorts in Mexico. There is no beach to speak of. We rented chairs and umbrellas at the Sheraton by the black rock and had drinks and lunch at their Cliff Dive bar and that was money well spent. Sheraton seemed more quiet and relaxing with a killer location. We are very unlikely to return to this resort.

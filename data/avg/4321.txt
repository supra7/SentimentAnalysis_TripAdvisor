Travelling to Boston for a few days between Christmas and New Year was a spur of the moment affair. Having stayed previously in Back Bay area, at the Lennox, we decided to locate ourselves a little closer to the City centre. The Park Plaza has an excellent location this fact can not be denied, it approximately half way between the Back Bay and down town areas, and just a few hundred yards from the Common. First impressions of the Hotel were pretty good. The large lobby area was beautifully decorated (Christmas decs etc, not the quality of the paint work!) and the Check in staff made us feel very welcome. We had read reviews that suggested the rooms would be on the small size, so we were delighted to find our accommodation was generous even by US standards. It has to be said that the decor was more than a little tired, and gave the overall impression that things were a little grubby and the bathroom wouldnt have looked out of place in a TV period drama! I fully appreciate that we did not spend a great deal of money on the room. However, even Comfort Inn (no disrespect intended) can offer working showers and clean towels. Finding a cleaners surgical glove on the bedside table was truely an unexpected delight. We notified the front desk of the problems, and an engineer was promtly dispatched to take a look at the shower. The hotel's opertunity to redeem itself disapeared with the engineers inability to resolve the problem. For the sake of paying a little more attention to detail, the Park Plaza could be a really good hotel. However, when I return to Boston (and I will go back because it's a fantastic City) I think I'll go back to the Lennox.

This was our first stay at this hotel. We had our car and let me tell you that it was not easy to locate. The young lady on the phone did the best she could but it seemed like we were going around in circles. That was really frustrating. She finally brought us up a side street and had someone meet us. The service was good, the room was OK, the elevator was small. But with other hotels in the neighborhood, I elected to stay elsewhere when i returned. You can't beat the location.

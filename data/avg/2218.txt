CONS: OK the $15 charge did not come to a surprise to me, many other hotels have the same charge. What surprised me is that it does NOT include internet. Internet is $12 a day (Per laptop). I have been in Las Vegas a few time before and I had NEVER paid for the internet. Other hotels included in the "service fee". This hotel is NOT on the strip, the walk is not that bad specially if you go through the mall, but at night time is quite unpleasant, if you are here just for a conference or a expo the hotel is fine, but if you are here for pleasure, stay somewhere else. There is no self parking, which means tips every time you want your car. I was at the 56th floor and I could still hear the trains..... want a better view? Costs more. PROS: The rooms were nice, had a small kitchen with microwave, stove, fridge all worked nice and were a nice surprise. The rooms were very nice, very clean, no stains anywhere. Like many other have said, the bathroom is amazing, TV on the mirror, huge bathtub, huge shower, very nice. The bed was nice very comfortable, And something I really like is the smoke free environment. Overall: The hotel it self is good, but the service fee without internet is a JOKE. Like others said LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.

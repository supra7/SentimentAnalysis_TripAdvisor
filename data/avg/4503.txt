We stayed at this hotel as the start to Falls & Foliage Tour  so this wasnt my choice. The public rooms were splendid and the check in staff was very helpful. Our room was nice and spacious and well appointed. My real problem with the hotel was the sound insulation  The bedside alarm went off at 3 am in the NEXT room, it was so loud that I thought it was mine. We both had a disturbed night, as we could hear the occupants of the adjoining room talking (and singing to the radio!). I also thought that charging $9.95 a day for the Internet is penny pinching  All the other hotels we stayed at during the rest of our tour the Internet was free.

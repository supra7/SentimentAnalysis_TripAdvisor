Reserved a room on the gold floor for a four night family stay - given very postive past experiences with Fairmont Gold. Rooms were clean, large, but badly in need of renovation. Furnishings, carpeting, etc. all outdated. Air handling is poor - common room / hallway air very stale and stuffy. Lighting was somewhat dim. Service in gold lounge / desk was clearly understaffed and appalling. For a long period of time no staff was on hand to attend to guests during evening - garbage cans were overflowing, food trays hadn't been replenished, tables had not been bused, and guests were complaining to each other etc. Expected more from premium paid for a concierge floor. Lobby front desk staff was excpetionally friendly and helpful. Catie Copley (on site hotel dog) was fun draw for kids. Location great. We decided to checkout after only one night.

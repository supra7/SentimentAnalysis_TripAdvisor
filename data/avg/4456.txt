I'm here right now. Since we're trying to relax and get a lot of rest for a marathon we're doing the 26th, we chose to stay here at The Hilton because we were under the impression that it's supposed to be so amazing and luxurious, etc. Well, the room looks okay but I don't see one single thing about it that makes it any better than a super cheap motel or hotel. I just stayed at a Super 8 last week for a few days and I'd take Super 8 over The Hilton any day of the week. There is no microwave in the room, there is no fan in the bathroom to keep it from fogging up, the ac in the room is very hard to use, no washer/dryer (S8 has them), our mini fridge doesn't seem to be working, and the internet isn't free- which at this price it damn well should be. You could get all that at Super 8 plus everything The Hilton has and pay much less to stay there. It looks nicer and that is all. The advantage is only superficial. I can say the staff is very nice, the place is clean, etc but you can get that at a much cheaper place. If you want to spend more money for no reason, come here!

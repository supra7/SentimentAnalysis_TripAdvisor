I just returned from an 8 day stay at the Hyatt. We were there from March 1st thru March 8th. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very good for the most part. Check in was made very easy and the bellman are very quick on getting your luggage to your room. The best part of our stay was that we had booked a standard terrace room, but we were placed in a very nice partial ocean view room. The daily maid service is not very good. We were there for 8 days and not once were our sheets changed. The pool is great for both young and old, and I must say that the waterslide even scared me a little. The beach in front of the hotel is terrible. The coral reef runs right along the beach of the Hyatt which makes for very painful walking. The beach is much nicer further down towards the Westin and the Whaler. The restaurants are very overpriced so we ate mainly at the Whalers Village food court and in Lahaina. The Pizzaria and Mr Sub are very good and inexpensive at the Whalers Village. If you have a late night flight out of Maui(which most flights are) forget about late check out. When I asked for a late check out because our flight was not leaving until 10:30 p.m. they said that they do not allow late check out. They did however say we could store our luggage with the bellman and use the showers outside by the pool to shower and freshen up. I thought thanks but no thanks. The hotel looks great but there are plenty of other hotels that are just as nice and less expensive for what you get. Next time I would definitely stay somewhere else. Try the Westin great beach and great looking hotel.

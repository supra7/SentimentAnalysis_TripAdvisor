Stayed in family suite for a quick one night stay during November. Spent all day at Silver Dollar City so we were only in room long enough to shower and sleep. Beds were softer than most you would find in an economy price room. Room had three queen beds and were clean. Pillows were not very firm and sheets came off at the corners during night. Room had microwave and single coffee pot. Shower clean but wallpaper was starting to peel a little from the moisture. I would stay here again for a quick sleepover. Breakfast was adequate with cereal, toast, french toast, bagels.. I think there was a few donuts earlier. Coffee was VERY weak. If you just need a clean place to sleep and shower it works.

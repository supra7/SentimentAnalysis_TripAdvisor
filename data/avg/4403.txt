Overall this hotel was okay. The positives: close to the Harvard campus; roomy suite, clean bathroom, good housekeeping service; free coffee and bottled water in the room; comfortable bed; a free shuttle service to Boston's Copley Square area, the Harvard Square and aquarium. What could be improved: The check-in service was average but not particularly friendly and the much advertised free cookies were not offered to us. The comfortable bed and what would have been six nights of good rest was abruptly marred late one evening by loud screaming and noise in the corridors - the result of people partying and running around the floors at 2 am. We had to call the front desk to complain. We had an upgrade for a free breakfast each morning which was a nice perk but the breakfast offered the same array of foods each day and the dining room staff (with the exceptiuon of one Latino lady) were not friendly. The other troubling incident was a bout of bad bug bites. On our check out day we mentioned the bug bites and were enthusiastically assured by the young receptionist at the front desk that a manager would definitely be calling us. It's been two days and we're still waiting. Although the hotel was conveniently located close to campus, crossing the streets each day to get to campus involved dodging traffic and fearing for your life. Cars drive very fast and don't slow down for pedestrians. The hotel should perhaps inquire about installing speed bumps on the road that runs outside the hotel and having signs posted asking drivers to slow down.

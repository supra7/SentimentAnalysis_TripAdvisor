I loved this hotel! I have visited this hotel 3x's in the last 3 years.The staff is very attentive. I was very disappointed that after my bill of $564.00 was paid in full there was a $917.00 hold on my credit card 5 days after I checked out. I spoke with staff at the front desk who assured me it was my banks issue. After many frustrating phone calls the Hotel Crystal had to fax a letter authorizing the bank to release the funds. I guess it was the Hotel's issue!!!

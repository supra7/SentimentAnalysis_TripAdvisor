When we first checked into the hotel, we were give a room with a king sized bed...a small upgrade from the standard room we booked. There was a musty smell when we entered the room, but ignored it. We're not really fussy. After coming back to the room a few hours later, it wasn't just musty, it stunk. Of old smoke. It was a room that used to be a smoking room up until a few months prior, we were informed after we called down and asked for a new room. That was no problem at all. We were put into a never-been-smoked-in room and after that, it was great. The location was fantastic and the service very good. Only tiny little complaint would be the breakfast cost vs quality. The 'Healthy Choice" option seemed to be all the sugar, all the time. (Blueberry muffin huge and sweet and topped with...brown suger? Yogurt and granola, sooooo sweet it made my teeth ache.) But a lot of people seemed to like the $15 dollar breakfast buffet, so maybe it was awesome for that.

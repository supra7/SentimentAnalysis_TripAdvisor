Three of us stayed in this hotel in early march, we were pleasantly surprised, the room was a fair size for 3 people and the bathroom was not as small as i expected having seeing other reviews, the staff were very pleasant and accommodating, including the maids etc. The location was excellent, we would stay here again, the only gripe is the restuarant McCormicks & Schmicks, this was a disaster, we ordered 3 soups, only 2 came out first and it was cold,we also had to ask for spoons, these were dirty. while in the process of trying to return the 2 soups, the dinners were brought out, one of our party was still waiting on soup, , the chef brought back the dinners, one dinner then came out 15 mins later, the waitress brought this one out on her sleeves, still no knife and forks, the manager eventually came over , we didnt pay, i have never returned food in a restuarant before, but this was really bad, maybe we were just unlucky. The next evening we went to an italian restuarant - Maggianos, go there, the food, service were excellent.

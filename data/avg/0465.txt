My wife and I stayed at this Hilton for one night in January 2009. The location is fine, however the hotel is somewhat average. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It seems like it is in that 30-50 year old range where it's not yet a classic old hotel, but it is too old to be remolded or updated for contemporary style. The staff was very nice and the lobby was pretty cool, but as with all older hotels all of the money is in the lobby and the rooms are small and uninspiring. The diamond room is the combination of two old hotel rooms and is average. The staff was very helpful, but the facility itself felt cold. My wife described it as a state office building- like it was full of people without souls. The hotel was a good value. I think we only paid $105/night- however parking was $20/night. If you're just passing through and aren't interested in a great hotel, this Hilton will do. However if you are looking for a warm venue, I would try the Homewood Suites up the hill.

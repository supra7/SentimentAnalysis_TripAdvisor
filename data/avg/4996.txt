Stayed recently for a conference and paid US199 per nite. I had requested beforehand for, and was assured at reception upon check-in that my room was one of the newer, upgraded ones. But turned out to be an old room. As it was already past midnite, I didn't bother to complain. I shall not repeat the other reviewers' comments about the smallness of the room and toilet, shocking lack of room fridge (for a purportedly premier property) ) and general tiredness of the property. If I do return to Chicago, which is a great city, I really see no compelling reason to stay in the Palmer again.

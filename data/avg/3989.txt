The staff were very friendly and helpful. Note that your key must be dropped off at the front desk each time you venture out into the city and then picked up when you return. We found this useful as we did not have to keep up with our key during our outings. They were also very attentive with our requests making sure we had extra pillows when we requested it. The cleaning staff cleaned the room everyday. It was nice not to share a bathroom and have our own bathroom even though it was really small. Be aware if you have claustrophobia. Shower, toilet, and sink are like the size of a closet. Water was hot but low pressure at times. Breakfast was served every morning, which consisted of cereal, milk, coffee (instant), OJ (watered-down or powder?), deli meats, toast, jam, and warm yogurt. Con: It was about a 15-20 minute walk to the nearest Metro station, which is Stratford. This may not seem bad but when you're returning home from a long day out, it is quite tiring. Also there is no A/C so I would not book during the hot summer months. For us, it was fine since the weather was cool and we were fine with just the windows open and the room fan on. Also the hotel did not have or offer wireless. Phone calls, even local, had to be done in the lobby. Also, it was about a 25-30 minute ride to central London, where most of the main attractions are. so like I mentioned above, if you're looking for a hotel to just crash in at the end of the day with a place to shower and has the bare essentials then this is a decent place.

The Atlas Hotel is situated just off La Rambla opposite the LIceu Theatre and is central for everything. It is close to the Gothic Quarter, Catalunya Square, the Cathedral and the port. The hotel itself is very small. The rooms were very clean and cleaned early each day. The bathroom looked to be quite new. The rooms are small with a television, telephone etc. There wasa choice at breakfast of cerals, toast and fruit or bacon and egg. The owners of the hotel were friendly and helpful. It is pretty basic but clean and comfortable. Barcelona is a fantastic city to visit and there is so much to do in a short break. The weather was very cold for FEbruary (colder than when we left England ) which caught us by surprise.

We stayed at the Ovolo for five nights. The hotel has lots of positives: great location; a gym; free laundry; nightly happy hours; filling breakfast; and a free mini bar. While the rooms are small, they are functional and a contain all you need if you are out sightseeing everyday. Reception staff and the manager are friendly and helpful. The biggest drawback is the quality of the housekeeping. On three ocassions we returned to our rooms at the end of the day to find they had not been cleaned. Twice we had to ask housekeeping for toiletries. The cleaning that was done was fairly superficial. We understand this hotel is fairly new, so hopefully this issue will be rectified shortly. Otherwise, it is a great place to stay and we would definitely stay here again.

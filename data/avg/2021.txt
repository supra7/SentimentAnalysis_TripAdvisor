We booked a superior room for 4 nights. What makes the room "superior" is the fact that it has a window. though the window cannot be opened. If you are claustrophobic- this hotel is not for you... The room is very small but has all that you might need including an LCD television and a basic DVD player. Everything is very basic, so it's good for a short stay on a budget, nothing more. What's good about this hotel is that it is very close to the MRT station which is very important in Singapore, unless you want to take taxis everywhere. The location, otherwise, is not a touristic area, just a simple residence area.

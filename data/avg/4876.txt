Before I had stayed at the Palmer House I had looked at their website and was impressed at what I saw, the pictures looked magnificent and fabulous. I was getting really excited. The lobby area with its murals are beautiful, the rooms are not so. The rooms looked like they were from a Super 8 or Motel 6. It had a CRT Tv, paint chipping off the walls in the bathroom and the floor next to the toilet was stained yellow. I was disappointed and I had stayed there for New Year's Eve/My birthday. Probably have to pay alot of money to get a better quality room.

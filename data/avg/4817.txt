Having arrived tired after 2 flights from England, I was confronted by the desk clerk asking me whether I wanted to pay an extra 39 dollars per night for an upgraded room plus breakfast, hors doeuvres and nibbles and no limit on non-alcoholic drinks. Unfortunately I missed the vital word continental and was non -plussed to find the next day I was not enjoying a cooked breakfast. Anyway my wife said overall it was good value-not completely convinced. The other initial problem was I was allocated an upgraded smoking room. When I got to the room I discovered that despite the assurances of the desk clerk that no smoking had occurred, the room stunk of it. The solution-one of the domestic staff with a few blasts of an air freshener! Well you can image how effective that was. We changed rooms the next day only to find that smoke from the next room was seeping into one of our bathrooms. Wedding attracted a young couple with a baby next door and the thin walls meant we could hear the screaming infant quite clearly. Not the kids fault but the walls were a bit thin. Apart from the extra charges and smoke the hotel was quite impressive with an old world charm. New room was large with 2 bathrooms. Main Bar was a bit impersonal with a transient population. Beer prices changed on the weekend- you guessed it they went up-not come across this sort of thing before. Surrounding area was a bit dodgy at night with homeless people constantly harassing you. Overall I was a little disappointed considering the favourable reviews I had read.

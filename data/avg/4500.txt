we have been going to this property for years. it has always been a dependable and constant experiance. however this last trip left us wondering if we will return. we take many trips to boston each year, and depending on our agenda we use several hotels. this last visit was disappointing from a standards point. the staff at the desk and car park were extremly nice. problems began in the room. there were no glass glasses for drinks just 2 coffee cups. the lotion bottle was left over from the last guest as it was only half full. sitting down on the bed we discovered 1 pillow case with what appeared to be blood stains on it. since there were many pillows we just put that one off to the side. using the shower the next morning we discovered the grout along the tub wall seam was missing and there was mold in the gap. as i said earlier, we are long time customers here. my best guess is that managment has been in place too long and time for a shuffle. these are basic simple issues a hotel of the hyatts standing should never have.

My family (of 3) stayed at the Vagabond in late June 2004 and found it a decent place for the price. The tub was peeling because a former owner had painted it, but otherwise everything worked. The air conditioning unit drowned out the street noises, so we had no trouble sleeping. There was some confusion about the price, since the phone reservation people quoted me a price of $69 and the receptionist had it as $79, but the night clerk was able to fix the problem. The location was near public transportation and three blocks from the Space Needle. We spent most of our time outside the hotel, so we didn't care what the hall carpet looked like. With other hotels downtown starting at $125 and up, we thought we got what we paid for.

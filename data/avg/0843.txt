Stayed at the Westin for a week and found it to be only average. I did ask for a quiet room and I did get this, which was great. However, there was a distinct smell of smoke in the room - jetlag prevented me from asking for another. There was no shower gel provide. There was no proper breakfast facility - other than a cafe-type place that was pretty poor. Internet connection was not free - in this day and age, this is ridiculous. On the positive side, the room was large and the view was great. But overall, it was not a great experience.

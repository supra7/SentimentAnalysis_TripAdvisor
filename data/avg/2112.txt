The location is great and you can do lots of walking from the hotel. The design is different and modern with an oriental touch. The rooms were very, very small and looking over a courtyard made our room too dark. I did not like that the glassdoor between the room and the toilett did not shut properly - no privacy here. The breakfastbuffet was nothing spectacular and the staff did not seem interested in being helpful. Nonetheless, we were there with a group of friends and had our fun elsewhere. For the very low prices we paid it was OK.

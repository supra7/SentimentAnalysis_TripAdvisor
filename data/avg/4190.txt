We really enjoyed our stay at the Park Plaza, but it ended on a sour note. My husband had removed his wedding band to wash his hands and left it on the bathroom shelf. We called security about it, but the housekeeping staff denied finding it. It was his fault for leaving it there, but an honest housekeeper would have turned it in. Other than that we were pleased with the room and staff.

hacienda itself is a beautiful resort the rooms are excellent, the grounds are beautiful. the food was ok but still reminicent of your average all american all inclusive buffet. for being a 5 star resort i would have liked to have better service especially from the concierges. i was quite taken aback when i made a request with marvin and his response was rude and arrogant. also one of the female concierges cant remember her name, rolled her eyes at me when i asked for a better description of what the chefs dinner entailed. not impressed. the beach was ok but for playa standards it needs a lot of work. the drinks are probably the best thing about the all inclusive theyre not watered down like in other places, and the pools are kept nice and clean except there are almost always kids in the adult pool. overall it was enjoyable but id rather stay at the ritz for that kind of money.

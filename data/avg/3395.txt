It wasn't the best of hotels but after adjusting to the circumstances of the hotel, we realized we weren't really paying for the hotel but for the location, which was great! The hotel was near Chinatown, Paddy's Market, Darling Harbour, Hyde Park and Central Station. Breakfast was available in the hotel which was a relief. Lunch and dinner was not a problem as lots of Chinese and Japanese restaurants and fast food places and food courts were easily accessible from the hotel. Be prepared as the hotel does not have a concierge department so be prepared to carry your bags from where you came from to your room. Rooms are small but bathrooms are clean. Do not expect majestic views of the city as there are none. But if you're like me, the hotel will only serve as a sleeping and bathing place as you will be out in the streets most of the day anyway. The great thing about the hotel also is that its about a block away from the nearest Sydney Explorer bus stops. There are two: Central Station and Chinatown. I'd recommend the hotel mostly for the location and the price.

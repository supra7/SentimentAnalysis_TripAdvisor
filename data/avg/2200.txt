I stayed at Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas for 4 nights last week. We had a fabulous suite on the 49th floor. It's not the hotel's fault but the north view is like looking over a huge industrial estate - endless grey, flat roofed factories. The receptionist at check-in was fabulous and very helpful however for the first 2 days our newspaper didn't arrive. The room looked great but lacked proper cleaning. The shower heads were encrusted with limescale, the dressing table in the bathroom was very badly damaged on top (this could have been avoided by placing a piece of glass on it in the first place - who puts a black painted table in a bathroom?!) and the room was always dusty. Each day we had to remind housekeeping to service the room in the late afternoon. There was only a coffee machine and no tea or fresh milk provided, despite our suite having a full kitchen. Our room was not quiet - despite being high up. Trains went by, helicopters went by and cars and sirens could be heard. We had breakfast just once. The service was ok but I ordered scrambled eggs. On arrival they looked like mushed up fried eggs so I sent them back only to be advised by the server that the chef would simply chop them up a bit and send them back to me! Extraordinary! Finally, the bar is like a barn. It's dreadful. The staff are keener on talking to their friends than serving customers - not good. Check out was excellent. In fact the only impressive and well trained staff seem to be those on the front desk. Trump has an awesome website. It looks great but don't be misled. They have fallen into the biggest marketing trap - over-promising and under-delivering.

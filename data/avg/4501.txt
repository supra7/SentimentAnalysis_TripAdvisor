My mom and I stayed at this hotel in October 2011 before leaving on a cruise. All of the literature we read was that this was considered "waterfront". Imagine our dismay, when finding this hotel a couple of miles from the actual waterfront area. It is a nice hotel but nothing extra special. The staff is friendly enough and the rooms nice enough. If you want a nice hotel in the Theater District in Boston, this might be a reasonable priced choice. If you want waterfront, stay at the Marriot Long Warf.

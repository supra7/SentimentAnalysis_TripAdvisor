We got married in hawaii and stayed for our honeymoon. This hotel was decent. We must have been in the "old " wing because the bathroom had no tub just a shower stall. The room was clean and the beds and pillows were actually really soft and nice. Beach was nice...you have to pay for chairs and umbrellas so keep that in mind. We paid for the buffet breakfast when we booked the trip and it was nice to wake up and just go downstairs for breakfast but its the same food everyday. Eggs, cold potatoes, mystery meat and fish, cereal, fruit...not a huge selection. We were very sick of eating it by the end of the week and the servers (all they do is bring u a cup of coffee and water) expect you to leave a 20% tip for doing basically nothing. The staff was ok...nothing special. I am not sure why they call themselves the "most hawaiian hotel". There are shows at night but after seeing one its enough. Location is ok...you can walk to whalers village and there are 3 good restaurants there...we liked Hula Grill the best. You can also catch the bus there and get an all day pass for $2.There is really nothing else in walking distance and if you ask the staff where a good place to eat is they act like no one has ever asked them before. They are also awful at giving directions so be cautious. I would not recommend eating dinner at the hotel restaurant...expensive and not very good. The tiki bar to go food was decent tho. Another thing is that we were probably the youngest people staying at the hotel and we are both 30...it is a much older crowd. Everyone was older than my parents. All in all, the hotel served its purpose but I wish we would have stayed somewhere a little nicer for our honeymoon. I would probably stay somewhere else in the future if we were to go back and pay a little more money. If you are on a budget tho and just want somewhere clean to stay this is a good place.

I loved the rooms at the Trump. The beds were great and the bathroom was amazing. The kitchenette would have come in handy if we were there for a longer trip. The pool was really nice. On the flipside the view from our room was lousy. The walk from the strip is miserable because there is no sidewalk. If there was a sidewalk it wouldn't have been that bad, but walking on the side of the road in heels at 3 in the morning in vegas isn't fun. There only appears to be one restaurant and a small bar. There is no casino. The hotel is beautiful but there aren't many ammenaties.

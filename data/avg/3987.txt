Stayed one night in this hotel when in London for a football game. As we were on a tight budget I choosed this hotel as it had good reviews compared to others in this price category. The hotel is longer way from the city center than it seemed on a map. As we used the hotel only for sleeping and not as a base for sightseeing it was OK. Check in without problems. Rooms and furniture seems to be older, but room and also bathroom were clean, although the equipment seemend a bit worn. The surroundings area did not seem dangerous and a shopping centre is 15 minutes walk (or a short ride by the bus). Breakfast were simple but I did manage. Checkout quick and again without problems. Overall for those on tight budget this hotel is OK.

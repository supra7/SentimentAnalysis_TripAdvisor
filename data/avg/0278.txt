We stayed at the Moore for 2 nights prior to our Alaska cruise trip. The Moore locates in a very good location. You can walk to the pier, pike place market and downtown area easily. I went jogging along the waterfront and to the nice park and enjoyed it. We walk to our NCL Pearl at Pier 66 to board our ship and it is a nice walk downhill. So, location is excellent for the price. The hotel is not fancy but clean. We spend a little more to have our own bathroom, instead of sharing, which is worth the money. There is a small TV, but no refrigerator or drink. But, that is not a problem because you can walk to buy all the stuff you want nearby. This hotel is good for budget traveller who wants to stay near downtown area. By the way, we have a great time in Alaska and NCL pearl is fanstastic.

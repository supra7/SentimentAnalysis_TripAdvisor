Stayed twice due to flight cancellations and it was fine. Then I stayed for one week when every single hotel downtown was booked except the Four Seasons and paid the highest rates I've ever seen listed at this location. A big plus was dining at the bar and room service was very good. The staff was also helpful for getting a package sent and other requests. Overall, food and service compensated for old rooms and noise. At normal rates this is average, but at near full rates, you can't help but feel let down.

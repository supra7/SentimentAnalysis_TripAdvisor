We are generally loyal Hilton Garden Inn customers, but this one just didn't make it for us. The room was too warm, and there really was no way to adjust the A/C to make things cooler. Beware: no bathtubs. Just shower stalls, so they told me. The lady of the house was not amused. And the plastic floor covering of the stall already had bubbled. The placement of the rail in the stall was not ideal either. The internet service was as slow as molasses in January (circa 1992), both in the business center and, even more pronounced, in the room. I was not amused. This could have been an anomaly, but I'm glad I wasn't there on business. We're diamond club members, so we received the complimentary breakfast buffet --- but that was a disappointment too, a surprise for Canada. We actually paid to eat somewhere else on the second day of our stay. The parking garage is fine, as long as you take it slow. The location is good for walking to Vieux-Montreal. We've seen worse for sure, we also expect a little more from this chain.

A favorite of cruise liners as it is close to many cruises leaving Seattle. Our hotel was completely sold out with people leaving & returning on cruises. Typical of a Quality Inn more so than Quality Inn & Suites. Check in was smooth & employees helpful. clean rooms with comfortable beds. nice pool area. continental breakfast was very crowded. onsite parking. Somewhat pricey for what you get, but you are paying for location which is good if you want to be near the Space Needle (2 blocks). bbeerbower

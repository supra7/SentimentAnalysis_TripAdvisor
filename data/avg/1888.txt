We stayed here on our honeymoon. Maui was the 2nd island we visited. Compared to our hotel in Kauai, this hotel was much more dated. I get that they want to be Hawaiian, but they could update the furnishings and bed and still have the same feel. We had an partial ocean view room, but could only see a sliver of water because we were on the 2nd floor behind some trees. One other note to honeymooners- this is a VERY family friendly hotel with only one pool. We love children, but after getting up to see the sunrise we just wanted to relax and sleep by the pool. It was difficult to do with the cannonball competition at the pool by a few children with little supervision. We loved the location! Quick walk to the Whalers Village was so nice. From there we often took the shuttle to Lahaina. The staff was friendly and mostly helpful. As part of our package, we had free tickets to the magic show at the hotel, but the performers decided to take a week vacation the week we were there. The staff at the hotel treated us to a meal because of the inconvenience. I also did the lei making class, which was fun.

Having lived in Germany for three years and extensively traveling to various countries in Europe, the Hotel Lumen would be a typical 3 star hotel. The rooms have the decor, and simplistic layout traditional of a European Hotel. The shower / water pressure is "ala" Germany where there is ample water pressure and flow. The Seinfield Episode where Kramer has illegal shower heads comes to mind because it is easy to want to stay in the shower for long periods of time (just don't wash the produce off in the shower)! The Aveda amenties are superior to those that you would find in typical chain hotels. Although the Lumen is not on par with the other Kimpton Hotel nearby, it is a very good value and has a great location and service.

The hotel is located in a fairly central spot within easy walking distance of tram stops and shopping areas. Check in was quick and efficient. The rooms were a bit "olde worlde" for my own personal preference, as was the hotel in general, but it may be to others tastes. The room itself was clean with a new HD flatscreen TV. The bathroom was also adequate. The hotel put on food for our conference which was of a good quality - though we didn't actually eat in any of the restaurants. The gym facilities are adequate - though a bit on the small side given the size of the hotel. Although i didn't personnaly use the internet (not complementary), feedback from my colleagues suggested it was a very fast connection. Overall, a good hotel if you like period features, situated in a good location.

Stayed here for a long weekend. We got a good deal on the room price ($110.00/night) for the location. The a/c did not work and we had to prop the window with a sturdy book. The window was very heavy. I noticed other patrons were creative in their window-propping; a wooden coat-hanger for example. The bathrooms were nice with marble vanity etc. Other reviews complained of the smallness of the bathrooms, but we found this to be okay. Clean with good soaps, shampoos. Easy walk to Underground Tour and Pike's Market. Staff were real nice and let us check in early on a rainy day. The airport bus (Grey Line) shuttled right around the corner which was very convenient. Free WiFi!

This is an absolutely beautiful hotel. The grounds, the lobby, and the pool areas are top tens. However the rooms are just o.k. The beds are very comfortable, but that is about it. The prices range from $250 a night down to around $650. For that amount I would look around for a good deal on a condo in the same area, and come over to the Hyatt for the day. Plus if you don not pay extra for the oceanveiw rooms it is not worth it. There are several places nearby that have just as good of a location, and veiws. Also I would have to say that the staff is just average, not unfriendly, but also not the most helpful. For the best advise on places to stay buy the book Maui Revealed, they have great advise on everything in Maui.

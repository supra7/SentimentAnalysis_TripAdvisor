The hotel is conveniently location to discover Boston city center and walk downtown within a few minutes. However we were disturbed by the noise of the ice machine (despite being several doors away) and it was possible to hear people talks next door because all rooms connect together with doors which did not make rooms properly sound proof, in my opinion. Excepted this, the hotel is clean, breakfast buffet is great and the hotel has eveything expected for such hotel.

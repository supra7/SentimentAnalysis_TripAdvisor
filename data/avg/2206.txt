I've stayed in Trump New York and Trump Chicago (one of my favorite hotels in the US) so I chose Trump Las Vegas for a recent business trip -- it was a bad call. The property is not up to par with its sister properties. What I enjoy and require most at Trump are the amenities that come with a studio-type or suite room, the actual fridge, dishes, dishwasher, sink and cooktop -- these are perfect for entertaining guests or colleagues. In Las Vegas, you have 2 small plates and 2 glasses, that's it. I thought it was just an oversight, so I called down for additional glasses -- beer glasses, wine glasses, cocktail glasses, but they only brought up 2 additional water glasses that you would find in the bathroom. They also seem to skimp on the little details, robes and slippers, extra towels in the bathroom, etc. I'll go back to the Four Seasons in Las Vegas while on business and let our Travel department know the experience... even the Bellagio beats the Trump, hands down. Oh, I also sent my feedback to the Trump Attache, who is there solely to assist clients -- not even a response.

We stayed in the suite of this hotel paying 580 euros per day, for three days. Except for the location, so near Trevi Fountain, it was a rip off. The room did not have basic facilities like Tea/Coffee Making, or an Iron. Breakfast room was crowded and one had to wait. The dining tables in the breakfast room were so small that two tea cups would fill the table. Toast had to be ordered and came after a wait of 30 mins, chilled ofcourse. Bottom line is it was a Rip Off, at this price.

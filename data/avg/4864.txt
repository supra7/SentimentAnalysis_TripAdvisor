The Palmer House is a Chicago icon so I was looking forward to the stay there. Indeed the initial impression of the grand lobby met that expectation. So did the attentive service received from hotel staff, from the bellman who greeted me on arrival to the front desk staff. It was apparent that the staff was well trained in customer service. My room, however, was a great disappointment. The inside room had frosted windows which, when opened, revealed a view of the indoor pool one floor below. With this came the noise from the pool area and the humid chlorine smell associated with indoor pools. While the room was a nice size, the only place to sit was at a strait backed chair at the desk or on the bed. There was no coffee maker, refrigerator or microwave in the room. There was an internet connection--for a substantial daily fee. The bathroom fixtures were cheap, such as you might find at a discount plumbing supply company. There was no grab rail in the shower/tub--nothing to hold on to when climbing in or out, and no curved shower curtain railing--just the old fashioned strait variety. On the positive side, being an inside room, there was no traffic noise, the central heating/cooling system was quiet and easy to adjust, the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great. And, being an older building, the closet was huge. Nonetheless, I found the room a great disappointment, and vastly overpriced for the amenities provided.

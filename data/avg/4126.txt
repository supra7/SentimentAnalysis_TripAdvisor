I visited the hotel when it was undergoing some renovation (painting, etc.) and it was pretty much a mess around the entry and lobby area. Except for the smell of paint, the rooms were fine and had a good view out onto the water. In general, I understand that hotels need to refresh periodically, but the staff were oblivious to the fact that it created some inconvenience and less than a fully desirable situation for guests, and they did nothing to try and alleviate these inconveniences. If the renovation is done, I'd try it again.

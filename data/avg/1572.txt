If you are looking for a descent hotel to stay at for one night that is downtown and not too expensive this is a good place. But I do have a good amount of complaints and one VERY good positive. I will start with the positive, if you want to workout at a gym or go for a swim, this is the place. This hotel is attached to a Maryland Sports Complex that has a HUGE gym and a lap pool, lazy pool, large kids pool and a hot tub. Now the bad, the service is basic, the front desk guy was not real pleasant and when asked if it was a quiet room, he was like "sure". When I got to my room, I was tired and realised that right across the square two buildings were under construction. So, unless you sleep REALLY heavy or have great earplugs like me, don't stay on the odd side of the building (faces water/square). The room service room is sandwiches and apps....that is it, no entrees...and they don't get the order completely correct either. My room, 1015, had weird smells in it, like by the door, it smelled like a cat litter box and then over by the bed, sometimes I got a wif of poop smell. Oh, and I did not need it, but my King Bed Room (non-suite) did not have a bath tub, only a glassed in shower. Overall, I am glad I was only staying over night, just to sleep...the room was smaller than I expected from this chain. Oh, and good luck getting a coffee at the Starbucks next door within 15 minutes during rush times, or them getting it correct, oh, and the staff being friendly.....worst Starbucks so far.

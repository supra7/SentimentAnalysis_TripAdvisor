Don't stay at Marriott. Online booking price totally misleading. $40 parking. $25 rollaway. Doesn't include a pillow and blanket. Front desk a d manager really do 't care. Rewards member since '91 and they just don't care. Just book the Ritz who will charge you but will give you great customer service. Manager took 4 hours to call and didn't leave much of a message. Guess i will call tomorrow and see if they care. Next step i will call the GM. Marriott is BAD,BAD,BAD.

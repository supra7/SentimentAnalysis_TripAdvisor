We just returned from a 5 night stay at the Hampton Inn. The suite was very large and roomy. Location handy to everything. Staff were courteous and helpful. Continental breakfast the usual. The only con was that we were located across from a firehall. This was very annoying and I'm a sound sleeper! I asked to be moved to a room further away from the firehall but nothing was available. My experience leads me to not recommend this hotel unless you bring ear plugs!

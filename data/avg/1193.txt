Staying in town for a conference and wanting to be close to the Convention Center, we chose the Roosevelt. Wonderful location. But the rooms were so average--small, ordinary, and needing a bit of sprucing up. I love historic hotels and often stay in them, but this one didn't have anything that would bring me back. Front desk staff was friendly and did a great job with the flow of things. I don't think that we ever waited more than a minute for anything.

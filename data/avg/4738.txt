We stayed five nights at the Hotel Monaco, opting out of the better chains, primarily basing our decision to stay on the reputation of the Kimpton Hotel chain and the Travel Advisor ranking. Even though we stayed during a convention--understandably there's little choice in rooms--, we would have expected better. We arrived at 12:30 PM and were shown two rooms that we rejected. The first one was very dark and the second one though a bit less dark, had a funny smell (in fact the beds in all the rooms smelled funny--poor soap or old feather pillows). We were told that at 3 PM we would be offered a nicer room. At 3:20, we inquired and were told that our room was not ready. After discussing this (the manager said to me with veiled sarcasm: "I'm sure you have stayed at better hotels" when I said I was upset by this), we were finally given a room facing a wall on the 14th floor, which was otherwise fine. We did complain about the coldness in the room and were told to take off the fan and the temperature would be fine--it never went above 68. The hotel is in a good location, the rooms are tastefully decorated (though showing their age) the adjacent restaurant serves a great breakfast, but I will never come back here.

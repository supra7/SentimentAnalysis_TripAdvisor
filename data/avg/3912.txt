Paia Inn is charming in a funky way. The hostess was lovely. Our room was clean although the towels had stains. The room was large and the furniture was adequate. The air conditioner did not work very well. The bathroom is small and motel like. Outdoor furniture is worn, especially the chairs. The beach is lovely and the hotel has a direct path to it. But if you are elderly or fragile, the path is slippery with no bannister. All of this is fine, except the price was too high for what was offered. We paid over $200 and that is not a funky price.

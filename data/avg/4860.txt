Old hotel with a magnificently decorated lounge, however extremely noisy and busy. Check in took ages as the front desk was understaffed and there was a long queue waiting. The Palmer House is expensive ($275.00 per night) as are most hotels in Chicago. I booked a room at the executive floor, the price was $30.00 more than my colleagues paid for a regular room that they booked through the congress. The room has all you need, but is not very fancy, very small bathroom, old fashioned TV set, which is not acceptable in this price range. Internet is another $20,00 per day, even at the executive floor. The executive floor has a quiet lounge, soft drinks are for free, continental breakfast included, and free snacks from 17.00-19.00hr. It was an oasis of rest in a very hectic hotel. I booked this hotel for its location between the convention centre at McCormick Place and the city centre. In the end it is too far to walk to the convention centre (50 minutes) but for the city centre it is OK. To my opinion this hotel is overpriced for what you get.

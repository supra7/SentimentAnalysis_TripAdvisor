I like this hotel a lot. It's beautiful and elegant. While it's definitely old (1927), it's well maintained and clean. My biggest complaint though is that they don't offer computers for customers to get online. You can hookup a laptop in your room, but if you don't have a laptop, they offer an internet service on your TV for $12.95/24 hours. DON'T BUY IT!! The TV internet doesn't work at all. It's not compatible with any websites and is painfully slow (slower than any dialup modem). So, if you're addicted to the internet, make sure you bring a laptop or stay somewhere else such as the Sheraton. The Sheraton offers multiple computers for guest use. If you go, make sure to visit the Bonfire restaurant in the hotel. It is excellent and worth every penny.

Let's get one thing straight: this is NOT a boutique hotel... although it bills itself as such. Rough towels, hard pillows, roly-poly mattress (bed moves sideways every time someone moves), worst breakfast we ever had in a hotel or even an inexpensive motel (plain bagels, no pastries or other bread items, cheap yogurt, instant oatmeal, no juice, whole apples, no banana or berries). Great big rooms but those in front of building don't have windows that open and some (like the one we had the first night) don't have a ceiling fan. The only way to get air movement was to run the air conditioner (very noisy and made it too cold). It was too stuffy so we asked for a portable fan. None available on site and desk clerk offered no options. We asked for the manager who was more helpful and we consented to a room switch to the back, looking at a painted brick wall but at least the window opened and it was quiet. Having a kitchen is great if you want to cook a quick meal but the Marqueen's kitchens provide no pots and pans or utensils. Only silverware, glasses and plates. Good luck! Location is good -- near Seattle Center, buses, some restaurants, foot of Queen Anne hill (good walking and views). Rooms are big and have sofas and/or chairs and decent TV. Be aware, there's no elevator but bellmen are great in hauling bags up and downstairs. Paid through Hotels.com so got a reduced rate. If paid full rate, we would have been really disappointed.

Roma the front desk staff is a gem. She makes an ordinary hotel extraordinary. The place is minimalist and totally Ikea. Nothing fancy but things do work. If you like sumptuous hotels this is not your place. It is really barebones but it felt comfortable and reasonably roomy. Certainly not the best hotel in Rome but thanks to Roma who really cared about a screw up with our restaurant booking we will always have fond memories of the place. The elevator is a bit scary but the walk will do you good! Breakfast is basic.

Stayed here whilst attending meeting at the Rai. So the hotel is about 5-10 minutes walk from the Rai and 3 minutes from a Train/Metro /Tram station. About 30 min or less from airport wit h about 6 trains an hour to the airport. Rooms are reasonably sized and shower works well. Good supply of shampoo and body lotion. Pillows too soft but there are extra in the wardrobe. Breakfast is fine and they have newspapers to read whilst having your breakfast. Mixed fruit for putting on your cereal, but pineapple mixed with melon and apple, whereas I just prefer pineapple only. There is nowhere in particular to walk to after the conference - there are some restaurants around which seem OK - I had a pizza in a Sicilian place and it was quite nice and good value - pizza, beer and salad was about 20. The hotel itself seemed fairly expensive for what was there - 149 incl B'fast + Sales Tax, per night. It would have been better to stay in a hotel near the centre of Amsterdam and then commute to the Rai. Museums etc seem to close around 5pm so if you want to see anything you need to arrive early.

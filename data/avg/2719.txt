We were there to visit what had been rated by Frommer's as one of the best beaches in Puerto Rico. Well, the beach was pretty substandard(unless you like seaweed), but obviously quite popular with the locals. As such, we spent more time than we had anticipated at the time share. First of all, the location is lovely, as it is very short walk to the beach( you get a key from the front desk that allows you to go through a fence to the beach). The neighbor complex was extremly high end as we saw huge yachts parked in front of each unit along a canal. The staff was extremely accomodating and provided cookies and juice in the afternoon. It is located quite near the stands and restaurants in the vicinity(again with the use of the provided key). It is a very attractive complex on the outside. The actual units were nothing special but very adequate for our purposes. The best part of the complex is the pool. The water was quite comfortable and the size of the pool allows for swimming laps.There is a bar/restaurant area adjacent to the pool but rarely seemed to be used. There were advertisements for a restaurant buffet all over the place, but were told that the restaurant had closed down. Overall, a satisfactory complex, though very disappointing beach...

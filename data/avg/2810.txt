This is the experience my husband & I had on a Saturday night: Pros: Nice room, nice lobby, large breakfast buffet. Staff was nice and helpful. Cons: Had to wait 50 minutes for car to be brought to us by valet. We heard doors sham shut 5 times after midnight. A couple of places walking back to hotel had some riff raff hanging around (but they didnt bother us). Bottom line, next time we will stay at a hotel that is below Rampart Street.

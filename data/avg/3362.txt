The Amazinn was just average - not terribly clean, not terribly dirty, not the cheapest, but not the most expensive. The room was dark, and the furniture was okay. The bath had a musty smell, and they are not generous with towels. It took us two days to find the swimming pool. We had to ask for an iron and ironing board, and waited a day for them to find it. The continental breakfast was terrible - we got coffee and that was it. Good southern cooking at really reasonable prices is easily available in Branson, so look elsewhere for breakfast. Now for good stuff - the people were very nice, the price is right in the mid-range, and the location is convenient. We won't go again, however. We have stayed at much nicer places in Branson that are in the same price range. It is convenient to have a refrigerator and microwave in the room. And the best ice cream in Branson is right next door!!

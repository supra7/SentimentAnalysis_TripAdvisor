I was looking for a place to stay for one night after a long cruise and before we had a flight the next day. The location is awesome, just a few blocks from the Termini Station. There is no "reception" and we almost walked past the hotel, keep an eye on the numbers! Once you ring the bell the booking manager comes to you and takes to you to your room. He was very kind and helpful and arranged for our taxi the next AM to the airport. We than had to walk around the block to our rooms. We had help from Damus, another employee. Especially since we were on the 3 floor and no lift. He also left us his cell phone number and told us to call if we needed anything. We got a coupon to get breakfast the next AM and off we went. The triple room was tight but clean! The bathroom is clean and new as well. For one night it was just perfect. Small and clean and basic. There was a small TV in the room, no phone but we had a nice size window and an air ventilator. I wanted a place that was clean and safe for one night at a good price and that is what we got. Breakfast was a pastry and cappie at the local shop.

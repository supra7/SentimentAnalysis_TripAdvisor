This is an older Courtyard property. The common areas are in very good condition but the rooms need upgrading. The furniture, bed and TV are all showing their age. The furniture is worn and stained, the bed sags a bit and the TV's performance was poor. When I first stepped into my room I saw three roaches in the bathroom area. I managed to kill one but the other two got away. It has been years since I have seen roaches in a hotel room. The room was clean but the presence of the roaches point to a problem somewhere. I ate dinner and breakfast at the hotel. Both meals were very good and the wait staff was great. I would not recommend this hotel primarily because of the roaches I found in my room. The room condition should be improved soon if this property wishes to compete with other hotels in the area.

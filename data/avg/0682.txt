I originally had a couple problems with customer service in my stay. I was contacted directly by the Hotel manager and my view of the customer service was changed. During my stay, the Hotel was extremely busy. I only booked for one night and was not in the room much. I believe that the problems I encountered would have been corrected immediatly had I noticed it sooner. I would stay at the hotel again but would only stay in one of the larger rooms.

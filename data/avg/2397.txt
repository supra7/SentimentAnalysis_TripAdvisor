This was our first time in Philadelphia, and I had made reservations at the Rodeway Inn for 5 family members. A friend also stayed there. First the good news. The location could not be beat-near public transit, many sightseeing sites, and close to stores. The other good news was that we got a great "senior" price, esp. for city center. Most of the front office staff was helpful, and our room was very large with two comfortable beds. Also, each room had a microwave and refrig, which we really appreciated. This is a very old building, with much need of upgrading. Although we were on the 6th floor, we could hear street noise as if it was right outside of our room. In my sister-in-laws room the towel rack came off the wall, and was never fixed. The elevator was small and very scary, with a very old system of door closing. On our first day, at one point we had to wait 1 1/2 hours in the lobby while they got someone to fix the elevator which wasn't running. The bathroom was small and basic. While we were there, they were in the middle of upgrading the locks, but before that happened we had to get our keys changed a few times as they didn't open the door. In general, they seemed to be having a number of problems with their "infrastructure". If you're looking for plush accomodations and nice views, this is not the hotel for you. However, if you need clean, comfortable, bland rooms in city center, this is a great choice.

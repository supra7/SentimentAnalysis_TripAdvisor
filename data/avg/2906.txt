Check-in/out Staff at front desk were efficient. Room/Facility/Lobby For the price, they've done a decent job with the upkeep of this older property. Nothing that would WOW a traveler, but just a very comfortable stay. There's no in-room safe, which I believe they should really invest in adding to the rooms. Most travelers nowadays carry iPads, iPods, etc and we need a safe place to store our goodies. WIFI Free WIFI service throughout the hotel and in the rooms. I love that they're not nickel and diming this service like other major hotels. Room: 1901 Best to avoid all the "XX01" rooms as they're all located next to the staff service entrance. Every morning at 8 am sharp, the service door next to my door would start to slam as the staff go about their day. A rude awakening for sure. Pool A small roof top pool is available with a beautiful view of Lake Michigan. Restaurants I had breakfast at both the Sky Lounge and the British Pub down stairs. You go to the Sky Lounge for the breathtaking view of the lake (the buffet breakfast food was quite bad). May be better to go for a cup of tea or cocktail at night. The British Pub restaurant downstairs has great service and good quality food. TAXI/Train to AIRPORT USD$8 for taxi to Clark/Lake Blue Line CTA station + $2.50 for CTA train to O'hare Airport. USD$40 for taxi to O'hare Airport. Final Thought Can't beat the value for Michigan avenue adjacent. Clean comfortable and affordable stay.

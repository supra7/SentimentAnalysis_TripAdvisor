We stayed here one night prior to flying out on an early flight. As soon as we arrived we were asked, do you want a King, it will be $20 more, nope we don't need a King. Do you need parking? $20 more. We did, a little pricy, and didn't know about the price of parking by looking at the website prior. However to be honest the parking was abundent and secure. I requested a very quiet room with NO adjoining room due to noise. Was given a key and lugged the bags up only to walk in and see an adjoining door. Back down to the lobby, given a new room. Back upstairs with bags, open the door, yup again an adjoining door. This time I called the front desk and was told a new key would be delivered. We went to the elevators to wait. After 10 minutes we went down to the front desk and got the key for ourselves. This time the room was perfect and was quiet. Bed was very very comfortable, tv was new, amenities were great. Did encounter people smoking on our floor even though this is a non smoking hotel.

Close to metro, located in center, many sights r walking distance, rather fair price, excellent breakfast, late check-out for 30 euro, very attentive staff. the only real inconvenience was that we had to go 1 floor down, then walk through the breakfast room and then go again up to access our room which was in the second building. but assuming rates and late check-out option, so convinient for us, we were ok about that. room was a bit small and walls were a bit thin (noise heard once). but to summarise, it's perfectly ok for friends/single/or reasonably budget stay. not good for a romantic getaway, special occasions of any type or senior travellers who might require more comfort.

It was clean, comfortable, and friendly. The hotel was what you would expect from a 3 star hotel...just a bit dated but definitely had personality. The desk clerk was wonderful and gave us coupon cards to all the downtown restaurants. The shuttle driver took us to the restaurant and offered to pick us up but we walked back. Everything was within walking distance. We would definitely stay again.

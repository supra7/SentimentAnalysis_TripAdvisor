The location is great; very central, close to shopping, only blocks away from the Convention Center and Pike Place Market. The staff was more than helpful, even went as far as digging through the kitchen to bring us up a bottle opener. The parking situation is interesting. The garage is adjacent, but stairs have to be used to make it to the hotel lobby; no elevator as an option. It was hard to get the luggage back and forth through the stairwell. We were on the 14th floor, which is one of the more updated floors. It's nice enough, but MUCH smaller that what shows on the pictures. The bathroom is nice but so small only one of us could be in there at a time, which was problematic when getting ready to go out for our dining and dancing. Overall, it's an okay hotel, but I'd probably go with a larger chain close by, that is more updated.

This is a very nice Hotel. It's beautiful, but it's not Five Star. First, Trump should have built on the strip or in City Center. The location is next to a seedy area (Erotic Sex museum) and railroad tracks. Five Star means the little things are taken care of. Well, one day when they cleaned the room, they forgot to pick up the breakfast room service setup. When we came to the room at midnight, we had to call to have someone come pick it up. Light bulbs burned out, toilet seat loose to the point it was dangerous to sit on, I had to tighten the screws myself. Room service delivered without salt and pepper nor napkins. No menu in the room. We asked for it twice, never delivered. Just stuff like this. Lobby staff very nice though. Won't stay there again.

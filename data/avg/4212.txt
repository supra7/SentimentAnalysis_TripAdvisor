Great location, but there is room for improvement in terms of the hotel interior/appearance. I've read a couple of reviews stating that you should expect a little quirkiness with an older hotel. This is true, but the problems appear to be deeper. While the room I had was fitted well (in terms of bedding/furniture), the washroom was a shamble. Beyond the mix-match of tiles (which i can live with), it appeared that the ceiling was going to cave in over the tub. Water from above must have seaped down below. There was a big bubble above the tub where the plaster appeared ready to burst. It appeared as though the water caused the wallpaper to peel off and that sombody quickly put it together in a sloppy fashion. Now I thought it was just my room.... but when the cleaners were in the room across from me, I took a quick peak and the same problem was present. The hotel is pretty good - just think it needs a little TLC and door staff need to be a bit more polished.

We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of April 2009 (myself, husband and teenage son). The rooms were small (1 single, 1 double) as were the bathrooms. The furnishings were very minimalistic - just a desk and bedside cabinets plus wardrobe. There were no drawers or cupboards at all although there was a safe, which is always needed. The rooms were both very clean and the staff friendly, although the air conditioning in neither room worked and despite trying, the staff couldn't fix it so we were very hot at night. Our cab driver had a lot of trouble finding the hotel, but location-wise it is ideal with the bus running every 15 minutes from the end of the road and the fare being only 1 euro each. There is a small menu here but the food is pre-packaged, convenience food directly from the freezer to the microwave. There is a free internet service which is a big plus point as some hotels charge high prices for this.

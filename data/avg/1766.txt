Roaches, outdated, inoperable refrigerator, bed hard as a rock, TV unformatted, Chair and couch uncomfortable. Really I'm not much of a complainer but I would never stay here again. Go to Mammas Inn and relax in tranquillity. Stayed there for two nights and 5 here at the Hyatt. You almost cannot ruin Maui. Have fun!

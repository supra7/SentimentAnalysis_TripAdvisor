Awkward is not a normal word to use in a hotel but this is a awkward hotel. We stayed at this Hilton right off I-5 in the heart in the heart of downtown Seattle for 2 nights. We were able to find the hotel easily but not the entrance because it wasn't clearly marked and we expected something more for a large, downtown hotel. We took the elevator to the lobby (on the 9th floor) and checked into room 2402 on the Executive level. We are Hilton Gold VIP's so we got a free upgrade plus free breakfast. We got to our room and found it generally small although clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the beds and had a great time in the Executive lounge upstairs. The staff was nice and so were the snacks they gave out. We went to the "Top of the Hilton Restaurant" on the top floor and had a nice breakfast with great views of Puget Sound. We did check-out early as we were expecting something more for our anniversary and moved to the Westin Downtown which was a very nice hotel. I probably would not stay here again, as I might try the Westin again or try the Arctic Club Doubletree hotel which is a little nicer, I think.

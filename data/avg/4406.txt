I stayed at Double Tree for Colombus Day week-end. sharing a suite while keeping our privacy was a big plus for us, I was travelling with my boyfriend and my aunt. The shuttle service is very convenient, eventhough it ends around 4pm on Sundays. The real downside of our stay was the noise in the room. Double Tree Guest Suites is home to one of the most famous jazz club of Boston. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and we heard the music until very late in the night, even in the bathroom. Asking for a higher level located room would probably do the trick.

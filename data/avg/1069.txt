The W hotel is in a great location in Seattle. We were a short walk in one direction to the monorail station, which we used to visit the Space Needle, and a short walk in the other direction to my favorite restaurant, the Metropolitan Grill. Of course being Seattle, we were surrounded by coffee shops that opened at 5 am (a good thing when you're coming from the east coast). My only issue with the W is the "trendy" attitude. It feels they go out of their way to make the W some type of cool destination that they forget about hospitality. It has a really great vibe to it, but after traveling all day, what you're really looking forward to is a friendly attitude. If they can learn to reconcile the two, this will be an amazing place to visit.

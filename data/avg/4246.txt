I think my review is best summarized by my first observation: they provide wrapped plastic cups in the guest rooms. Seriously - the same you might find at your local Motel 6. I expected better. My only other issues are the room furnishings (the room was very big, but sparsely furnished) and the parking was $48 a night. Everything else is what you would expect from an old classic hotel. I will not stay here next visit.

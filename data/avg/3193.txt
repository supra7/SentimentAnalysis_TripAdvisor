This hotel was conveniently located near the termini station however this is not an attractive area to stay. The rooms were clean and simple however the customer service lacked the charm and friendly helpfulness we found in other parts of Europe. Our room was also by the breakfast room which was a little noisy from 6:00am Would look else where is we were to return to Rome.

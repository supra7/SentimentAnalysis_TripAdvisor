I stayed at this hotel for two nights on business. This is a historic hotel, which means many things. The lobby is very ornate, almost gauche, but unique and interesting. The concierge desk was very helpful and knowledgeable. I stayed in a queen room, with a view of a brick wall and a crummy roof. Since I wasn't there for the view, I didn't mind so much. And as I mentioned, its a historic hotel. Therefore the bathroom was very small, but adequate, and the room was tiny. Two things about this hotel really bothered me. The toiletries in the bathroom. Now some might say "who cares?" But Hilton's always have the full range of toiletries. The Palmer House had only shampoo and conditioner and soap. No lotion, or other things that are common in most hotels. Also, one can usually request additional items at the desk. Not here. In fact, the front desk clerks were a bit rude about it. Since I travel light, those toiletry items were things I did not pack. The second weirdness, was no free internet. I have a hard time believing that in the days of wi-fi, the Hilton would still be charging so much for internet access to its customers. I'd probably stay elsewhere in Chicago in the future.

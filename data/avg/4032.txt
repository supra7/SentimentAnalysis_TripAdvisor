Stayed November 11th in a "wedding block" room-no particular complaints as the room was fairly quiet, adequately appointed, although it was difficult to shut out city lights and attain a level of privacy, and despite temperature controls, the night was chilly and there was no extra blanket in the closet. The real issue was that we stepped out for breakfast the next morning from 8:30-9:30, and, although we did not check out and were not planning to do so until close to the 12 PM check-out time, our room had been cleaned and given to another couple in the hour that we were out! When I explained this unfortunate situation to the manager at the front desk, and described how four people were made exceedingly uncomfortable (we used our key card to re-enter the room and were aghast that a couple was occupying it), all I received in the way of a response was a perfunctory "I'm sorry". Am I cranky or this this situation absurd and unacceptable? The short stay was $319.31 including tax.

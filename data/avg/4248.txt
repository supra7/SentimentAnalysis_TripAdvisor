The hotel has a fascinating history and the communal areas are comfortable and stylish. The rooms are decent quality but cleaning standards could be higher; if you move any fixtures then you'll likely find a layer of dust. Room service is pricey and the food served is pretty poor but the main resteraunt does offer tastier dishes. Some of the service leaves a little to be desired: reception and resteraunt staff are friendly enough but we found both the bellhops and the doormen surprisingly rude on several occassions. The location is however simply unbeatable, with the subway on your doorstep meaning most of Boston is only 10mins away.

Having read Tripadvisor i thought it would be a good hotel to stay at. We arrived at the hotel via a water taxi and basically hung our clothes up and then headed out to have a look round. when we came back we noticed the room (102) was really hot. I tried to lower the temp but the cooling system wasn't working. i phoned reception and they sent someone after a few minutes. Basically there was nothing they could do and said we would have to wait 'till morning before action could be done to address the problem because there was no other rooms although they did send some fans ! It definately seemed to be getting hotter and to be honest it felt as though i'd been out on the beach all day and had sun burn. My partner then went to reception and explained this was so uncomfortable. When she came back she was in tears and said the 2 men on reception had been really rude to her. Let's put it this way, after a frank discussion they found another room in the hotel, heaven knows why we went through all this upset in the 1st place when there was a vacant room all this time, ridiculous. Obviously the night's sleep wasn't the greatest after all that had gone on and i went to reception in the morning to complain once more about last night's problems. I spoke to a Gentleman called Simone who gave apologies and said can the hotel and us start afresh and try again. I have to say that Simone was very good and restored some of our confidence in the hotel and was even good enough to send a bottle of prosecco and some sweets to the room when we came back from the day out. To be fair this could have gone very very wrong after the 1st night, thankfully they had Simone there who had a bit of sense to sort the issue out.

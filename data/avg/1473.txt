This hotel is stunning, food and service are great. The only complaint was the pool side policy. If you are away from your lounge chair for more than 30 minutes the pool staff moves your things. I saw this cause so much stress and a few near fights. I pay this kind of money to relax, not worry that if I don't finish my breakfast in 30 minutes my things will be moved. We probably will not be returning to this resort unless they change that policy.

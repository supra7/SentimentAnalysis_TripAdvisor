My husband and I stayed here for 1 week on the second leg of our honeymoon. Having stayed at a Hilton hotel in Oahu we were a little disappointed with the comfort level of the rooms. Dubbed as the most Hawaiian hotel in Maui, the decor was traditional but a little out dated. The beds were uncomfortable and the maid service was a little unreliable. On the other hand the location was great for the beach, snorkeling, shopping and dining. The gardens were beautiful and the pool was good to. Surprisingly everything closed at 9pm and there was no room service. I would not recommend this for single people. I wold recommend this hotel for couples and families as it was good value in comparison to neighboring hotels.

Stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 3 nights. Here's my pros and cons: PROS: Pretty convenient location; very clean rooms, eclectic decor (if you like that style); nice beddings/linens, service is adequate, staff is polite. CONS: Small, dark rooms--small windows because building is old renovated space; small closets, bath tub/shower combo small, eclectic decor (if you DON't like being surrounded by funky stuff); small lobby, pricey restaurant. Bottom line is...given the level of quality in terms of service, amenities, and location, this should be a 3-4 star hotel, and it wouldn't be worth paying more than $200 a night for it, above that and you'd find something better around the same area of Chicago.

A good value for a 3 queen bed suite. Unfortunately that's the only value. Our room was as far as possible from the office so we never made it to the breakfast in time to try it. The room was clean, but the carpet felt dirty so I always kept on shoes. My biggest complaint is that housekeeping didn't arrive to clean our room until late afternoon on the first day..okay, we were in and out, so no problem. The second day, however, we were gone from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Arrived back to put little one down for nap and room still not clean. When I went to the office to request that housekeeping wait to clean our room till very late in the day when we would be leaving for shows, I was informed that housekeepers left at 4 p.m. and they offered to just give me a towel exchange. Basically, since they hadn't cleaned the room during the 5 hours I was out, either my room wouldn't get cleaned or the kiddo wouldn't get a nap - my choice! It is a great location, beds a bit too mushy soft for my taste, an adequate room but definitely no luxuries, doors open to the exterior so you do get some outside noise and if someone is on the sidewalk smoking, it comes in your a/c vent. A good choice for those who need a room to accomodate several people at a budget friendly price. I stayed here based on the favorable reviews online; I won't stay here again.

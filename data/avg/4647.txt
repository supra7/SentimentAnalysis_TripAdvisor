Had a party at the Fairmont, booked 2 rooms. Unless you get a great deal on the rate, it is expensive for the regular rooms. I have been here before, only stayed in the average rooms. I would like to see if the club floor or suites were outstanding. The rooms tend to be nice, the bathrooms are tiny. There is no coffee machine, and no coffee sold in the lobby, so room service is the only option, or go out to get coffee. The 2 pots of coffee serving 6 people, was 50.00 plus tip. That is a lot for coffee, got a whole breakfast delivered on linen with flowers at the Ritz Boston for less. 40/nite to park, valet never got my luggage out, a few problems but close to T, Pretty location, great resturants around. Liked this hotel better than the Copley Plaza Hotel, but not as nice as the Ritz Boston Common. The lobby is average, nice old bostonian bar, very elegant, but pricey. Nice location on Copley Square. The Door man/ Bellman? was helpful getting a gang to the North End for dinner.

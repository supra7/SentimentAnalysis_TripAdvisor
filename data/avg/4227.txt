I was travelling for a business meeting with tight schedules. The hotel is located in a good location and thats the only good part about this hotel. This is a old hotel and is clearly seen in the quality of the rooms. It does not have any amneties for a business traveller like No shuttle service, no free internet, no free breakfast - everything in charged.

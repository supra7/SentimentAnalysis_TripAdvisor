I have stayed there for 5+ times and I have extensive idea of it. There is nt much to says, that I have nt said in the heading, but below are more details. I prefer it coz its located near my work place (Kowloon bay), and i love my morning sleeps. For a tourist visiting HK for sight seeing, i would say there are plenty of better options. Below are the +ves & -ves + Absolutely neat and clean + Fast & free Internet. + Im addicted to their breakfast buffet (simple & nice) @ 88$ HKD + The staff is friendly and professional. + Hotel Looks are Modern, Inside/Outside: rooms, alley, bathrooms, carpet, furnishings, etc. fully carpeted. + Good sea/ harbour view if you get a front facing room (22th + floor). -ves: - A big minus: no facilities - no pool, no place to go to- other than room, no terrace, no - Restaurant is under renovation since 5 months - Far from the happening places (but near MTR metro line) - no bath-tub General Notes: o) Malls & food: APM & MegaBox are the closest Malls to the hotel, then there are: Telford 1,2, Amoy Plazas, etc. These malls have great food. There are plenty of Chinese restaurants in the area, but for other cuisines, you have to goto the malls. o) some of the facilities are: hot-water, e-safe, internet (LAN), refrigerator, laundry, restaurant (not presently@2010), 24hrs desk, cable. o) Its mostly taken up by visitor groups (40+ ppl), and is crowded from Jan-Jun. I dont like that part. o) I would nt call is value for money, coz it depends, how much you got it for, I guess a standard double bed room for $600 HKD is a nice deal, but if you pay more than $900 HKD, for it, its not worth it.

Stayed one night room 505 en route Hong Kong to Perth. When the elevator doors opened on level 5 I could not believe the tropical damp heat. That's because the hotel is open plan. My door faced the apron of the tarmac with several airplanes parked not 500 yards away. The room door was thick timber and the room was beautifully appointed and furnished. But it was not soundproof and Changi is a 24 hour airport. MY TIP. Ensure you have an ambient sound source to drown out the jet engines roar. I finally dozed off around 4 am, only to be up at 6 to catch the next leg. My other peeves were that the bed was rock hard, although that is not uncommon in Asia and that the air-conditioning vent was straight down onto the bed. Minor complaints though compared to no soundproofing.

Basically, a convention tied me to this place, otherwise, I would have stayed elsewhere. For a small-ish dingy room (no view) with nothing but a $7 bottle of water and a bottle of shampoo that wasn't even replaced regularly, the price - $530 a night, $350 with the convention "discount" is insane. And yes, they charge for internet in the rooms - $13 a night. There's free wifi in the lobby and on the 2nd floor, if you're not too annoyed by having to reconnect frequently. They don't have any of the basics (no DVD players to rent, tea bags but no kettle, meaning your tea will have to be made from hot water from the coffeemaker...which tastes like coffee, etc.) here - just bare bones. Decent nachos at the Champions bar on the second floor, but not much else to recommend the place. The gym is okay too, but like I said, for that price, lordy, you can do better.

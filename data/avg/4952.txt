My husband treated me to a night in Chicago at the Palmer House for Valentines Day. After spending most of the day shopping, we were ready to put our feet up and relax a bit before dinner. Arriving to check-in at approximately 3:40 pm, the line for check-in was nothing like I have ever seen before - I guess it would resemble more of a line I would expect to see at the airport then a line I should expect to see at a hotel. Needless to say, our feet did not get the much anticipated relief for another half an hour or more. I would have had a glass of wine to make the wait more enjoyable but I couldnt seem to get over the outrageous price. After arriving to our room, I noticed that our room did not resemble the stylish modern king size rooms that they show on the hotels website, it had more of an 80s motif with peeling wallpaper. I cant see that anything had been updated in the bathroom in a long time and there was no hairdryer. Yet another disappointment! I guess the topper was in the middle of the night with the loud guests on our floor. I know this is not the fault of the hotel but where I do find fault is in the large gap between our door and the floor  with this nice large gap and our room being at the end of a long hallway all of the noise, talking, etc seemed to filter directly into our room and at times it was like the group was in our room with us. The beds were comfortable but unfortunately we did not get a sound sleep. When we were leaving the hotel in the morning, while passing the bags of chips, candy, pop and liquor that our loud neighbors had strewn about, I did notice that the door to our room seemed to be the only one on the floor with the very large gap  unlucky us!

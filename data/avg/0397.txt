Found a great package here that included free parking or free breakfast. We took the first as parking in these hotels can be pretty spendy and there are plenty of breakfast places around. Got ourselves a small room with a king sized bed up on the 15th floor. I don't like noise so they found me a nice little spot even away from the street. Fairly quiet except for sirens periodically despite that. Other issues no free wifi, and in this day and age it feels like you are being slighted. They also had one of those 1 coffee cup machines in your room with, only 1 coffee filter.. so one of us had coffee in the morning anyway. Very clean and the decor fairly updated. The lobby is absolutely huge and beautiful. There are 3 restaurants (one is cafe) in the building which is also convenient. The food presentation was wonderful and the crabcakes were chock full of crab! The building goes up to the 28th floor and the view (also name of the lounge) is truly spectacular. The gym is also located on the 28th floor so you get a nice view while you are working out and lots of new machines as well as a swimming pool and a hot tub. That night of the wedding though they were packed in the swimming and hot tub area. All in all a decent place though we did run into a snafu in that they had a large wedding party that affected the parking and so when we got back from our evening we could not park actually for "free" in their garage. We ended up having to find a spot on the street instead.

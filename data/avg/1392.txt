Stayed here two nights on returning to Seattle. The airport is right across the street from the hotel but I can't find anything else overly positive to say about our experience. It was just an average place and didn't live up to the hype that we had heard about it from relatives who had stayed there. We got a good deal on a 1 BD suite but it was right next door to the elevator, of which you could hear the inner workings in the walls when you were in the sitting room and bathroom. The rug outside our bathroom was quite damp, as if water had leaked from the bathroom to the rug. After turning on our fan, it was dry the next morning. The beds were not as comfortable as I've heard everyone rave. We came from a 4 day cruise where the beds and blankets were MUCH more comfortable. The pool and hottub were okay and it seemed to have a decent work out room just off the indoor pool area. There is an on-site restaurant but you have to pay for breakfast. The desk staff in the morning were friendly and helpful enough. Other than the room issues, there was nothing seriously wrong about the Radisson. It got the job done and it was convenient to the airport. It just that it was nothing special and I don't think I would stay here again unless I got a really good deal on it.

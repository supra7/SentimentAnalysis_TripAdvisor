I found the rooms to be nice and overall quit. However, everything cost extra which always bothers me. Parking was over $20, internet was expensive, the exercise room cost extra, ... I don't know why large, expensive hotels frequently charge for everything while medium grade hotels provide services for free. I will not stay here because I really don't like adding all the extra expense to a motel stay so I just end up not exercising, not using the internet, etc. Overall the place was clean and quiet however. I would rate it as average accommodation for it's price range assuming they didn't charge additionally for every service.

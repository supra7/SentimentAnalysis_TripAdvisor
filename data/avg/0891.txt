We drove to Seattle from Edmonton and stayed here. I have never been to Seattle before, so making our way through the maze of one-way streets downtown there is a challenge unto itself. So, it seems, is parking. This hotel charges $36USD PER NIGHT to self-park your vehicle in their lot. Their valet is $39USD. I asked two different staff at the front counter when I checked in if there were any more cost-effective options in the area for parking. I was told (in these exact words) "I'm sure there are, but I don't know of any". Interesting that they both said the same thing....hmmm.... After going for a run the next morning, I happened to come back to the hotel from the west, just off of Lenora, onto Fifth Avenue where the hotel is. I was overjoyed to find that attached to the hotel with a PEDWAY of all things is a parking lot that charges $18 USD for overnight parking for hotel guests. How could the front desk staff "not know" of any other parking in the area when the Impark lot is ATTACHED TO THE HOTEL!?!??! That, in my opinion, is tantamount to deception and it really tarnished the good name and quality I expect from the Westin chain. If they're not being honest about the parking, what ELSE aren't they being honest about? Just food for thought. Everything else was fine. The room was clean and comfortable with a nice view of the space needle. Can't really complain about anything else...just the deception from staff regarding the parking situation really left me with a bad taste.

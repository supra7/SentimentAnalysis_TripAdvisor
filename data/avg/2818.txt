I arrived at the hotel by taxi and as my luggage was unloaded, an employee quickly came out to tell the driver to take me down the hill and then up and around. It is quite a distance to walk, especially if you have luggage. I was given a ticket for a free drink at the pub nearby. Since I was alone, I was hesitant to go get a drink, even if it was for a soda. I don't think a woman traveling by herself should be in a pub drinking alone. This place is a basic motel. The pool was nice to swim in and enjoyed the country feel of the area. I doubt if I will come back to this place. The employees were pleasant, and everything was neat and clean. There are restaurants, a large Walmart, and entertainment walking distance from the motel. It was more basic than I preferred and being so far from the road was odd. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.

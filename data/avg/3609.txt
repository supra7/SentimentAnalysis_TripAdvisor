I had the unusual (for me) experience of checking out of one hotel (the Hilton Anatole) and checking in less than 10 minutes later to another (Marriott Suites Market Center). And oh my, what a difference a 1/2 mile makes between these two competing hotels. The only reason this hotel should carry the Marriott brand rather than the Fairfield brand is that this hotel has the higher end tile bathroom and stone countertops, rather than the more plain / inexpensive tile floor and plastic surround bath, and formica countertops. My room was generally old, tired and smelly, and lacked the fine details and cleanliness that I had just walked out of at the Hilton Anatole down the block. I think my corner room at the Hilton had more floor space than the suite at the Marriott, which was probably the equivilant of one and a half small rooms. The mattress was older and thin, and the sheets were stiff. The Marriott Suites Market Center is definitely at the bottom end of the "Marriott" branded ladder, and I wouldn't consider staying there again absent a full and complete remodeling.

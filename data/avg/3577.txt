We are just back from Orlando, and stayed in WorldQuest Resort for 8 nights. We had difficulty finding it and seemed to be driving around for ages, before venturing past the sign. Our check in was slow. There was only one girl on the desk, dealing with all the checkins, purchases from the shop, answering the phone etc. Our 3 bedroom condo was spacious. We had only 2 bathrooms, as opposed to other reviewers saying they had 3. The master bathroom was huge! There was no separate utility room. The washer and dryer were in a cupboard beside the bedrooms, and were very noisy when you put your washing on after coming back late from the parks! The windows from two of the three bedrooms looked out onto the internal corridors. Other guests walking past can look straight into your bedroom if your curtains are open. We kept them closed all the time for security. I think blinds would have been a better option for the hotel, for privacy. Most of the rooms seemed to be like this. The beds were quite uncomfortable. The sheets seemed too small for the bed, and kept springing off during the night, revealing a very lumpy mattress protector! We selected the clean towels option for an extra $5 per day. I think this is very good value. We stayed for 8 nights but were never left clean bedlinen to change the beds. I wonder how long you would have to stay to get clean linen? We have stayed in Vista Cay several times, but picked World Quest this time due to the location. While World Quests location and proximity to the parks is fantastic, Vista Cay is a far more superior resort. We would have no hesitation selecting Vista Cay over World Quest next time!

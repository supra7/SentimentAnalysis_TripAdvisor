I got a good last minute deal and had a nice clean room - nothing fancy, but better than a Motel 6 or Super 8. Great location downtown, within walking distance to department stores and 10 minutes to Pike Place Market. Very friendly staff. However, both mornings I awoke to the sounds from the ceiling above me, hearing footsteps and TV noises nearby. Seems like the building has a cheap wooden construction with bad sound isolation. Without ear plugs, you cannot sleep late, which is the main reason I went there in the first place...

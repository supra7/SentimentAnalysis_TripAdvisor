Stayed one night only for a romantic getaway. requested roomon higher floor, view if at all possible. got a 6th floor room at the back facing the back of another building overlooking a wall and roof. room a bit small. bathroom very small could only really fit one person in there. TV was old and small and far away from bed and remote was not working properly. a bit too far to walk at night or in bad weather to market. menu at restaurant next door for both dinner and sunday brunch not appealing at all. a bit of a musty smell to the hotel room when you first enter. nice things:: service was good. concierge & bellman very helpful. l'occitane products in bathroom a plus! winetasting at 5pm a welcome treat! room very quiet. overall it was nice but would not go back again. would stay in hotel closer to market or something that perhaps just as nice but not as pricey. did not feel that this was entirely worth what I paid.

Stayed at this hotel for a week for a convention that had been booked years in advance . Truly odd timing for the westin to decide to rip up all the carpets in the lobby and run a jack hammer. Only thing odder was the decision to close the bar for renovations and have no restauarant. You would thing having the opportunity to sell to 7000 lawyers food and drink would be desirable , apparently not at this hotel . Bar staff was slightly handicapped by lack of english , it made receiving your drink such a surprise. Desk staff very helpful , although a fax I sent through them never arrived , on the upside they did not charge. Great view from the 34th floor room and good location.Parking too expensive and hard entarnce to find

The hotel was extremely dusty and it made my eyes itch but that just may come with very old hotels. Some of the service was excellent such as the catering service but the hotel has some of the worst food I have ever had. Unless you buy the $50 and up plates it is not even worth trying. The accounting department completely botched about 25 guests room reservations. We were tax exempt and we are still unable to receive the tax exemption. The front desk could have shown better customer service and the management had an attitude problem.. Other then that, the hotel is in a good location but I would not recommend it unless they happen to get a fantastic deal, it's not worth your money.

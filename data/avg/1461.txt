The pool is very nice and the restaurans are as well. I would recommend going to this resort, but whatever you do, DO NOT JOIN THE "UNLIMITED VACATION CLUB." You will be asked to go to breakfast with a representative when you check in. If you do, they will give you a resort credit for the spa or some other service. If you want the credit, go to breakfast but hold them to the hour or two they say it will take. If not they will take up your whole day. The sales reps do not know the product and will say anything to get you to join. Get out quick, they will still give you the $200. I would suggest you just take the $200 with you to spend and not waste the time with the sales rep. They can be very persistant and it is hard to end the meeting. The vacation club has serious issues. The "club" cna't make the resorts actually follow the contract. Also, you can get better prices on cheapcarribean.com for all of their resorts. Once you add the discount cheapcarribean.com gives you on airfare if you book both with them, it is actually cheaper than the rates you get with your membership after spending thousands and thousands of dollars. I would give this resort at least 4 stars, but becasue of the vacation club and those issues I want to give it 1! I compromised with a 3.

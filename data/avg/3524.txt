Nice location but average rooms I stayed here twice between 2003-2005 and booked it through JTB, a Japanese travel agency. Their website actually has a reservation function but only in Japanese.The price has gone up over the years, though I am not sure if the quality has caught up. It is a typical business hotel with tiny single rooms (remember this is Japan).Also, very few rooms are non-smoking and I had to open the window to get some fresh air.Location-wise, it is within walking distance to Tokyo Station and quite a few restaurants and convenience store nearby, but otherwise the area is devoid of cultural sites or even big shopping malls.

A big hotel with everything and convenient to the Staples and Convention center 100 yards away. Kind of expensive - as you can't get out of here for less than $300/day once you add in taxes. I never did see Kobe strutting through the lobby, but kind of a place to show off. This is not a spot for somebody wanting to save on their expense report! A beer for $10. Coffee was priced normally - I think because of the Starbucks next door! Issues with the hotel were a TV that I had to reboot and would take 15 seconds just to start up at near full volume and another 15 seconds to get off the main page. The pool was closed one day too. If you park across the street, you can cut your parking cost in half $22 versus $40 for the valet only Marriott lot. Also, the Ritz is connected, so you should compare the Ritz which shares the same building. They gotta be close on price. My discounted rate was 229, but with taxes, it was touching 300 per night. Maybe i'm cheap.

Just returned from a week long stay at Hilton San Diego Bayfront Hotel. All in all a good stay. Outside pool facing the bay is nice but no tiki bar like at the Hyatt down the street. You had to go inside to order food at the restrauant. The pool service was closed. Food at the restraunts was good. Fox Sports Bar and Grill was a nice place. Outisde were several seating areas with a gas firepit which we sat by every night. This faced the bay. No coffee service in the hotel you had to go outside the hotel and enter Starbucks and Fox Sports Grill from the outside so we thought that was not convenient. There was also a frozen yogurt store you had to enter from the outside. The room was nice and big but the beds were soft. The bathtub was a regular porcelain tub with a shower curtain. I thought maybe it would be a little more fancy. I thought it was a hotel made for business people who may attend the convention center next door. Not fancy and no extra perks like the Hyatt but I do not know the rates of the Hyatt either.

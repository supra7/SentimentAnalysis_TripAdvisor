We stayed one night at the Hilton in February as were going by train and then using the Metro system. As it was February (cold) we found that the Hilton allowed you to travel to around Montreal without going outside. Staff were friendly and helpful and this may be the most secure hotel on Earth, you can only enter and exit by elevator, no street access. The downside was that our room was next to the heated pool and was very hot all the time.

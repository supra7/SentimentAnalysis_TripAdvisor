I read most of the reviews and I agree with some of them and others not. Yes, the televisions are old and there are no microwaves or fridges in the room. But in my opinion staying in this hotel all depends on where your room is located. I was unfortunately on the side facing Interstate 5 and I was on the 5th floor. The noise was definitely troublesome to say the least. It wasn't bad getting to sleep if you like "white noise" in the background, but if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night it was difficult to go back to sleep. It's amazing that the traffic on the I-5 was constant all night long... I mean at 3:00 am there was a lot of traffic coming and going. Overall, the staff was nice and there were some nice features in the hotel. I walked to a ballgame at Safeco Field and it was about a 20 minute walk. The hotel was within walking distance to most of the attractions. The library is one block away and you can use their internet and computers if you need to check your e-mail. You just tell the library staff you are visiting from out of town and they give you one free hour of internet and computer use. I didn't have car with me so I have nothing to add about the parking. I took the Gray Line bus from the airport and it drops you off right in front of the hotel. This was a business trip for me so I didn't have to pay for the hotel out of my pocket. If I had paid for the hotel I would not have been a little more upset about the noise.

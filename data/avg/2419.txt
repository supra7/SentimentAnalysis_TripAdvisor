As many reviews state, if you have a friend or relative in University of Pennsylvania Hospital and want to be right there for them, this is the place to stay. The hotel connects directly to the Silverstein Pavillion via a skywalk. The rooms are spacious. The rates in my opinion are very fair in today's hotel market. As another reviewer stated, I found the rooms to be clean. However, the bathrooms are pretty beat up and in need of replacement. Being involved in construction, I can state that the hardware used when these rooms were built wasn't all that good to start with and it hasn't withstood the test of time all that well. There are cracks in the vanity sinks. The cracks stain and can't be cleaned. This makes them appear to be dirty. The tubs have been refinished and the new finish is peeling off. My shower faucet only provided extremely hot water that could not be tempered at all. I stood as far back as I could to avoid being burned. In short, Penn Tower management - If you are reading this... You shut shut down these rooms one at a time and replace the bathrooms. Everything else about this hotel is at the very least adequate and can't be beat in regards to location and convenience.

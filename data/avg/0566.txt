One of those enormous hotels, which I'm sure does great convention business. However, as an independent traveller, I was disappointed by the brusque attitude at check-in, and then by the room itself, which looked a bit dated. We were on the Club level, which includes both breakfast and hors d'oeuvres in the Club Lounge - again, disappointing from the perspective of how very busy it was, with guests often waiting for a seat, and the dirty windows (a lot of bird poop) which need to be cleaned more regularly. The food served, however, was good. Back in the room, the walls are quite thin and we had to call down to reception more than once to ask them to get our neighbours to quieten down. Location-wise, you couldn't ask for better, with Nordstrom just 1 block away and Pike Place Market about a 10 minute walk.

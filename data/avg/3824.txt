I've stayed at this hotel three times now for conferences, and it's very nice. The staff is hugely helpful and accommodating. Still, there's something about the place that has you wishing it just didn't try so hard. Of course, the same could be said about the entire LA Live complex, or even LA in general. That said, the service is all to a high standard. But be prepared to pay for Internet (which seems like a real remnant of the past). Ultimately you will have to decide for yourself about the isolation of LA Live from the rest of the world. It's not the easiest place to get to or away from. But there are plenty of fine (if pricey) restaurants and things to do within the complex. Enjoy if you can!

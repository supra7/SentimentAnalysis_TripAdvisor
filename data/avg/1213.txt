We spent one night here before flying out to Alaska. They have a good stay/fly program that we always use to leave our car there while on vacation. The room was clean and bed comfortable. My only complaint is that they charge for the use of wifi in your room. I can walk down to the lobby and get free wifi or use their computers for no charge. So why would I pay to use it in the room??

Tried this place as it looked quite nice on the internet. Attracts mainly a young crowd, but not really a good choice for serious business people. Might use this again if I travel for pleasure, but not for business (eg. no pressing service). Location is a 10-15 minutes walk from China Town, but the direct neighbourhood is not so nice (except for the park right next to it). Also found the Air Conditioning in my room difficult to adjust to create a pleasant climate (either very cold breeze, or off), but this could have been just my room. In light of the decent price (compared to other hotels), I would recommend this for young people seeking a "hip" place, and who do not mind being not really central and close to the business districts.

My company booked me at the Warwick for a recent business trip. This was my first trip to Seattle, so I really had no idea what to expect. What I liked about the hotel: comfortable bed and pillows, really tasty food options for room service, cabs parked outside for easy/quick transportation, accessible by Gray Line from airport, professional staff, view of Space Needle. What I didn't like: no fridge/microwave in room, small bathroom, vending machines available only in basement, $11/day unsecured almost-never-functional WiFi, insufficient sound barrier for street noise (even though I was 16 floors up) and adjoining room, no fan to create white noise at night, location was too far from touristy stuff to walk to it (at least as a woman alone). I ventured out one night to find dinner, and was no more than two blocks away before I was greeted by the city's homeless population... ended that journey pretty quickly. Overall, I thought the hotel was decent, and I wouldn't mind staying here again, but my preference would be to stay someplace a few blocks south where all the tourist stuff seems to be.

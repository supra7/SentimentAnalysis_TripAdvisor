This hotel is well located because it is near the train station, so you won't have to walk long distances if you arrive to rome from the airport and take the train to the city. It is also near underground stations and buses. If you want to take a sightseing tour, it also begins near the train station so, as far as transportation is concerned, you'll be fine. The hotel was recently renwed so everything looks new and clean. They have different types of rooms. If you're going there be sure to ask for a room facing the street (don't worry, the double glazed window muffle the street sounds completely), otherwise you may find yourself (as we did) in a room that faces an inner yard, quite small and stuffy. This room was so small you couldn't open the bathroom door completely before it hit your bed... We asked for another room and the staff was quite nice to change us into a bigger, brighter one. The bed was comfortable, big. There was no bathtub but the shower was enough. Bath towels were small and very, very thin. The room had an LCD Tv, so small you have to wear glasses to watch it... and they only had four channels (an italian one, a japaneseone, CNN and BCC world news!!!!). There aren't many drawers to put your clothes in, but as we went in the summer, clothes don't occupy that much space. So, yes I could say the hotel is fine, clean, well located, comfortable, etc. Unfortunately it had the worst breakfast I've ever tried in my life. They have most of the things you can expect from a 4star rated hotel - like eggs, bacon and sausages - but everything was so badly cooked and bad quality we only had breakfast there on the first 3 days of our one-week stay.

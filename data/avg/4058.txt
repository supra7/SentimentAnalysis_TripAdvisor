Had set high expectations for one of the largest hotles in Boston. Doorman, with the exception of one, were not engaging at all. Walked throughout the lobby multiple times, stayed for three nights, and was only greeted once by a younug man at the front desk. I believe his name was Airel? Champions servers were rude. Food was decent, gotta try the pulled pork nachos. Called to ask if their gift shop was open the lady who answered the phone said "Uhh...I think they are, but I am not sure" of course I went down to discover they were indeed closed. Bottom line, I was disappointed with their service, I understand with such a large hotel it is sometimes difficult to be personable but a better effort should have been made.

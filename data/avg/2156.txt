There is no self-park option which is annoying. One day we dropped the car with average gas mileage of 27+ mpg (after 300 miles road trip) and next day the car was showing 21mpg and was missing some gas in the tank. Did they leave it running for few hours or someone took it for a small test drive? We had a problem with room cleaning crew. If you dont leave you room by 9.00 AM your room wont be cleaned that day. Customer service will leave you a voicemail (around 6PM) saying that they didnt clean the room since you were there and you can call them to bring you clean towels if you need them. It happened to us twice during our stay. Other days we were leaving around 8AM and those days the room was clean after we were back in the evening. One more thing  noise from the freight trains passing through in the middle of the night!!! In my opinion, all of the above completely unacceptable in 5* hotel.

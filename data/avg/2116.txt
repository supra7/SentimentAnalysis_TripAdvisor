Great location - check the map before you set off if arriving independently. Ask for a quiet room - ours was overlooking the street and was fine - more noise from the piped music in foyer and stairwell - you'll be sick of the Jack Johnson/Norah Jones style after 48 hours! Nice staff - the doorman is very sweet. Room clean and comfortable with a safe. Good shower but no space to put toiletries in bathroom. Sauna and Hamman are good but lap pool and jacuzzi are cold and a bit smelly (drains!) Massages from male staff are excellent but fairly intimate so be prepared! Breakfast was very 3 star - looks like a lot of (same every day) dishes but not actually much variety or taste. Shame it was that usual 'orange' squash imitation rather than real juice!

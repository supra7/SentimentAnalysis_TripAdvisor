Likes: The king room we had was nice- good decor, comfortable, clean, big T.V. Good location- we were able to get to The Common fast and thought walking to attractions and back to our hotel was easy. Decent restaurant nearby. Good bar, great bartender. Dislikes: The room was tiny!- I refered to it as our shoebox. Bathroom was really dated- cracked tiles, squeaky faucets, and overall blah. Bottom Line: We'd stay there again because, overall, it was a nice hotel and it was the least expensive when compared to other hotels in the area.

Hotel 81 Rochor the perks : - great location - right in the middle of Little India and Bugis, very convenient - You have a choice which MRT station you can take and it's near the city center too. - near Arab Quarters too - service is quick and efficient (When we first arrived in our room, it was dirty - there were hair scattered all over the floor. I went down to the Front Desk and asked to have our room cleaned. After a few minutes, they sent someone who swept and cleaned our room. So, I give them points for service. Plus, every time we asked our room to be tidied, it was always done well. No repeat incidences of uncleanliness.) - safe negatives: - the room is small but it will do if you are out all day and then just need a room to sleep in it during the night (if i may add, not as small as I expected it to be though) - the room was dirty when we checked in (but it was alright during the next few days of our stay) - only provided 1 bottled water although our booking was good for 2 adults - no cable television - but it does have a dvd player the lowdown: This hotel is great for the budget traveler who wants a more private accommodation than a backpacker inn. It meets the basic necessities but doesn't have anything more special to offer. My experience was a pleasant one. I would stay in this hotel again.

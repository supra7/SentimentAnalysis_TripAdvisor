Not luxury, but will do for a quick stopover. Lounge area tired look, needs renovation. Good location, quick walk uphill, downhill to the Pike's Mkt area. Bed is the best comfort, but carpet, furniture not pristine. Not easy to sleep well, as there are weird structural or machine noises during the middle of night, feel like I'm still on a jet, ugg! Very few bath products, hate when they dont even supply shower gel. Only shampoo, conditioner & lotion. No bathrobe. There was a bowl of fresh apples on hall table 23rd floor, where I was first assigned a room (turned down this room as it smelled musty & of stale smoke). No apples on 12th floor hall table. Take the short flight by elevator & help youself. I will say the elevator wait was always short, so nice not to be kept waiting for an elevator! Concierge gave incorrect directions for a simple destination near the hotel. Had to ask locals for proper directions on the street. Needed to make a left and a right, but was told one block to the right. I detest wasting my precious travel time walking in circles! There is a McDonalds nearly next to hotel if you go down the escalator to the pkg area dropoff, cross the street and to the left.

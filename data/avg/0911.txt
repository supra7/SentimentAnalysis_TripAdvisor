This stay was definitely fine as I would expect from a Westin but not exactly heavenly as I have come to expect from the brand. The common areas were dirty and unkempt. The room was nice and stylish but a lamp did not work. The hotel charges you a high price for absolutely any request such as extra glasses or corkscrews, which I have never experienced even at lower-end hotels. I hope that this is not becoming more common at the Westin brand hotels.

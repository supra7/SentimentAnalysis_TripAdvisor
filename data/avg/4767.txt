We stayed at the Omni on a Saturday. The hotel was crowded because Chicago was hosting the national dental convention. Our check in was quick and the room was clean and nice. All of their rooms are suites, so they were very spacious. When you enter the hotel, you have to go up one elevator to get to the lobby, then take a different elevator to get to your room. They can't really change that, but it was a bit annoying. In the morning, we called the front desk to get a train schedule. They told me to come down and look on-line at the business center. I didn't feel like doing that so the clerk said she would call me back shortly. About 1/2 hour passed and she still hadn't called back (we were afraid we'd miss our train). I went downstairs and there were 4 staff members chatting and ignoring me. When I asked the clerk about the schedule she said, "Oh, Yea" and printed it out for me. Not even an apology for never calling back. We did not pay full price for the hotel (we got it for $125 on priceline). The normal price is $300, but I do not think it's worth it. The staff should be much more attentive and the hotel should be nicer for $300 per night.

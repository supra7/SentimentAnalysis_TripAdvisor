The Westin is showing its age. The rooms are clean but the decor is about 15 years behind the times for wear and style. I booked a suite with adjoining rooms for my party and the reservation was not honored. Initially, they made no effort to relocate one of the rooms to the same floor. I had to be the squeaky wheel and eventually they did discount a portion of the bill for their error. The hotel again is nice but it's time for a facelift. Location is great.

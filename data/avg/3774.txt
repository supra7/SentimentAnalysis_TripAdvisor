We enjoyed our time at Hotel Lawrence. The male manager was very friendly, he enjoyed baking cookies for the customers every night for supper, served with milk of course. This was a complimentary offer as well as breakfast. Breakfast was some cereal, pastries, make your own waffles and toast. Nothing too exciting but I'm a toast girl so I was happy! The pastries weren't too tasty, croissants were terrible and the muffins tasted like cardboard. The room was small, the bathroom small, but we managed! We didn't have a view from the south side of the hotel, but all the north side rooms had a view of Old Red and of the Sixth Floor Museum. Housekeeping is the biggest worry. One day we left our room at 7.30am and didn't return until 8pm and our room still hadn't been serviced. Not that we are that picky, but as we were getting dressed for dinner we were asked to leave the room by the housekeeper who was dressed up to go clubbing so she could finish it. When we asked for half an hour as we needed privacy to get dressed for dinner she wasn't too happy - perhaps we made her late to her party? Location is great, only a few blocks to the tram/train which can take you to different locations in Dallas such as Deep Ellum and the north side, or make a day of it and train it to Fort Worth to watch the muster!

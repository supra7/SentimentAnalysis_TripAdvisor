Took my wife overnight on a Birthday Special the hotel was promoting. We had a Junior Suite which was comfortable but even being on the fifth floor the noise from the street was noticable. King sized bed was comfortable and the dinner served in our room was better than expected. Bathroom was very small and no exhaust fan so got pretty steamy with the shower on. The front desk attendant Wendall was extremely pleasant and helpful. The hostess at the lobby restaurant was less than helpful, borderline rude which took me by surprise and kept the rating from being above average.

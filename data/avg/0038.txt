Although the smoking rooms were a big plus for us, the room and the hotel overall are very dated and in need of renovation. Bathroom was OK but the tub and faucets were really old as was the decor all around. The TV (old style, no flat screens here!) was hidden away in an strange piece of furniture that almost fell apart on us during our stay. Breakfast was good and moderately priced. Concierge was very helpful both times I needed directions and information. Coffee in room was good and very appreciated when we got up at 5am jetlagged!

We stayed here late October, early November because a relative had recommended the place as most Hawaiian and taking Halloween into account there was not much available in Lahaina when we inquired late September. When we phoned to inquire about rates, etc. we were told we would get a "free lunch" because we were referred by a previous guest. Well when we checked in we were told our relative would have to send some sort of referral form to the hotel first. We also booked a garden room and got one on the back side of the hotel looking at grass between us and a condo building. We complained about our room location and questioned the lack of the promised lunch and asked the clerk AND HER MANAGER to see what the could do for us. Not a word, and this was when the hotel was only half full - too bad for them, we won't be coming back. Try the Lahaina Inn for real Hawaiian.

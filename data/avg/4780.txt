Spent two nights at the Palmer House, and although the lobby is beautiful, our room and experience did not match up. King room on 9th floor was tiny, but I suppose that is to be expected at a historic hotel. We had a view of a partition wall between other buildings, and room positioned next to an elevator shaft so we heard elevator noise for much of the time we were there. Tried calling the front desk four times to inquire about changing rooms, but there was no answer so we gave up and didn't feel like slugging all the way down to the busy and crowded front desk. Other reviews indicated there are better rooms, so not sure if we got a poor location due to the fact that we paid the hotwire rate, because the hotel was full, or just bad luck. On the plus side, the bed was super comfortable, room was clean, and the location very good.

Prospective guests would do well to heed the advisory letter in each suite, which in essence reads: "This building is designed to flex in order to withstand earthquakes. As such, the guest may hear noises as the building moves during windstorms. This is appropriate. Do not worry. If the guest is disturbed, ear plugs are available at guest services." LOL!! The building does indeed creak and groan with regularity. And, because of the circular design, no suite is more than 10 feet from the elevators, which whoosh and whirr noisily all night long. All in all, a very spooky place to stay Hallo'ween Eve.

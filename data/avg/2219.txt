We stayed several nights for business. After upgrading our room after the first night, we were offered an upgrade and were misled as far as the cost of the upgrade. We questioned the cost of the upgrade as the TOTAL price and not IN ADDITION to the room rate at which we had already booked. We were assured that the upgrade total cost was $300/night ($350 on weekend). When we got our bill after the business trip, we found out we were charged $300 to $350/night EXTRA to the room rate we had already booked. As the saying goes, "Buyer beware -- and always double and triple check." Everything else with the property is above and beyond.

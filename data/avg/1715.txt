Adjacent to the convention center, this hotel is definitely for the conference go-er or vendor. It's a nice location on the bay and near the Gaslamp district but was extremely crowded due to 3 major conventions. It's a newer hotel, so rooms and amenities were wonderful but was a nightmare during peak times and the Starbucks kept a line of about 30 ppl at any given time.

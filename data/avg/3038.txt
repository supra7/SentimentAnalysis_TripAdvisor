I booked a 4-person room. It was sufficiently big with 1 double bed and 2 extra beds. The restrooms were pretty clean. WiFi is not free. The breakfast was jsut about sufficient. Staff at the reception speak decent English. The location is great. Its at a 5 min walkable distance from the Rome's main train station. They provide airport taxi service for a flat rate.

Stayed at this hotel during a recent visit to San Diego for a convention. As is the case with most Hilton Hotels, the public areas were beautiful. Staff were helpful in all areas. However, when you're paying $249/night plus taxes, one should not have to pay $4.25 for a bottle of water left in the room nor should one have to pay between $6.95 (one hour) and $19.95 (24 hours with high-speed) for in-room internet service. Stayed at a LaQuinta Inn and Suites last Christmas for $79/night plus taxes and got a nice room, complimentary water and internet service included in the cost of the room and a great continental breakfast every morning. So, if you want a nice view and need to be close to the convention center, stay here. If those things aren't important and/or necessary,there are other hotels in the city that provide more services for the price you pay.

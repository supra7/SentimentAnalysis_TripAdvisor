Not sure this is really 4 star quality. Room was quite small (but probably ok given centre of Rome), but decor of dark wood panelling made the room seem very dark. Lots of small things were annoying: lights not fixed properly to wall, one plug socket hanging off, shower leaked onto floor, all power was shut off at 10am on the last day (had to waste time getting them to turn it back on). However, location is great, albeit noisy and in quite a tacky touristy area. Bed was big and comfy. Staff reasonably friendly and efficient although it took them 20 minutes to retrieve our bags when we stored them for a few hours on our final day. Breakfast was standard fare, but had to wait for a table one day as the room is small. Overall, we had a nice stay and its reasonable value for very central location but in my opinion not as great as other reviewers have indicated. On a more general note for UK visitors, the poor exchange rate means this will be a very expensive weekend break or holiday!!

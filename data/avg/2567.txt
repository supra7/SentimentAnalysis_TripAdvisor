Excellent location for St Pancras station and a short walk to Russell Square. Rooms are adequate but the hotel is indeed next to a very busy and noisy road (the double glazing doesn't help much with this either). The rooms are adequate, but fairly basic. It's OK for a one night stay and good value if you book in advance but I'd certainly not recommend spending a holiday in London at this hotel!

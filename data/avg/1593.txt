We stayed here for three nights on the last stretch of our holiday after having stayed at other 5-star hotels in Spain and this hotel isn't really the 5-star hotel standard. There was a mix-up with our rooms and we got a smoking room for our first night which ended up giving us severe hayfever and colds - and ruining our stay. Luckily we were able to switch rooms eventually, although a bit late. The breakfast spread at the hotel was good but not great. I would recommend this hotel if you were aiming for great central location and 4-stars or less hotel. Also be aware that the bathrooms arent another room but rather flowing from the bedroom - so make alternate plans if you are sharing with a stranger whose bathroom (toilet and shower/bath) habits you don't want to share.

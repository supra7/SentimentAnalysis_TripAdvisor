Once we decided to go to Maui, there weren't many hotels that had availability on the dates we were going (2-5th of April), and we had to select the Hyatt, and unfortunately ended up paying a ridiculous rate per night. For what we paid for, we did get a room with a view and breakfast, but because of the timing, every day we had to wait at least 30 mins in the breakfast queue! The pool was impossible to get to, all the chairs around were gone and we had to use chairs in an area that was well out of the way - but at least it was quite! It was a fairly relaxing few days - in spite of all the families with the little kids, but we've paid less for a much better experience. Some things we were really disappointed by included lack of free WiFi (for nearly $500 a night, I would have though that should be included!) No complimentary water - in a fairly hot climate, this was ridiculous, we had to buy water from local shops... We used the spa, and though the treatments were really good, the spa itself was pretty basic, and not very relaxing - esp. compared to some of the other "cheaper" spas that we've been to! We only tried the one restaurant - Umalu for lunch, it has a basic selection of stuff, but not worth the price, I guess you pay for the convenience! The breakfast spread is pretty good though, still, not worth $30 a head, we considered ourselves lucky for having booked the breakfast with the room, $60 a day for breakfast is very expensive, even for Hawaii! Overall, unless you can get a good deal and you REALLY want the resort experience, and there's nothing else available, this is okay. Three tips, bring your own water, don't have food there and drive!

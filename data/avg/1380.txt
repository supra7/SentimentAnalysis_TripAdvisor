After flying all night, it was nice to be so close to the airport. The shuttle picked us up in less than 10 minutes. If would have been daylight, we would have walked. Friendly front desk staff. She advised that we would be getting a suite! After paying only $65 on Hotwire ~ I was excited! The hotel itself is clean, just looks a bit tired. Our room was clean as well, just a bit worn. One light bulb was out next to the bed and the batteries in the TV remote were dead. The two room suite was nice, as you had a place to go when you wake up, make in-room coffee and watch TV. The bed was fine, not over the moon, but fine. We had a room that faced the airport, but I was not bothered too much by the planes taking off. We used the gym & pool, both which were great. We walked next door to 13 Coins for breakfast and it was excellent. Pricey, but delicious! Portions are huge - we split a dish. Overall, heck, for $65 what can I expect? I would recommend this hotel, just don't pay full price.

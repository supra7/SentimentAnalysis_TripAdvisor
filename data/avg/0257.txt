We needed a downtown Seattle hotel to sleep my two adult sons and myself so we could attend a baseball game that evening. The Moore came through with a room with a queen sized bed and a twin in one room and another queen sized bed in a second bedroom, all for a great price. The Moore is an older property but well maintained. The front desk was helpful in making dining and parking suggestions.

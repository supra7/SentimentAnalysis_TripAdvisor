We chose this "hotel" because of all the glowing reviews on this site. So many reviewers commented that it is very clean, but we beg to differ. The shower had mold growing on the white caulking. The bathroom had an old, grimy feel. However, the sink, faucet, and countertop (located outside the bathroom) were quite clean and newer. The carpeting was worn and in need of replacement. With that said, this place is a good value for the area. It's conveniently located close to the Disney theme parks and to all the restaurants and fast-food joints on Rt. 192. Our room was small; it had two beds with very little room to walk around them. It was nice to have a mini fridge. Breakfast was included, but it was mostly pre-packaged carbs (pancakes, waffles, bagels, and muffins), along with cereals, packaged oatmeal, and cold hard-boiled egg. Not an inspired breakfast, but I did like the OJ. The small breakfast room was packed, with not a single open table for us (this was New Year's weekend). We ended up eating in our room. The reason I put "hotel" in quotes is that this place has the feeling of a motel with interior hallways rather than a standard hotel. This is an average-quality hotel with a below-average breakfast and a decent price. Next time, we will be staying elsewhere.

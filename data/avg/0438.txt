We went to Seattle for the weekend. Our stay started out wrong at the front desk, when the executive room with king I reserved was not available. Apparently a geology conference was being held the next week. I could have two doubles executive or king regular, or a king in an odd corner room on the executive floor. We went up and looked at the oddball room which was smaller than the usual but was otherwise pretty good, nice view. We took it, and got a $25 discount and breakfast coupons too. The inconvenience was about made up for. In the room we noticed things like there was no fan in the bathroom, and not much heat either. There were a couple of ordinary water bottles with $5 price tags on them. It was near impossible to find channels you didn't have to pay for. Breakfast buffet would have cost $21 apiece. Parking $29 per night. And the final insult, wireless Internet for $10.95. We were feeling nickeled and dimed at every turn. This surprised me because the room was not cheap in the first place. Staying there left me feeling a little ripped off, to be frank.

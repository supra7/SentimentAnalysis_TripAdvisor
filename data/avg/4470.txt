A good but just standard Hilton hotel, but with a great location in the middle of the shopping area with connection to two malls and also close to the Metro. No executive lounge, but a small separate Honors breakfast lounge. Did not try the restaurants, nor the fitnesscenter with pool. Location 8/10: Right in the middle of the city with easy access to everything. Its located between two metro stations, which is more modern then to match the rest of the city. Walking distance to shopping, restaurants, museeums, etc.. Lobby/Check-in 6/10: Nothing special, but not bad neither. The greated me as an Honors member and had upgraded me according to my request, which was excellent. Two free internet computers by the lobby, which was good (Business center costed approx $12). Room 6/10: Big size room with a huge and comfortable king size beed. The view from the 29th floor facing Charles river and the Cambridge side was beautiful. There was a lounge chair to sit comfortable and relaxed in and just look at the huge, I think it was at least 40 LCD TV, which also had many HD-channels, so watching a football game in HD was amazing. It was a very cold stay for us, but the heather worked perfect A small closet with safety deposit box and a drawer. The negative were that the minibar had been taken out from all rooms. There is a coffe/espresso maker, which was very good, also with a take-out mug, which is a small plus. The bathroom was ok, with a tub. Restaurants 4/10: Did not try the restaurants, except the Honors breakfast lounge. A bigsize LCD tv, but no newspapers. The food was ok, typical American breakfast I would say; bagels, creamcheese, salmon, donoughts, muffins, etc.. Other: There is a fitness center and pool, but we did not try these. There is a garage that has direct access to the hotel, so we could park the rental quite easily.

I stayed here on business as it was close to the office. It is a really stylish, modern hotel with helpful staff and good food (excellent value for money for the room service meal that I had). It is a way out of town and there are not many shops nearby. Free wifi in the rooms which was good. No other facilities like a gym or swimming pool.

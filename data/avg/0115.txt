We last stayed at Inn at the Market, Seattle's boutique darling overlooking the Sound west of First Avenue, in 2001. At the time it seemed charming, luxurious, well-managed, and well-positioned to walk the downtown area. When we returned in June, 2006, we found the property in exactly the same state, down to the carpets and the paint job, only five years older. Like the dowager in Dickens' Great Expectations, this old dame hadn't moved in five years (OK, Mrs. Havesham didn't move in 20), and no amount of air spray could cover up the decay. The area around the hotel has likewise declined, such that a stroll towards Pioneer Square had all the patina of a Fellini film, replete with panhandlers, stoners, bikers, and guys with pants well below their plumber's line for ease of repulsive viewing. Restaurants in Pioneer Square appeared dirty and the famed Skid Row area has returned as a flexible homeless folks' hangout. Too bad a city as wealthy as Seattle can't cope with the needs of its least able. While I see a potential synergy between quarters for the homeless and the rooms at the Inn, I suspect the $500/night rates might prove a bit daunting. I continue to give stars for friendly, professional service, regardless of a property's physical condition, and the employees at the Inn are thoroughly helpful. But they can't take the cigar smokers off their own balcony, nor the drunk, nocturnally screaming frat boys from the adjacent streets. I hear the Four Seasons is opening a new hotel in the Fall....

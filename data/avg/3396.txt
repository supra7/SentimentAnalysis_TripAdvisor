We stayed in this hotel on 2 occaisions as part of a 3 week long trip. The first night we stayed we were put into a room that was really a single with a double bed in it. My partner is a big guy and we had loads of luggage so we asked to be moved and the staff were great giving us a free upgrade on the second night to a much a nicer room. When we returned for the second part of our stay we were given a disabled standard room which was much larger and quite adequate. Overall message is that the room you get will make a lot of difference to the quality of your stay. The pictures on expedia show a superior room which you have to pay extra for. Despite this the staff were lovely and the location was great.

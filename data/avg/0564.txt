The lobby is nice, the location is excellent and the staff are friendly (especially the valet guys), but it's clear that these hotel rooms have seen better days. Everything seemed slightly run-down - the paint was chipped, bathroom counter had small cracks, there were scuff marks on the walls where suitcases have dinged the walls, etc. It isn't a bad hotel - it just needs some re-painting etc. in the rooms. The hotel restaurant was alright for breakfast if you're in a hurry and don't have the time to find restaurants in the neighbourhood.

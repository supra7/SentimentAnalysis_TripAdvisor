We stayed here because it was less expensive that some of the other Sea-Tac options. Our room was clean except for a slight old-hotel smell. The tub and shower curtain were relatively new, but I caught a couple whiffs of mildew in the bathroom. This is an old and outdated hotel, and it shows, but we wanted to save 20 bucks, and I think it was worth it. Parking was free, which was a nice bonus. I would stay here again if I was just passing through.

Stayed here Aug 14-18 2010 for a convention. Spartan is the word I would use to describe the interior. Room was o.k., nice view, but others had a view of a Dole tanker unloading for 4 days. Pool area was boring, but fine for reading a book. Close to Gaslamp district, ate at some good restaurants there. Nice walk along the Embarcadero to Seaport Village (about 10 minute walk along the ocean front.) There are no beaches close by, so you have to take a trolley or whatever to Coronado. O.k. hotel for business, not pleasure travel.

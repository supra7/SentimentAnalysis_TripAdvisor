I booked this hotel then read some not so great reviews online and was worried. In the end it worked out as a great location, the room was tiny, but clean. The bathroom less clean and old so even when clean would still look a bit used. They are sort of pet friendly-30lbs or less and your pets can never be left alone in the room? Noise was not a problem but check in was slow we were told we would have a room in about 30 minutes, it was well over an hour.

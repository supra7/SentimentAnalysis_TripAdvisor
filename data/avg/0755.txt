Stayed for one night. Tried to check in early (12:30pm )and asked for a quiet room. There were no rooms available on the water side so I wasn't offered the upgrade. I was told that they'd have to call me when the room was ready. Since I hadn't heard from anyone by 4:30pm went back and found out that room was ready and they seemed surprised that no one had called. The staff were all pleasant but the front desk staff on the three occasions I went by were quite scattered. The room was really hot when we entered. The fireplace was going and probably my major complaint was that it was really difficult to maintain a proper temperature. The fan kept going off and on all night which disturbed my wife. Probably shouldn't have used the auto setting. If you're on the train side take a room on the lower floor and as far down the hall as possible. We couldn't hear the trains. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was quite nice. The gym had good aerobic equipment and average weight equipment. Worth the $80 I paid on Priceline but would have been really unhappy had I paid their regular rates.

Like most downtown hotels, one would expect to pay more than you should. In this case we tacked on a few more for the view. What we got was a view of a large office building next door. If I stood at the window, I could look at an angle and see the space needle. needless to say, not too impressed with the view. Service staff was friendly. I didn't like the fact that when I checked in, my luggage and golf clubs sat curbside unattended when they parked the car. luggage valet was not around and car valet said they will be ok (we have cameras. I don't think so. I guess they don't realize the value of a good set of golf clubs. Overall, not bad, but had better views in cheaper rooms

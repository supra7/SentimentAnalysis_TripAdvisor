The good: No casino in the hotel, valet was friendly, bartenders were kind, rooms were big, huge bubbly bath tub for two. The bad: No hot water, and when we notified the hotel staff-the engineer called us back at 4:30 am (WTF?). Also, I booked through Priceline and spent more on the studio than if I booked with the hotel. We found no room service menu. My advice is to a) stay somewhere else and b) book either when you arrive in vegas or by phone.

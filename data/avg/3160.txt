I stayed at this hotel because the meeting I was attending was being held there. I was surprised that the hotel is really in the middle of no where. You have to walk (though building works) at least 10-15 minutes to get to a restaurant and believe me you want to as the rooms are so depressing making room service not a good option. I stayed in my room one night and I wish I hadn't. The gym has a good range of equipment. I think the main profile of guests is business men and the odd tourist. It was rather depressing, plus for a hotel that is in such a bad location and with old decor, it isn't very good value for money. I am sure there are much better options in Amsterdam.

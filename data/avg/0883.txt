A couple of weeks ago, I finally managed to redeem a gift certificate for the Westin Seattle that I had purchased through a charity auction two years ago.We decided to take our 14 year old son along for a week in the city, so I added an additional day to make the weekend in downtown Seattle a memorable experience for my wife and son. It was memorable alright I took the advice of a fellow Trip Advisor member to forego the hotel parkade & save  of the parking costs by utilizing the Westin Building parkade which is linked to the hotel by a walkway. As we unloaded the luggage from the car, my son & I went looking for a luggage cart in which to transport our bags to the hotel room. We found one at the end of the walkway on the 2nd floor of the hotel near the meeting rooms. We took the cart back to where our car was parked, where we loaded up our luggage & proceeded to the front desk to register. While I was checking into the hotel, my wife was approached by a bell attendant who told her that she could not use this cart. When she responded that it was left in the upstairs lobby near the walkway, the attendant then told her in front of other hotel guests the cart was his responsibility and that she should not have taken it and that he could get in trouble with his boss . My wife responded that maybe the hotel should have put a sign on it telling patrons to not use the luggage carts. The attendant then insisted that he bring our luggage up to the room. Unaware of the encounter that transpired, I proceeded to the hotel room along with my family, the bell attendant and our luggage. After he left, my wife then told me the story of what had happened. It reminded me of a scene from the English comedy Faulty Towers. Since we were on a bit of a schedule, I chose to wait until I returned home to comment on this experience rather than make a formal complaint. I felt sorry for the fellow, as he appeared "stressed out" during my brief encounter with him.

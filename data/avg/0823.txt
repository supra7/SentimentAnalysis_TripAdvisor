This hotel is about 3 walkable blocks to the mall (monorail). But it was to far for us to walk to Pike Market. The hotel was nice & most of the staff were helpful. We had 2 double beds for 4 (no queen beds). One wall was all windows & our room looked into the apartments across the street! Make sure to close your drapes. The room was small we stayed here for 3 nights before a HAL Cruise. The thing I really disliked were the homeless sleeping & begging on the sidewalk out side the front door. Going back to Seattle in Aug & booked a different hotel for the same price.

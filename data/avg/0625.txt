Although the hotel looks like a mid-rise sixties hotel from the outside, our room was clean, large and bright with comfortable mattresses and a renovated bathroom. It was a terrific value given it's location a few blocks from Pike Place Market. Although, there's just a small lobby and desk, the attached restaurant was comfortable with a well-balanced menu, attentive waitresses and comfortable, clubby interior. Although, we used it for only a one-night stay before a cruise, it would certainly be fine for staying a few days and sightseeing because of its great location. Major chain hotels nearby were much pricier with amenities we did not require for this trip.

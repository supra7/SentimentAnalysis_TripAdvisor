This hotel is great if you are on a business trip and attending one of the exhibitions held at Tuyap Expo Center nearby which is 5-10 minutes drive from the hotel. There's a nice sea view and it seems like the hotel is situated in a small town near Istanbul. I didn't get to try to the spa although I was told it was the biggest in Istanbul. However if you are using this hotel as a base to explore Istanbul then forget it, it's far and will take you too much time to get there. This is a strictly business type hotel in my opinion. Hotel offers good breakfast, rooms are good, staff are helpful, all in all a good experience but nothing special.

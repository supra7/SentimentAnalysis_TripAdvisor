I had a Deluxe Room, very small but quite good as was the bathroom. Internet was free and fast, television reception was troubled with on/off reception and with only a few channels anyway, mini-bar expensive (an 80 cent can of coke for $3), service was good and the hotel is bright and colorful. Can be noisy at night when people return to their rooms. It is good 15 minute walk (uphill) from Outram MRT Station although there is a free Shuttle Bus which runs regularly during the day. Breakfast was included with my room and was pretty good and the restaurant downstairs seemed to be busy all day so perhaps the food is good all day long. Happy Hours Bar is great as far as location but once again expensive even in Happy Hours - no wonder it was always empty.

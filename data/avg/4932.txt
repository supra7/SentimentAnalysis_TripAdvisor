We stayed two nights after getting a decent rate from Priceline. Good points: The lobby is spectacular; the (replacement) room was nicely appointed; the bed was singularly fantastic. Not-so-good points: No obvious place to stop at the main entrance; outrageous parking charges (self-park $36/day; valet $51/day); lousy hotel access from self-park; overcharging our account (which was corrected); unknowledgeable valet and door people. Our first room had a strong musty smell with a deodorizer/chemical finish, so we called guest services immediately for a room change, which took an inordinately long time. Returning from self-park after 10:00 p.m., the valet entrance was locked and we had to walk around the corner to the main entry in the rain. We avoided the concierge, as there was only one person and never less than three people waiting for his time. We wouldn't stay again, as too many little oversights affected us negatively. Insufficient consideration for the purported quality of hotel.

We stayed at the main section of the hotel with connecting & corner ocean front view rooms. Overall comfortable and clean rooms with good views (partially blocked by the tall coconut trees). One BIG disappointment -- surprisingly small & tight bathrooms. The open atrium definitely felt tropical. Most of the staff members were efficient and friendly. Breakfast buffets(included in our package, otherwise the cost was $30/person). There were many yummy choices (Hawaiian papaya, salmon egg benedict, all kinds of scrumptious cakes) to choose from. For most of the mornings, expect a long wait for a table after 7.30AMish. Relatively small pools for the size of the hotel. Poolside chairs are hard to come by after 11AM. Forget about chilling out at the narrow beach head...better off swim/sunbath/snorkel at the Black Rock. Around the sunset time, we saw a local fishing at a "special spot"...apparently there is a nice channel 100-200 yards out with plenty of prized fish swimming thru the channel. Free/self parking is limited! Valet parking $18/day -- Lowell is the most helpful valet guy. Be aware, between 5- 6.30pm is a zoo time at the hotel -- many people arriving for the checking ins and for the Luau show and hotel guests trying to go out for dinner. Free shuttle to Whalers Village/Sheraton-Black Rock is convenient. Nothing bad about this solid hotel. However, next time we visit Maui, more than likely we will look to stay at another hotel, given the similar price,quality of service and reputation.

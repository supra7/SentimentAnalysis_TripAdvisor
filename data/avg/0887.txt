Starting with the good things. I was pleased to be on the a top floor on the north tower. This is a great view of the water - can't be beat. Great downtown location !!!Also as always, the Westin has the best beds !!!. What this hotel does not have it great bathrooms - theirs are interchangeable with a blah Marriott - your basic bath/shower combo - nothing special. Also, the elevator noise is bad news. Avoid the hotel food.

I stayed here because I was able to buy 3 days for less than 130 per night from Jetsetter. I liked the Belltown area. This redone hotel is sleek and roomy but I thought the bed was too small. Seemed small for a queen. I guess you get what you pay for. Even with the great deal I would likely pass on my next visit unless the bed is king sized. Also there should at least be free internet in the lobby

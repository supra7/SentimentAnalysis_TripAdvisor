If i had been on a business trip, this place would have been unacceptable because i need a more luxurious stay. However, i was visiting family and once i adjusted to the sparcity of the room, it was totally fine. Plus side: Very roomy, good kitchen which saves money on meals, practically free internet, attentive staff. Down side: Thin walls, thin bed (though relatively comfortable nd they'll give you extra pillows), plain decor, housekeeping only every third day. Oh and the entryway doors are RIDICULOUS; they are completely manual and since you have to move your own luggage, as a single travelor i actually threw out my back moving in and out. Conclusion: When you choose a hotel for price, you get what you pay for, but this was a fair tradeoff.

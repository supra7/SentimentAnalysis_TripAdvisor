located by the Opera in Rome. Very difficult to find as the signing in not good. He had to ask a man working in the internet cafe down the street. Rooms had recently been redone and they are very nice but small. ONly 14 rooms in the hotel. Front desk staff is very nice and the breakfast was good. The only real complaint is the we would have rather stayed in the older section of Room

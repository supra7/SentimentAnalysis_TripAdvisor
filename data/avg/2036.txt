The hotel was all in all not too bad. Disliked the size of the shower [it was very tiny] and the staff weren't very helpful. There was also no phone in your room and they didn't have one in the lobby that you could use. We couldn't seem to figure out how to turn our tv on at first, then when we finally did get it, there were only 2 channels. There were 4 people staying in our room and we had two regular beds and two others that were obviously cots. There wasn't much room for us to keep our suitcases considering the large number of beds in such a small room. Being from Canada, in March it was a lot warmer in Rome than what we were used to back home, and our room didn't have a window so it was very warm at night. We tried to turn on the air conditioning, but it didn't work due to it still being winter. Breakfast was a little different, and was mainly comprised of pastries out of bags, pretty bad coffee and rather gross juice. It was a bit weird that the hotel didn't really have hallways, and the hallways it did have were outside. This made it difficult to descend the stairs when it was raining because they became very slick. Though it's not in the greatest area of the city, it felt very safe because the hotel had a gate that was kept closed during the night. The room was always clean and well kept.

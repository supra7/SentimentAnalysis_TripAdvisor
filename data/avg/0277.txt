I stayed here for 2 nights in a single room with shared bath. The room had a sink with mirror, small TV, small fan and large closet. The building is old and the rooms have seen better days, especially the carpets. The bed sheets were scratchy - no Egyptian cotton here! Shared baths were clean. Bottles of cold water could be purchased anytime for $1 at the reception. Staff were friendly and helpful. The sliding lock on my door was broken, but I could lock the doorknob with my key. My room overlooked the street at the front of the building and the traffic noise was bothersome, especially the night of the Torchlight Parade for Seafair. The fan helped that a little. The second night, there were people talking loudly and walking around all night and their voices echoed in the halls. It sounds a little miserable, but it's no different than a youth hostel. The location can't be beat, so if you need a cheap place to crash downtown, this place is good enough.

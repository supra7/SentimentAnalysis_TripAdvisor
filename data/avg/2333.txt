Anniversary wasn't acknowledged as requested. Buffet restaurant was just ok - nothing to make you say wow, as a matter of fact doesn't seem they try to do anything special to give it a wow factor. Very disappoint in the facilities. Just that I expected so much better since it was suppose to be a 5*. However the price was ok, since it was based on a "timeshare presentation". I am a beach person and this was not a nice beach. Steak/Lobster dinner we were looking forward to was cancelled for rain. Free massage was not free. Italian restaurant was ok. The best thing about this place is the employees that work there.

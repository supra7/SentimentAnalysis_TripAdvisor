Stayed at this Hotel July 2011 for about a week. The location is great, located downtown Seattle. Walking distance to the mall, buses, trendy bars, Pike Place Market, and shopping!Biggest appeal overall, best location ever. The rooms are sooo tiny. I'm used to this size room in Europe but not Stateside. Hallways and lifts are snug but clean, and the decoration was nice. Bathrooms are a big disappointment, too tiny, you can literally sit on the toilet, and wash your hands at the same time. They also could have been alittle cleaner, bleach goes along way people! Even though the hotel was positioned on a busy street you couldn't hear the traffic below. I would recommend this hotel is you plan on site seeing alot, and want to use the room for sleeping and storing your belonging. If you are looking for luxury stay at the Weston down the street. Good over all budget hotel, we paid around $129 a night. If this is a family stay I don't recommend this hotel. For students, couples, friends or business it's worth it

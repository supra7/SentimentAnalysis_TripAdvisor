Arrived on 7 April, staff were lovely and gave my elderly parents and I 2 rooms on 1st floor. Got to the rooms and was overcome by paint fumes with no adequate ventilation. The painters were regularly in the lift and told us they werejust doing the halls. We complained and were moved immediately to separate floors! The next night my mum had 2 cockroaches on her side of the bed and pillow!! Not what you expect from a 4 star hotel!! My room was ok and no bugs! Again mentioned it to staff who made a note of it and gave us free luggage storage for our trouble. Once we left the great southern we moved to a 3 star travelodge out of the city which was amazing and would be easily 4-5 star in comparison!! This hotel is in a great location and you can get a cheap full English breakfast across the road at the YHA for $8.40 they also do great meals better than thie great southern hotel for 1/2 the price. This hotel is great for 2 things: price and location ( only across road from free shuttle bus). Don't expect a 4 star experience because you will be disappointed! You do get what you pay for and so if you want cheap accommodation in a central location and don't mind too much aboutthe look of the place and cockroaches then this hotel is for you. However I seriously think this hotel should re-rated to a 3 stat at best!!!

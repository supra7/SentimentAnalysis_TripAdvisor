We stayed at this hotel for one night before a Cruise. The hotel's location and price, including how close it is to the attractions downtown and to the Seattle light rail were all big positives when we were considering which hotel to pick. We were assigned a room facing the "club" that is next door, and that club was very loud throughout the night. The noise stopped at about 4am Saturday morning. I'm not sure if that "club" is that loud every Friday night, or if our night (June 24) was an exception. The hotel itself was great; there is no free breakfast, but there is a McD's very close by that of course serves a decent hot breakfast for a decent price. The room had an in-room safe, and the staff was helpful in getting us into our room a little earlier than the official checkin time. They also gave us a late checkout, which we appreciated. Overall, we had no complaints regarding the hotel or its operations itself; the complaints we have were about the loudness of the club that is next door. I'm sure people staying at the other nearby hotels likely also had our complaint that night. There also are two internet enabled computers for free usage in the lobby. I would consider staying at this hotel again, but not on a Friday or (I'm guessing) Saturday night. I'd also stay away from other hotels in this area for the same reasons on Friday and (likely)Saturday nights.

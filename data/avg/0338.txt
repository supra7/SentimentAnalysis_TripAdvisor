After a Mariners' game, all we wanted was a good bed, hot water, good air conditioning, and good coffee for the first morning cup. We had all that, but in a simple room with a scarred and gouged ceiling, a bathroom door lock without screws (it fell on the floor) an elevator in need of paint and care, and a limit of one card-=type room key per room, which did not work the first time. Think very plain and basic, with hands-off service. Don't go if you plan to spend time in your room.

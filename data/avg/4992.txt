I spent three nights here in early July. The renovations had not started yet so there was no noise. I have to agree that the room was quite small and yes it was dim. It was not bad by any means but I had just arrived from a very nice hotel in Cleveland. I guess I just don't like my one night stopover to be so much nicer than my main event. It's a very historic building, which I like, but very much in need of the renovations that are being done now. The location is excellent, walking distance to Navy Pier, Shedd Aquarium , Sears Tower and the Magnificent Mile. Millineum Park and the Taste of Chicago were right down the street. I would definitely stay here again, but not until after the renovations.

Grand lobby and great customer service at front desk. Hotel is in an excellent location. Only complaints: internet service in rooms is not wireless and there is a fee - even budget hotels are offering free internet service these days; and had to wait a long time for service in the hotel bar, both to get my drink and then my bill. Otherwise, not a bad hotel and has seen some improvements since Starwood bought an interest in the hotel. I would stay at this hotel again, but be sure to use a discount booking service.

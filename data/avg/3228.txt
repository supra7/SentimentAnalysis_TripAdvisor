I was a bit unsatisfied with my stay at the South Loop Hotel in Chicago. I went there knowing it was a bit far from The Magnificent Mile and pretty close to the convention center which was great. My first complaint, very uncomfortable beds. I have been spoiled in other hotels I guess but these were pretty hard. The room was pretty clean and like other reviews mentioned the bath tub was very big and clean. The location was a not what I expected as in not in a real good area. I knew we were close to China Town but I was not going to venture out to find it. My husband and I took a cab to the convention center, and when we took a cab home the driver for 20 years in that area had no idea what Hotel we were talking about. We gave him the cross streets and he said "oh that's right. I heard they built a hotel where the projects used to be" Now lets talk about the food. They had a restaurant, a bar with food and a small cafe for breakfast. The dinner in the hotel was very overpriced with really bad service and the food was not great. the next night we decided to try the bar, what we did not know was the food came form the restaurant we ate dinner at the night before. the food was still bad. The bar tender was great though, thumbs up. The price we paid for the Hotel was good, but I would not have expected to pay much more based on the location. I am not sure I would stay there again.

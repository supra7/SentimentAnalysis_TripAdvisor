This is very nice hotel with a fine location on the busy beach strip, if that's your thing. Overall good service and friendly staff; nice shops inside, including a Macy's devoted to swimsuits! The only reason why I'm giving it three stars is that it doesn't come close to matching the design and ambiance of the Kauai Hyatt, where I stayed in 2008. So i was a bit disappointed there. It has a somewhat "dated" feel to it and lacks the landscaping and multiple swimming areas of the one on Kauai. The other odd touch was having showcase areas for species that have nothing to do with Hawaii--penguins and flamingos. The other tip: get to the pool early. Seating appeared to be quite competitive with advance staking out of seats.

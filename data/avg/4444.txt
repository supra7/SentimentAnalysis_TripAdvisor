When we saw the location it seemed very central, but this is a little misleading. It is down a back street off the more glamorous Boylston. The rooms are really rather small, and the decor very dated. My bill was incorrectly calculated, although the staff were pleasant and corrected it without fuss. The gym and swimming pool were the highlight of the stay. Also it is noisy - you can hear the person in the next bathroom very clearly for example.

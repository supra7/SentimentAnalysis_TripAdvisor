I want to start by saying Daymeyn in concierge was awesome!! He was the only shining star in our stay. Other than Daymeyn don't expect any decent customer service. We had lost luggage, and informed every staff member we could find, and insisted it be added onto our notes. When it still had not turned up the next day, we asked that they call us when it did, and get a receipt for insurance. The staff were certainly unable to do this, and didn't even know the luggage had arrived when we enquired upon our return at the end of the day. With all the insurance calls required, and follow up to airlines and delivery services, I was disgusted to discover this hotel has removed all their public phones. All the Manager Polita had to say is that we had phones in the rooms - at a cost of $2.00 for a free call!! Disgraceful. Not everyone has cells that work in the US, and are willing to pay such ridiculous prices for free calls. PS people the Radisson 2 blocks away is the closest payphone, which staff were unable to tell me. Apart from our luggage experience I can say: If you need nothing from the staff, or don't need a public phone, the rooms are adequate, the beds are so comfortable, the location is fantastic, and may be worth the money. On the bright side, as the hotel is so old (Historical landmark) it has its own generator, so we were unaffected during the Boston blackout. If I had not had a negaticve experience with the staff then I may have enjoyed this hotel more.

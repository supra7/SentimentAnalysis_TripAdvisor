Good points: * Large rooms * Good breakfast, although expensive for range available (12.50 Euro) * Rooms clean * Location is good enough, road is busy but you cannot hear it and it is between two U-Bahn lines and near-ish to an S-Bahn line. * Comfortable beds but we had two singles/queens instead of a King. * Nice bathroom but only shower gel, no shampoo/conditioner/body lotion. Bad points: * Room in poor condition, marks all over the white walls and a very poor job painting over previous marks with the wrong type of paint. It looked sloppy and really lowered my view of the quality of the room for me. * Cheap fittings, all looked very IKEA. * Only a few choices of channels if you are non-german speaking, or not fluent. * No mini bar, no safe, nothing other than a phone and a TV. * No room service, you have to order drinks at the reception and carry them upstairs yourself, no food available other than breakfast. * Some dodgy service at breakfast, waitress seemed cheery at times, at other times was visibly annoyed at being asked to do things by patrons. Literally huffing and walking off making a scene. I found it pretty uncomfortable. * Staff were OK but often only seemed to be one person available and some of the staff felt a little inexperienced or uncomfortable being asked to do things. * Rooms very hot when air con not on (automatically switches off when you leave the room, so everytime you come back it was hot) This place is nice enough, and if you are only interested in a comfy bed and a large room then it's fine, but as there wasn't even a safe if you are carrying high value items that you are not willing to leave in the room then I'd consider somewhere else. If you are used to above average quality of rooms and amenities you will be disappointed I think.

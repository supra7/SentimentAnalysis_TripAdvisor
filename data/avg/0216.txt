The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. We had a great room on the 7th floor with plenty of room. Breakfast delivered to the room was very good. We stayed during construction but on a Friday night so there was no disturbance. Parking rate was extremely reasonable for downtown Seattle. I will stay here again on my next trip.

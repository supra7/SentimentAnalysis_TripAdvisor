In the lobby old is charming. And it is a beautiful lobby! However, when it comes to the room, the pool, the bathroom, the windows, the decor in the rooms, the walls between the rooms, the elevators, and the hot tub, old is less than charming. The service was great. The locating is perfect. House-keeping left something to be desired. Granted we were there over new years, but are you really going to leave lime from a drink in the floor for 3+ days? (I say + because we checked out before it was picked up) The hot tub was broken after our third day there. The pool was tiny and poorly maintained. You could hear your neighbors through the walls. The elevators were slow and can't seem to be able to handle the traffic. For the price we paid i expected more.

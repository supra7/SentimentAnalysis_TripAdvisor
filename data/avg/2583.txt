Stayed here on a 19.00 promo rate and standard Travelodge fare. Its a new build opposite Euston station. Staff not exactly tripping over themselves to be friendly and the 3pm check in rule is rigorously enforced unless you want to pay the 10.00 charge. Was allocated a room on the 2nd floor which faced the back, which is probably a blessing as the ones facing the road, will be noisy. Bendy buses trundle pass every so often from the bus station opposite, plus night buses all throughout the night. Double room was smaller than the usual travelodge rooms that I have stayed in about 12 square metres or so. The room benefits from Air Conditioning, but sadly no option to open the window. Cleanliness was not a plus point here, a few missed spots in the bathroom and behind the toilet and the bathroom was starting to smell rather musty. The same could be said of the corridors. Major problem for the light sleepers amongst you are slamming doors and noise which is clearly audible from the adjacent rooms. The night I stayed, lots of screaming children in rooms and people with TV's at full blast. Given the choice, The City Road Travelodge is better, although the top Travelodge in London remains the one at Southwark. Tip: Avoid any room numbers ending 06-12 on any floor as they are right by the lift and the door which everyone has to pass through to gain access to, so even more slamming of doors.

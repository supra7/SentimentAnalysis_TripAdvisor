I stayed here for a weekend at the beginning of December. Overall, the hotel was middle of the road - some great positives and a few negatives. A few days before my stay, I made sure to call the front desk and request a king size room in the renovated section of the hotel. Thankfully, despite booking on a 3rd party website, they were able to accommodate my request even though the hotel seemed to be near capacity for the weekend. The hotel room was extremely large (it looks like they combined two rooms during the renovation) with a nice sitting area in front of the king bed. The room was clean with no signs of wear, but despite being recently renovated (within the last couple years) it did not have a flat screen TV. The bathroom was very small, and my girlfriend and I found it hard to be in the bathroom at the same time to get ready. The room was extremely quiet - you can occasionally hear the L outside, but this was not noticeable at night. For me, one downside was that the building seems to slow down internet connections on mobile phones. Since I did not want to pay for internet, this was annoying when I needed to get a few things done. The hotel has a great location! A block from Millennium Park/Art Institute and a 10 minute walk from N Michigan Ave shopping. The employees were helpful and nice during our entire stay. The lobby is beautiful, but it gets very crowded in the evening and there are not many places to sit.

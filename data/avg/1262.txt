The room was fine with lots of space and a sitting area. Typical for the late 80's Embassy Suites. One set of elevators which worked good even on the busy weekends. 2 flat panel TV's that were large enough to see, unlike some hotels now. We had a couple things tthat were wrong (loose toilet seat, tub that wouldn't drain) but fixed after the first night, no problem. A couple things that were a problem. when we got the plumbing stuff fixed they forgot to clean our room that day so we got back to all the towels still laying on the floor. On Saturday and Sunday the crowd was enormous and the wait to get breakfast was not worth standing in line for. Wish they had a better system. Second they say they have an omlette bar but in acuality these aren't omlettes they are a thin layer of scrambled eggs wrapped around your "ingredients" ham or wehatever. Omelettes are made in a pan and these are made on the grill. Tasted fine but not really omlettes. Lastly the managers reception had exactly the same stuff every night, carrots celery popcon cheese squares and crackers. After 4 nights you'd like to see some variation, taco bar? Chips and salsa? anything to change things up. My advice, stay here on a week night but skip the weekends, too crowded, too many little kids, no place to sit and eat your breakfast. for $109 a night you deserve more. Also parking is $8.00 per night and the wi-fi is $10 per day so roughly $20.00 extra per night for what most places in the area give for free.

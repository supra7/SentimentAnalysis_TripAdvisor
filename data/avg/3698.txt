We stayed at the Magnolia for the 5th time for the UT/OU game weekend. This year for the first time, they required all payment upfront and it was nonrefundable, even though we made the reservation in June for an October weekend. The rate was way too high for the rather small, worn room that we got--about $850+ for two nights. The breakfast and afternoon reception are nice, but the hotel seems a little past its prime and definitely not worth $400+ a night. On Friday night, there was a very loud band that we could hear clearly in our room even though we were on the 16th floor.

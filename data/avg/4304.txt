Situated just off Copley Square, the Boston Park Plaza is a busy, conventionally elegant, older hotel very near Newbury Street and the Public Garden. With a dramatic though slightly shabby lobby and an aging piano bar, the hotel seems almost a relic from a bygone era  as are many of its elderly patrons. Having reserved through Travelocity, my room was adequate, non-smoking and quiet, in spite of a charmless view of a dismal gravel-topped roof spattered with pigeon droppings. The small room was equipped with a plush queen bed, soft linens (nicely turned down each night), and conservative English soaps adorned the early twentieth-century fixtures in the bathroom. No WiFi was available but the ample, ersatz-Federal writing desk featured Ethernet-LAN service for a fee. The overpriced lounge served an indulgent, though a bit greasy, breakfast buffet, and the hotels service was expedient, refined and courteous. This hotel is walking distance from the Arlington stop on the Green Line. Overall, for the $260 room rate, three stars.

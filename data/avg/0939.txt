My daughter stayed here Dec 26 - 30 and really enjoyed it. She said the place was very clean and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful to them. She was traveling wth a friend and the walked or took the monorail everyone. The hotel was in a great location for all the places they wanted to go. Her only complant was the breakfast was lacking of many choices. They booked the hotel at a great rate and it was well worth it.

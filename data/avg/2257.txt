We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the airport. I was a little worried at first because the cab driver did not know where this hotel was located. When we finally arrived at the hotel, we were impressed at the size of our room...well its not just a room, it is actually an apartment with 3 bedrooms, a kitchen, 2 baths. We were able to get a good night sleep before our flight and take advantage of complimentary breakfast. I would have rated the baran 4 stars but i was disappointed at the service more like lack of service. There is usually no one at the front desk and we had to figure out on our own how to take a cab to the airport. Fortunaly there is a cab stand right down the street. This hotel is a good option for large groups because of the space and if you want to be near the airport. I would not recommend if you want to be close to Istambul's main attractions.

Stayed at the Kanaapali Beach Hotel in Maui in November, 2005. At first I was very disappointed in our room. It was old, not too clean and a smoking room (we asked for non-smoking). After a long flight from the east coast, we were tired and right outside our door there was a very loud function going on. We looked at another room on the third floor (no elevator and lots of luggage to carry), but the rug was filthy. The third room they offered us was wonderful and we were very pleased. The beach at the hotel is the best beach I have ever been to. The water was perfect. Further down the beach towards the Sheraton near the black rocks there is incredible snorkeling. They offer a welcome breakfast that shouldn't be missed. It was great. Upon departure, you are given a wooden Kukui bead lei that is very nice. I would stay there again because of the beach, but would be very specific about which room I stayed in.

I attended a conference at the Convention Center in Amsterdam, called the RAI. I was worried that the Novotel would be quite far as every hotel in the area advertises "close to RAI". Despite my worries, I was able to walk to the meetings from the hotel in about 10 minutes. There is a convenient tram stop nearby and a communter rail that will get you in 15 min to the airport (Schipol). If you want to go into town, it's a half hour tram ride, it runs till midnight. While the hotel is well kept and efficient, the staff were a little impersonal, typical of the huge chain hotels in Europe. The other unfortunate aspect is that they do not have rooms for three unrelated people (a couple with child is OK as they have queens with sofa bed). There is no such thing as three beds so my two companions and I took turns sleeping on the floor. The hotel is gracious enough to only add 35 euros per night for the extra person so it was still better than an extra room. Don't even think about having breakfast there, they'll get you for 20 euros. Better walk over to the kiosk at the train station and have a coffee and a pastry. Over all, for the price, I am happy with what I got.

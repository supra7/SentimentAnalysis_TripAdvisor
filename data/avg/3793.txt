I stayed at the Best Western CityPlace Inn for an extended stay. I stayed here because the price was right for the amount of time that I was staying for. (Over 1 week and about $56 bucks a night). Like I stated in my title, you get what you pay for here. The room was a standard motel room with a bed, small pullout couch, ironing board, small microwave, small fridge, ironing board, and basic toiletries. The room for the most part was clean. When I was in the bathroom, I did not see any mold in the shower and the toilet was clean and functioning. The sheets appeared to be clean and the room did not smell. However, the people next to us I believe were smoking in the room and the smell was seeping through the walls a tad but not to the point where it was nauseating. The entry ways to the rooms are all exterior so just be aware of that when booking. The neighborhood appears to be ok that the motel is in. The motel is loctaed next to the freeway and right off the service road so it is located on a very busy street. There is a small free continental breakfast in the morning with cereal, fruit, powdered scrambled eggs, juices, coffee, and make you own waffels. If you are looking for a quick, non fancy bite to get yur day going, its really not that bad. Finally, the front desk staff was extremely nice at the property and were willing to answer any questions we had about the area. For what my purpose was which was a place to lay my head down for an extended time, this property for thr price was very satisfactory.

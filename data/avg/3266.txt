The hotel is good if you are travelling on business as it is close to TUYAP and is clean enough, but that is all there is. The service is ok, but not spectacular and certainly less than expected from a 5-star hotel. I would avoid the restaurant as the food was not special (or warm for that matter). There is nothing to do around so avoid this hotel if you want to do something outside the hotel. It is far away from the city (20 km to the airport and 45-50 km to the city centre), so be careful about that. Walls are so thin that you can hear the conversations from neighbouring rooms. Couples beware!! We made the mistake to book a room over the weekend with my wife and checked out a day early and booked another hotel to get over this one.

Great location right off the 5. The service was excellent...as far as service goes, they totally live up to the Marriot name. They accommodated my request to check in really early, to check out late and to have a room not facing the 5. The room was fine, except the bathroom was a little shabby. We were right by the elevators and it was just way too noisy to me. I could hear everyone coming and going, doors slamming, housekeeping and the TV in the room next door. The worst part was the parking. They charge $28 a night, and then sneak on a $5 "parking tax". So you pay $33 a night... As far as the walking...You can easily walk to many places, like Tulio down the street, but it is on a hill and if you want to go to Pike's Market, be prepared for a hellish hike back.

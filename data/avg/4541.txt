We checked into this hotel late after arriving in boston, we had pre booked and was given a lovely room over looking the river. Parking was easy. Room was very comfy, I cant say much about the hotel other than that as we lefy around 8am next morning for Stowe, However early morning i needed some info from the main desk, and the night desk man went on the internet and got me the telephone no i wanted. Not sure I wouls stay here if visiting Boston for a extended lengh of time but it was great for a over night stay.

If their is one thing I have to highlight is the fire alarm only sounds in the hallways, not in the rooms. The alarm sounded twice during my stay and it was not clear enough for it to be identified as such. Other visitors also were confused as to whether it was the hotel fire alarm or an external fire alarm. If you are hard of hearing or a heavy sleeper beware of this. On checkout I confirmed with reception staff that the alarm only sounds in the hallways. Other hotel chains I have stayed at the alarm sounds in the rooms as well. All rooms do have their own fire smoke detector in but this did not even indicate by its flashing lights the hotel alarm was going off. This became obvious by the small amount of stayers mustered in reception. The shower tray was slippy so if you are unsteady on your feet beware. Their is a safe handle but that is it. The flat screen TV has a good selection and includes Film4 and CBEEBIES. Location for the price was perfect with a London bus station across the way to get you around London seeing the sights which you do not see using the tube network. If you want use walkit.co.uk to see the sights on foot which is possible as this Teavelodge is quite central. On the Euston road traffic lights is a PREZZA restaurant if you do not want to walk far for a meal. In the bus station is the DORIC ARCH pub for a pint. Euston station also has shops cash machines etc so you get room supplies inot far away. The hotel basment bar is OK but a bit cafeteria like. Did not have breakfast. I found the hotel staff pleasant and helpful at all times If you get a Travelodge deal this location makes a weeks stay in central london very reasonable and affordable for Joe Average watching the pennies in the credit crunch.

If pampering or fine decor is what you're looking for, this isn't the place for you. If however you don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room and you don't mind a dated hotel and ammenities (i.e. the pool), this is a great value. I tend generally to be one who prefers to be pampered, staying at higher end hotels with great services but my Maui stay was different. The hotel was the hub but I spent so much time on the beach, shopping in Lahaina, and travelling the island that this hotel was just right. Spending the prices required for fine lodging at a similar premium location wouldn't be worth it. If you, like me, won't be reading a book at the poolside or expecting decent dining and a well apportioned room (e.g. internet is via a long cable only and $10 for 24 hours), stay here!

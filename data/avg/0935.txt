Overall we enjoyed our stay and were happy. It is your typical Economy Hotel. If you want 4 stars go downtown and spend twice the money. If you want a good location and value, stay here. Things we liked: The location to the Space Needle is excellent! It is an easy walk. The coffee machine in the lobby was a nice touch. It offered several types of coffee's which I hadn't seen before, and didn't expect in a hotel like the Travelodge. The beds were nice and the linens and pillows were comfortable. Things we didn't like: The hotel hallway was very hot and muggy feeling. Other than the lobby the hotel needs some remodeling. The rooms were also boring and not well appointed. I expected a fridge and microwave, but didn't have one.

We found this hotel on Hotwire at a reasonnable rate and were pleased to be situated in the theater district in a known 4 stars trademark hotel with very nice staff upon arrival. Pros : - Well located in the heart of the city (near Chinatown and Financial district) - 21 floors with an appreciable view of downtown (even on the 10th floor) - Rooms and accessories were clean - Very quiet, we didn't heat neighbors at all during our 2 night stay - Regular room is a bit bigger than what i expected Cons : - 10$/day for Wi-Fi or Wired Internet - 32$/Day for parking, no rebates for registered hotel guests (and not possible parking around) - Were charged 5$ for a water bottle we didn't use (but got reimbursed easily without justification) - It felt like everything we touched was to be billed, at high rates... - 2 different elevators to get to the rooms. In conclusion, it is a nice and modern place to stay, but maybe a bit deceiving for a 4 star hotel of this reputation. I would still recommend it, if at the price we got from Hotwire, but i would have been deceived by paying the full official rate. Bon voyage !

It was inexpensive and served as a place to sleep. The room smelled like smoke and the pool is only open during the summer months. It is located around many other hotels with a "Ruby Tuesday" restaurant one hundred yards away. The staff was friendly and helpful. It is not a place to take your family, but for a two night stay with a kitchen it was a good deal. No continental breakfast, but fast food restaurants are only minutes away. It is not in a scary part of town, it is literally surrounded by other larger hotels with ample parking lot lighting.

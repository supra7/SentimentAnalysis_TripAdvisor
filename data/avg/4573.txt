My husband and I stayed here from Sat 20th May for 3 nights. The room was very smart, the bed and bedding very comfortable, the bed was very high - hard for me to get onto! The air con switched on and off a few times during the night which woke me up a few times, so that could have been more user freindly. Also the fridge buzzed a few times also (the fridge cannot be opened, unless you want to be charged). There was a kettle and hot drinks for free. The hotel is very pleasant and the bar area nice. I would say that I did not like the location it was in, as it seemed to be surrounded by some 'unsavoury' streets, we did not feel safe even during the day and so had to get taxis out in the eve (I live in London, so can comment on unsafe areas). Another bad experience was that when we checked in, the porters took our bags and 2 hours later we were still waiting for them to be sent to our room. I telephoned about 4 times and in the end my husband had to go to reception to complain. I had visions of our bags being lost, which was not a nice thought after the long flight we had just had. If you want a clean, comfortable hotel for a good price, this is a good choice, but bear in mind the location is not safe. I think that a lot of the competitor hotels in Boston can charge more as they are in nicer areas. This also struck me as a business hotel/ used for conventions.

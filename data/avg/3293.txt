We stayed at the Best Western for a couple nights during a Berlin visit. The Hotel located at Spittelmarkt with the Subway right around the corner to Line 2 which connects the Alexanderplatz to potsdamer platz easily, but even when you're walking it's only 15-20 minutes to get to either. Unfortunately there is construction right across the Hotel which probably will be there for a while longer. The rooms are nice. Hardly any decor, but clean. The staff didn't impress me as much. Check in is not possible before 2 p.m. they are not really able to store luggage if you arrive early and you unfortunately nobody will greet you when walking into the Lobby or restaurant first un like other hotels I've stayed at. They offer breakfast for 9 Euros and have a small computer in the restaurant for surfing the internet, but very open to others. They have a small amount of parking spaces and there is a bakery right across the street for a cheap breakfast. All in all. It's Berlin and you won't be spending much time in the hotel so for beeing close to everything by Subway it's a good place to stay considering you could be spending double for less in a fancy neighborhood.

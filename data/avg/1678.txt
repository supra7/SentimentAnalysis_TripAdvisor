The rooms are nice and clean but don't find the restaurants anything to write home about. Lots of people at the pool but no service there. You had to go inside to get anything to eat or drink. Restaurants are pricey. Location is great though. Especially if you're going to a Padre's game. Ask for a room looking north with a view. It's well worth it. You can see Petco park and the water. Charged $6 for a UPS package I had delivered to the hotel and had to pick up myself at the business center. That was a bit distrurbing. Fitness center is nice but treadmills could be updated. Plenty of treadmills and elipticals.

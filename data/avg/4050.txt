I typically select Marriott for the great predictable offerings. This is an aging property so that could explain the lack of WiFi above the first few floors and the painfully slow elevators to the concierge level on 28. That does not explain the sloppy housekeeping service in our room or the indifferent concierge. My colleague tried to get assistance with dinner reservations and was offered PF Chang or Cheesecake Factory rather dismissively when she asked for seafood suggestions. When I asked for directions to the Museum of Fine Arts, he waved in the general direction without looking up and mumbled "more than six blocks, less than ten" in response to my inquiry as to how far it would be to walk. Hardly a friendly welcome. Nice wine for a fee, weak snacks, but great breakfast in concierge level gathering area. Next time I must attend a meeting at this hotel, I will stay next door at The Colonnade. Too many nice spots in Boston to spend this much money here.

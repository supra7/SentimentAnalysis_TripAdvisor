We did a reverse park and fly, parking prior to our 2 week trip to Costa Rica. We had to wait a bit for the valet to park our car, and then there was a small fender bender with the shuttle as we pulled out. They got us another shuttle though, and we'd luckily left plenty of time. On our return the message said that shuttles come frequently. However it was very late at night so none were coming. When we called again and asked for one it came quickly. So don't just wait if it's late - call. The front sek service was quick and friendly. No complaints there. Our room was spacious enough, the bed was comfy and it was quiet.It could really use some updates though. The carpet was old and stained and the bathroom just had a new counter and fixtures added to an old room. The tub was old and the toilet a big ancient thing that barely flushed. The lighting was dreadful. It was ok for a night, but I was a bit surprised as we purposely spent more to get a better hotel than last time. This one didn't include the quick eay breakfast buffet, which we missed. We came back from a Hilton in Costa Rica that was much more modern! Would we stay again? Maybe, but only for a better price. There are lots of airport hotels to choose from.

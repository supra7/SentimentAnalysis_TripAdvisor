I enjoyed my stay but wont be back due to the sneaky resort fee. The pool closed at 5pm and I never got to even use it after having to pay $15. Also, we had housekeeping ring our doorbell and wake us up at 8:30 only to ask us if we were checking out. This might have been acceptable at 11:00 am but at 8:30 its ridiculous. On the morning when we were going to check out, I got up early to run the building stairs twice. Evidently, the building doesn't really have 64 floors. The rooms themselves start on floor 16. Below that you have the lobby, pool deck and a 7 floor parking garage. I noticed several things that bothered me on my run. I saw cigarette butts discarded everywhere in the stairwells. This is not good in a non-smoking building. The building had two flights of stairs both at a 44 inch wide code minimum. One flight (East side) ended on the 16th floor with no ability to get to the ground floor. The other flight (West side) did go to the bottom but at the 16th floor one had to take a unmarked confusing side passageway to find an additional set of wider stairs that continued to the bottom. How much would an additional exit side have cost?

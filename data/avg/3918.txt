Stayed here on a Saturday in January 2012 in a loft room. Got the room for $92 on the Tuango deal website (Would've been $179 without the coupon). I usually stay at chain hotels so thought this would be different and fun to try. Pros: - Great location: walking distance to everything - Great decor: As some mentioned, very Ikea-ish - Parking: Valet is $25 but if you're staying there on the weekend, you can park on the street for free from 6pm Saturday night to 1pm Sunday (if you're there before and/or after that, you can just put money in the meter) - Good breakfast: was basic but they had good muffins and the orange juice was in a juice box (not from a machine) - Huge windows from floor to ceiling Cons: (a lot of very basic amenities missing) - Shower: There was no curtain or door to the shower entrance so you end up getting part of the bathroom floor wet - Bathroom small: Not much space to put your stuff - No mat at the entrance of the room, so you end up getting the hardwood floor wet and dirty when you come in to the room - TV not where the bed is. It is located in the living room section. - TV not working: It took about 5 minutes to turn it on in the early evening, and then when we came back from dinner and drinks, it wasn't working at all. We called reception and they told us the technical support had gone home for the evening, but that we could switch rooms. We didn't really want to pack up everything and switch at midnight so we just stayed in our room. I might stay here again if I got this room for $92, but definitely wouldn't stay here for $179 per night. I would go to the Days Inn or Candlewood Suites a couple blocks away for $100 and get a bigger and better room.

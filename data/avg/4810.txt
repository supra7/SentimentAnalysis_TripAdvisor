The lobby was wonderful and the staff was very friendly. But...the room was nothing special. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the mattress was rock-hard, and the TV was from 1997. And, I had a nice view outside my window of the fire escape. The bathroom was very nice, however, with a nice showerhead and big thick towels, and it was very clean. However, overall the room was a disappointment. The rest of the hotel was very nice, though. I would probably look for a different hotel my next trip to Chicago. I like the location here, but I'm really using the room the most, so when it is a disappointment, I feel like I'm not getting everything I should be getting, especially for the cost of a room here.

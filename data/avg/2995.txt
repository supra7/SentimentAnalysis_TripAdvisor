The management / owners are opportunists. I was massively overcharged as walk in guest. The entrance of the hotel is a bit disappointing, but once inside, it is Ok. The furniture is a bit worn out and needs repairs replacement. The microwave oven could not be used as the plug and socket were of different standards and so I could not heat my food! In spite of paying double amount for the room, breakfast was not included! I had to remind the manager about the amount he had charged me for the room before he relented for a free breakfast! The breakfast was not very elaborate but adequate.

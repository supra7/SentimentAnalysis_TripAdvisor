The Parrot Key is definitely a nice place. The rooms and in fact the whole resort are new. The main problem, as pointed out by others, is that their advertising and website are very misleading. Educate yourself beforehand and you'll probably have a decent trip. The hotel is not well located. It's basically on the other side of Key West from where all the action is. Taxis are very expensive in to town. We paid $15-20 each way. If you want quiet, you'll find it here. Also, there is NO beach or beach access, despite what the website says. The hotel borders the harbor, and it's not really that pleasant and you can't swim there. The, however, grounds are very nice and well-maintained. The swimming pools were fun and the cottages extremely spacious. My main complaints are that housekeeping is a-w-f-u-l! Often they didn't clean the room at all and when they did (after I hassled front desk with a phone call), they wouldn't bring towels or take away old ones. We got in the habit of dumping our old towels out on the sidewalk in front of our cottage in a plastic bag. Crude, but it got the job done and forced them to take them. The telephone system is spotty. We could call the front desk but couldn't call other rooms where family were staying. The hotel bar closes at 6 pm(!). The swimming pools close at 9 pm, before it's even dark. The entire staff goes home at 11 so there is absolutely no one around at night if you need someone. We came here on our honeymoon based on the reviews. It wasn't horrible, but we wouldn't return unless we had a rental car, and we would most likely choose some place near a beach in any case.

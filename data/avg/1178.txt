Stay was okay at best. Rooms are super small and can get claustrophobic when trying to escape the rain. Wireless internet was terrible in the rooms, barely could stay connected. Room thermostat didn't work right, would either keep blowing hit air non-stop or would shut off completely so we would be either sweating or freezing. Probably will stay somewhere else next time we visit Seattle...in fact we are. Next time in February we will be at the Hyatt. Got a deal on Expedia,$103 including parking. I would refuse to pay anymore than that.

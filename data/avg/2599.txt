Stayed here on a 2-night business trip. The staff was very nice, friendly and helpful. The location is not great but alright. The room was quite small and hard to move around in, as others have said, but the bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. Noise problem with the air unit, but without it you hear everything in the rooms around you.

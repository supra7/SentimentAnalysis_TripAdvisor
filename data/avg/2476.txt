The hotel door was not properly sealed or just too short as there was a 1/2 inch gap between floor and door. Thus all the hall traffic was very noticeable. The rooftop bar was very loud and open very late. Seemed like it was on the floor right above us. (fyi I am in my 20s so if it bothered me I can only imagine what other guests thought) The room was bare or contemporary however you look at it. Bed was comfortable. Great location. Keurig coffee maker. LOVED the shower setup. Floor to ceiling windows with nice views. Booking with the hotel allowed a $10 pp voucher for breakfast, making breakfast almost free each morning, a plus. Must take the elevator/stairs from ground level to lobby on 2nd floor. Then two elevators are available from 2nd level to your room. Inconvenient. (This set up is thanks to the rooftop bar that uses the 1st floor to load guests. Thus hotel guests are stuck waiting for a elevator as they are bypassed for the rooftop bar. Hotel guests have to use their room keys to stop on guest floors but still security is a concern with people other than hotel guests using the elevators.) Spa was average. Maybe it's me but I can't enjoy a massage with the sound of horns honking like they are right in my room. Move the spa up from the 3rd level or the massage rooms away from exterior walls!

This common or garden motel is average at best. The room quality was acceptable but I did wonder if the whiff of cleaning fluid was masking something. The big down side, which applies to all the SeaTac hotels) is the location. It is probably great if you are coming into or out of SeaTac airport (They have their own shuttle bus), but if you are looking for a cheap alternative to a downtown motel bear in mind that you are a long way from the tourist sights in Seattle. Once the Light Rail is extended to the airport (due December 2009) then this might be a viable option, but until then I'd suggest somewhere away from the airport.

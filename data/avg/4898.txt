These are the smallest rooms that I have ever seen in my life. A few of the people on my team had o.k. sized room because of updates made to the hotel. But I was told that the hotel is historical and that they didnt want to damage any of the historical feel :{. With the wallpaper and cracks in some of the walls you can tell that the hotel is old but they have made some nice updates. Lockwood was just o.k. the drink prices are insane, but you can go right next door to Millers and its a little cheaper. Millers is also rated high on Tripadvisor but after going there I cant understand why that is. For the nightlife people for Chicago to be such a large city everything closes by like 11:00 p.m. I guess there are about 10 clubs that stay open past 2:00 a.m. but I am not really sure. p.s. Lou Malnatis is really good pizza. All and all, this hotel was just o.k. And they charge to use the fitness center.

The hotel staff is excellent and so is the concieragee.Got some valuable tips from the concierage that helped us in our sightseeing. But the hotel by itself is very small. Extremely small lobby, no business center, fitness room is a joke and the rooms are small as well. Nothing anyone can do about it but works out well as long as you are aware of this fact. THe fitness room s on the lower level and the room had a dirty musky smell 2 it. It had 1 treadmill and 2 ellipticals very close to each other. THey have complimentary internet wireless but alas hadn't taken my laptop.

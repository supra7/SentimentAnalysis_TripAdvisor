The Intercontinental Dallas is an OK hotel. The common areas and rooms are clean. The location is good. The staff was polite. Breakfast in the restaurant was fine. Ok those were the good things. Now... the hotel was probably nice in 1982, which is the last time anything was updated. The lobby feels like a time warp - lots of brass and empty space, with the original ceiling tiles (and probably the original furniure). The bed had a sag in it, the pillows were 11" thick (some misguided attempt by Housekeeping to "spruce up" the lousy bed). I got a deal on the hotel on Hotwire, and for what I paid it was fine. If I had paid their normal rate, I would have been dissatisfied. There are definitely better hotels nearby.

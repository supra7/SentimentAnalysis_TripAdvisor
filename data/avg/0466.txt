I stayed in the downtown Hilton Seattle for 2 nights. My room was on the 16th floor. It was clean but could use some updating. There was a coffee-pot and keyed mini bar. There was no hair dryer and the bathroom lighting was poor. There was quite a bit of street noise.They do charge for parking.The bed and pillows were really comfortable The location is good(about 5 blocks to Pike Market). There are a number of places to eat within walking distance.The on ramp to I-5 is just around the block I used hilton miles for this visit,but i don't really feel this is 5* property.

We just stayed here for our honeymoon in May. We stayed at the Hyatt in Maui for the first 5 nights and then moved along to a condo in Kauai. Although the scenery at the hotel was gorgeous, the room was just average. The rooms weren't as clean as expectee for a 4-5 star hotel. There was construction right outside our window on the roof all 5 days we stayed here-- not exactly what you want to look at from your window on your honeymoon. The staff willing to move our room and/or waive a "resort fee" of $15/day for parking, etc. The pool here and garden are beautiful. In general there are plenty more nice places to stay in Maui and the Hyatt was a bit overpriced. I would recommend staying in a condo or a rented unit. The following week we stayed in a condo that was twice as nice, larger and had a full kitchen with utensils, washer/dryer, microwave, etc for half the price. The Hyatt is definitely overrated.

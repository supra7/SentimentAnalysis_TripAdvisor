As a last minute option, this hotel offered a classic feel and is in a convenient location. The rooms are small, but clean and well decorated. The restaurant is very good and has a nice seating area outside. Try the short ribs. I found the price to be acceptable as I booked this at the last minute. However, I do not think it's worth more than $250 a night simply because the rooms are tiny and there are so many other options in Chicago.

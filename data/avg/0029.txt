The Hotel Monaco Seattle has drastically gone downhill over the course of the past 3 years. I regularly stay there each summer and this last visit left me looking for new lodging options in the Emerald City. I have stayed in both the Monte Carlo Suite and a King Deluxe. PROS: - Rooms are a decent size for a city - The beds are extremely comfortable - The room has functional furniture - including a desk with 2 chairs and a comfy chair to relax in (in standard rooms) and a nice sofa an coffee table (in the Monte Carlo Suites) - Room service is very good - the Continental breakfast is fantastic and service is prompt. - The hotel has added large flat-screen televisions and DVD players in every room. CONS: - Service, service, service. I waited 15+ minutes just to check-in and was not "welcomed back" as a Kimpton In Touch member. - The front desk reception never greeted me as I came and went (something they always used to do). - They mishandled packages and phone calls routinely (not so great for a business traveler). - My Kimpton In Touch preferences were ignored altogether (room type, pillow type, etc) The personal touches are what make Kimpton hotels special. WIth the lack of service I received at this hotel, I would have much preferred the W across the street.

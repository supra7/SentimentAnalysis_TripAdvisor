We stayed for three nights and had problems parking everytime we returned to the hotel. When there is a parking space it is next to impossible to get out or you are in danger of someone else hitting your car. They say to park at your own risk. On the street parking is available at $1.25 per hour between 8 am and 6 pm Mon - Sat. Free on Sunday. Or you can park in one of the local pay lots for $9.00 per day or more. Everything else about this hotel was great. Our room with the King bed was bigger than the ones with the 2 queens. The Breakfasts provided were excelent. The kids loved the pool and workout center. So if you choose this hotel, please come prepared to deal with the parking.

We would not have booked this hotel had we known there was active construction underway. Arrived on a Thursday and stayed on the concierge floor. The lounge there had a beautiful view of the new and improved harbor but only 10 tables. We were given a room by the elevators, which were very very slow, and asked to be moved and are very glad that we did. We were at the opposite side of the hotel from the lounge and it was fairly quiet. The lounge was to small to accommodate the crowds for breakfast and even though we paid to stay on the floor we had to eat else where or in our rooms. The room was remodeled and clean. Bathroom is small but worked. Expected much more for the price we paid..over looking Columbus Park and the Rose Kennedy parkway. Around the corner from the aquarium and all the tour boats leave from the pier right outside the door.

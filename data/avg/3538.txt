We stayed here on our 4 night visit to Dallas to see some friends from college. This is a basic Fairfield Inn. The location is good for things in North Dallas. Breakfast was included in the price, although it ended at 10 am on Saturdays and Sundays and 9 am on weekdays. For me, this is too early. We found it difficult to wake up and be ready for breakfast by 9 am. Also, the interenet was free, but it was rather difficult to figure out how to use. We had to call the front desk for help. It should not have been that difficult.

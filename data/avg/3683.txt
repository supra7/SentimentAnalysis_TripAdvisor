Excellent location. Very nice lobby and pretty nice rooms (although the bathroom floor tile in our room was very cracked and in need of replacement). The complimentary breakfast and evening cocktail hour are also very nice touches. The automobile valet service and the VERY old and slow elevators, however, need LOTS of improvement. There were very long waits for automobiles to be delivered and getting on an elevator during the morning check-out period was extremely difficult. We would probably not stay at this hotel again if the valet service and the elevators were not greatly improved. Pillows on the beds were also very firm and uncomfortable.

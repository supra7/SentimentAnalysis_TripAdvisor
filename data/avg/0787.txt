I have stayed at the Westin many times but the most recent was a disappointment on many levels, the towels in the room were mismatched and worn, there were also no robes as there have been on previous stays. Our drapes opened randomly in the middle of the night and early morning. Our important dinner reservation was missed and when we phoned from the restaurant to check that we had the right restaurant, the concierge told us her system was down and took an hour to call back only to tell us that they had made the reservation on the wrong night. Not great all in all.

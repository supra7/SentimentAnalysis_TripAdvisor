I have mixed feelings about the hotel... It was certainly not what I expected. The positive: Clean hotel ground and friendly staff. I agree with all other reviews that every staff working at this hotel is very helpful!I The breakfast on the rooftop was nice and the kitchen staff was very attentive. The neutral: Location -- If you are planning to use public transportation to get around, please note it will be a bit of a walk to the bus station. The shops and restaraunts are at a shorter distance but I would have prefered it to be a little closer. The negative: While the room was always left clean by the cleaning staff, it was just way too moist and muggy, even with the A/C on. The bed was a bit too soft (preference issue) and the water pressure in the shower and the toilet was inconsistent. Perhaps it was just the room we were in but I found these things a bit uncomfortable. If I may recommend a couple things to the hotel owner...1) Consider bicycle rental for guests. It sure would be helpful in accessing the bus terminal and the main drag down 5th avenue. 2) Better in-room climate control. Maybe the A/C can be adjusted by the hotel staff before the guest arrives so the room does not feel so humid. No other reviews seemed to point this out as an issue so it may have just been our room... I personally wouldn't recommend this hotel to a friend.

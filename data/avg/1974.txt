Just returned from a week's stay at the KBH. Great location, great service from all of the staff. Housekeeping cleaned the rooms nicely and always seemed very happy and greeted you. The beach is in a perfect place, close to Whaler's Village. The nightly lua I thought looked cheesy but was actually really fun. The downside is this place needs a renovation REALL BAD. The place looks really dated. I'm sure the wallpaper and front desk-lobby everything is from the 70's. The Molokai wing we stayed in didn't have an elevator-We are only 27 so didn't really bother us but it was weird to see that. Rooms were average-nicely decorated but you could tell it was worn out. Also no hot tub-not a big deal but it would have been nice in the evenings. I thought almost every hotel had one, especially at a 400 room property. Overall nice location, good service, ok food. Next time I would stay at the Marriott or Sheraton though-worth the extra money in my opinion.

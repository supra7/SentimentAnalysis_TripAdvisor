I stayed here at the Westin for a guys night in Seattle. I picked this up on Hotwire at a steal of a deal. I am glad I did, because I would never pay the $289 the hotel website wanted. Dont get me wrong, the Westin is nice. The front desk staff was nice as well. The room was pretty basic, nice King bed, pull out Sofa Bed, decent bathroom, real nice shower head, and a decent view. That being said, its not worth $289. There are a lot of other options at lower rates. As someone who loves to travel and blogs about it, I liked my stay, but I am always looking for a deal so thats my take on it. It was nice being able to check out via the TV, but it was hard to find that option on the menu with the remote. Since it was a Saturday night stay, we scored some street parking and paid for the meter until 8pm, which saved us about $20-30 easy in parking garage fees. This place has a great location as well. We did hit the lobby bar for first round of some over priced drinks (as expected) but did enjoy the bartender who was friendly. Overall a good stay and really just used this as a place to sleep after a night out of drinking. I would stay again in a heart beat at the rate I paid. I have two more stays in Seattle in the next month and I am looking to trying out new hotels as I did on this stay.

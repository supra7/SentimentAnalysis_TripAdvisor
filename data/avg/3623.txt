Rooms are very spacious and very confortable with a kitchenette, a dining room with a large LCD TV and separated bedroom. Unfortunately it is not sound proof and I could easily hear noise from the cars on the highway just next to the hotel. The place is organised in seven buildings and in winter time you need your coat and gants to go to the lobby for breakfast or any other need. There is nothing around in walking distance and even the McDonalds's on the other side of the highway is not accessible on foot, you do need a cab to cross it... The worst part was that when I checked in there were long black hair on the bathroom floor, clearly from the room service lady, and used coffee filter in the brewer machine. Even worse, on the second day both hair in the bathroom and used coffee filter were still there. And bed sheets were not even pulled straight, just the blanket was pulled over. Clearly the room service lady is not going into all her checklist. These were not details but basic cleaning items. I left the hotel one day earlier as luckly I found one room available elsewhere not far and at corporate rate. Anyway, the staff was very helpfull in providing all sort of information and directions to me when I asked.

This was a one night stay so my contact with the hotel was limited. I thought the front desk and it's President's Club Check in was a model of efficiency. My room was a rather strange one. I assume that when the hotel opened in 1913, this was two tiny rooms with a shared bath. As it is now configured, one of the rooms is a tiny two armchair and a desk sitting room, the other a bedroom with an armoire holding a TV and the minibar. The bathroom is between these rooms. A little odd and were I staying longer I would have requested something else. The bathroom is fine, the cleanliness unquestionable and the bed comfortable. I was pleased to see that one of the benefits of memembership in the President's Club is free internet access. Unfortunately, I use WiFi so much that I'd left my ethernet card at home and could not be connected through the hotel system. This led to an unfortunate use of the lobby work stations which are pay per use and I ended with a staggering $30.50 bill for 13 minutes of service and the printing a boarding pass. Buyer beware. There is no business center here and that I think is a major debit for this property.

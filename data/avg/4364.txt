This hotel has everything going for it, a great location, friendly helpful staff but potentially, depending on which room you get, a challenging experience may await ! On arrival we were told that we had been upgraded from our Deluxe Room to a corner room which is slightly bigger (all sounds good so far) The issue is that the corner room was on the second floor, above the night club & bar with pounding beats till beyond 2am, an outside smoking area with revellers screaming about till beyond 2am and a set of traffic lights on a major junction with trucks stopping at night then screaming off when the lights go green with all the resulting noise. We expressed our disappointment at check out and was given a $50 discount which helped a little but I would seriously consider if this was the experience I wanted when I return to Boston. As I say though, great location and staff.

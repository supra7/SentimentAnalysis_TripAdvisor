The Hotel had really nice modern design and location was perfect. Really easy to go anywhere with the train. But the things that make us disappointed when we were reach there the check in counter area so small, queue so long and the receptionist didnt say anything to me or even looked at me, only greet my husband (maybe because he is caucasian). So yeah thats really turn me down, cant imagine it happened in A class hotel like W. As Platinum SPG member normally they have separate check in counter and in this hotel is nothing. In the other Starwood hotels if you are Platinum member, you will get tons of benefits and they will treat you like a king but unfortunately not in W Hong Kong. We only got upgraded in corner junior suite (Cant remember what it called). Even when we were check out, we only drop in check out cause the queue (again) was so long. other than that nothing to complained. Restaurant was good, and pool was amazing. But we need to think twice if we want to back here or not after the experience that we got, really ruining the first day of our holiday.

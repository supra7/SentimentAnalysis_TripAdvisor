Overall a decent stay, the Palmer House is convenient to most downtown Chicago destinations and my room was very clean. The problem is that the Palmer House is currently under construction, and the construction noise in my room was unacceptable. When I first entered the room (on the 10th floor) at 11pm, there was a loud thumping / grinding noise coming from the walls. I called to the front desk to say that it sounded like work was being done nearby and I'd like a different room. The response from the front desk was that there were workers down near the street level doing jackhammering, and the desk clerk said that it would stop shortly and offered to send up some earplugs. Not kidding. It's my fault for not pushing the issue, but the noise in fact lasted well past another hour, then happened the next night (Saturday) until midnight. I don't know how the noise was transmitting up the walls, but I'm guessing many of the rooms were hearing the same noise. Beyond that, other more permanent disappointments include extra fees for the gym and for an internet connection, a smallish room, and minimal dining facilities (restaurant / bar on the ground floor).

We stayed here for our honeymoon last year and had such a great time that we decided to come back for our one year anniversary. We were never notified of the construction that is happening and it came as a bit of a shock as we approached the front of the hotel to a bamboo fence and an employee ushering us to the back of the property. The entire back parking lot is now used for valet parking, which is to say the least is inconvenient. It seems unreasonable that not only Is there noisy construction going on, but you're forced to spend $18 a day to valet your car when the undersized self parking lot is full. And even worse, while talking to some other guests, their parking was comped the whole trip! We booked a "partial ocean view" room, which consisted of a corner room, over looking a parking lot. When we called to discuss, we were told that partial ocean view is only 25% ocean view. Now I'm now math major, but this room was not even close to that. We were moved twice before finally having to ask for an upgrade to a deluxe ocean view. Which they accommodated, for an extra charge per night! I asked the person at the desk if she could take care of this for us and she told me "Not if she planned on having a job tomorrow." SERIOUSLY, the Hyatt Corporation is going to fire you for putting the guests first? I find that very hard to believe, especially after hearing from other guests that they were upgraded 3 rooms away from us FOR NO CHARGE! I can't believe they blatant favoritism that is happening here. This is no way to run a property, especially when there are so many other options. This was definitely not the memory that we wanted to have for our first anniversary. I guess the tradition of coming to this resort every year, ends here.......

We stayed here for 2 nights prior to joining a cruise, adequate for our needs, buffet breakfast was excellent, also had a lunch one day which was very acceptable, room probably similar to those of a budget hotel but fine for a short stay. Area was in among the business skyscrappers area but this was not a problem for us as on the one whole day we were picked up and dropped off at our hotel for excersions, and on the 2nd day got a taxi to the cruise terminal - if we wanted to stay in Dubai again for a longer period would chose a hotel nearer the creek so that we had somewhere to go for a walk around.

Not that Im from Sweden, but they got a word that I feel really describes this hotel in the best possible way.. That word would be lagom and it translates into something like so-so or not good, but not bad either I spent one week at this hotel and there are definitely both good and bad sides that I could highlight. Like many others have pointed out the location is perfect. Right down town just a few minutes walk from Pikes Market, Nordstrom, Macys and a handful of good restaurants including Cheesecake Factory across the street. There is also a Gameworks and movie theaters across the street and if you like video games and are in town on a Thursday you should go there after 9 where you can get unlimited gaming from 9 to midnight for 10 dollars. The reception area is nice; the hotel restaurant is nice and serves good food in huge portions for the right price. I also enjoyed a very well equipped gym with plenty of cardio and weight workout where you can have a run while enjoying a nice view from the top floor of the hotel. Staff was friendly, but nothing other than what you would expect in a hotel in this. The room was ok size (in the smaller range for a US hotel room, but big compared to European standards) and the bed was nice and there was good water pressure in the shower. The room looked and felt outdated with older style furniture and decorations with plenty of visible signs that it had been around for a while. The hotel is a non smoking hotel, but every time I entered the room I could smell a ligt smell of cigarette smoke that I would presume is from back when the hotel had smoking rooms. When I checked in I was asked if I wanted the key to the mini-bar. Something I said yes to, but I found out that the mini-bar was never refilled during the week I stayed there. This hotel has plenty of potential, but definitely needs a refurbish.

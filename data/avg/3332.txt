OK!, The Hotel Raval is fine; it is clean and the staff is friendly, but the rooms are almost inconveniently modern: like figuring out how to work the shower could take ten minutes. Also the futuristic lighting tacky decor of the lobby and room makes me think I'm in Ariel's garden from "The Little Mermaid" . The surrounding 'barrio' is claimed to be up-and-coming...well I'll take your word for it and come back in fifteen years when the prostitutes and drug dealers no longer roam the perimeter of the hotel. The reviews say the hotel is located in the heart of the city near the hottest shops and restaurants and well as cultural attractions, but in reality they are all at least a 15 minute walk away. Which is fine if you don't mind passing little 'nino' holding a toy? gat. The walk would actually be fine....if I brought a rottweiler for the journey between hotel and destination, and making the walk at night...I guess just cross your fingers. In hinds sight...Get Me Outta Here!

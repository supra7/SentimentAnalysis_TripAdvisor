Stayed here for 1 night and although this is a clean new property, I would consider elsewhere if you are having to pay the rack rate. Hotel is very nice, in a convenient area and offers beautiful views of the city and waterfront. I lucked out when the rate dropped so I re-booked a high floor water/city view for just over $100 a night with visa discount. Parking is $21.00 for self park so consider that into rate as well. The rooms were a bit small but appointed very well and had a great high def TV. Only problem, their tv menu service was out of order the entire night we were there so no movie night as planned (not all bad, guess we saved $15.00 by not ordering a movie!). All in all a good hotel but needs to work out its "new" kinks before I would consider again. For a business traveler I'm sure its fine, but a family hotel or someone on a tighter budget definitely look elsewhere as everything is a la carte.

While the bed was nice and I slept like the dead, the room itself was smaller than most walk in closets. In addition, the hotel has very little amenities. The only thing you can find is a Seattle's Best coffee shop in the lobbey. If you are looking for a hotel for a couple or with enough room for more than one piece of luggage - look elsewhere. Oh, and the parking was just too much. Park outside of town and take the light rail in. It'll cost you only $2.50 instead of upwards of $30.00 a night to park.

I've stayed at this Inn at least 1/2 dozen times in the past year and I'm sad to report that my experience of it has fallen with each visit. This Inn is in a lovely location, within walking distance to all historic Fells Points attractions. Non-management employees are nice people; some have a clue as to what's going on while others are unable to answer most questions. The hotel has a preferred guest program that used to offer special rates to members. This program now is nominal, with no offers others than those listed offered. Why have a Preferred Guest program then? Prices of rooms have also steadily increased. The breakfast option is nice. Several cold selections of cereals and pastries. The gym is small and has a very low ceiling, making running on a treadmill for anyone over 5'5" an interesting proposition. If you can get a room for 139., as I once did (rates are now 229.), go ahead. Be forewarned, however, that, while attractice, the lower price rooms are petite.

Stayed in BCN Design a few days with my collegues and some clients. The hotel is "hidden" in the very middle of Barcelona, with reception one floor up from street level. The entrance in convenient once you have registered, since the lift takes you straight to your floor level. The lobby is stylish and compact. There is no separate breakfast room; a part of the lobby is used for serving breakfast in the morning. Corridoors are simple, but when you open the room door, you get a surprise: extremely modern room where eveything is open including showers and toilet (which are behind a glass door each). Overall special. Breakfast was good and eveything fresh. There was a small hickup though: the room in which I was staying was booked and paid for over almost a week. I left early after three days and another person from our group arrived that day and he was going to stay in the room I stayed in. I left my Mac charger into the room for him to use, but when he arrived a few hours after I had left, the charger was gone. And the room had not been cleaned, so somebody must have entered the room, and taken the charger. I contacted the hotel and told them that I feel they are responsible for the loss, which they did not agree to. In a hotel of this quality should not happen! So overall the experience in this hotel was good until it ended with a disapointment.

We stayed at the Edgewater for w weekend trip into the city. Loved the bar/restaurant so much, the views of the sun setting over the water were incredible. Had two delicious pineapple drinks which were amazing. Room was somewhat small but i feel like it made the experience cozier. The Shower and the bathroom was very nice, clean. Service was good but nothing to write home about. Valet parking was kind of annoying. We didn't have a "water" view but I did not mind. Overall I would suggest staying here for the experience but I would not recommend stay for more then a couple days.

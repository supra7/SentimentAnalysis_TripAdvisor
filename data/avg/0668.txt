It is a lovely looking hotel and the bed (Hastens) is fabulous. Also, great location - one of the major draws. The staff were just "okay" when we checked in, but could have been better considering they screwed up our reservation. Our issue was with the non-existent stay 3 and pay for 2 night deal they advertised (http://hotelandra.com/packages/stay-3-pay-2/). In the end, we paid for 3 nights in a extremely expensive room and they graciously took $40 off the bill. I even left a note when I booked online to confirm the deal and rate, which they didn't. Would I stay again? Probably not. There are better deals in Belltown.

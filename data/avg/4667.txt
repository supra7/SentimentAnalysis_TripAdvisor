This is a really great hotel in downtown Chicago just off Magnificent Mile. It is has a wonderful art deco lobby in creams and yellows with dark wood. The rooms are large and beautifully appointed in pale greens, dark wood and gorgeous bedding. Great restaurant, Ben Pao right across the street. Had a fantastic dinner after a long day of travel. Went to bed only to discover that opposite the hotel is the Fire Department. So in the middle of the night, on more than one occasion, we were woken by the sirens of the emergency vehicles heading out on calls. We won't be able to stay there again which is a shame because if it wasn't for the sirens we would rate this hotel a five star!!!!!!!!

The beds are old. You can actually see the "dip" in the mattress in the center of the full beds. Both us and our kids were falling to the center during the night and kept waking each other up. Also, the sheets didn't fit and they kept coming off the mattress. There was dirt and dust balls inside our drawers as well. Otherwise, the service was good. They need to replace ALL of their beds as all 5 rooms our families stayed in all had the same bed issues. And, we were on different floors.

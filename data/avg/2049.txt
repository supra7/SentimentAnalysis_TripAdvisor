I stayed in copthorne hotel for five days. it is crazy that me and my friend couldn't use the swimming pool after 13.30 because ladies and men can not be together at the same time.And in the morning there is no sun because it's hidden by the hotel. I complained to the reception and they told me that their main visitors are arabians so they had to respect their culture. PS Friendly people,poor breakfast.

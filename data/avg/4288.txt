Stayed at this hotel for a conference and it certainly seems well prepared for this kind of visitor. The public spaces and meeting rooms are all of a high standard; staff well able to deal with the volume of guests and all remarkably friendly/helpful. In-hotel restaurants are varied but pricey; a better option is the right next door Au Bon Pain that allows for a quick and inexpensive meal any time of day. I did eat a couple of meals in hotel restaurants and food and service were both very good. The rooms at the hotel are another story, however. Small, ordinary, and--at least where I was--very very noisy. I could hear the phone ring in the next door room as well as any coughing etc. Doors along the hallways in desperate need of oiling instead of the squealing noise that each of them seemed to make. And the heating system was so loud, I turned it off and had a cold room instead. And there was no way to lessen the incessant street noise outside. I seldom have trouble sleeping when I travel, but this was not a good experience. One positive: the shower in the bathroom is really good--two power heads, as others have noted. But the bathroom was tiny--closet sized (and it must said that the closet in the bedroom was less than closet sized--also tiny) and dated. I liked the original tile floor but toilet/basin/faucets needed upgrading. The shower curtain had a number of small, but nasty stains. Both the bedroom and the bathroom desperately deserved a fresh coat of paint--I've seen dorm rooms in better condition. Overall the room seemed out of step with the public areas of the hotel and the hotel's image of itself.

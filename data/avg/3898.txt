The front desk staff was friendly. However, the phone in the room would not dial front desk, I asked for a wake up call but never received one, on 2 different occasions (after housekeeping had already been to my room) someone was in my room. I knew this because the first time it had happened I came back to my items moved and 2 lights on that were off when I left. The second time, there was a cable/internet man in my room. He told me the people in the room next to me had poor service and that he needed to be in my room to fix it. As a woman who traveled alone for most of this trip, this was an uneasy feeling. The mattress in the bedroom reminded me of a visit out west...a big mountain between 2 valleys. The mattress on the pull-out sofa had springs showing. I was charged a resort fee after I had arrived, so it was an additional charge I wasn't aware of up front. I saw there was a pool and an exercise center, but most hotels have those. I would not have labeled this a resort. Housekeeping only makes beds. My used towels weren't even replace with new ones. The hotel was very pleasing to the eye but I prefer quality over aesthetics.

Really nice hotel, if you are staying there, make sure you ask for the river view with a balcony! Would have made all the difference to our short break. Really need a taxi to get around but there are plenty of them and they are very cheap. Could not use pool when we wanted as it was Ladies only at the time we wanted to go.

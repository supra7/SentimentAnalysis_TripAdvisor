I personally thought this Hotel was overpriced. The only reason why I stayed here is because the wedding party that I was in chose this hotel. Our room was small; there were charges for internet and the fitness center. These items should be complimentary with the price I paid. I also thought that the bathroom could be a bit cleaner and bigger. Some updating to the decor would be nice too. I did find the bed comfy, the lobby beautiful and the location great. I have stayed at many Chicago hotels and I have paid less and gotten more. I would not stay at this Hotel again.

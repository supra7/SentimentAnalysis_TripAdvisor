Let me first start off by saying that we were in Hawaii for 2 weeks- first 7 nights at the Maui Marriott Ocean Club (beautiful-loved it) and then to Kauai for 4 nights at the Sheraron (another classy hotel) -Our last 3 nights were spent at the KBH- There is NO comparison to the other 2- staff was pleasant enough but the hotel is dated, "run down" and forget about "old fashioned Hawaii" as their ads indicate- just think OLD - the beach is beautiful in front of the property and their breakfast is acceptable(except for the many birds landing all over the tables and plates left there)- We had an ocean front room -beautiful view from our balcony but again the room was dated and "dingy" - the best thing about this hotel is the location and the price - But honestly in this case you really do get what you pay for- I would not stay here again unless some major renovations take place- There are MUCH nicer places to stay even for the 250 a night that we paid .

Having been happy with previous one night stop overs we were happy to book here again. We booked a few weeks in advance and requested a room facing away from the road and airportl. We also paid for bed and breakfast rather than room only as we had enjoyed the fresh fruit selection on previous visits. On arrival after a 9 hour flight from London we were very tired and hoping our room would be nice and quiet. We were very disappointed to be offered a room facing the busy road and airport and asked if a quieter one was available - it wasn't - even though we had requested it at the time of booking. We wanted to sleep immediately after our flight even though it was only 7pm, but the noise made that very difficult. The rooms are looking dated and the water pressure in the shower was dreadful. Next morning we were disappointed again to find that the restaurant was being renovated so breakfast (which we'd paid extra for) was restricted to a very limited selection laid out in reception. They were able to make eggs to order, but there was no prepared fresh fruit, no low fat plain yoghurt, no fresh squeezed juice, etc, etc. They must have known their restaurant would be out of action when we made our booking so breakfast such as it was should have been free. All in all a very poor show. We have a booking for our return journey, which I am very likely to cancel in favour of a more accommodating hotel.

I had high hopes for this hotel and had wanted to stay here for sometime. The lobby is beautifully decorated and the continential breakfast is better than others but- there is one thing you should know... The rooms are not sound proof. When your neighbor flushes the commode or takes a shower - you hear it! All night long!! The valet entry is a little odd to find- but we had no complaints and only circled the block once. There is an Iron Cactus within walking distance that has great food and drinks. The rooms were nice- but just very loud!

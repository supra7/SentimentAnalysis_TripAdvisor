I stayed for a conference recently. The hotel is quite large but for access to events at the convention or Staples Center it is fine. Otherwise nothing is really within a comfortable walking distance. The reception, bar and restaurant areas are an open plan and feels somewhat disjointed, certainly with no feeling of intimacy anywhere. I was in an executive king room which was oddly shaped. It was attractive looking but some practical design flaws are actually annoying (shades that are difficult to raise and lower, lights not well attached to the wall, cool water for showers in the morning, and no light in or near the closet unit) On the good side the bed was comfortable and the bathroom well designed with lots of a shelf space and a very large shower. All in all my stay was acceptable but I would not stay again barring a conference located there

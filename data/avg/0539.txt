If there were a way to give a 3.5 star review, that's what this would be. There was nothing wrong with the hotel - I just wasn't wowed (except for the gym, which was great). This was a weekend getaway with my sister and I chose the hotel primarily for its convenient location and its gym. 5* for both. This is a great location for city sightseeing on foot. I paid to upgrade to the Club level, and the upgrade was a good value for the two of us in terms of perks (lounge access, continental breakfast and evening snacks for two) and free internet access. It didn't, however, seem to translate into anything special in terms of the room we were allocated. We were on a Club Floor, but the look of the hallways and our own room was very ordinary. Beige, beige, tan, beige, blah. While the room and halls seemed to be in good repair and clean, the style/decor was rather outdated. Also, while I certainly wasn't expecting the Four Seasons or the Ritz, I did expect a little more in terms of quality/luxury in a Club room. As others have mentioned, the wait for an elevator can be quite long. At one point, there seemed to be only a single elevator serving floors 20 and above in our tower, at a point where many people were checking out in the late morning after the Anime convention. Would I stay here again or recommend it to others? Maybe. Someone trying to stick with his/her fitness routine on a business trip or weekend away? - absolutely yes. Someone used to higher end properties in the Marriott, SPG or Hilton chains? Probably not. Someone wanting a little style or a personal touch? - definitely not.

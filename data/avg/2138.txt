This hotel falls a little short of being a 5 star hotel but overall its quite nice. Good facilities, no casino and the staff are OK. Room layout and size are great. Two BIG issues. [1] Almost no mobile phone signal inside the hotel which make it really difficult to lead a normal business life if you are staying here. [2] THE NOISE. The noise was a the real issue and I hardly slept for the 4 nights I stayed. There are 2 noises. The first is clear the Train and other road noises. For some reason this thing blows its warning horn at around 12am, 2.30PM and 3.30PM. Why it has to do this is beyond me, does it cross some roads? There were also some other noises which I think were something to do with the high speed lifts. You can even hear police sirens and car horns and that was from the 31st floor. The hotel were great and moved me from the back of the hotel to the front. When I complained about the noise their response was instant (they must be used to it) and they put me on the 51st floor. Although this was better you can still hear the noises. I am really surprsied that building of this quality has such poor sound insulation. Not good at all. Sadly I would not stay there again and the noise is the only reason.

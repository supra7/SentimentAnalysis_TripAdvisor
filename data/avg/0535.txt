The room was great, compact and with all mod cons. Perfect for people not wanting to apend a lot of time there. The pool is a joke. We were on the opposite tower and there are no changing facilities, so we had to cross either the main lobby or go through the convention centre (not easy when it's convention time). The pool itself is tiny and there are no places to sit around. By time 2 kids were in the pool, there was no space to swim or relax. What a shame, particularly affter they make so much of it on their website. Also check out the Daily Grill (accessed within the hotel)

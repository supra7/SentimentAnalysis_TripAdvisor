We stayed there for three nights at the start of May. The room was tiny, the breakfast was very average and the staff weren't very attentive. However I had read that this is often the case with Roman hotels, for us it was overpriced. And unless you get a really good price, I wouldn't recommend it. The location was 2km from the Colosseum.

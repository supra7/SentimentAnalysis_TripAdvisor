Having used Hiltons before I expected a certain level of service, efficiency and knowledge. The people behind the registration desk were not knowledgable about several facts and instead of informing me and my colleagues that they would have to find out the answers they gave none answers. The interior shows its age. The atmosphere was DARK and dreary. The suite was large and comfortable and even though we were on a concierge floor we couldn't access the priviledges unless we were Hilton Honors members. We didn't learn of this and that if your Hilton account was not used within a calendar year the points expired and you had to sign on again. We ate a light dinner in the pub area - it was not crowded and yet it took us 1 3/4 hours to be waited on, served and get the bill. We are told that they expect major renovations - then it would be time for another look

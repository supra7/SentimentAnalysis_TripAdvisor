I had a tight budget to fit for a last minute trip to the beach with my partner and family. Hey for $90 rate on the boardwalk, I thought that was pretty good compared to the neighboring beachfront/boardwalk hotels, which were up to $100 more. Yes, I read the reviews and I expected the worst! For someone traveling with a family where it a hassle to get anywhere, (everyone takes their time getting ready, forgets stuff, etc etc) the convenience of a beachfront boardwalk location was MUCH needed! So I booked the Royalton, and was well prepared from previous review woes. We brought febreeze ,extra blankets and sheets, raid, lysol, and other emergency items. But we ended up not having to use any of it. When we arrived, I held my breath as opened the door to our room. To our surprise, we all said, "Its really not that bad as some people made it out to be". Yeah, The furniture and decor was outdated and the room was small, but it was managable for 4 people. The bathroom was clean and functional. No frills, no big deal. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to my request to be placed on the first floor since we had an elderly, they gave extra towels, and even gave us a discounted price off the ususal rate to extend out check out time. We stayed in a standard 2 double bed room, had a nightstand, dresser, small tv (with not many channels), and regrigerator. The bathroom seemed like it had a few new renovations such new fixtures/sink/toilet, and there are not many outlets in the room. In all, This is definatley a 2 star place, it is minimal and the building is old as dirt! But we had a pleasant stay and a good nights sleep. I think the people who complained were expecting way more without doing their research on this place. Honestly, If you are expecting something more spacious, modern, and newer in architecture, seek elsewhere! I would recommend this place if on a small budget and plans made at the last minute, and if you are staying short term of 1-2 days.

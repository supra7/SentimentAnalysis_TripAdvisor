My wife and stayed one night here while waiting to get on an Alaska cruise the next day. Upon check in we were wowed by the decor of the establishment but the front desk and bell boy were too snobby. They think they are celebrities or something....not friendly at all. Overall the room is nice and clean and the location was great.

We were allocated a junior suite on the 14th floor, high enough up not to hear most of the traffic noise but not high enough to drown out the emergency vehicles sirens that were arriving, day and night, at the massive hospital across the road. Plus there was a contant thumping noise, maybe a water pump or something to do with the aircon, that also went on day and night. So I found sleeping really difficult, which is a shame as the bed was lovely and comfortable, with pillows to die for! I had a running battle with housekeeping for my extra pilow, every night I would get it out of the wardrobe, and every day they would put it back again... It's a pity they weren't so zealous with the cleaning. On our first night we spilled some sugar on the counter top by the coffee machine, 3 days later it was still there. And the coffe making supplies tray wasn't refilled in all that time, we had to ring down to have some brought up to the room. Other than these niggles we really enjoyed our stay in Chicago and would love to come again. I would stay at the Avenue but would request a room at the back next time.

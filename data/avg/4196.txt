An unexpected trip to Boston required us to find a room for the night. Trough trip advisor we got a room at the Park Plaza for $240. When I asked if we could reserve the same room for the next night, the rate would be $575! When we arrived at the hotel, we were upgraded to the tower level. When we arrived, the room looked as if it had been used for a meeting in the afternoon (room service trays outside the door and notes on the desk). Other than that the room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable -- but we could not control the room temperature -- even pushing the temp control down to 64, the room never went below 75. As a business traveller, I have a personal beef with high price hotels that charge for internet. We were only in the room for 10 hours, I did not want to pay $10.25 to send out two e-mails. Usually, there is a common area where internet is available. Such was not the case at this hotel.

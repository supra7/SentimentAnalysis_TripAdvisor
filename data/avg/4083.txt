This is the 2nd time I have stayed at this property. The first time I was not immpressed at all, and in a years time not much has changed. The Hotel's location is superb, easy to walk around, great places to eat and shop near-by. The bad news is, the hotel has unhappy staff, and it's apparent in almost anything you ask for. Also the elevators still are very slow -which is surprising considering the number of them to serve guests. The rooms have been updated but still remain a bit haggered. The 2nd floor is currently under renovation and is going to be the new lobby, it will help create a more up-to-date feel. Because there is so much close by I never ate at the Champs in the hotel. I did stay on the concierge level this time, and the lounge did supply breakfast -but again the staff seemed to be doing it under orders. They were not a friendly bunch. Also the food selections never changed as they have in other hotels, every morning it was the same and every evening it was too. I didn't think I would stay here again, but I did. It is mediocre, except for the location -which is very nice. One other thing I found disagreeable was the $12 something charge for internet and then that get's taxed! The internet is charged from noon to noon regardless of when you actually sign into it, seems like a rip-off and considering what you might already be paying, it seems wrong.

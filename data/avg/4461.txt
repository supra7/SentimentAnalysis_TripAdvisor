The hotel is in a great location. Belvedere St. entrance is a trolley stop - convenient. Across the street from the Sheraton and huge mall/convention center - excellent. Nearby walking streets, libraries, Lyric Stage Theater, and Fenway Park (10 min walk). The staff is friendly and efficient. Free internet in lobby area - very nice. The hotel itself is more budget than high class. Rooms are very small, tiny little bathrooms (hard to turn around in). The lamp shades in two of our four rooms had been sliced and diced by some previous partygoers. Pretty bad. . . . One of the two phones did not work. One lamp did not work. The room was freezing and could not be altered from the room (we tried and tried). Our requests for assistance was quick and effective. Overall, a decent place to stay, but I expected more luxury from a hotel with the Hilton name,

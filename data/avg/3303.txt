Hotel was pretty decent I found. It is located in the Amsterdam suburbs, which means you need to catch a tram to get into the centre. The area isn't exactly amazing but it's not run down and you don't feel totally unsafe walking around. The room I stayed in was very clean, however it was a pity to see that the ceiling has clearly had water damage at some point and there was exposed wires (still in the "jacket" though) leading from the wall to the mirror spot lights in the bathroom. To be fair though, the rest of the room was spotless and everyone worked as it should have so no complaints there. The breakfast was good, with continental breakfast and "fry ups"-style breakfast also available, which should satisfy everyone's tastes. There was also free wifi in the hotel, although it was a struggle to get a reliable signal in the bedroom. All in all, a decent hotel that should be considered.

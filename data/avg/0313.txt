Great centrale location, in middle of everything, great staff absolutely friendly and helping, a good 3 stars hotel. But room are hobbits-style, they r nice but very very small, first of all bathrooms. The worst? Breakfast. It's in close caf: u receive a single pastry and a drink, just enough to go to have breakfast... elsewhere

On a positive note . . . . Very clean/cozy resort. Friendly and courteous staff help. Peaceful with beautiful coastal views. Very comfortable beds. Good selection of dining experiences. Unfortunately, this boutique hotel needs much improvement to be considered as a notable resort. Negatives: If you rent a car, good luck finding the location. No signs, no map on their website, phone wasn't answered when I attempted to call. Many Taxis didn't even know this location since it's so off the beaten path. After 2 more hours of driving aimlessly, I found it. The first night I stayed in a groundfloor/garden suite. More like kitchen suite at 7am with staff preparing breakfast next door. Small room with no locking doors leading to garden. The next room was like stepping out of the basement into a slice of heaven. Spend the extra money to select the top rooms or you will be disappointed. Not a swim friendly beach: nice sandy beach but reefs in the water make it a little tender on the feet. Checkout was a nightmare! No one was in the office nor was the phone answered when I tried calling them or concierge. When I was able to contact them, they still hadn't prepared my bill. They couldn't process the credit card over the phone line. I checked over the bill and noticed there were several charges on it that weren't mine. After they recalculated it, I still was paying more than my charges but by this time I had only 2 hours to get to the airport/customs/security so ended up paying the extra bucks. This last correspondence with them really left a bad impression of my experience with Le Reve. Good luck

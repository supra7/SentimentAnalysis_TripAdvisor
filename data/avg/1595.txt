I went with my new girlfriend for 5 nights. Great location, with good restaurants and shops around the hotel. I didn't like the bathroom and shower with the glass doors. The doors didn't close properly so you could hear and see the person inside. No place to put your cloths next to the shower and the room is always getting wet because the of the glass doors. No cabinet next to the sink to put your tooth brush or shaving cream eather. On the other hand, I wasn't bothered by the noise at all.

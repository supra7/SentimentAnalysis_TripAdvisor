I booked this hotel for the price and proximity to London. It's in a suburb called Stratford, which is good for finding cheap local food and supermarkets, but it takes a while to get into the city if you're there to see the sights. It's a 15-20 minute walk to the Stratford tube stop, in zone 3 of the tube network, and from there it takes 25-40 minutes to get into the center, depending partially on whether service on any of the lines was interrupted (which seemed to happen pretty often). Also, be aware that over half the rooms are motel-style, and they're currently doing renovations, so if you end up with an outside room you're likely to be woken at 7 or 8 am every morning like we were. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but small; the bathroom was tiny (the door nearly hit the sink when it was opened). Breakfast isn't bad; typical continental European - cereals, milk, tea, coffee, bread, meats and cheeses. The man who seemed to be the manager was awful. The first morning at breakfast, he yelled at one of the maids and threatened to fire her. They were in the kitchen, but both clearly visible to me and just a few feet away, since I was getting cereal at the time. He definitely knew I was there. The following days showed that was characteristic of how he treats his staff.

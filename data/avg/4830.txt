Since this is an old hotel, the rooms are tiny, it was difficult for us to move around during "getting dressed" time with two people in the room without running into furniture or each other. There is not empty floor space. Also, the walls are thin and you can hear everything going on in the rooms around you and the hallway. If you need to sleep past 8am, bring earplugs. You may also need them if your neighbors are loud. The public spaces of this building (lobby, ball room, meeting rooms) are fabulous and elegant. It is a great place for an event and the food on the property was pretty good. Also everything was spotless and clean- even in the guest rooms. We did have one challenge that we brought to the attention of the hotel at checkout- Someone sent us champagne and the hotel set it up on our bed. The problem, the ice in the bucket melted and spilled: and when we got in late that night, our entire bed, comforter and sheets were soaked! Not good planning on the part of the hotel, they should have put it on a cart or on the desk. As sweet and romantic as it looked, it was no fun to unknowingly climb into wet sheets . This is a great place to stay if you can get it on Priceline or a discount website, but it is not the luxurious rooms you would expect for the rack price.

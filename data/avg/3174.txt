I stay here 3 times a month on business. Primary reason is location to office. Hotel is clean, predictable and relatively efficient. If you are coming from the airport, take the train to RAI station then a 5 minute amble - save time and money by not taking a cab at the airport. Limited food options at hotel but bar is fine. Note, you are not in the centre of Amsterdam so you will need to travel to eat out and see the sites - Transport to Amsterdam City centre can be quick and cheap - take the train or tram from RAI station into the Centre. Rates very depending on occupancy - there are a lot of expositions in Amsterdam.

It is probably the best place to stay because it's far from the noise and the party of Key West, but not for more than two nights ... the staff is not very friendly, they just do their job. You have to cross your fingers to find a parking space available, otherwise you should find space in the Win Dixie. The blinds of our window was damaged, we ask them to fix it, they confirmed to us that they would, but they never fixed. We were two families, and the hotel confirmed to us that they wouldn't charge resort-fee for the two families, but when we checked out we were charged the resort fee per family. We argue that it was the same reservation by the group, but we didn't get any help. The pool is nice. The rooms are good. There are best options upstairs (A) because they are larger. The bathrooms are beautiful, but again, not for more than two nights.

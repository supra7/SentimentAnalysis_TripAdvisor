Based on the reco of a fellow Trip Advisor reviewer, I booked our room in the Towers section of the hotel. The first 2 nights we had a King bed on the 15th floor with access to the "lounge" (which, by the way, has very limited hours - and NO weekend hours at all! What is THAT about?!). This room was so small that my husband and I were literally tripping over each other. To open the closet, the dresser drawers had to be closed! We did call up for a refrigerator and they brought it relatively promptly, thought. On the third night we switched to a double-bedded room, also on the 15th floor- which was MUCH bigger. The parking is $44 a night. We parked across the street for 2 of 3 nights and paid $20 for 12 hours. The concierge only works until 7:30PM on a Saturday night - strange considering this is in the heart of Back Bay. And charging $11 for Internet is beyond ridiculous. Unlike most, we had no problem with the HVAC, but I'm not at all sure the Towers Level was worth it.

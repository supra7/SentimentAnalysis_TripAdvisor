Location is excellent. Plenty of places and attractions within walking distance of the hotel. Words of advice- do not bring stay here if you need to park your car. Parking is minimum of $40 a day. They also charge you for WIFI, which for a 4 star hotel you would expect them to provide more then just a bed to rest on and except such amenities. Other then that, if you can get for 50-100 dollars a night, this would be worth the stay, but be weary of your budgeting as parking and wifi costs money.

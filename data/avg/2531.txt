I was pleasantly surprised by the Euston Travelodge. I found the staff friendly and helpful, both in person and on the phone. I stayed in a room at the back of the hotel, which was remarkably quiet considering the proximity of Euston station. The room was clean and reasonably spacious and the carpet appeared to be new. The mattress unfortunately managed to be both soft and lumpy at the same time and the pillows barely merited the name, making a good night's sleep an impossibility, but as I have encountered similar problems with bedding at other Travelodges, it didn't seem worth complaining. The bathroom was small but well-appointed and clean. WiFi charges in the room are reasonable, and WiFi is actually free in the hotel's bar.

Stayed here for two nights in September 2011. The main draw was the location - my train got in late and I didn't want to be traipsing across the city - it is right next to Euston and about a 5 minute walk from Kings Cross. Euston is well equipped with shops, including an M&S food store so you can grab breakfast there! There is an automatic check in machine which was simple to operate. My double room was on the third floor and on the side street - there was some noise at night but not too much. The rollerblind shut out any light. The room was clean although a few of the fixtures, especially in the bathroom needed fixed or upgraded - eg the bathroom bin had a metal spike sticking out , one of the buttons on the shower was broken and a bedside lamp needed fixed. The bed was reasonably comfortable, and the room was equipped with a kettle and a flatscreen tv on the wall - it was next to the bed so you had to lie across it to see properly. All in all, its fine for a place to lay your head and the location is very convenient.

Stayed here two nights for $500. The room was nice size...2 queen. It was clean and comfortable, but tile in bathrooms were cracked, paint was peeling off boards. The room stayed warm and we could not get the air condition to work- room 1040. We ate the Sunday buffet for $25 a person. It was tasteless... I have had a better breakfast at Hampton Inn for free. The front desk was not friendly. I asked to speak to the concierge and the girl at the front desk did not know one existed! Ha!!! The one redeeming quality is that it is in a great location to sight seeing. I will look elsewhere for my next stay.

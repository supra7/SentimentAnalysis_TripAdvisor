I visted the Copley Square Hotel as a business client. Having reviewed several hotels on TripAdvisor in great detail, I decided that the Copley Square must surely be a dead-cert for a quality, comfortable and rememberable place to stay; suffice to say I was very disappointed from the start of my stay. I payed over 1700 for a six night visit, staying in what was described as a boutique-queen room with wine reception. My boutique-queen room didn't live up to the title. I was on the top floor with a view that looked across to another high-rise building just several feet from my window. My room was small but well decorated. It was disappointing to find that there was no fridge, dust around the skirting and lampshades, bed sheets that had small stains on them and a very small bathroom that could be described as 'fairly' clean. Generally, the Hotel Copley is a 'nice' place to stay, if one has payed up to 150 per night for the room. Unfortunately, the Copley Square Hotel oversell's itself from the ad's/reviews I have observed and needs to seriously 'up it's game' in both service and quality if it wishes to continue to appeal to it's respected market. My stay was comfortable but knowing that the Copley had spent many millions on reinventing itself, I was very disappointed. My stay was comfortable but I'd advise the Copley that they are not playing in the hotel league that they think they are.

I have stayed here many times,The hotel is friendly,quite in general and central and for the conference good value $79 i would not pay more than this. I have been coming here since 1999 and since its upgrade not much has changed,The rooms are small and T.V.s need upgrading,my air con was broke and nights were cold as they had gone back to sheets and taken away the duvets. The milk and cookies are great but you have to be quick as people you have not seen all day swarm like locusts when they arrive,Breakfast is free and enough to eat some cold meats would be a help and cheese. THE BAR is the same as it has ever been overpriced and not run by the hotel not open on a sunday or after 22-00pm and dont stay Thanksgiving nothings open mind you to be fair a lot of the hotels are like this now in Dallas,I would say this to the Lawrence,Tidy the place up Get the Bar and Resturant under your control and make sure everything works in the rooms

The staff was super friendly and helpful - Absolutely the best thing about the hotel. The hotel shares amenities with the Marriott Residence Inn, which made the pool area very crowded. The pool was very cold, but the hot tub was nice. Although both were very small. Normally an important part of our stay  but a bad experience here. The room was clean, and the view of the city was great. Walk to Michigan Ave wasnt bad, about 5-10 min. Breakfast was very good. The room didn't have a hair dryer and the beds were uncomfortable. Even our teenager complained. The suite didn't have a separated couch area as advertised - the couch was at the end of the beds - defeated my purpose of not having light in the sleeping area. Hotel was nice, but overall, for what we paid, Id look elsewhere before staying here again. We had stayed in a Springhill before and it was worth every penny we paid  this one just wasnt close to being in the same league.

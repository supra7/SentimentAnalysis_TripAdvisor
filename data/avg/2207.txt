The price was actually good but the one bedroom suite fell short of feeling luxurious. There were no DVD/VCR's which the children look forward to. There was no writing desk, which is a big deal these days since most of us travel with our computers. It's too far to walk to a casino if you're hoping to do that. We also had several serious service problems but, since management apologized and gave us a decent refund, I won't complain about that, other than to say the mistakes were careless and very unprofessional. Having stayed in other Vegas hotels with similar suites that did not have the drawbacks the Trump suites do, I have to say I wouldn't stay here agaIn OR advise anyone else to. There are things to appreciate, like the huge elegant bathroom, the flat screen TV's and the well equipped kitchens, but The Donald should put in a casino next door. And chair/sofa arrangements in the lobby for weary travelers. And (definitely!) a place for pets to go since they are allowed here. -- By the way, we worried about the train, since others have complained about it keeping them awake, but we heard it only once and never from our room.

This hotel has a great designer boutique feel to it. I understand its a refurb of an old hostel and they've done it well. The room was lovely with lots of well used space and nicely furnished in a budget boutique way. ikea ish furniture everywhere. Small kitchenette came in useful. Floor to ceiling windows let a lot of light in, corridors are dark and stark. Tins of charcoal paint seem to be used in the refurb. Facilities are sparse in the hotel. Several small seating areas by reception including an small courtyard area. No restaurant or bar, Just a small breakfast pickup area, Tea/coffee,apple, muffins. There is a roof garden but its just really a smokers area. Location is superb. Across the street from Chinatown, 10 minutes to the old town, couple of blocks to shopping area, airport bus stops across the street. Supermarket a few minutes away as well as a small shopping centre. No great bars or restaurants in the immediate area Service wasnt too great. Reception were ok but did not go out of their way. Friendly enough and did what was expected of them.One day it was blowing a gale and the courtyard doors were slamming and blowing newspapers every where. Nobody even looked up. Lots of other hotels in Montreal to try and would probably do so. Still has bit of hostel feel to it. So wouldnt give it 4 stars. More luxe 2 star. Nothing major to complain about though.

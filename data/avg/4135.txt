This hotel is in a great location for touring Boston. I traveled with my teenage son to tour Boston. We had a nice stay in a clean room. Close to great dining and all of the freedom trail as well as public transportation. Initially was given an interior room, translucent window into atrium area, requested a change. They gave us another room that had a little bit of a water view. Do not expect expansive water views from this hotel as almost all of the rooms face to the sides of the wharf. Concierge was very busy as only one was on duty all of the times I went to the desk and there was always a wait. For the price I paid I would have expected a little more. Make sure that you make a reservation at Momma Maria for an incredible meal in the north end.

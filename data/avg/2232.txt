The hotel's failure to soundproof the windows against the loud train that runs near the hotel at night is a serious issue. To mitigate the noise, choose a room on the side facing the Strip, on a high floor. Apart from that issue, the Trump is a perfectly nice hotel. The rooms are spacious, attractive, functional and well maintained. Service is friendly and professional. There is no casino, which is a plus or minus depending on your point of view. Room service is prompt and the food is tasty. If they find a way to fix the noise issue, I would certainly recommend the hotel; otherwise probably not.

Just returned from a short jaunt to Boston. We had two rooms located on the 10th floor. The set up of the hotel is odd, but nice. The valet parking ($43) is ridiculous and much more than other hotels located only blocks away. Rooms were nice but very tired looking, exception given to the beds which were extremely comfortable. The furniture and the bathroom are showing their age. Most noticeable was the carpet. This is not, of course,. something to ruin a stay, but noticeable in what's known as a 4 star hotel. Views were great as was the location of the hotel; walking distance to most spots or a quick jaunt on the T. Pool was okay. Small, but fine for a city hotel. Definitely about half the size of the photos. Service was okay. I jokingly asked the woman in "gift shop" what the markup on the gatorade was (@ $4/bottle) and she was extemely vicious in her reply. I truly was just kidding but she apparently didn't think it was funny. We were given connecting king rooms which obviously doesn't work with 2 adults and four children. This took quite some time to get resolved and the front desk person was not too helpful. The concierge was always helpful and gave us pretty good recommendations. The biggest plus is the location. Comparing the hotel to other Hyatt properties, the Boston prpoerty doesn't come close. They really do need to refresh the rooms.

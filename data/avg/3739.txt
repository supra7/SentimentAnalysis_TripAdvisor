We booked online thru the hotel's website and printed the confirmation. But there was no record of it when we showed up. Fortunately there were other rooms available. There is a fee for the internet service. I had called and asked and was told it was free. With a little pushing they did give me a day for free. I was also told there was a shuttle service that would take us anywhere within a 2 mile radius of the hotel. What they didn't tell me over the phone was that it was only until 5pm. The elevators were slow and the stairs closed for a private party. And the valet took us 20 minutes to get our car. The room was spacious, clean and quiet. And the location convenient to our destintation in Dallas. Although not terrible, I would probably try a different hotel next time. I just felt that I had been lied to at this hotel.

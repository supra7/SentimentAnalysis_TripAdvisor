I have stayed here several times over the last few years and believe that the hotel is suffering from the construction work across the street.. It's been in operation for almost 3 years but should be completed by the end of 2009. I loved the hotel when I first started staying there, but it was looking a little rough around the edges on the last stay there so I moved down the street to another hotel on my most recent trip. The carpets could do with replacing, for example. The beds are comfortable, although don't go to the bathroom in the dark if you don't want bruised shins/stubbed toes from the unnessecarily sharp and protruding bed bases. If you want a room with less constuction noise, request one that looks onto 4th Avenue and not Virginia Street. Wifi charge is extra, which in this day and age, is more than a bit cheeky. Trot down to Top Pot on 5th Avenue for choice donuts and free Wifi. Regret to say that some of the front desk staff have always come across as somewhat snooty and arrogant, particulaly one young lady with reddish, straight hair. A polite change request for items in the room due to an allergy is always met with borderline contempt. Crack a smile, lady! Room service from Lola is good, but extremely expensive with the hotel charges. Better to grab it at the bar or take a table. Breakfast and Lunch at Lola is superb, dinner less so. Very nice, knowledgable and efficient wait staff, but I suspect front of house went to the same School of Snoot as Andra front desk. Excellent wine and drinks list, with a very nice happy hour. I might stay there again once the construction is complete, and hope the hotel staff seem a little happier to be there next time, so would still recommend it. There are nicer hotels in Seattle, I have found, so shop around.

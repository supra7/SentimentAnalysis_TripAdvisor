I spent three nights at the Renaissance Hotel in Seattle. The rooms were well supplied. The bed was very comfortable and spacious. I only had two complaints: (1) This hotel is noisy. It is adjacent to Interstate 5 and I had a hard time sleeping at night. For this reason alone, I would probably not stay there unless I could get a room on the western side of the hotel. I heard traffic at all hours of the night. (2) The concierge lounge is way too small for the number of business guests they have. We had very little space to sit down and eat. The concierge staff was very attentive. This is a nice hotel...but I need peace and quiet when I sleep.

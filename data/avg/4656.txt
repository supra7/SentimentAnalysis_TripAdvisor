Nice hotel, good location, shame about management. Decor very nice and clean. Modern feel to hotel. Excellent location. Reception staff helpful Slight problem with hotel not having ironing facilities in rooms but was sorted eventually. After checking out, checked my bank statement to find an extra 17 Euro charge to my credit card. Emailed hotel for an explanation and was told it was for taking a bottle of water and champagne from the mini bar. I explained I did not even open the mini bar let alone take a bottle of champagne so demanded a refund for the 17 Euros. The hotel sent a standard reply about mini bar usage and no refund. So I phoned the hotel twice from London spoke Sergei on reception to further explain, also including the cleaner came into my room just before I left, looked in the mini bar and said "nada". Sergei said it is down to the management to decide upon a refund. I told him due you really think I would ring all the way from London if I did use the mini bar. He agreed I would not. Waited a few more days still no further response. So I emailed the company directors the full story. I received a replying saying "even though we know you took the items from the mini bar we are going to refund the 17 Euros". Then the last part of the email said "We would be pleased if you chose another hotel on your next visit to Barcelona". So the Hotel Catolonia Port are calling me a liar. Great customer service? Eventually received my refund. Shame about the terrible service as the hotel itself is quite nice. But i dont fancy being charged for mini bar usage or being called a liar so will not be returning. Also avoid Club Catwalk who let in a group of white boys but turned away a group of black guys for no reason straight after. But i did see Messi score a hat trick against Valencia at the Nou Camp which made all the hassle worth it.

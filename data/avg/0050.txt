Overall this hotel was good, the rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping also keep the rooms in very good clean condition. The bathrooms are a little dated and the water pressure for the showers... well its pretty low... the staff are friendly and there is free internet within the business room downstairs. Although WIFI is not free. Overall, If honest, after an eight day stay at this hotel I may consider a more recently refurbished, new hotel.... this is not to say our time at this hotel was bad, if anything it was very pleasant, but there are little things here and there that could be improved upon (including a luke warm, bubbless jacuzzi).... Overall I would recommend this hotel, but I think with regards to the price, you can get better accommodation in other hotels.

We stayed at the Palmer House for a Friday and Saturday night after bidding on Priceline. Walking into the lobby you'd think it was a palace. The check-in was efficient. For us the best feature was the location, since we traveled around Chicago on the "L" and the red line stop was literally just outside the door. The room was comfortable (we had an end room) and the staff was friendly. There were some things missing that we have come to hope for, and indeed expect, when using hotels. Chief on our list was the lack of an in-room refrigerator or coffee maker. Our leftovers became waterlogged when we tried to keep them cool in the ice bucket and the bag broke, and having to go downstairs and wait in line for Starbucks is much less convenient (and more expensive) than brewing coffee in your own room. Also the pool was extremely small, the TV was outdated, and the number of elevators servicing our floor was inadequate. Internet was extremely expensive (nearly $20/day). Overall, it's a nice place, and at the price I got on Priceline I certainly can't complain. With that said, if I was choosing my own accommodations instead of naming my own price, I'd be inclined to look for a place with some more modern amenities.

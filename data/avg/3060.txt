Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights recently, the first night - booked through airmiles - the room was tiny and had a view of the internal courtyard and fire escape, as we'd spent most of the day travelling we put up with it. In it's favour the bed was probably the most comfortable I've slept in. We were moved to a larger room for the remaining 3 nights of our stay, which was OK. The location's good for the station, walking around the main tourist locations and getting an open top bus - which was a very useful way of getting our bearings and getting around. Overall a decent hotel but wouldn't recommend the breakfast, which didn't have a lot of variety and as the hotel didn't seem to have a kitchen was a combination of pre-packaged and brought in sundries.

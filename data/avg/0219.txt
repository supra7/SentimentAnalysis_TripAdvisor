We were unfortunate enough to have room 115, a ground floor room with a window looking out on a wall no more than a few feet away covered in someones idea of art or it could have been grafitti. The wall extended way, way, WAY above our room but there was probably a sky up there somewhere. Avoid the rooms that look that way at all costs. We met others who stayed there at the same time and they had a few good things to say about the hotel so we will try not to be too hard on the Marqueen. Breakfast is interesting with only 5-tables available for the entire hotel. So grab your dried muesli and take it back to your room. The hotel describes itself as 'boutique'. Where that came from is anyones guess but there is something oddly quaint about the place. Just make sure you are put in the rooms on the upper floors. One oddity. There is a tiny kitchenette but no kettle, so we aske for one. It arrived promptly but was one that had to to be placed on a cook-top (not an electric kettle). There is no cook-top! We wonder if the management have any idea why their kettles are lasting so long?

Purchased the mocha package. Check-in was smooth with the front desk person telling me about and showing me the bonus of my package yet forgetting to put it in my room key sleeve. Went back down to the front desk and the original person was gone. The next person seemed put out that I was requesting my perk, almost seeming to disbelieve me. However, I did get it. Room is of average quality. Bed sheet had blood on it as did one of the towels in the bathroom. Seemed like the maid had a cut on her finger when she made up the room. Room was on the opposite side of construction and not on Michigan avenue. Room was VERY noisy. I should have gotten a hotel on the El line as that would have been quieter. I am a Select Guest and with that receive the beverages and newspaper in the morning. The hotel must not have enough trays/services to go around as they called me to put it out for them to retrieve. Same thing happened later in the evening after ordering room service. I love staying at Omni Hotels but I dislike this one very much. I feel the quality isn't up to par due to dirty linen, noisiness, and the interruption during my stay to retrieve trays/dishes. I will post a comment on the restuarant but will post that separately on Yelp.

My husband and I just got back from our honeymoon in Hawaii. We stayed on Ohau at the beautiful Hilton Hawaii in the Ali Tower which was amazing! Then we went to Maui to the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for the next 8 days. I wasn't sure what to expect, I've read the reviews before we left and everyone was saying it was nice, but a little out dated. They were right. Our room was an ocean front room, which was nice, but the room was very out dated. I know the hotel really wants to stay in the "old Hawaiian" way, but I believe they need to invest some money into some up dating. The staff was always friendly and the grounds were kept up nice. I guess we were just spoiled coming from the Hawaiian Hilton which was first class all the way. I believe this is a great place and the price is great for a family, but being on our honeymoon we wish we stayed at a little better hotel. We did really enjoy the Tiki Bar! The bartenders were very entertaining and fun! And the drinks were awesome!! If you go anywhere along the beach like to the Hula Grill, and Rusty Harpoon, the food is great, but the drinks are like water....My husband and I could have 5 drinks anywhere else but only a couple at the Tiki Bar! :) So very high ratings for the bartenders! :) Overall, we might come back someday with our family, but when we come just the two of us, I think we'll try another hotel.

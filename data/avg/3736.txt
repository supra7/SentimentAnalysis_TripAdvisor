Maybe our expectations were too high, but we expected a top of the line, swanky downtown hotel. What we got was a hotel with carpet that really needs replacing, scratches all over the paint, a really small, old style t.v., cheap formica countertops and a room that was way too bright in the morning due to the lack of curtains (they had cheap blinds that you get at your corner Home Depot). The Magnolia really needs to invest in this property.

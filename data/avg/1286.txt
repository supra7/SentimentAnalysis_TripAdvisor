Better than expected We stayed here May 21 for one night. We called for the shuttle to pick us up at SEATAC and it arrived within 15 minutes. The check in process was a little slow.The rooms are small, but clean. The Bath and Body Works toiletries were a nice suprise. There was Tulley's coffee in the room. We had a room right next to the entrance door. A little nosey late at night with thoughtless guests who let the outside door slam shut. Breakfast buffet was average. Got us by until lunch. Major renovation going on, will probably be very nice once finished.

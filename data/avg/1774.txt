Good location but be sure to rent a car. Hyatt has Hertz onsite which is very convenient and there is free self parking. Concierge was very helpful for restaurant suggestions away from the tourest trap of Whalers Village, which is walkable. She was also very helpful with explaining the Road to Hana, which we drove. Beautiful scenery on that drive. The Hyatt beach, although right outside your doorstep, is not that great, but if you walk just north of the hotel, to Marriot and Westin, the sand gets better and the beach is wider. The pool gets crowded early and the whole towel card and wristband thing is inconvenient. The hotel is starting to show it's age. I'm sure the hyatt was incredible back in the mid 80's. Our bed was a platform bed and very uncomfortable. If you have a bad back, do not expect good support.

This hotel has a great location and the lobby area is very clean. The thing that put me off was upon entering our room the light (shade and all) next to our bed was dangling off the wall. We called and had that fixed the next day since we arrived at 2am. Also, we needed non feather pillows. It took them 45 min to deliver them. I would've gone down and get them if that was going to be the case. Also, the room just seemed dated and quite honestly not that clean. But I am kind of a clean freak. I would not stay here again as I am sure there are other hotels with a similar location.

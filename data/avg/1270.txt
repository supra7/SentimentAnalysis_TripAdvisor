I have stayed at the Seattle-Airport Hampton quite a few times over the past few years. Check-in after 11pm is ALWAYS a painfully slow process. The man who handles the front desk (Keith?) can't seem to locate a reservation, scan a credit card and get a key handed out in less than 5 minutes (or at least it seems that long). I have seen some improvement over the past 6 months or so but it is still slow. My last two stays I had no acknowledgement of my Diamond status, or welcomed back, or any of the "extras" such as bottled water and cookies. The service does not compare well with other Hilton properties I have stayed at. The property itself is a "standard" Hampton Inn: Clean, comfortable, predictable. The location is on the Airport side of the road and can be noisy if you are on the runway side of the building. The biggest issue is a late check in. Since I am usually just passing through, coming in at 10:30pm and leaving at 5:30 am, any delay has an impact. It will take the shuttle about 15 minutes to reach the airport although the trip to the hotel is just 5 minutes. When you add the length of time it takes to check in after 11pm, it can be 30-40 minutes from curb to bed. The Hilton and the Doubletree are closer and seem to have shuttles more regularly so you may want to check the pricing between the properties and choose accordingly. Both the Hilton and Doubletree have better properties and service but they can, at times, be much more expensive.

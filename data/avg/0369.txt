Whether or not you like the location probably depends on why you're in Seattle. If you're a tourist and without a car, you might not be too happy. I was visiting a company a block a way so it was perfect. I took the light rail in from the airport. It's reasonably fast and convenient, but be prepared for a steep uphill walk to the hotel. If you walk anywhere you'll encounter the hills. If this will be a problem, do not stay here. Every individual I came in contact with was friendly and helpful, from the doorman to the concierge. My corner king room was more of a suite and very pleasant with a nice view and separate temperature control in the living area and sleeping area. The 28th floor fitness center has newer cardio machines and some basic free weights and weight machines. There are multiple restaurants in the hotel, though one isn't open for dinner year-round. My choices were the lobby bar or the 29th floor restaurant. Both have limited menus, and if you want an quick, light, healthy meal, you won't find it. I did find a Subway sandwich shop a couple of blocks away. As others have noted, internet access is $12.95 per day. Mine was free due to my Marriott elite status. But the connection was so slow that I couldn't do some of my online work. I'd have been very upset if I'd been paying for it. Even worse is the incredible sloppiness in attention to detail. One of my room keys didn't work. I didn't get the newspaper I requested. I didn't get my wake up call. Add this to noisy HVAC (hard to sleep through) and cheapness (you only get two cups of coffee, not the customary four) and the overall sense is negative.

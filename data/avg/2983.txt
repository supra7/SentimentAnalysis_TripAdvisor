We stayed with our soccer team for 4 days @ the Holiday Inn. We had a morning training on the beach every day, so the location for that was great, just a 15 min. walk to the beach. The rooms were great and clean. The bathtub was quit slippery, it would be best to do something about that before somebody gets hurt! The service was not that good, since we had to bring our glasses back to the bar to get a new beer in the Hotel Lobby. The lady at the bar was not willing to give us new glasses or to wash the ones we brought back to get a new beer. For a private stay in Barcelona I would take a hotel more in the city center (with a cab it's 8 euros to the city center, which is cheap, but to far to walk) Over all our training camp was a success and with a big group the hotel was fine.

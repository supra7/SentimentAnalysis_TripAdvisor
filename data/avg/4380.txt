Place is lovely, but a series of goof-ups overshawdowed the chic look. One immediate turn off--you cannot get a fresh cup of coffee at the hotel between lunch and dinner service. Also, ordered in-room breakfast and it arrived 30 minutes late. Sadly, had to leave for my first meeting of the day without tasting it...and with out a cup of coffee to get me going. On arrival--at about 2pm--I was told that no food was available because the kitchen is not open during the afternoon. Had been traveling all day and needed some refreshment before an early evening meeting. Because there are no mini-bars in the room, there wasn't even the option to grab a coke or some chips. Had to walk down the road to supermarket and get something there (woman at desk who recommended this was nice and in general the staff was very pleasant). Free glass of wine at 5pm was nice, tho the environment was stiff and surprisingly inelegant given the marketing of the place. Wanted to love this place, but little details--like access to food, coffee and timely room service--are important when you are traveling on business.

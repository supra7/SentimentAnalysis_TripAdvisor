Had a 3 night stay for a sightseeing trip. First impressions were the hotel is small with no central area/lobby. Reception is in a small corner, and what would have been the lobby is a 'Seattle's Best Coffee' shop. Staff were friendly and helpful on arrival. Like others I was offered by the internet booking agency the addition of breakfast for $10 which luckily I declined as it doesn't exist. I experienced one other guest who had prepaid it being told there was no such thing, so beware. The rooms are very small, and a little tired as in worn carpets and old fixtures/fittings. Except the TV which is modern flat screen. However, everything was clean and the bed extremely comfortable. Location is good, a few blocks from almost everything in downtown/Pike Market and Pioneer square. Free wifi too.

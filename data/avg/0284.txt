My husband and I booked a room at the Moore Hotel based on all of the glowing reviews and the amazing price (we paid $89.01 for one night in downtown Seattle). Although the price was great, the room was less than great. Nothing was technically wrong but everything was very very old and smelled very strongly of cleaning supplies even after I opened the windows for several hours. And, I am usually not bothered by "downtown" noise, but the windows must have been incredibly thin because I woke up multiple times due to sirens and other noises even though we were all the way up on the 6th floor. On the other hand...like I said above, the price is hard to beat for downtown Seattle and the location itself is great! We were within walking distance of great restaurants, nightlife, Pike's Market, and the waterfront! So...if you are looking for a nice and relaxing place to stay, the Moore may not be it; but...if you are looking for a cheap (and clean) place with a great location, the Moore is for you. One more thing...parking. The Moore does not have a parking lot or garage so you have one of three options: (1) park on the street after 8/9ish at night for free so long as you wake up and pay the "meter" at 8AM the next morning, (2) get to the hotel before 8/9ish (call and see what time) and park in a garage across the street for $15 for a day a think, or (3) park in one of the many lots around the hotel but pay a lot of money. We ended up parking the car on the street because we got to the hotel too late to park in the cheap garage; then, in the morning (8AM), we moved the car into one of the lots around the hotel for "early bird" parking ($10 for all day).

I always look for a boutique hotel to stay in when I travel. When I first arrived I had to wait over half an hour to just check in. Then when I got to the room it was tiny, once my wife and I put our bags down we had to jump over them to reach the other side of the bed. I called downstairs and asked for a large room, they told me that this was the style and that their was nothing else. I asked to speak to the manager, and was transferred to the voice mail, during the weekend I called back numerous times and never spoke to the manager. I've still never heard back from the manager. I left all my contact details, I guess the manager was to busy to speak to a guest?

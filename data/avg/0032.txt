This hotel was a great deal being under $100.00 a night. There are very few decent downtown hotels at that price point. This hotel is within walking distance to so many restaurants, stores and local attractions such as Pike Place Market and the Space Needle (this one is a bit of a longer walk). There is also a movie theater and small grocery store across the street. Also, there is a restaurant on site. Check in experience was surprisingly good- long wait but front desk agent was super nice! My complaints about the hotel would be the beds and bathroom! The beds were extremely uncomfortable- squeaky and quality that you would find at a MOTEL. The bathroom was super small! The water pressure was low for sink and shower due to them "Going Green". I'm all about going green but I felt like I used more water because the pressure was low. Trying to wash off felt like forever! Guess you get what you pay for!

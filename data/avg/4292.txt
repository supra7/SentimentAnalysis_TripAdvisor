The Hotel Staff were rather blunt and abrupt. We had to look for someone to assist us in getting our gear to our room. The bathrooms really weren't great and the room was so very small. Tha gas / air con unit in the room was really noisey and I should have asked for a move but we could not be asked. There were spurts of noise which was quite frightening throughout the night (no I am not precious). The beds were nice and there was a bit of a view but other than that and the location, I would not return to this hotel again. The staff really put me off. Oh and at afternoon tea we had to wait some considerable time for service. On, exit they gave us this huge telephone bill and when I questioned it, they simply said it was the supplier's rates and not theirs, I don't believe it. I had used the phone for 3 minutes ... I foolishly forgot to take my change from the traveller's cheque I had paid and no mention was made by the assistant either as we gathered our bags. I refused to tip the doorman as he had simply opened the doors for us and the service had been so bad, he shouted at us in the street to top things off. We had tipped graciously throughout our trip but I refuse to tip when the service has been poor. I agree with all of the negative feedback on this hotel and a local even referred to it as "not very good". Addie London

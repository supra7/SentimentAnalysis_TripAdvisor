The Hotel was decent, my room was fairly clean but the top sheet was stained but OK I'll live. Then at 5am the smoke alarm low battery alert when off. When I called downstairs I was asked to disconnect it myself and leave it in the hallway because she was all alone. But she promised to let the Hotel manager know. It's a 17 floor hotel in NY and there is only one person staffed over night!? When i went to check out they couldn't have cared less. All the desk person could do was offer me complimentary breakfast. Which is already included! nah not again

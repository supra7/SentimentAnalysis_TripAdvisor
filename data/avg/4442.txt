My wife and I stayed in a king room on the HHonors floor for two nights, and were not disappointed, but also not impressed.....typical Hilton room, typical Hilton location, typical Hilton service. Clean room, good access to restaurants, subway stop a block away, but nothing special. We stayed for rewards points, but I think I would have been somewhat disappointed if I had paid full price....Boston hotel rooms are very expensive, and for he price, this hotel offers only location. Parking is $41 a night, the rooms are kind of "boring", the bathroom is small, the lobby is lackluster, carpets are old, furniture is '80's modern....just nothing special. Really good: the bed, the continental breakfast (free for HHonors members), and, as I said, the location. Really, really BAD: the television (a primitive satellite system that takes 30 seconds to re-tune eachtime you push channel up/down, pixellating, poor resolution, poor channel reception).....probably the thing I remember most. All in all, an adequate hotel, but not worth more than others in the area (made over 15 trips to the area in the last few years, as my daughter is a BC senior).

I stayed at The Palmer House one night for business. The hotel lobby is magnificent. The ceiling is beautiful (make sure you look up!) and the hotel bar is vibrant. I wish I had time to stop by to have a drink! I had a small room with a queen bed. Just fine. Bathroom was small. Room was clean. Starbucks inside hotel (on Street Level) major plus. The fitness center was awesome. A lot if equipment and spacious. There was even a separate room for yoga and classes, I assume. The surprise was that it cost me $10 to use the fitness room! After I saw my final bill, I vaugely remembered seeing signs to that effect, but I thougt to myself, that fee can't possibly apply to me, a hotel guest. Unreal! I have never heard of a hotel charging guests for use of the fitness center. That is why this hotel gets an "Average" rating. THE NERVE!

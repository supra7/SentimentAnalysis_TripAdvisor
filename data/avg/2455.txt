I used Marriott points for a last minute stay here as I decided to go to a Phillies game. We arrived about 2PM or so and were promptly and pleasantly checked in. I was recognized with my Marriott status, which for this year, I think is only the 2nd time. Got an accessible room with 2 beds as requested. The room was fine and served it's purpose. It wasn't filthy-just little detail things such as a shoe print on the wall, finger prints on the glass over the pictures, and make-up finger prints on the bathroom door. Not gross, but still not nice. I wiped everything with Lysol wipes as usual. Didn't eat in the htotel this time-instead drove about 1-2 miles to a Subway for sandwiches. The A/C actually worked and wasn't overly noisy. TV reception was good, but the game wasn't on so mom couldn't look for me! TVs are NOT HD-not even the newer, big flat screens. Internet (wired only in rooms) is free, but NOT super fast. I had been granted a late checkout by the Operations manager shortly after check in...but no one told the AM crew (and the gal was rather rude until she noticed my status), no one told housekeeping so they knocked on the door, and I specifically asked to get my key extended but it stopped working. That entire situation was very annoying..... The hotel has a 24 hour shuttle and is close to a Ruby Tuesday, as well as offering nightly dinner service (or room service). I asked for a fridge, had to call again, but it did show up. The hotel was quiet-only heard some plane noise and virtually nothing from the hall or the connecting room. (For some reason, most accessible rooms in Marriotts are connecting..) There is security at night, free parking and overall seems to be fairly safe. I would consider staying again, provided they clean up and the few staffers who were NOT nice get their acts together. Fairly easy access to I-95 and there are several other hotels nearby. All in all, if you just want to lay your head someplace, the CY is fine.....

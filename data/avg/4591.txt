Meddusa Hotel - Istanbul centre - Oct 07-Oct 11, 2009. Actually the hotel is not bad for 40Euro in peak season. The worst part is the shower - no curtain no tub - so when you have the shower - everything around is wet including towels and toilet paper. The stuff is rather helpful. The breakfast is very simple: bread, chease, tomatoes, eggs (boiled and fried), jam, grapes, tea, coffee. What else do we need? The open terrace view is terrific. These is a nice restourant next door, just a good place to have you evening beer and kebab. So, if you come to Istanbul just for sightseeing to catch the last simmer days - Meddusa hotel is not bad choice, just not expect too much! Oh, they do love CASH, so they pretend as if their card terminal doesn't operational, be ready and do not check out at last moment when your taxi is waiting for you. But for me, Istanbul is too crouded, too crouded in early October. I like to visit it before Christmas and next time will come here this time of the year. Enjoy Istanbul, it is beautiful place!

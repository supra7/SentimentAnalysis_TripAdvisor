Traveled to Miami in January for business and stayed at the Hilton Downtown because the conference was being held at the same hotel. The good: Excellent Conciere and Valet service and their helpful tips The food was very good both in the restaurant and room service Nice view of the harbor and I was only on the 3rd floor Close to free tram Close to Downtown and Bayside Market area Pool area looked nice but did not use The bad: Room was in a block reserved by the Conference yet when checking in, there was no mention as to where the conference check-in was located and had to search the hotel over to find it. $28/day for valet and $25/day self parking...very expensive Blood stains on pillow cases...contacted front desk about the issue and they reacted like it was a normal thing and would mention it to housekeeping. Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed. Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business. For the money, there are much better hotels in the area. The cost of this hotel should be 1/2 of existing for the value.

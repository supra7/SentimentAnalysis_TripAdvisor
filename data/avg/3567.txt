We had a suite - not cheap. The shower barely worked - no water pressure. Took an half hour to wash shampoo out of my hair in the drip of water. The alarm clock was non-functional. There is a kitchen - but no coffee maker, no plates, cups, spoons - no garbage can. The television in the main bedroom was outdated and poor quality. The robes provided by the hotel were VERY old and needed to be thrown out/replaced. They do have a happy hour in the lounge - with some free wine - which was good because then we had some extra glasses for the room. The soap provided for 3 people to use was 2 smal bars for someone the size of a smurf. The listing stated a king size bed - but it was actually a queen which was a shame as I was sharing with a friend and not a spouse. I would check out and move except I brought my pet as it is pet friendly and with 2 others staying with me - it would now be an huge hassle to relocate. Will not stay here again. With so many great places to stay in Dallas - SKIP this hotel.

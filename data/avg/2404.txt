I stayed for two nights. I made my booking four days in advance, and had a great deal of trouble finding a hotel in Philly which even had a vacancy, so I was glad I could get into the Rodeway. Honestly, for $259 a night, it was pretty steep for what I got. I have seen the other reviews on here talking about the elevator. It was working when I was staying there and I was lucky enough to be on the second floor, so I count my blessings for that. Honestly, the room was acceptable. The TV was working, the bathroom was clean enough. If anything about the room was any less clean, it would have been unacceptable. In the room's favour, it was a great deal larger than most other similar hotels would be. The place is a definite need of rennovations. The window in my room didn't lock and there was no safe in the room and because the window looked out onto a rooftop courtyard area, I didn't like leaving valuables when I went out for the day (but there was not much I could do, as the staff were not so helpful on that one). It's not all bad: the breakfast provided in the dining room was nice and simple. My room was quiet and well insulated from outside noise. The location is fine. It's a 10-15 minute walk to the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall and the major tourist attractions. This is certainly no luxury hotel. If you want the bare basics, this place will suit you. I could recommend this hotel to fit travellers who want to be near the tourist hot spots and can handle stairs. I don't think it would be a great place to stay on the top floor if the elevator isn't working.

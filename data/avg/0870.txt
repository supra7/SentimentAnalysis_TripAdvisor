My family and I stayed at this hotel twice this month. We were able to get good rates via Priceline and, thus, were summarily sent to a lower floor in the South Tower. I was told that there were no upper level rooms. I knew this was a lie but family was too tired for me to push issue at 10pm traveling from east coast. The room (1159) had a significant mold problem. Those with allergies and/or asthma will be impacted. After the first night, we were moved to a higher floor in the North Tower. This tower, I was told, was more recently renovated. I appreciated the hotel moving and putting us in same tower on second stay but this is a problem they need to address or they will drop even lower in ratings for Seattle. Their fix of running ozone air cleaner will not work. The room works for a family of four only if you stay in a king room, use the pullout couch (which they will need to make up for you) and get a roll-away brought into the room. It is tight but workable. Parking is a nightmare in this city. I tried everything to spend less than $30 per day and was unsuccessful.

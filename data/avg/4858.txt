My fiance and I had some appointments in the city, and hhonors points to use, so I convinced him that we should use them at this hotel. My parents had stayed in the past, and it was highly recommended. Check-in was a breeze with the separate area for HHonors, which was great because it felt like there were at least 3-4 wedding parties having pictures in the lobby area. We ended up on the 9th floor, and when we got to the room (the elevators are very slow at times), we found it to be very clean and decorated nicely. There was no view, however, and it didn't have things you'd expect in a hotel of this class (only a single sink in the bathroom, no coffee maker, no mini bar, etc.). When we went to bed, we found the biggest downfall of the hotel -- there is absolutely no soundproofing between the hallway and rooms. When one of the wedding parties hit our floor around 2am, neither one of us were as excited as they seemed to be. Oh, something else curious...the bathroom appeared to share a vent with the room next door, and light came through it all night. Overall, we've been to better places in the city.

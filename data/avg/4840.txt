Not sure even at a discounted on line rate that this hotel was a good value. Lots of tourists and kids, not a good place for a business traveler to stay in the summer. Kids running up and down the hall late into the night. My room was right by the utility room and the maids were chatting loudly in the AM...I could hear almost every word. Self parking was a better deal than at most in town Chicago hotels. I regret not asking to see the room first before checking in as I typically do when checking in; I would have asked for a better location and perhaps on a less family friendly floor.

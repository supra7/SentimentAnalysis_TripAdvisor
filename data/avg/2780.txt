It is what you expect from holiday inn.The room was big enough for all 5 of us breakfast was good continental as stated.Area was busy but very accessable with hire car.Parking available under hotel at extra cost but worth it...The lifts were small, breakfast room tiny with not enough seating.However pool was great for splashing around in kids loved it after busy day.Staff were very helpful it did not help that they were laying fresh carpet in hall way at night but it had to be done at some point.As stated easy to walk to attraction of the walk of fame there were quite a few tramps lying around in the area but we still walked at night with the children for something to eat so you just have to be a little wary.It was a good base for us to visit LA and somewhere to crash.The toilet was a little on the small size but you just have to get on with it.... I would book again if needed in the future. We had a small kitchen area but never used it as we were out and about for meals it seemed ok.

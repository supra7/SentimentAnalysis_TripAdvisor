the beach wasn't great, and was public access and quite crowded. the room wasn't 5-star-clean, but it wasn't terrible. the shower didn't get hot; just lukewarm. but i got the 3 bedroom suite by switching a timeshare, and the value for money was satisfactory. the pool kind of sucks (only 3.5 ft deep), but there is a good wet-playground for the kiddies. the restaurant is understaffed (waited over an hour for breakfast one day)... but the adjacent town of boqueron is oozing with charm-- fresh oyster carts line the street, dance clubs open at night, most of the tourists are puerto ricans from other parts of the island, there are AMAZING beaches a short drive away (by the lighthouse), there is fishing, scuba diving, etc. don't expect a 5 star hotel and you'll be satisfied. it's more like renting an average apartment for a while... it's not terrible, but it's not great.

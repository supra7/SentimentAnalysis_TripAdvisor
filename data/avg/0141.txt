Good clean comfortable hotel. Staff are helpful and friendly. We booked via Hotwire and were rather shocked to see parking at $40 per night (once taxes included) and wi-fi at $10 per day. Lesson learned on Hotwire there. Only complaint with the hotel was the noisy rooms. We thought the air conditioning was stuck on, so had the engineer up to our room to check (the guy came quickly, even though it was midnight). We were told that the noise was coming from the wind gushing past the vent, it wasn't air conditioning at all, and the noise couldn't be stopped. Every room is like that! Thankfully we had ear plugs, there was no way we were going to sleep with that noise. Have never been in a hotel like that. Sadly would not go back to this hotel for this reason.

I stayed in the Palmer House Hilton for 4 nights on business. When I made my reservation I specifically requested a room away from all the banging and drilling, which I didn't get...I was one floor above it. But as I was up early every morning it didn't effect my sleep too much. My room was big and clean, and the cleaning staff did a great job cleaning my room every day. No complaints there. I found the concierge (male) extremely helpful on all times I needed his help. He even recommended a great little nail bar around the corner from the hotel. I had a drink in the lobby one night, the atmosphere was good, but it's very dark and I've been in much nicer places so couldn't really see what all the hype was about! The service wasn't great and I was given my bill before I asked for it. I wasn't happy about that. I'd no issue with checking out. My bill was in order and all I had to do was call a number and I was checked out automatically. If I was going on a holiday I wouldn't stay here, but it was fine for business.

The room was huge - easily fitting two teenage boys and me. Flat screen TV, fabulous bathroom - modern and clean as a whistle. BUT the construction zone that surrounds it is a pain at the moment. Our room, with insulating windows was at the front of the hotel and at 0630 the trucks started arriving and then it was on for the rest of the day. Subway is close by, and around the corner 9as directed by the reception staff) is a super cheap genuine german pub style restaurant that we all enjoyed enormously. In 12 months, when all the noise is gone, it will be far more appealing.

To be fair, this hotel is asthetically beautiful. Large, grand with cooling colors of blue. Eco friendly and the food is "farm to fork" so everything is superbly fresh. I just didnt like the snobby attitude that is expressed by the staff. There is a fee for wireless internet, so that was a downside. Even the cheapest of motels and fast food restaurants offer this. The rooms do not have blinds, only thin fabric curtains, which may make some feel uncomfortable and others can look down or up into your room. I loved how the sheets and towels are replaced at your discretion. They typically dont change the sheets until every 4 days to save energy, but turn down service is available upon request. Overall, my experience wasnt as fabulous as I expected--lot of delays, misinformation and bad attitude. I just think that it wasnt the type of hotel suited for us. A little too stuffy for a romantic stay that we had planned..

Travelling to singapore is always specail, its a fast city & work gets done faster than you think ..Crowne plaza is just is the right place to get your work done smarter as well (besides being only faster, specailly if your work is spread in & around Changi area) ..Being a ariport hotel, I was admit that you have to compromise a little on the sleep quality but rest connectivity, service & feel is awesome .. I personally prefer to have food in foodcourts while out on a business trip & hotel has good options connected in the airport area. Also you save a lot on traveling time & hassle .

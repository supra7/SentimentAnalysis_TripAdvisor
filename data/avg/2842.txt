The only thing excellent in this hotel is the location. Its just seconds away from the Ramblas. Rooms are adequately sized, but beds are terribly worn out and sagging. Bathrooms are nice and modern. The noise level can be distracting as people were going to and fro in the street, but hey its the Rambla area and its Spain! Breakfast is OK but if you are this near to La Boqueria, there is no excuse not to have fabulous breakfast or meals for that matter! I would probably stay here again given the chance.

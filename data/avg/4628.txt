We booked our hotel online, reserved and confirmed a King Deluxe room. We've stayed at this hotel before and know that these rooms are quite nice. Greeted with a smile by desk clerk, who handed us keys. When we got to the room, it was very small with one queen bed. Went back to front desk, spoke to a different clerk who told us there were no king deluxe rooms available. No explanation or apology for why we were not told that the room we'd reserved was unavailable upon initial check in. He offered us free breakfast if we'd just stay in the standard queen at the same price for the king we'd reserved. Meanwhile, I was eavesdropping on the conversation the first clerk was having with another guest, who wanted a room change due to loud AC unit. She offered to show this guest a different KING SIZE room which was available at the other end of the hall from her original room. Clerk said he might have a king for us, but would have to check with his manager. We asked him to please check, but suddently he simply produced a set of keys to a deluxe king room. This was a nice room, but it was a handicapped room. No mention of this fact by the desk clerk. Did he think perhaps we wouldn't notice? The shower has no lip or edge, the water simply drains into the middle of the bathroom floor. I prefer a tub and shower, but was not inclined to complain until I realized that we had been given only two towels. Yes, two. If I need to wipe up the bathroom floor after using the shower, then I need more towels. Bottom line, we felt we had not been dealt with fairly. Honesty really is the best policy. If the clerk had explained when we first checked in that there were no king deluxe rooms, offered an apology plus a discount to the going rate for the room they wanted us to take, we wouldn't have been so annoyed. This is classic bait and switch, which feels out of character for the Fairmont Copley. We spoke to a manager who did apologize and offer a free stay in the future.

We stayed in this hotel for two nights and then returned for one more night before leaving Seattle. We had a king size room and it was actually a very large room, but the bathrooms were very small both times. The sink was so tiny the second time with no room to put any toiletries anywhere. Overall the room was clean and had a nice bed and flat-screen TV. There is also some road noise from the street. The parking was $19 a night with in and out privileges. Good location.

No facilities in the room for tea or coffee and restaurant in hotel very expensive, needed to get dressed up to go and have a coffee. Sounds like a small thing but after a day of walking walking walking, all we wanted to do was relax with a cup of tea/coffee in our room, not go out again. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very polite. Walking distance to the train station, but difficult to find out this information. The hotel should have had more information on transport and tourist info available would have been helpful.

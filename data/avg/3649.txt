Stayed one night in Feb 2012 on business. Arrived at about 6pm. Check in was quick and uneventful. Had a room on the 14th Floor with a nice view. Room was of a good size, the furnishings nice and comfortable. Wifi access cost $9.95 per day. Was feeling rather tired after a long flight so decided to eat in the restaurant. Big mistake. The service is really very very poor and slow. Ordered a drink and this didn't come. I had to remind the waiter about it. Ordered a steak and waited ages for it. Looked around and everyone was waiting for their food too. The waiters were no where to be seen. They would disappear out of sight leaving us with no service for long periods. It was as if the waiters were helping out in the kitchen??? Where else would they have gone? When the food eventually did come, it was cold. Had it been ready for some time just waiting for someone to bring it out? Will never eat there again. Poor service, very slow, cold food, expensive too. Experience in the restaurant affected my opinion of the hotel in general.

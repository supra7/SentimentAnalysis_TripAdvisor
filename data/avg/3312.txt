when we arrived at the blue square hotel i was pleased it looked clean and tidy, but we did arrive at night it was a different story in the day time very dirty looking even the area was untidy. we went to book in the hotel lobby was clean and tidy staff was polite, we when to are room and the room was really nice, you are also by a river and that did smell and in the mornings ur woken to duck and swans the other problem we had with this brake was that it's to far from the town center and it's easy to get lost if ur not sure of the tram system we did get lost and that was scary the tram that goes in to Dam Square is number 14 tram and they are every 10 to 15 min be carefull thow the tram's are expencive u need to buy a pass that can last ur trip and any newsagents do this. i do reconmend that if ur not worryed about going to the town then ur fine but if u want the night life then get closer to the town center it's just to far there is a good resturant/ bar called tottoncarmoon not far from the hotel but that's the only good resturant there but is expencive so enjoy ur trip

We choose this place largely because of the large selection of activities included in the price of the all inculsive, from sailing to snorkeling in cenotes, to kayaking. It really did deliver in these area. The staff who conducted the activites were really great, especially Maya. We also really liked the beach beds. Very relaxing. The waiting service was not very good on the beach, but there also weren't any bathrooms even remotely close to the beach so you had to hike back to the main hotel area for those anyhow. The mixed drinks were terrible. Created for people who are going to drink 17 margaritas in one day (very low alcohol) and kids who like huge amounts of sugar in their drinks. I suspect they were putting water in their alcohol bc I have never had 4 drinks and not felt even buzzed in my life. The water at part of the beach, as others mentioned, is not very swimable. However, there is an area towards the north end of the beach where you can swim where the centoe empties into the ocean. Is very clear and nice and cool. This part of the beach is really beautiful. The rooms are nice. Clean, modern, comfortable. The double shower was awesome, about 4 feet by 3.5 feet., nice tavertine. The spa is also very nice. Be sure you know ahead of time whats included in your package bc they will not bring it up if you don't. We were supposed to have special honeymoon wine and cheese. We never brought it up bc we didn't care, but they didn't mention it either. And proving that we had a free rental car included in our package was a bit of a headache. The food is mediocre with a couple real stand out dishes. I will eat just about anything, but I expect a lot from restaurants. The coconut ice cream is good:) Bring bug spray and maybe water shoes. Tulum was really cool.

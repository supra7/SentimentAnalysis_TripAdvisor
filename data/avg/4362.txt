The hotel is super cute and modern. Beds were really comfortable. Great bars in the hotel. The location right in Copley Square can't be beat. But the room was almost comically tiny! Definitely the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in before. I kept tripping over the leg of the desk chair which was just a few inches from the bed. The bathroom was very small and awkward. I'm 5'3" and the space was tight, not sure how taller people even sit on the toilet! Overnight parking is $43/night which is ridiculous, even for Boston. Save your money and park in one of the buildings about a block away for $8-$9 overnight. Lucky I got a decent deal on Priceline for this hotel!

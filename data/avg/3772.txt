I arrived at midnight and was told valet parking was full. Then instructed to walk around and find a meter, at midnight, in downtown Dallas as a single female. I walked to a meter only to find in bright letters "2 hour limit, Meters Effective 7 Days a Week" not to mention that parking at a meter was $.25 per ten minutes. Even if I had that many quarters on me, my car would be towed unless I moved it every two hours all night long. There is a single, small surface lot adjacent to the hotel with a pay box but it too was full with only two empty spaces marked "reserverd". After much more discussion, the staff managed to find a spot for my car considering my special circumstances, but buyer beware that if you arrive late you may end up parking far, far away and walking by yourself in the middle of the night. I was told that the nearest parking lot with available spots at that hour was Union Station. The staff (nor the owners) cannot control the parking situation in downtown, but I feel it is only ethical to warn potential clients of the situation I found myself in. I was ready to walk away and lose my money rather than venture out alone a third time in search of parking. Not to mention that if I had accepted the hotel at its word and simply parked at a meter I would have had the chance of being towed for staying there 10 plus hours. Apparently at one point the meters were not effective on weekends so this was what they suggested to guests regularly. If you have no car to worry about (arrive via taxi, etc) then I can wholeheartedly reccomend this hotel. The room was very comfortable and clean, the staff was kind and polite throughout, and the hotel itself was appealing and quiet. All basic amenities, including fitness room and continental breakfast and delightful toiletries were provided. I will only stay again if I fly into Dallas sadly.

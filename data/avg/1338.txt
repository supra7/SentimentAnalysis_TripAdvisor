The area surrounding most USA airports is dominated by chain motels, parking facilities, rental car lots, and chain restaurants. Hiway 99 as it goes by Sea-Tac Airport is no exception. Lots of free enterprise to ensure good value; but not much uniqueness, charm, culture, or nightlife. If staying in this area, your best bet is to choose a place with the amenities you require that has the best price. Our price was $70 per night grand total. The staff was polite and professional. The room was quiet, clean, and fully stocked. It featured full bath, air-conditioning, clock radio, phone, TV (65 channels), coffee maker, mini-fridge, microwave, hair dryer, and in-room clothes iron. Free amenities included parking, airport shuttle, hot breakfast, local phone calls, and wireless internet access. On-site was a laundry room. Nearby were fast food places and convenience stores. One problem with a hiway filled with nothing but chain motels is that it is difficult to notice a place that is not right on the hiway. This motel is only a block from Hiway 99, but we missed it the first time we drove by. Don't repeat our mistake and not have the exact address of the place, as you might miss it in the boring sameness of the chains. Nothing magical about the place, but also nothing bad. If this place has the best price for your stay of a couple nights, you may as well choose it.

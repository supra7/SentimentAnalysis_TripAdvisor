I just recently discovered Tripadvisor and decided I should share our experience at El Dorado Maroma even though we went way back in October. There are so many good reviews on this resort so I guess we just had some bad luck during our stay. First of all I know this resort is known for giving guests the relaxed and away from everything type of vacation but there was like NEVER anything to do. Maybe because of the time of year that we went, but we would show up for their scheduled activities and there wouldn't be anyone there, even employees. But then when we did go on an excursion or try to rent out snorkel gear the other few 20 or 30 people staying there were doing the same thing so it took forever. We never even got to use the snorkeling gear bc it was always checked out and they never put our name on a list or anything to use it. The beach was pretty but not as pretty as other beaches we've been to such as Jamaica, Grand Cayman, or the Dominican Republic. I saved the worst part of our experience for last, we had bed bugs in our room and didn't realize it until we came back home and found one in our luggage. Every morning we would wake up with several small itchy bites on us but just figured it was mosquitos. Thankfully we debugged all of our luggage as soon as we realized what we had brought back with us from mexico so they didn't infest our home. We called the resort and explained that the room had bed bugs and the employee just giggled, I guess she had never heard of them and thought it was a joke. So, I asked to speak with the manager and she said they would have him call me back and took my phone number, but we never heard from anyone. It was a pretty bad experience for us, and if that deal with the bed bugs didn't occur I would say it was a pretty nice place.

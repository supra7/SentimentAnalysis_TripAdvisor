Not just another convention center hotel, the Magnolia is in an older, interesting building that once housed an oil company. The rooms are quiet, comfortable and clean, with very spacious bathrooms. The furnishings aren't the newest and some of the paint needs updating, but in general it has a pleasant feel. Flat screen tv in the rooms and a decent breakfast buffet with hot foods help. I had no luck in getting a wireless signal in my room and so had to go out in the hall with my laptop to connect. The elevators are old, funky, and slow. Free beer and wine and cookies every night establishes a friendly feeling. There are ample free internet terminals available for guests. The gym facility is ok, although the spa was undergoing renovation when I was there. There is a nice steamroom, though.

The interior of the lobby is nice. I like the restaurant behind the reception area, they serve good and affordable dishes. The rooms are quite small. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the nearest metro station. The breakfast is just like any ordinary continental breakfast nothing fancy mostly bread and fruits. When we transferred to another IHG property during our stay last January we forgot one of our luggage at the concierge. The bag wasn't labeled and we were able to retrieve it after 3 days. Thanks for their great staff

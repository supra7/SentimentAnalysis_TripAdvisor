The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with directing the group of us to the main sights of Berlin. They made sure that we knew which direction to head in. The room was small and cozy, beds were very comfortable. There was also a safe in the room. Bathroom was a little of on the smaller side, definitely a one person bathroom! Location was on the former east side of Berlin and therefore the price was a little cheaper and it was still within walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie, Berlin Wall, and the numerous other sites. Breakfast was not included but is well worth the extra cost. Had the best variety that I've seen at a hotel in Europe. Walking back to the hotel at night was also alright. Make sure you eat in the main city center of Berlin because there was not much for food around the hotel in the evening.

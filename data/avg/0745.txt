My husband and I stayed at the Edgewater for one night and were wowed by the beauty of this hotel. The scenery is amazing and our room was wonderful (despite the fireplace only working intermittently). That said, I'm not sure if I would stay at the Edgewater again. When we checked in, there was a line of 3 or 4 people and one not-very-helpful employee who kept disappearing. The situation when we checked out was similar. We asked the employee if we could store our bags for the day and after saying yes, he left the counter and did not return. We had to get back in line and appeal to a different person to assist us. But, by far the most egregious example of poor service is the fact that although the fire alarm went off twice during the night (scaring us to death and forcing us to quickly dress and try to find an exit with each occurrence- the second time, a maintenance man said that it was a false alarm) there was no apology or explanation when we checked out. Another guest standing next to us when checking out mentioned the 4 am fire alarms to an employee but the employee laughed it off and said, "Wasn't that something!" When I spend a decent amount of money to stay in a hotel and have my sleep interrupted twice during the night by a faulty alarm (or otherwise) I would like a mention of it and an apology. For this reason, I will not frequent the Edgewater Hotel again.

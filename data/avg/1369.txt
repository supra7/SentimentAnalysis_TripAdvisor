We stayed at the Hilton last week. I got a great priceline deal- $60.00 out the door. The location was really close to the airport and they have a free shuttle. The room was okay, not as great as I was expecting for a Hilton. The Wi-fi in the lobby was spotty. We had an unlucky view of the garbage cans which was gross. Also, some kind of vehicle in their parking lot kept backing up all night so we heard the beeping of the reverse gear most of the night. If you can get a cheap price, it is a perfectly fine place to stay (safe, clean) but if you are looking for luxury I would go elsewhere.

Partial Ocean view room is worth the extra $. View of gardens & beach lovely. Gardens & facilities are great. Room average. Noise from rooms next door & above travels & makes it hard to sleep if guests are moving around in the night. Coffee pot not cleaned & floor could do with a good vacuum in certain areas. Bathroom small but rest of room generous. Hotel restaurants offer good quality food & location is great. Service ranged from excellent to below average depending on staff. Overall hotel appears to be best option in Kaanapali.

Hotel Max has gotten a lot of poor ratings. My experience did not match those. Service was excellent and the hotel did have artistic flare and sexappeal. Their restaurant food is excellent. The biggest issue I have is with the bathrooms, which are the size of an airplane's. The sink is so small that you can't wash your face without soaking your feet. The toilet is located two inches from the wall. Worst of all, there was a huge 10 inch step up into the bathroom. The other problem I had was with reservations. I made a reservation for four nights, but then found a special on their website that included parking and breakfast (after reading TripAdvisor reviews). The special was only available for the first two nights of my stay; I called reservations to confirm the new booking for the first two nights and retain only the last two nights of my first reservation. Of course when I checked in they had no reservation for the last two nights. The hotel was "completely sold-out" (someone in the hospitality industry can tell me what that means). The clerk could not get the manager to find us a room, but she did call other hotels until she found something. The positive outcome was that the other hotel was more comfortable.

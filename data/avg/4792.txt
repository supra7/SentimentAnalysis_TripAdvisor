The palmer house was not what we expected at all. The room was small which is to be expected of an older hotel in Chicago and the fact that there was basic cable and a tv from the early 90's was not even a problem either. I think what was the problem was the lack of service, no mini bar in the room and the old outdated bathrooms. The tile was cracked and dirty, the sink cabinet was old and all dinged up the toilet was tiny and everything was so outdated. Even if space is limited there are ways to update the bathroom and room to feel more comfortable. The fitness center is not complimentary and neither is a crib thank goodness we brought our pack and play. I guess free wi-fi is not standard in most hotels but the Palmer really over charges on everything and anything they can.The room was ok it was fairly clean but the carpets looked old and dirty. The view was of a brick wall and the "L" to the left. It was nice because we were able to walk out the hotel door to the Thanksgiving parade but I would not select this hotel again. We frequently visit Chicago and this will not be on our list of places to stay. Good location though.

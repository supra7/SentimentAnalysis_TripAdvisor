The beach of course is beautiful outside the hotel, the grounds were nicely kept but I think most all of the hotels in Hawaii are. The employees were very friendly but my goodness they need to renovate that thing. Just seems dirty and old. My husband and I cant figure out why its the #6 pick on the Lahaina Hotel list.

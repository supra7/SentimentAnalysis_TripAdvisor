The hotel is centrally located which allowed us to walk most everywhere we wanted to go. However, it was very noisy with noise coming from both inside and outside of the hotel. The "balcony" on our room was barely 18 inches wide. You could stand on it if you wanted to but why would you bother. There was no hot water for a late morning shower either day we were there.

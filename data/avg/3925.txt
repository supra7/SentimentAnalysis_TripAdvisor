nice ideas but realised on the cheap/ sloppy cleaning. used plastic cups on the reception desk , carpet in hallways, entry and elevator is vey dirty. Minimal mattress cover sheets, no bedside table lamps. Common areas, entry and elevatator are unkempt and ate clearly not ckeaned on a regular basis. This is the first impression when you walk in. Looks nice on the pictures, shiny at first glance, but the attention to detail, lack of adequate staff training, using professional vacuum cleaners that have good filters and do not project the dust back into the room need to be adressed urgently. Otherwise call yourself a youth hostel !!

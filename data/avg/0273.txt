The hotel is in a great location only two blocks from the farmers market. Lots of buses run nearbuy aswell so its easy to get around. The hotel itself is a little dated in its decor. We had a european style room which meant the bathroom was shared however there is only one bathroom and toilet for the whole floor (im unsure how many rooms are european style). It would have been nice to be given a bath robe for going to and from the bathroom and any other hotels we stayed in provided these. Overall though it was a nice hotel in a good location.

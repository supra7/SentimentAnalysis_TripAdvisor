Helpful & courteous staff. Bed was very comfortable but bathroom had a lack of shelves or counters on which to put cosmetics, etc. On request, we immediately received a refrigerator. Air conditioner in room was old; could not get nightime temp. below 72 degrees. We got a great rate from 1800hotel but they never paid the hotel even though our credit card was debited. We heard they went out of business. We still are unable to reach a live person when we call them. When we checked out the hotel mgr.was still trying to resove it. He was very good about the whole mess. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat.

Why is it that the top tier hotels in a chain provide less quality than those in the value segment when they charge about $50 per night more? I couldn't get my favourite Hilton Garden Inn 10 E Grand Ave. Chicago, so had to settle for the Palmer House. Yes it's a glamourous hotel, but the bathroom is very small (unless you're a short supermodel) and the internet is not included in the room rate. So I had to forgo the internet because I refuse to pay extra when it should be included. The king size bed was extremely comfortable as were the pillows. I was here on business, so it was a perfect location only 2 blocks from the office. There are some very fine eateries nearby. I had breakfast the first morning in the lobby restaurant. The continental buffet is good value for the price ($13) but I don't know why they can't provide you with self service beverages. One needs to wait for interminably slow wait staff. Make sure you have exact cash or charge it to your room. So if you want to have a good breakfast and get on your way, go to the Corner Bakery on the corner of Monroe and Wabash. Noise is a bit of a problem. I was not directly facing the "L", but I could hear the trains. I could also hear my next door neighbours talking, and they weren't talking loudly. Overall the hotel is fine in a pinch, but if you like Hilton properties, you get better value at the Hilton Garden Inn on Grand Ave.

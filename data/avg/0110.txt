The simple fact is the hotel's location is simply unbeatable.. a mere stone's throw away from Pike Market. Plenty of great restaurants to go to and it is generally a fun area to be in. That is if you are a tourist. However, the quality of the hotel itself is only so-so. This is not a place for business travellers. I might be a bit hard on them especially since I just returned from a trip to HK where I stayed at the Conrad HK and Wynn Macau. Compared to those the Inn feels like motel 6. Issues: 1. There is no desks in the rooms to place your laptops on. Even if you have wireless internet, there is no place to work on but your bed. 2. Furniture and coverings are worned and just outdated. 3. Room 409 is a city view room. The last room they had for that date. Avoid at all cost because its window sits right above the bus stop. They claim that the windows are double paned but I could hear the buses' roaring engines. I had to sleep with ear plugs which they had at the front desk. 4. The AC is a standalone unit attached to the wall. This is not part of a central system. The standalone unit made quite a bit of noise. It looks cheap and tacky too. 5. There is no business center. Only a fax machine located in the basement of the hotel. For the price you pay you are paying for the location only. The staff are extremely friendly though. Folks should check out the fried doughnuts at the Dhalia Lounge.

Stayed for a week in this "luxury" resort....I use the term "luxury" loosely for the following reasons: #1-guest does not have to choice but to swelter in the rooms, as the AC cannot be turned down below 70 degrees....#2-towels for the pool area were not available until after 10 am....#3-floor in our room was not swept for three days-gross!...#4-no ice machine, needed to get it from the pool bar, which was not always open....#5-no place to sit and watch tv in the room except on the bed.....#6-and what was the $24 per day resort fee for? there is no beach-no entertainment

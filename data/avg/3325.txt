If you are into futuristic design this could be the place for you as it was for me. Outside and inside is designed with gusto of a modern James Bond movie. So stylish and a bit tacky at the same time. The bad thing though is that they also seem to have implemented the cool welcome James Bond gets from his enemies. So in the sterile environment very little staff or movement is to be seen. As for the location issues the other advisors here mention. We didn't see the streetwalkers on our way to the Ramblas, and alas, in Barcelona as a tourist chances to get confronted with muggers are almost as high as not getting mugged, regardless the area. I once got robbed twice in three days in Barcelona in totally different locations, but yet love the city.

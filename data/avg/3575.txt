Have always loved staying here and have multiple times, however, our last visit infer 2012 left my daughter with bedbug bites!!! She had them on her arms, neck, face and legs! We did get moved at 3am the first night when she found them, however, since being home I have spent money at the doctors, for cream, medicine and I had to throw out a suitcase and duffle bag! Lots of money and embarrassment we endured!

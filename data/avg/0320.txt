The hotel is clean, and the location is right across the street from the library and within walking distance of Pike's Market. There is a Seattle's Best in the hotel, and other hotels on either corner for more substantial meals. It's an old hotel with 8 floors and only 2 elevators. Shortly after we arrived and were assigned our room on the 8th floor, both elevators broke. The desk clerk reassigned us to a larger room on the 2nd floor since we had to take the stairs to our room, and the bell captain was great helping us move our luggage. All in all, we were pleased with the hotel for the price. One tip, DON'T TAKE THEIR SHUTTLE. It costs twice as much as a taxi ($16 to the wharf for 2), and you have to go with them to drop off other passengers at their destination. A taxi is only $8, and takes you directly there.

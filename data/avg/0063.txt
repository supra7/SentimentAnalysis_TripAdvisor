My wife, 6 year old daughter stayed one night on our way to Victoria BC. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was fine but a little outdated. We had a great view of the Space Needle from our room and all of downtown was just a short walk from the front door. Staff was helpful and friendly. I would stay there again.

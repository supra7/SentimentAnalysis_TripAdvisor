Came here for a short stay and booked a room because of the great location. It's in the LES so it's near all the great restaurants, bars etc. But, I found the staff to be lacking. When we first arrived no one helped us with our bags they just watched me drag my bags through the front door. When I called earlier to confirm some information I found the front desk attendant to be a bit clueless. I think it's because it was a new hotel at the time and was going through some "growing pains." The room was TINY but to be expected in New York. And, I could hear the street noise. This was again all expected because it's Downtown NYC!!

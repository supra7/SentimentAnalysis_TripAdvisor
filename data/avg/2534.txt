I stayed in this Travelodge, with my partner for New year's Eve. We were basically pleased with the service, but it was spoiled in the restaurant, by obviously very watered down orange juice, but mostly by a television blaring out football for all of our meal. In spite of what we are led to believe, not everyone in this country worships at the shrines of this phoney idol. Certainly, not many of those in the restaurant seemed interested. One more complaint, why is it so difficult to send an email of complaint directly to Travelodge, which is why I am making my complaint here. Don't they want to know what there customers are dissatisfied with? Andy Kent

All the other reviews here were helpful. It's a great location. The staff is amazing. It is difficult to find, but that makes it nice since you get away from the crowds. The woman who manages this place is exceptionally wonderful. However - Here's the deal. The owner essentially bought an entire floor in an otherwise residential building. It's kind of nice, right? The thing is, it's not really meant to have a lobby area - the receptionist sits at a desk in the small hallway outside the rooms on the right of the entrance. I really wish we would have had a room down the left-side of the hallway, but our room was right-most room. Right outside our door was the reception, computer/desk and kitchen. Which is all crammed into a corner at the end of the hallway since it's really just a floor of a residence, right? So at first we were thrilled, until we got in our room and closed the door. You can hear EVERY THING and I mean everything. So we were jet lagged and desperately needed to sleep and it's 2am and I can hear the guy on call outside in the hallway typing. And you can tell he's trying to be so quiet. And then we layed awake and all of the sudden it's 6am and they're out there getting breakfast ready in the closet that is the kitchen... and they're trying so hard to be quiet... which is so frustrating! If they would just do their thing and not worry, but they're trying to be quiet just makes it worse cause we can even hear them whispering! AGHGGHG! First night in Rome and I'm thinking about what I'm going to write on TripAdvisor! Second night in Rome and I'm ready to stab my ears. Jeez. Wish someone would have told us to get a room as far away from the kitchen area as possible.

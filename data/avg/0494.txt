We stayed at this hotel for 3 days, at the suite on the fifth floor. We have a good view of the Space Needle from the room balcony. The suite is clean; the kitchen is convenient for the children. The location of the hotel is convenient to go everywhere in downtown Seattle. The hotel is a 3 stars, so it's decent, nothing fancy. It's good and convenient for the price.

Best Nobel is located in a lane in old Istanbul it is easy walking distance to the sights and sounds of the old capital. Because of congestion our taxi driver dropped us off, or should I say threw us out? And gave us incomprehensible directions to the hotel. We got there about half an hour later in the rabbit warren of lanes. It turned out we were always near to it. Staff were quite pleasant and accodating but the hotel is a little tacky. We booked a non-smoking room but were first given a room which stank of smoke. They readilly changed us to another room in which the a/c was filthy and smelled up the room when turned on. We turned it off and opened the window. Our room was on the top floor but the elevator ended at the floor below. It was a struggle with the luggage. Breakfast was great every morning with a wide variety to choose from. Numerous restaurants and street cafes are everywhere around the hotel and tourists wander around the streets till the early morning hours. When we were leaving the hotel arranged a shuttle, for a fee, to the airport. This was a great help.

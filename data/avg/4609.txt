All together the Fairmont Copley Plaza is a good hotel. It benefits from being in a beautiful historic building in a fantastic location. The staff, when around, are friendly and helpful, just don't hang around waiting for them to open the front door. The hotel is not cheap, but does offer rooms to those looking to pay a bit above average without breaking the budget. One note of caution would be that not every room within a room description (e.g. Deluxe) meets the advertised standards. Parking is not cheap, but is practically placed for visiting the city and you won't need to get the car out to get around once you're there. The room was decently sized with a nice bathroom and comfortable bed. The only drawback was the extremely loud air conditioning, which sounded like someone was driving a motorbike around inside in the room in the middle of the night

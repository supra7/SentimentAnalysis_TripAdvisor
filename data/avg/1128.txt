In what used to be the Vance Hotel, Hotel Max occupies a great location in Downtown Seattle, within walking distance to most everything, and 2 blocks from the light rail station to the airport. The hotel boasts unique artwork throughout the common places, and life size photographs adorn the doors to the guest rooms. The beds are very comfy, and depending on where you room is located, either you will have a very quiet room, in the back off the street) or a very noisy room, (in front on the street). The rooms feature very large flat screen t.v.'s, bathrobes and the usual bathroom supplies. Unfortunately the cons outweigh the positives. Due to the hotel's age, the rooms are quirky and small. The hot water for the shower seemed very limited during peak times, and never got past lukewarm. Room service prices were very high for the quailty of the mediocre food. (Bagel, lox and coffee $32). Room service trays remained in the room even after housekeeping cleaned. In fact trays littered the our floor of the hotel for about 20 hours until they were eventually picked up. Parking at $30 per day was very high, since the lot right next door was half the price. The window a/c and heater was very loud and close to the bed, which made conversations or watching t.v. difficult. I just think the artsy, modern theme just doesnt work well with this old, quirky hotel.

We stayed in the Executive Suites and found the staff to be very helpful and pleasent. However, the rest of the staff were not so helpful and friendly. When we arrived we were given a ticket from the Valet to park our car. When we checked out and gave the valet our ticket to retreive our car, we were told that we had the wrong ticket and that he could not help us. He also accused us of not paying for the parking (which was clearly charged to our bill). He sent us to the basement to get our car. Another instance involved a question about the wireless service and was treated (by a man at the Hilton Honors desk) like we were idiots. We have stayed at the Palmer House many times and NEVER have we had been treated this poorly. It was clear that the only staff that made us feel welcomed was on the Executive Floors. How sad.

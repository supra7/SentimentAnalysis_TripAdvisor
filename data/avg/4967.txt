Stayed one night Sat. July 19, 08 via Hotwire - $120 altogether, good price for downtown Chicago. Never seen such a busy hotel! Lines for check-in at 5pm, lobby and lobby bar full of people milling about; even out on sidewalk in front of hotel, people loading and unloading from cars and taxis. Pleasant desk receptionist. Allocated room 431 - HUGE! 15' x 25' (yes! I paced it out:):) By contrast, bathroom is SMALL, but functional. Looked as if room and bathroom were "halfway" modernised in a kind of art-deco yucky green! Interior room overlooking fire-escape and buildings, so no street noise - just inconsiderate guests in hallway at 3 am! Comfortable beds, toiletries provided. For price paid was ok - of course, drinks at lobby bar were usual downtown Chicago prices! (i.e...expensive). AC worked fine.

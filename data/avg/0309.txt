My bf and I stayed for two nights in July 2011. We booked online and got a decent rate for a Deluxe King with wine reception. We were able to drop off our bags at 10am and park the car in the parkade. Upon our check in around 4 pm we discovered that there is no such thing as a "wine reception". They haven't started that program yet!!! False advertising...... Not that it's a huge deal, but c'mon...take it off the website. The room was pretty small, but really....we were only there to sleep. The bathroom was slightly larger than a medium closet. And there was no fan. Which is bizzarre. Maybe this is why a lot of the reviewers complain about the musty smell. Thanks to TA we brought a scented candle :) The bed was comfortable. Room temperature was perfect. We were supposed to have free wifi in the room, but alas.....there was no signal in the room. In the stairwell there was perfect reception, but not the room. In the morning i was able to pick up the Kimpton's signal from across the street. We complained three times about it. Apparently they rebooted the server, but that obviously didn't work. We had an iPad, iPhone and Blackberry...none of them were getting the hotel's signal. Not terribly impressed about that. But again...we were only there to sleep. But don't advertise things you don't have. The location was perfect. Close to Pike Place, the waterfront, the Ferries...... I would stay again, but only if I got a really good deal.

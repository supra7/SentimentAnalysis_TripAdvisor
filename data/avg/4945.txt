Staying at this hotel was a step in the right direction compared with my previous visit at a youth hostel! I was initially given a double room when I have paid a king sized room but they did not have any as it was just after Christmas so told me that I would have to move into the king sized room the next day. The double room was comfortable and cosy compared with the king sized room, which was massive. It occupied a corner of the building so I received light from two sides of my room. The air conditioner was freezing! I tried to adjust it, but it became either too warm or too cold so 1st January was spend nursing a cold! I ate in the restaurant next to the lobby on 1st, as I didn't think there was anything open locally. There was a good choice of food, ranging from fresh fruit, cooked breakfast, breads, cereals but was pretty pricy compared with going to the diner next door. At the check-out, I only had to pay for the water and as it was a small amount I wanted to pay cash and checked with the receptionist if I would be charged on my credit card, but she said no. So I paid cash and when I received my credit card statement at the end of the month, I found that I've already been charged for the water! So make sure that doesn't happen to you! All in all, it was a lovely place to stay, as I usually stay in youth hostels or with friends, so it was a major treat to be staying in a place of this calibre. But if I was visiting Chicago again, I think I'll stay somewhere uptown, as its closer to the shops and other sights.

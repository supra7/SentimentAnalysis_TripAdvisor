We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton for 3 nights in January 2007 as part of a 2 week holiday also visiting NY, Dallas & Vegas. The best feature of the Palmer House is the foyer which, as you can see from any photos used for advertising, is extremely grand. This gives, I feel, an inaccurate picture of what you expect the rest of the hotel to be like - 5 star, but that it ain't! It's not that its dirty or the staff are rude but the rooms are average & the decor is too & the staff service is OK but in no way, shape or form do they go above & beyond for you. I also had to pay an extra fee to use the gym facilities. Pretty much a standard hotel & service but charged out as if it were luxury. We won't be staying here again as I'm sure there are many other Chicago hotels that offer better value for money.

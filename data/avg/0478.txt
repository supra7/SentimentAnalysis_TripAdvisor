I read the reviews of this hotel carefully. I realized full well what type of lodging it was. I did not want to pay for a four star hotel in Seattle. Priceline rates were going for way more than I was willing to pay. I decided to give this place a try and I was not disappointed at all. We found the check in staff very friendly and efficienct, although they didn't seem that familiar with the area and couldn't answer several of our questions. Our room and bathroom were very basic, but VERY clean. The room did have a cleaning solution odor, which bothered me a little. I do have asthma and was worried it would be triggered by the smell. However, we ran the fan so it drew in outdoor air, and it turned out to be just fine. I also left a note for housekeeping to please not use any deodorizing sprays for day 2. The odor decreased significantly. Breakfast was typically 2-3 star hotel breakfast. Nothing to write home about, but adequate to start your day. We were most grateful for the free parking. We thought the location was perfect. We ate at several local restaurants that were frequented by the locals. It was not a far walk to downtown. We liked that it was much quieter around than the downtown area. We would definitely stay here again. However, as mentioned by another reviewer, you have high standards for your lodging and like 4 star hotels, this is probably not the place for you. If, however, you are just looking for a friendly hotel with a clean room and free parking, you will likely be satisfied.

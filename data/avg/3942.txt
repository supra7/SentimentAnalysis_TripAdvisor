We booked a "renovated bathroom" room at the Royalton recently. It was tiny. (The corner of the bed met the corner on the bathroom, so you had to climb across the bed to get to half of the room.) However, it was very clean, room service came by every single day to give us towels, and everything in the room worked. We had a small fridge that worked better than the front desk said it would (they cautioned that it may take a long time to cool down but it worked fine for us) The renovated bathroom was decent, very clean and it looks brand new. Although the website led me to believe the bath was a full tub, it turned out to just be a shower stall. There is a Boardwalk clothing store downstairs, and if you are quiet you can hear the techno music playing from inside the room, but it is not excessive and it was turned off/down by 11. Upon check-in, we were given coupons to the ice cream shop that is also downstairs (Sweet Surrender, on the boardwalk) This hotel is also directly beside the famous Julia's Cannoli and Pizza Boy shops which is an added bonus if you like either of these No, there is not an in-room phone or alarm clock, but then again there wasn't a nightstand beside the bed either. The bed squeaked if you jumped on it/threw heavy objects on it (such as suitcases) but using common sense, any bed would make noise to an extent. Parrot Lagoon owns this hotel as well as the place on 9th, so the pool at 9th street was open to us. We never made it to the pool, since we had the entire Boardwalk right in front of us. It's not a place I would recommend if you want to sit inside, as there really isn't much room to do anything...But as a place to sleep and bathe, it was just fine.

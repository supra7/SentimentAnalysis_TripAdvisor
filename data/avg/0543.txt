You can expect the usual from this four star hotel. I was disappointed that free WiFi is available only in the lobby, where you will see most every seat occupied with guests on their laptops. In-room WiFi is $10.95 for 24 hours. One would think a hotel of this caliber would provide free WiFi in the guest rooms - every three star hotel i've stayed at in Washington, Oregon and California does that. We got a great deal on Hotwire; $78/nite on the weekend, but i would not want to pay much more than that. Parking is $28/nite a half block away ($41 if you use the valet service), so the extra expenses can add up pretty substantially.

My first visit to Singapore and being there for work, the Windsor in terms of location was convenient and cost effective. It reminded me very much of a UK Travelodge style offer, no frills but generally clean and comfortable. I found all the staff to be helpful, even when the coach trips arrived (and there were lots of those) and the place was full. Not the place to stay if you are looking for character and/or somewhere to chill out after a day of sight seeing. Room safes were being fitted as i was there, and my iron and ironing board was efficiently delivered and left for my duration of the stay. I also managed to have an early check in and late check outs to fit around my flights with no hassle whatsover and the loan of the hotel umbrella's was great (still didnt stop the frizz tho!). I only had breakfast in the cafe and stuck to toast, coffee and melon as i still cannot face a full chinese meal for breakfast. I laughed when i read the review below, having stubbed my toes in the bathroom, every single time i went in there.... i didnt learn and it does hurt, so be warned! All areas non smoking, but my room did smell suspiciously of smoke and suprisingly no complimentary water. I was assured the water was safe to drink, by the cafe staff who were genuinely puzzled by my request for a bottled water. The garage next door proved to be useful to buy water and other odds and ends. As for taxi's, i always got the hotel to book them for me, there was a small surcharge, but i was happier with that than flagging one down outside on the busy road. All in all, ok, for a work trip or as a base only.

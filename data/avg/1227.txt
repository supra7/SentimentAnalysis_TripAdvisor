My friend and I are both Hilton Honors members. We are currently staying here and prepaid for the room. What they didn't tell us when booking on the website is that the parking is $16 per night and the internet in the rooms is not wireless. On the incoming leg earlier, we stayed across the street at the Hampton for about the same price, wireless internet, free parking and free breakfast. Just doesn't make sense. Overall, the room is nice, but could have a refrigerator in it for the price. One thing I have learned about traveling is that to bring your own router just in case there isn't wireless. Especially when more than one person in the room has a computer. If I come back to Seattle, I'd go back to Hampton.

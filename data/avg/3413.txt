I regularly (once a month) stay at this hotel as our company keeps us there. I don't know what is with the reception staff but I haven't once got a warm welcome at the hotel. The reception staff are almost rude... The rooms are large and really nice though. The hotel is at the airport so it has 2 disadvantages.. its a bit of a travel to the city and also the trains stop by 11pm so then u have to take a cab. second due to the aircraft taking off and landing the rooms are a bit noisy especially the ones on the outside.. the inner rooms are a bit better. there are much better options at the city.. stay here only if u have to..

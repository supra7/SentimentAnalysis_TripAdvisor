The location is very good, so close to Pike Place Market. However, it was loud if you stay in a room facing the street. We were on 7th floor and still could hear loud noises from the street throughout the night. Not only that, you can hear your neighbor's TV so the wall must be really thin. The room was okay, quite roomy and clean.

We were originally booked at the sister hotel, Fjord Lindemann but due to their overbooking ended up at this hotel. Although rooms were not available upon arrival they held our luggage for later check-in. Hotel is located somewhat far away from Potsdamer Platz but is located on U and S-bahn stops (Bulowstrasse) Hotel was modern, recently built. Well appointed with phone, tv (2-english channels), and necessary amenities. I would rate higher if the consolation of having to move farther out of the city was more than a bottle of sparkling cider/wine and breakfast instead. Surrounding neighborhood may not be as comfortable to walk in at night as during the day.

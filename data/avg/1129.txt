We're locals and have put out-of-town visitors up at this hotel because it's reasonably priced and has a good location, so we decided to do have "staycation" there ourselves. The room quite small, but clean and the bed was very comfortable. We'd asked for a quiet room, but our room was far from it, and given the location of the hotel and the position of the rooms, not sure how quiet any of the rooms could be. Also, the hotel appears to draw a younger crowd (or weekend crowd?), and after last call, the rooms around us got pretty noisy. If you're old, like us, and want to stay some place clean and reasonable during the week, Hotel Max would be fine. But on the weekend, you might want to find someplace else.

The hotel is located in an excellent location. It's literally one block away from the Art Institute and Michigan Avenue, a 5-10 minute walk from Millennium Park, and a 15-20 minute walk to the main shopping and restaurants of the Magnificent Mile. There is a Starbucks in the hotel itself and many nice coffee shops and restaurants located nearby. It is also very close to the main metro and bus lines, so it's easy to get around downtown Chicago. The hotel staff was also very helpful. The room itself was like any other Hilton, nothing that spectacular. However, I do wish that there was more seating in the room, as there was only a desk chair and the beds to sit on. There are some minor problems with this hotel though... As other posters have mentioned before, there is no wifi in the rooms or in the lobby (we inquired about access in the lobby but were told that it wasn't available to us). Many hotels have free wireless access these days, so I found this very odd, especially in a hotel where there are many business travellers. There is, however, wired internet access in each room, but that means you can't use your iPad or other wireless devices. Another thing to keep in mind is the close location to the "L." Although convenient, we heard trains rush by throughout the night even though we were on the 20th floor. So, if you're a light sleeper, make sure to request a room on the other side of the building! Overall, the Palmer House is a decent hotel in a great location with some minor flaws.

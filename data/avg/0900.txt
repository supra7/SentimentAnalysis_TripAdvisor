This Westin hotel is located close to the Monorail Station and Westlake Center, a short walk from Pike Place. Its a good location in a city that's easy to get around. The room was spacious with superb bed and well-equipped. However, the decor was slightly dated and the whole feel of the hotel was rather disappointing. The lifts, lobby, corridors, and restaurant all need freshening up. Breakfast was average, with a slightly disappointingly small choice at the buffet, and rather pushy staff overly trying to persuade customers to choose the expensive a-la-carte options. I expected more for my money.

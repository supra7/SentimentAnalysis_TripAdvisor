Centrally located this place is perfect if you're not carborn and/or want to live downtown Seattle with close proximity to the waterfront. Best value for monthly stays. Rooms (queen bed, one person) are new and clean, furniture OK. Kitchenette has everything. Good storage room for both shoes, clothes and bags. Big and nice desk and LCD TV that's not in the way. Staff is friendly and efficient, front desk open 24 hours which feels safe. Could be better: affordable parking options, internet these days should be complimentary and wireless (they have a business centre but that's SO not attractive), mirror (one in bathroom only), noise reduction from the street (thin windows), cooling options (no airconditioning, hot in summer!) Area is a local neighbourhood, pretty tourist-free. Lots of good places for wining and dining at resonable cost. Some streets are less attractive and easily avioded. Perfect for young or solo travellers looking for long-term stays downtown.

First off...Parrot Key is a beautiful resort but I was disappointed in a lot of things. EVERY night we had to park at Walgreens and walk to our room which was all the way at the other end. Extremely disappointed that you couldn't bring your own beverages to the pool...YOU MUST buy from Cafe Blue! It's the keys....come on!! Oh and the kitchen or lack there of was not good! We could barely fit a half gallon of milk in the fridge and at it's max temp...was not very cold! This was our honeymoon and we wish it could have been a little better The cleaning staff was very nice and did a wonderful job! The sunset was beautiful from our room.

Things I really liked: - Perfect location. Just a block from shopping and 1 mile from the stadiums. - Great staff. Parking valet and reception staff were friendly and quick to provide good service. - Free wifi if you join Kimpton Intouch. Joining is free and you get perks like said free wifi, $10 towards mini bar snack, your choice of paper in the morning, and choice of pillows. - Charming and unique atmosphere. - Dog friendly - Amazing down pillows - Leopard print terry robes. - In room safe - Efforts in being eco-friendly Things I didn't like: - Mattress was awfully uncomfortable. I'm sure not all rooms were like this (in fact, I've stayed here before and the bed wasn't like this). It was lumpy and there were big dips from being overslept on. - Every time someone in a neighboring room closed the door, the whole room would shake and it was so loud. - Shower liner was stained with black mold and mildew. -Small tub/shower Tips: -Join Kimpton Intouch - Ask for a corner room if possible. It's much larger.

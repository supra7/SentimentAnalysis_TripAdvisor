I stayed here for one night when I couldn't extend my stay at the Westin Copley Place. I thought it would be nice to try a hotel in a different part of the city. The service was adequate but the hotel itself is dark and old and in desperate need of a renovation. The decor is outdated and the furniture needed replacing. On the upside the room was clean and had a comfortable bed. There are better 4-star properties in Boston. Maybe I would consider staying here if the hotel is updated.

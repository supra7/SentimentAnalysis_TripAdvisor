Its a very good hotel, but I dont think that It worth the fifth star. I also had a bad experiance with the check out. When i checked in, and I leave a debit card in case of incidentals that I dont usually use because there machine didnt want to accept my other credit card, I told to the front desk lady that I didnt want to pay with this card, they told me that It was ok, she only took a preauthorisation, that was ok for me. And in the last day, I receive a text message from my bank saying that they charge me for the stay, I was very upset because they use some money that I wasnt ready to use in this moment, they told me that It was nothing to do in the check out. Note: If you want to go to the Strip, you have to take a Shuttle or walk for a not very nice area If i go to Vegas again I would not choose this hotel again, and I woulnt recommend it.

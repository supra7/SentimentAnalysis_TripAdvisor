The hotel is a beautiful historic property, with lots of quirky aspects, some good, some not. Room was fine. Good location. Nice meeting space - if a little dated. Had 2 bathrooms for one person - which was fun. Biggest complaint? No coffee pot in the room! Please, who doesn't have in-room coffee anymore. It's a decision maker for me. Staff was nice - had to move rooms and they were very accommodating.

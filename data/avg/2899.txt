Like another reviewer said, "It's a hotel" Nothing special. The rooms are kind of tucked together at weird angles so it felt like you were entering a closet to get to your room. We had two rooms and all four keys to those rooms stopped working at the same time. The front desk person, instead of apologizing and just reactivating our keys, immediately placed the blame on us saying we kept the keys too close to our cell phones or credit cards. One problem with that is that one of the keys had never left the dresser except to verify that the keys weren't working. You never blame the customer with your first reply.. Some Customer Service training is certainly in order.. This was a one time trip to Chicago but if by chance we do return we probably wouldn't stay here again. Too many better choices close by..

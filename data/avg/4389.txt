To be fair, I got a double through Priceline for $99, plus taxes etc., so for the money, I got a much better hotel, nicer amenities than I would have paying full price elsewhere. Front desk help was extremely pleasant and helpful when presented with a tired traveler made crankier by the extra 15 minute drive resulting from the combo of poor GPS instructions and the hotel's weird, hard-to-access, easy-to-miss location. The room itself was fine--personally, I'd prefer a bigger bedroom and smaller living room--with a view of the river (nice) and rail yards (not so much). Very comfortable beds with crisp sheets, pleasant if uninspired room, slightly shabby around the edges but clean. What bugged me, however, were things like the unavoidable (if you're driving) $35/night charge for parking--there is nowhere close that you could even try for street parking--and other money-grubbing details like $15 for WiFi. Otherwise, no real complaints--it just, all in all, felt serviceable, bland, a little greedy, and lacking anything special to make me want to come back. I know Boston hotels are expensive, but what with parking and WiFi costs, no breakfast included, the distance from neighborhoods and the T, I wound up wishing I had gone with a B & B more in the heart of things.

Been to many Secrets this one is overpriced for what you get. Besides the beach everything else is ordinary. Staff were slow and one guy got drunk everyday from his bartender friend and made a fool of himself. My boyfriend didn't complain but if you are a woman that has high expectations, wait a few years for this resort to work out the kinks

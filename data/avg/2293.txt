I stayed for 4 nights with a friend and it is really nice. We had a nice room with a patio overlooking the river and sand-nice. The only downside is no restaurant, room service or what you may be use to in a resort. It is a personal 'bug' of mine-they only change the bed linens every 4 days so you have to call each day and request if you want them changed daily. Drives me nuts:) We did the 1.5 hour island jet ski tour-that was fun and pricey but worth the money. So, if you are looking for a nice boutique place to stay-this is good-just know you won't have the extras.

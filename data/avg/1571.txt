This Hotel was very clean. The two issuesthe first was I was told I could get a adjoining rooms and was told they had none! I was traveling with grandchilderen so that made that not only dangerous but a real issue.The second issue I had was when I tried before I came to book a addtional night (which was on the same day I booked the first night)and was told that the price of my first night would increase over a $100.00! That made no sense to me and after a very long hold we decide to skip it totally and just stay the one night. The price for one night stay on a thurs included breakfast at $124.00. This was a great price...although there was new cooks in the kitchen and breakfast took forever. The poor single waitress was overwhelmed and unable to handle the crowd of people. They need to wake up and get her some help. The pancakes where rock hard like they had been reheated. The coffee and juice was out. (the waitress was in charge of that too impossible for her with all she had to do).As far as the rooms in the beds they where clean and comfortable and quiet. The pool area was wonderful and my grandchildren enjoyed the heated pool. The gym was just great! The hotel in c lose to Inner Harbor walking distance from the aquarium. I would stay again but suggested the Hotel get a little better control of there pricing.and more staff during breakfast.

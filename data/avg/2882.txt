The shuttle driver and front desk staff were very efficient and friendly. The hotel is a bit rundown and shabby looking but once in the room it seemed safe. The room was small but clean. My main concern is that the area is super rundown with a shuttered fast-food restaurant next door. There was a Hampton inn and Marriott next door, both fenced in. Without a car it doesn't seem like a safe area to grab a bite to eat.

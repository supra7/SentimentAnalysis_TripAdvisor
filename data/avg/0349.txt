Here it is- the definitive evidence to illustrate how small the rooms are at The Executive Hotel- see pics The bathroom does not hold my personal travel trophy for tiny but it is small and if you are pressed for time then while you are on the 'throne' you could soak your feet at the same time. The room is small too but fine for two people. I only bristle at the $196.00 price per night when I glance up and see huge cracks that cut across the length of the ceiling as well as water stains and peeling paint. My prayer before falling asleep- Oh Lord please may there not be an earthquake tonight!

Your first staff impression is the front desk in any hotel. Put unpolished inexperienced people behind registration and your brand is tarnished. Having stayed at Ws mostly in New York, I might be expecting more for service. The reception area was staff with 20 somethings who were obviously not trained in customer service. When I asked, "Could you provide the name of a couple unique Seattle restaurants in the area?", I received a list of chain restaurants including The Capital Grille and Chipolte. I walked over to the Fairmont hotel (which the front desk never heard of) and asked them. They gave me a nice list of restaurants and offerred to make the reservation for me even though they knew I was staying at the W. W Hotels are known for placing more value on their lobby space than their rooms, so I was surprised this lobby was ho hum and the rooms standard W fare. The gym was standard, bit cramped and not well ventilated. There was a morning line for the cardio machines.

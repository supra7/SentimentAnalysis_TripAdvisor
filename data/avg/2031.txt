We like: Cleanliness - it was wonderful. Rooms are cleared every day as well towels are changed daily. Staff - helpful and very friendly. Location ~250metres from Rebibbia metro station - very good if you are going to centre of Rome. We didn't like: Breakfast - it is called "CONTINENTAL" - that wasn't continental breakfast. It consisted from - cerial, milk, bread, jam and coffe/tea. And it was always the same! It is awfull if you are staying more than one night. 3* - it's NOT a 3* hotel. There are no windows in rooms - only glass doors. Air conditioner - doesn't work properly. It's always too hot.

If you are looking for a cheap place to sleep in London then this place is great providing you do not expect anything special. The staff are helpful and friendly and will take the time of day to speak to you. We booked this place 2 months in advance so we could have somewhere to stay after watching the England V Andorra match at Wembley so as to eliminate the need to try to travel back the same night. Unfortunatly the tube workers were on strike when we went so we had to take the car. This hotel is fine for that as they do have secure free carparking at the back of the hotel whis is a big plus point for London. The room was of a good size and so was the bathroom. The early flatpack furniture was however well past its sell by date. There has been subsidence in the area as the floor is not very level. The whole place could do with being painted as there are large water stains on the celing and walls. The basic breakfast was perfectly ok as were the tea and coffee in the rooms. We did have a good stay there though and we would go back.

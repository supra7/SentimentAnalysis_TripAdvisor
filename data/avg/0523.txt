This hotel is a nice average hotel to stay in. They mention on their website that they have done all of these upgrades, and that is true, but they must have upgraded from okay to nice. We found a rate of $131.00 for the room and thought that it was reasonable for the type of room you get. The staff seems friendly, the location is great as it is within walking distance of everything. We stayed on the club floor and it has breakfast included. I am a SPG gold member and I am suppose to get a complimentary upgrade but it wasn't available. When I asked about paying for one, it magically was available. (Rolls eyes). The breakfast and evening appies were okay. For the extra $15.00, I would say that it was worth it for two. The bathrooms are small. If you are staying to get ready to go out, then this would not be a great option for more than one person per room. Also, the towels were so old that when I was drying, one of them ripped apart it was so thin. If you are looking for middle of the road, this is a great place with a good rate.

We spent 5 nights at this sprawling hotel adjacent to SEATAC Airport in Seattle. There were 600 at our convention. We were often crowded in narrow passage ways, where it was hard for other hotel guests to pass by. We had opted for an upgraded room with a view of Mt. Ranier, but our 3rd floor view was blocked by tall evergreens. A staff member informed us that we needed to be on the 9th floor & higher in order to see Mt. Ranier. She kindly took off the upgrade charges on our room. The food served at our final banquet was disappointingly cold and bland. There's nothing quite like gravy that is like jelly. There was free wi-fi near the lobby & pool. There were lots of folks staying there as a jumping off spot for their Princess Cruise to Alaska. The corridors near the pool were incredibly cold & uncomfortable to walk through. The front desk staff seemed sincere and caring while one of the hotel managers helping with our conference seemed to be more pompous than helpful.

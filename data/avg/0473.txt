A good value in a very convenient location to downtown attractions. We walked daily to the Convention Center and had a latte enroute each morning. The rooms are very small and the heating/air conditioning is loud. Our room was on the second floor and the floor was freezing. The free breakfast is far above average. The staff were very friendly.

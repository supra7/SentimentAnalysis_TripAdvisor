Helpful and friendly staff. Defintiely feel you get your monies worth with the hotel. It is not very expensive, and yet very clean and tidy. Disapointed as requested a double room but it was two single beds put together. Also, it does state that you have sky tv in your room but forgets to mention that all the channels are in Italian! However, nevertheless, when you are in Rome we are sure you will not find the time to watch tv and will be out there enjoying the sites! Therefore, its not a bad deal. Would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere cheap, clean, and close to all main metro links enabling you to do as you please x

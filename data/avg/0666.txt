Was up in Seattle for business and stayed at the Hotel Andra for 2 nights. I think that while it is not a 3-star hotel, it is also not quite a 4-hotel. I would say that this hotel lies in the "3.5-star" range. First of all, I think that the boutique concept has been lost. The hotel room is no more comfortable or contain more finesse than other similar priced hotels in cities. In fact, there are a few things about the room (minibar quality, bed frame, coffee table, shower) that are sub-par. I think that a Boutique hotel should also provide warm service and a personal touch. While the service was in no way bad, the staff at Hotel Andra did not fulfill that criterion. In addition, I was confused as to how this hotel can be good for business travelers without free-WIFI, complimentary in-room broadband, and complimentary use of computers and printers. Overall a nice hotel to stay in with a great restaurant below, but may be slightly over-hyped.

For an affordable, uncomplicated and comfortable stay in central Philly, this place can't be beat. Just a few blocks from the Convention Center and the Market East station, where trains to and from the airport stop; near excellent dining and shopping; and steps away from the bars, clubs, and restaurants of the gay district. As a guest here you can use the excellent 12th Street gym, just around the corner. The continental breakfast is completely adequate.

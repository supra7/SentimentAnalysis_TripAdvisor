I was led to believe that the W was a very luxurious hotel. Well it isn't in my opinion. The carpet could have been a lot cleaner, the towels small and worn out( not the thick towels that other hotels of this price range normally offer) and overall the whole place was just a let down. Won't be returning. I'll stick with the smaller boutique hotels that actually give something for the money.

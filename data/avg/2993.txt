We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for two nights. It cost about 35 Euros from the Barcelona airport. We had booked it thinking it would be very close to the port in which our cruise was leaving from, but that was not the case, and the port we left from was far away. (At least 40 euros!) It's a nice hotel, clean, modern, with a nice English proficient staff. The lobby even offers 15 minute free internet browsing, which was nice. The breakfast included was mediocre....the coffee was hideous and the food left us feeling slightly ill with mailaise. The neighborhood was not the best....we would not feel comfortable at night walking around. However, lots of neat cafes and a supermarket are closeby.

Stayed here for two nights on business as I am a big fan of the hotel's designer, A. Tihany. Design of the lobby and rooms was chic and sophisticated. Restaurant in the lobby is a Charlie Palmer and very much enjoyed the breakfast, lunch and dinner I had. Everything about the hotel was great until I tried to sleep. The feather pillows were absolutely horrible and I MAYBE got 4 hours sleep. Next day I asked for foam pillows and they weren't much better. If you can bring your own pillows, stay here. If not, beware!!! John NYC

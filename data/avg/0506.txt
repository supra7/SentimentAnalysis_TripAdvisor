We spent two nights at The Quality Inn Suites before heading north toward the San Juan Islands. I chose it because it was close to Seattle Center. Our stay was pleasant, nothing fantastic. We had the King Select Suite 2. The pool was nice and the breakfast was good but the rest of the hotel was mediocre. We could tell that they did a lot of renovations to the bathrooms which was nice but the jacuzzi handle was broken so I had to call maintenance. The beds were old and a bit saggy but I could tell they were trying to keep things updated. Just not quite there yet. The hilarity was when we were ready to check out and we realized our 2-year old son had locked himself in the bedroom. He was fine (finally allowed to do what he wanted to do without us telling him no) but I think it took maintenance longer to come unlock the door than it did for them to come fix the tub handle. But, that might be b/c I was more anxious about getting the door open than having a nice bath. All in all, I probably would not stay here again. If I had gotten the room at a cheaper rate, perhaps, but not at the full price.

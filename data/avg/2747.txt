Booked the hotel because it offered a good price for a NY hotel, the room was clean, bed - the best we've ever slept on, air conditioning , cable TV, LAN internet connection (which I could not configure with my laptop) but basic - small wardroad, no safe, minibar or even a luggage stand. The staff was terrific, very helpful & even let me use their computer to check my gmail. Also reccomended a great Chinese restaurant. There is a freight elevator which can take your bags to the reception on the second floor otherwise it is a longish walk along the still empty ground floor & down a few steps. Though trains pass the Brooklyn Bridge all the time, noise was not an issue as the double glazing was very efficient. The hotel is in Chinatown & the chinese not the touristy part of Chinatown, almost all the shops & signs are in Chinese catering to the locals many of them do not speak English or do not bother to answer, at night everything is closed with black nylon bags of garbage dotting the pavement. The neighborhood is safe but not pleasant. Subway is a 6-8 minutes from the hotel and the F line runs along 6th Av.

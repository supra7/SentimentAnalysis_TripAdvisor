My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here. We are locals, and the Edgewater has been a fav location over the years. I found a room in our budget (Cityview), which was around $150. It ended up being the smallest hotel room in which I've stayed in a very long time. It was beautifully decorated, and the bathroom was filled with beautiful design. The bed wasn't very comfortable and the service was slow. Had to call a couple of times to find out when our requested service would be arriving (i.e. technician to fix our fireplace and in room breakfast). Both were very late, and we really would have appreciated a call to let us know. If we had known the tech was coming from home, we would have said don't worry about it. While sometimes communicating can mean a person deciding not to use your service, it can also show them that you haven't forgotten them. The Edgewater is in a beautiful location, and many of the rooms are beautiful, so I still give it a thumbs up. But just know you will have to pay quite a bit more to get a more spacious room if you desire it.

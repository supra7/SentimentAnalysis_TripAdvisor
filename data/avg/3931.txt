I will start off with saying you can't beat the location for the price. The rooms were great with a kitchenette and a decent TV and fantastic view of Old Montreal. The only issues I had with the hotel were: One, there were dirty dishes still in the sink and a duster on the floor when we arrived in the room. Two the cleaning staff just walked in without knocking and then just stood there as if waiting for us to leave. Aside from the cleaning ladies that were rude, the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay there again, but check that the room has been cleaned an leave your 'do not disturb' sign on at all times if you want privacy.

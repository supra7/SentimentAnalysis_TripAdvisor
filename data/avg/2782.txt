I chose this hotel because it was rated an eight for location, the rooms and service.This is an #8 for the whole Los Angeles. Taught me that I can't really trust trip advisor reviewers either. It's a run down hotel and a little bit better than Day's Inn. The location isn't so great by the way. It's still about 2 blocks from hollywood blvd. So when you're with toddlers and the hot sun behind your back, that's not easy. I also got a 2 bed executive suite with kitchenette. OMG! the kitchenette was a cabinet. At least in the picture they showed on the site, there was a counter with 3-4 cabinets. Well ours was just 1 cabinet, so just enough for the tiny sink...more like a bar sink and no other place to put your stuff. by the way the 2 bed executive suite is just a room with 2 beds and a sofa bed. no walls separating the beds from the sofabed and kitchenette. Their free wi-fi also didn't work. That's the caution when they say free. We're on a road trip all around California so we've got BUGGAGE for 5. There's no bell service when we checked out. I had to bring the cart myself up to the room... lift and put the luggages on the cart, roll the cart to the elevator and bring it to our car. Not so great for an 8.

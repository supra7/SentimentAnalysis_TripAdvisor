I pass through Seatte, either for business or vacation, several times per year and I use Priceline if I need a room close to Sea-Tac Airport. A $35 bid for a 3-star room in the Sea-Tac hotel zone will often get you into the Doubletree. By the time Priceline adds on taxes and fees, the cost goes up to $47. Because of my flight schedules, I merely use the Doubletree for sleeping. I arrive at night and then catch an early flight the next morning. Therefore I can't comment on the hotel's public amenities; I never use them. This Hilton-managed, chain hotel is almost certainly the largest in Sea-Tac. It has hundreds of rooms, some of which can be quite a hike from the lobby. Be aware of that if you have a lot of luggage. Once you get to your room, however, it will probably be reasonably clean and reasonably quiet (except when school groups or conventioneers have filled the place). The matresses are reasonably comfortable and the linens are of reasonable quality. The free shuttles to and from the airport operate with reasonable efficiency. The warm cookie the desk clerk gives you at check-in is a nice touch. Nevertheless, there is nothng remarkable about this hotel. It could be on any airport strip in any mid-size city in North America. Across the street from the Doubletree is one of the locally-owned "Roasters" bar and grill restaurants. It is a good place for a beer (lots of drafts on tap) and some roast chicken or a burger and fries. For more upscale dining, check out the 13 Coins. That restaurant is on the same side of the street as the Doubletree and about two blocks north. The food there is good, but a dinner for two will probably cost you more than the room at the Doubletree.

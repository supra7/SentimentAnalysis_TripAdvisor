If only it were not for the beds!! They were awful - I have gone almost a full decade w/o lower back pains - they returned in one night after sleeping on the most awful beds I have ever encountered! My parents also stayed at the hotel and complained about the beds as well. We had rooms with two double beds. The beds were sleep number numbers beds - first night me and my husband tried one bed - changing the numbers all around - did not help. Felt like we were camping on our air mattress! The second night I had one bed he had the other - not any better. Third night we tried the other bed together - bad bad bad! Other than that it was just fine! I did enjoy the fabulous water pressure in the shower. It is directly across the street from the airport and a 10-min door to door (including buying your tkts) to walk to the Light Link Rail. Just head right out of the parking lot and walk for 7-min and you will hit the entrance to the Rail station. Another 3-min to get tkts and get the actual platform. Then it was a 40-min ride into Seattle - $5.50 for a RT ticket. We had a room facing the street and airport - I could not hear any street or airport noise. But if you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for a room on the other side - which only faces a parking lot so at least the street noise might be a little less, though again I didn't hear anything. Within walking distance of the hotel there is limited food selections...Denny's, Jack in the Box, a BBQ place, Subway, Tully's Coffee and a few other restaurants next to the other hotels. They did set out coffee in the lobby every morning with to-go cups.

Having read the other reviews for this hotel, I felt some reservations going in but thanks to other reviewers knew to avoid the Kaui and Molokai wings of the hotel. Of course, our reservation had us booked in the Kaui wing but we asked for a change before even checking in and were given a nice room in the Lanai wing. We were on the ground floor and the room was very spacious, very clean and relatively quiet. We had a king bed and a small table and chairs in a step-down area leading out to a small shaded patio. The hotel grounds are pleasant in a low key way though the pool area could have been much improved. While relatively clean, the pool was very small and there were none of the amenities associated with most hotel pools. I actually only went to the lobby once--when checking in and true, it is old and dated but my philosophy is you get what you pay for and make the most of what you have. We came to Maui for what Maui has to offer, rather than the hotel. We knew we wouldn't be in the hotel much and actually wanted to stay in a decent place in a great location. The KBH fit the bill. We also had the free breakfast included but rather than use it at the shoddy Mixed Plate, ate at the Tiki Grill outside. Using the free breakfast coupons we ended up spending no more than $3 each day for 2 of us ordering off the menu and had good food in a nice outdoor setting. We were close to Black Rock and the rest of Kaanapali Beach and would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hotel with lower prices but very clean. The service was also very good and all hotel staff members we dealt with were extremely nice and helpful. If you want luxury and many amenities this may not be the place for you but the value was worth it to us.

This is my first time to Boston for a meeting. Honestly, all the hotel around is quite expensive and I choose this one because of availability and the name 'Marriott'. The hotel itself is pretty old as well as the room. The mattress and pillow are too soft, just because they are too old, you can feel a 'hollow' in the middle of it. They totally forgot what I requested. For example I requested a late check out, however my card key was expired and I need to refresh it. Worse is someone crash in to check room while I changing. Definitely not to stay there again. By the way, so many other choices around there, right?

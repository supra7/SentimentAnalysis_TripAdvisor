Pros - Quick transfer after calling from my cell at airport. Free transportation to and from Dave's Diner (1/2 mile away) on hotel shuttle. Cons - Noisy HVAC - no option for fan on all of the time (which is easier to take and drowns out other noises) Bath was tiny but well-appointed - not really good for 2 people though Hotel is not well sound insulated - planes taking off and landing, especially (this would not have been a problem if the HVAC fan could be set to run continuously) Had to wait 20 minutes for shuttle to airport, mostly due to local traffic

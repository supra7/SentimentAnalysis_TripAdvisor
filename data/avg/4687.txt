Spur of the moment trip to go see Oprah! The price was right, including parking and they allowed us a late check out. The room was small, but clean and was all we needed for this trip. The room was updated with a microwave and refrigerator. We were not fans of the bed...because of that, would most likely try someplace new next time.

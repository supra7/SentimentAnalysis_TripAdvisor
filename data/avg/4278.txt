first of all keep in mind this is a very OLD hotel!..it's very quaint, in a GREAT location, but it is based upon the "old" TRADITIONAL hotel style...the beds are very comfy(not too soft - i detest a too soft mattress!) however the bathrooms are VERY small...some have no tubs only a shower unit..if you with children, you might want to ask for a tub. the elevators are slow and heaven forbid you are on the opposite end of the hallway - pulling luggage along the heavy carpeted floor can be a pain! so many restaurants and bars within walking distance..easy access to the trains too. a solid 3 star hotel...if not for the tiny rooms another star could be added.

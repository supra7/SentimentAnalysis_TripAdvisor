My option for city break in Amsterdam was Novotel City. Is well conected with for city center ( tram 4 near ) and for airport ( RAI ). Good breakfast, nice room, clean. We choose notsmoking room from thursday to sunday. Friday evening in our room was smoke from an other room conected by a close dor with our room. Saturday morning same but we left fast our room to visit the town. In the evening 10 pm was not posble to breaf without to open the window. I called to reception and a lady told me that she will send somebody to check. After 30 min. nothing. I called again and same she told me that somebody will came. After other 20 min. I called again and a gay told me that they check the corridor and everithing ok. My opinion that they need a psiholog because when somebody claim a problem in his room you cannot go to solve this problem to corridor, restaurant, parking............ After 1 hour was 23 pm came a gay who told that is smell from smoking in our room and gave us other room. Somebody smoke near our room in notsmoking room!!!

We booked a two night stay after a cruise to see Seattle. The room had a great view of the Space Needle, just out the window of the room. Only two blocks from the needle and the monorail. The breakfast was OK not bad not great, same as most free breakfasts except they had scrambled eggs and ham. The only real complaint would be the very loud air conditioner and it didn't even cool the room down. A good clean hotel with free parking near major attractions.

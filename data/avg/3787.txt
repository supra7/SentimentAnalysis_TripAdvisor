The hotel is very run down and it's like they have air fresheners running through the AC vents... Makes us think that they're trying to cover up something?? The smell is too overwhelming!! It's as though they're updating because there are beautiful furnitures & fixtures, but tur walls, door frames, doors & carpet are in terrible shape so it almost seems like a waste? The walls are the thinnest that I have ever experienced... We heard every movement and voice in the hallway as well as every step taken in the room above us. The desk clerk was incredibly nice and accommodating. He went out of his way to make sure we were set up well.

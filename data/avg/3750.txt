I had a 6th floor room facing the parking lot. The lights in that lot are on all night, and eaisly shine through the window if you do not have the shades closed. The room itself was small, and reminded me of a New York City room. The noise from the traffic below could be heard at all hours. That being said, the breakfast was very well done, and the food was replaced quickly when empty. The lobby was presented nicely, although there could have been more staff on hand when I checked in. There were several people in line, and only 1 staff person doing teh work. The area was safe and in walking distance of many resturants.

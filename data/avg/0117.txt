This motel is a motel, it served our needs, and I've stayed at worse places. We stayed for three nights in room 210 in early September. We had requested a room with two beds, and were pleasantly surprised that the two bedrooms were separated by a door. The hotel is nothing fancy. The bathroom, carpet, and sheets were clean. No bed bugs or other creepers. I read the reviews after my friend booked the place and every other place was twice as pricey or filled up, and was a little nervous. I prepared by buying earplugs and remembering to make sure that the door was locked every time we left. I ended up not having to use the earplugs, even though there was construction outside the back window. My worst fears weren't realized, and we both slept fine. It's perhaps not as quiet as the Westin next door, but it wasn't a problem. No parties kept us up, and nothing bad happened. The front desk kindly loaned us an iron and ironing board, and let us keep it in the room for our stay. He was also helpful with restaurant recommendations and getting a layout of the city. The location is great. Maybe other rooms are worse, or other people had different experiences. But the negative reviews seem overblown.

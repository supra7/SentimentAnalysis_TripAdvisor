Located in the eastern part of Berlin with more soviet style atmosphere, this hotel is on the top floor of the building, so you always come in like to the appartments. Staff is mostly from former soviet countries(also from my homecity Odessa). The room was quite poor, but clean. Breakfast was not so nice, better to eat somewhere else. Bathroom was also clean and tidy. The hotel is 10 minutes walking to Brandenburg Gate.

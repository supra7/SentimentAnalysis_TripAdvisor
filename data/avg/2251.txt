We stayed at the trump hotel over the New Year break. It was in a good spot slightly off the strip. Quiet in comparison to the other casino hotels. We were upgraded to a one bedrrom suite which is huge and has a full kitchen. We were on the side that the train and highway is on, but we had no problem sleeping. We did go to bed late though so we might've slept through most noise. All in all a good stay. We did not use many of the facilities while we were there, except for the gym which was excellent. If you like a hotel that is more like an apartment i would reccomend this hotel for you. It's also very close to Wynn and Encore which are the best places to hang out on the strip. For a great breakfast, hit the Peppermill it's open 24hours and has great food.

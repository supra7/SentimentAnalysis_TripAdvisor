We recently spent two nights at the Copley Square Hotel in Boston. The hotel itself is beautiful along with the furnishings of the room and bathroom. The staff was great and very helpful about booking tours and places to see. The only complaint I have is that they need to furnish housekeeping with vacuum cleaners that can go under their furniture. We pulled the nightstand out to play cards on and the dust was a good 1/2 inch thick plus stuck on the base boards. I was scared to look under the beds as to how much dust I might find. My sister and brother-in-law were traveling with us and they found the same thing in their room two floors up. I am not blaming housekeeping, because otherwise the room was clean. Maybe a team of cleaners should go through the rooms every two months and move the furniture out so it can be vacuumed underneath.

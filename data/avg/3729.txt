Good location. Room was small, but beds comfortable. Ease of check in was good. Internet difficult to access- had to get code from front desk. Restaurant has no hostess- had to go to the bar to get someone to wait on us for dinner. Food was good though. Breakfast buffet was free, but it was terrible - eggs like rubber. It was more like something you would get at motel 6. Very disappointed. Staff friendly. Vallet is come and go for $22.00. Valet staff very helpful and friendly. Stay at Adolphus often, so maybe I expected it to be same level since an older hotel. Cool architecture though.

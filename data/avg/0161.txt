The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable and room was very quiet at night. Stayed on the 24th floor, but lower floors heard more traffic noise. Within one mile to Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square and were able to walk to them. The view from the room was of other buildings and the freeway and you could see the mountains between them. If you want a view, not a good choice. Hotel did not have a pool and the bathrooms needed updated greatly. The food in the Regatta Grille was good and the service was acceptable. Nothing outstanding. The elevators are exceptionally slow.

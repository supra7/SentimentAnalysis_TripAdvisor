Amazing views and a great location that places you next all of the action without being in the middle of it. Staff is very attentive and actively looks to see that you are enjoying your stay. Our meeting space was modern and attractive. The park and access to the boardwalk was perfect for my morning walk. My only complaint is the restaurant... Not sure what has happened there but it really appears to have changed from where it was a year ago. The food options are blah and the staffing levels are less than they used to be, and this shows in the level of service and attention. Wanted to speak to the restaurant manager regarding their private dining room, nobody could find him so I left to go to FOX grill and meet coworkers... Guess who was there having a beer with his friend? Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. Booked the dinner at Bice instead. The hotel is such a nice place, too bad the restaurant has turned into a typical hotel cafe. Because of this, the rating went from 5stars to 3.

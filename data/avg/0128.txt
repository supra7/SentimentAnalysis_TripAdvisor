It is a dump, of course, but not as horrible as some of the other reviews will make you believe. And the location IS great. This hotel is old, and some things (paint in the rooms, bathroom fittings, a coat of paint on the outside) could stand an upgrade. But the sheets are clean and changed daily. The noise that other people were talking about did not materilize beyond the normal street noise of a big city downtown. The one thing that I noticed, is that it is fairly cold in the room at night (my stay was in November) and the air conditioners that serve as heaters are pretty noisy but bearable.

The hotel itself is a cool building. It's very old and could probably use some updates, but they do what they can with what they have. The staff was very friendly and very attentive to any needs. However, if you like fancy places, then this hotel is not for you. It was priced right and it's in a pretty location - walking distance of a couple of good restaurants, seattle center, grocery store, and bus stops. Getting downtown towards the Pike area was a breeze.

Locations: Excellent (one corner a little shady, but its New Orleans!). Rooms: clean, small and a little used. View: DO NOT STAY IN A ROOM THAT ENDS IN -11(EG. 211, 311, 411). You will have 2 windows with views of cement walls. Breakfast: Skimpy...Cold cereal, coffee, donuts, make-ur-own waffles. Value: Good (paid about $55/nt) Staff: Okay I would stay here again. There is no need for a rental car. There is a public bus that takes you from the airport to the hotel for $2 and streetcars that go everywhere. Bourbon St is only 4-5 blocks walk.

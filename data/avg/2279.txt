We have been to Parrot Key a couple of times and this past trip will probably be our last. We have always had a good experience however not so much this time. We had a 2 bedroom unit for 4 adults. We checked in on a Tuesday afternoon for a 3 night stay. On Wednesday our room was never cleaned. No clean towels or supplies replenished. We had to have someone come around 10 PM to take care of this after we returned from dinner. Thursday we had to tell them once again later in the afternoon our room was not cleaned again. For 4 adults there is a 4 cup coffee pot and 2 mugs ( again a 2 bedroom suite) We had to ask for a second pot and additional mugs. Extra toilet paper was not replenished so good luck when you ran out because the other bathroom was upstairs. The facilty is very clean. The cafe in the morning was a bit slow. Next time we will be going elsewhere.

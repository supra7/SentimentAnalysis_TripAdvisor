My first thought about Maui Eldorado is that there must be great inconsistency in the condition of the units. Some of the reviews are fantastic, but our unit was not in good condition. It was actually somewhat disgusting. The entire unit needed painted (about 10 years ago) and baseboard work. We had water damage is both bathrooms and the bedroom. The tubs were missing large sections of porcelain and there were tiles missing and cracked everywhere. Counters were mildewed and missing tiles. Kitchen was just kind of old and yucky. The air conditioner unit in the bedroom was right above the bed and so loud and clanky we turned it off to sleep. Our deadolt didn't work, bathroom sink didn't drain and no lightbulb in outside doorway. On the plus side, the area was fantastic. We had a beautiful, large balcony with a view of the golf course and the ocean. It was amazing to sit out and view the scenery. We loved the cabana and beach area. The pool area was big, but very cold. Overall, we would not stay here again, unless we got one of the great units that other people seem to review favorably. So beware what you may end up with. By the way we were in the building closest to the lobby and room 204.

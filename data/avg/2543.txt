Have stayed here a couple of times now, most recently on business for two nights. Best thing is definitely the location if you are travelling via Euston Station. Standard Travelodge decor inside although better than others I've stayed in due to its relative newness. Clean and tidy but minimalist is the best description. I was on the second floor and had no issues with noise from outside or neighbouring rooms. There were a couple of irritating things. Firstly when I arrived I couldn't get into the room as the key didn't work and so I had to trek back down to reception twice for another key, after eventually discovering there was someone else already in the room they'd allocated me. And the fire alarm went off at 7:30am on Saturday morning which was a pain. Didn't sample the breakfast so can't comment.

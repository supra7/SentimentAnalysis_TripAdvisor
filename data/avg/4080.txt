I thought this hotel was satisfactory. I really have no complaints. If I wasn't there on business with the company picking up the tab then it may have left something to be desired. Check in was fast and friendly. Made our way up to the room. The room was basic, just like every other room I've stayed in with nothing that really jumped out at me. My view of the city was pleasant. There is a lot of construction on two of the floors for renovation. I will totally recommend the chocolate stop on the way by the walkway over to the mall. GREAT! Location is great with tours happening right outside the hotel. Some nice Irish pubs in the vicinity as well. Overall, nice...no big deal.

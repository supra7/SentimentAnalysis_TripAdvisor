We booked a room there ahead of a 6 am flight, not wanting to inconvenience our son with a 3 am wake up and drive. He dropped us at 10 pm, helped us with our luggage to our room, said a quick goodbye, and went to his car to leave. Not even 10 minutes had passed, and he found a parking ticket. While the lot is marked for hotel guests, even if we had checked in, brought luggage to our room and immediately returned to our car, it still would have been ticketed. In fact, the person who must have done the deed watched as we unloaded our luggage, walked right by into the lobby. He must have walked straight over and put the ticket on the car. My son was incensed, as were we. The desk said it would be taken care of, explaining it was a "new company" but still doesn't explain why they would be running around ticketing vehicles when people were still checking in for the evening. The efficient and most logical would be to check for legal parking after midnight, when most are in for the evening. Other than the annoyance, and that making sleep a bit more difficult, we were only there 6 hours, so unsure of other amenities. I am still debating a letter to Radisson on this, will wait to be sure that they handled this nastly little misstep. Our first experience with this hotel chain, not the best.

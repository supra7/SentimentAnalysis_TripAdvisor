I was very impressed the first time I stayed at this hotel, but I think I was blinded by the sleep number bed. This time I noticed more stuff that needed to be fixed. I was on the 7th floor and the hallway smelled like smoke, although our room did not. Our room was nice and big, but didn't have a fridge or microwave. The A/C was broken or just bad, because it barely pumped out any cold air. On the plus side, my husband and I got room service and the food was excellent....kind of pricey, but good. The bathroom was nice with an interesting (in a good way) shower head. I would stay in this hotel again if it was priced more toward what they offered, but we paid $180 for a night in an average hotel without too many amenities.

We stayed at this hotel Nov.3-6, it was booked through Priceline as 4 star in the loop. Lobby and public places beautiful and historic, but rooms very varied and not as nice as other hotels with same rating. The worse part of this hotel is they nickel and dime you to death. Very expensive charge for internet in your room and lobby. No coffee makers or fridge in rooms, and coffee not available in lobby without purchasing a styrofoam cup for $2. It is a great location, but after two years receiving this hotel after bidding I think I'll have to make sure we try a different hotel on our next visit.

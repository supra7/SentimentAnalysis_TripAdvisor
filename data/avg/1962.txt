I was lucky enough to visit Lahaina as a tag-along on my boyfriend's business trip, so I had a lot of time to explore by myself. I LOVED Lahaina, the town, the Ka'anapali Beach area. We selected our hotel based purely on cost, so we were not expecting a palace...and we surely did not get one. We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel, touted as the "Most Hawaiian Hotel". It is older, and a little shabby compared to some of its fancy neighbours, but honestly - you don't go to Maui intending to stay in your hotel for too long! It was fine, considering our objective of doing this trip on the cheap. One additional comment - it's so worth driving to Kihei to have dinner at Roy's...I can still taste that chocolate souffle!

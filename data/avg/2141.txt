The Trump makes some big claims,and for the high room rate I had to pay (as Vegas hotels busy), I hoped it would meet it's claims! Unfortunately it did not. The positives - It is an impressive and grand style hotel with pleasant staff and large room with kitchen area and comfy bed. Away from the hectic non stop strip, yet close enough to not be "out of it". No casino, so more relaxed than the big strip hotels, It was nice to not have the constant pressure to tip everyone for everything, that goes with these hotels. The let downs - Given an ease of access room without needing it or being advised. Shower much too low for me to use. Wardrobe too short to hang trousers etc. This was not a great issue but I was never asked if this ok and my request to relocate was not managed well, so I didn't bother in the end. Great room for Warwick Davies to use if he is ever in town. Hotel could not cope with breakfast queues, people hanging around lobby waiting for tables all very disorganised and a long wait. When seated food and service was good. The hotel is noisy, not fromwithin, but outside street and train (yes you can hear trains in the night - I also heard other people discussing this at breakfast) noises seem loud. It's as though the windows are not sound proof. I asked for at check in, and was assured my room was a quite one, so I can only presume the whole hotel suffers from this noise penetration. The whole reception area has the smell of cheap air fresheners. I presume some kind of automatic aromatic system is used. I don't think it is needed, it smells like they are covering a bad smell. All in all not a bad hotel, just not in the league it try's to position itself in. For my stay, it did not justify the rate paid. $200 per night less and I would not be so critical. Oh, and not to forget the dreaded resort fee! Hoteliers, If a charge is not discretionary, then include it in the room rate. Customers will appreciate it.

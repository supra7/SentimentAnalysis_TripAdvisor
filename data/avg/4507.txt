Hotel is not up to what you would expect of the Hyatt Regency. Although room was clean, it was worn out, nothing special. Carpet did not feel clean. Hair dryer was cracked and had been repaired with glue! Bathroom was old. Lobby is small and it is hard to find your way around inside. Porter left our luggage in lobby at check-in, and we never got it in our room- finally went back to get it ourselves as reception phone didn't work. Previous stay at a competing hotel across from MIT was much more luxurious.

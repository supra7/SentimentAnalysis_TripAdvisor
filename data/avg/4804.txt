The lobby is grand, although almost completely taken over by the bar. There are few hotels in Chicago that can claim or display the kind of history that the Palmer House can. Once leaving the lobby, the rooms are not great. They are large, the room we had would be a Jr suite anywhere else, and included 2 bathrooms; however, the furniture included was inadequate, the layout made no sense, and the tiny tv was so far away from the bed it wasn't easy to view. The hotel is large, and it is difficult to avoid stairs. The entry doors are not automated, which makes the hotel difficult for anyone loaded with luggage or who has mobility issues.

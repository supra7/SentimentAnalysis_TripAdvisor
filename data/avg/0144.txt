Room was clean and had nice linens. Safe located in closet. Everything worked. Restaurant located in building - cheap diner style. Bar located in building - average. Internet was chronic drama during our stay. Front desk staff had different answers every time we called. In the end, the front desk clerk cleared all of the error charges and charged us for one week of internet access. But for the cost of this hotel, internet service should be hassle free and free of charge. I forgot to bring a razor and the hotel provided a courtesy razor immediately on request - I was very grateful! Hotel located 5 blocks uphill from the main down town area. They are the steepest 5 blocks in the area! The city bus does not travel up this road. Tip - walk up Pine St. to 6th St. and then walk down to Seneca St.. Stayed at Crowne Plaza for work but arrived a few days early for vacation and stayed at Best Western Loyal Inn. Preferred Best Western in all ways and it included free hot breakfast, free delicious coffee, free internet, much closer to space needle, easy bus ride to Pike's Place and downtown and was cheaper.

We went to Seattle for four days on vacation and chose the Ace due to its close proximity to restaurants and downtown. It is 'hip' and 'stylish' and there are Eames chairs in the lobby and that's all good, but ultimately what you have is a hostel converted into a hotel. Nothing more, nothing less. The beds are fine, and the aesthetic is right, but you really do get the feeling that everything was chosen so it would look good in a picture, not in real life. The quality of the materials (aside from the common-area furniture, which was all great) is quite poor, and looks like it all came from the As-Is section at IKEA. Other reviews indicate the night desk attendant is pompous and talks on the phone a lot- if you think this, you have to be completely wrong, because she was one of the most helpful people I've ever encountered in a hotel. 'Belltown' is sort of trendy, and the restaurants within two or three blocks of the hotel were incredible (i.e. the location if you don't have a car and want to walk is great), but I've never been panhandled so many times in my life (and I work in homelessness outreach) as I was within a block of this hotel. In the middle of the night EVERY night, there were fights and shouting and sirens, which woke us up constantly. If you're looking for a hostel, stay in a hostel. If you're looking for a hotel, stay in a hotel. If you're looking for an experience, and a bit of an adventure in being sleepless in... ah, forget that... (with excellent breakfast in the morning, I will say), try this.

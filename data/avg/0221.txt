Pros: It's in a great location (the sushi restaurant around the corner is outstanding, by the way); the suite is a great size for young children, with French doors that allow for privacy after they've gone to sleep; the kitchenette is a nice feature; the daytime staff was always super friendly and helpful; the noise-reducing windows work as advertised  no problems at all with street sounds. Cons: In general everything is just a little old and worn (which is fine if you're looking for that); the nighttime staff was hit or miss, sometimes not even acknowledging our having entered the hotel lobby; it seems a little pricey for what you get; there are stains on the carpet in the hallways; the breakfast fare is little better than what one would get in a budget chain motel.

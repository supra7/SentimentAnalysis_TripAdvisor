Things I liked - location - right downtown, within walking distance to the Public Market, etc - the Heavenly Bed - the view from the high floors Things I didn't like - carpet etc looked really dated (old and worn) - I was surprised - elevators are slow - they have 3 elevators servicing 40+ (?) floors. I was surprised at how dated the carpet etc was.

The stay was ok, with exception of the elevator that was broken. I had to lug 3 weeks of travel baggage around the full loop in the morning. I thought it would have been fixed from the night prior, where the front desk did not inform me of the second elevators so I had to lug suit case up 3 flights of stairs. Since I arrived after 7:30 pm I ate dinner there, very expensive, $50 for a 8 oz steak! WOW. The shuttle service was on time and drivers were friendly. Check in was quick. Not worth the extra expense. Tried to get a starbucks coffee in the lobby.... but the bartender was too busy conversing.

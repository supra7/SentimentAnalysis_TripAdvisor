We were there for a week with for a company vacation from a supplier. The trip over and back was long but 5000 miles is not done at the snap of a finger. The rooms were clean and the staff was helpful from the maid service to the bartenders. The worst I can say is "I ATE TOO MUCH!" The prices for the bar and at Umulu were higher than the value received, but the better restaurants had a nicer atmosphere and quality of food. I guess the one bad thing was the shower walls were dirty and soap scum was on them, but I just kept my hands off the walls and forget to mention it to the desk. We went to Pearl Harbor for the tour and I recommend doing a tour rather than flying over and getting a rental car on your own. The traffic in Honolulu is bad and if you don'y know where you are going- Forget it. Arizona and Missouri were awesome and very sobering. Did whale watchin out of Lahaina, Slip 11 charter, and recommend them, cost under $40 each. Saw LOTS of whales, I do highly recommend seeing them, they are awesome also. Did Ruth Chris Steakhouse inj Lahaina and the food was GREAT. Others in party went to Molokini to snorkel and they were happy.and took helicopter over Hana and crater. I probably won't return to Hawaii as once is enough and I saw what I wanted to. Take the Trolly, FREE, to Whaler's Village and get on local bus, $1.00, to other destinations if you have time. It is fun to mingle with the locals and see what you don't see at the tourist traps. ABC stores are best for cheap souveniors which will end up in someone's yard sale next year anyway. Excpect to pay high dollar everywhere as everything has to be shipped or flown in. And YES, the bars need to stay open longer at the property. Now, go have a great vaca!

My girlfriend and I stayed a night in October for her birthday so we could go to both of Universals parks. The hotel says they provide shuttles back and forth. What they should say is that the hotel employs a guy with an expedition to take 5-8 people at a time over to the park. There was ~20 people waiting at 8:40 am for a ride over to get to the park before it opened to see the Harry Potter experience at Universal. Why not invest in a bus or shuttle? Don't most people come to the resort to attend the parks? Also the hotel makes no effort in organizing this matter. The first people to jump in the van go tot the park which I'm sure you can imagine gets tense. I shouldn't have to fight with other people on my vacation to get a ride to the park. The hotel is closer than other hotels in the area but after a long day at the parks a 2 mile walk is the last thing you want to do. On a positive note the rooms were very clean and nice, which is very important. I'm not a very picky person at all, but I do expect to get good service when I spend $140 to stay at your hotel. I don't think that is unreasonable and I feel the experience was not worth that price tag.

The outside of the hotel and the lobby are much nicer than the appearance of the rooms themselves. They have a very college dorm-like feeling to them. Our room smelled faintly of smoke when we walked in, but we were tired and didn't want to make a fuss and request a room change. The bathroom was large, but the shower seemed kind of old. I liked the kitchenette - it was nice having the basic dishes, stovetop, microwave, and minifridge all supplied. The TV was also nice. For what we paid, the hotel was fine, but I'd been hoping for something better. It's very close to a sketchy part of town with lots of adult entertainment. If I'd been traveling alone, i would have felt uncomfortable walking around at night.

Stayed here again recently. Check-in was unfriendly and could be likened to ordering a burger at a fast food joint on a freeway - no personality, no recognition of status (Priority Club), nobody to carry luggage to the room. Room was nice but attention to detail might have meant the pubes in the shower weren't mine! With no choice when staying at Changi overnight this hotel doesn't seem to care about its guests other than they can pay the expensive room rate for the short time they pass through the hotel. Unfortunately I'll probably stay here again but not for anything other than convenience.

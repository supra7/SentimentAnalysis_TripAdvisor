The rooms were full big enough to comfortably house three guys on decent terms with each other. There was no morning room service, which was a bit of a letdown, but ignorable. They serve a lower-middle-of-the-road breakfast in the morning. The hotel staff wasn't able to help find much of anything near the hotel--restaurants, stuff to do and the like--but, they were friendly and accommodating. This hotel's greatest asset has nothing to do with the hotel itself, actually, it's a simple matter of location. They're immediately south of the Dallas World Aquarium, a bit further south of McKinney Avenue, just west of the train station, and a stone's throw east of The House of the Blues. For the price, I didn't see any other hotels that were even remotely comparable. In short, this isn't the place to stay if you're only going to be here one night. But if you plan on sticking around and seeing a thing or two, this is the place for you!

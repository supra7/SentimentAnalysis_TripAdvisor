The Moore is a few blocks from Pike's Market. Public transportation is nearby. We ditched our rental car and used buses and cabs or we walked everywhere. The neighborhood has its share of urban ills, but so does every other big city and we were never scared. If you want to stay in downtown Seattle for a reasonable price, this is the place. The rooms are being remodeled so while plain, they are getting updated one by one. Some of the staff were amazing, and some quite indifferent. It can be noisy, so definitely bring earplugs.

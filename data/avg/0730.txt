To be fair, most of the downtown hotels in Seattle are overpriced (IMHO). Being right on the water, I was prepared to pay. However, I think the $34/day for parking is excessive. There is a fee for wifi; in nicer hotels, I think it should be included. The restaurant was good, but expensive; you pay for the view. The upside is that the staff was friendly and accommodating - they get high marks. If you order room service, check the fine print; a tip is already calculated into your charge. I *would* recommend the Edgewater, but with the caveat that it is not for cheap people.

Stayed in a big to queen beds room, large enough but with a small bathroom. On the top floors you can get a little view of the city. The hotel is nice enough, a bit outdated and not to many extra fascilities. But the location is superb, in the heart of Seattle, close to everything, especially shopping. Can be a bit noisy

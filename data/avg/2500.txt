3.0 rating reflects very mixed experience - some aspects qualify for a 5.0, but paint fumes in fact made it a 1.0. Pros: Great location; extremely helpful and friendly staff; free wi-fi; rooms beautifully appointed with exciting design details and amazing picture window views (some with balconies); good coffee maker in room with complimentary coffee and tea; great bath products. Cons: Some of the exciting design details tried too hard and didn't work that well in practice; poor sound-proofing both to hallway and street. Biggest problem at the time of our visit was that the hotel is so spanking new (about 1 month old) that the chemical fumes from paint, carpets, furniture etc. were overwhelming and caused us to check out prematurely after just the first night. Expect the fumes problem will be solved in time, although with A/C as only source of air circulation, it may take a while. Once the air clears, this hotel should be a great choice if you're looking for modern, chic cool.

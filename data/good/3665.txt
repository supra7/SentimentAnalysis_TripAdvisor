Fantastic location on north side of Inner Harbor, adjacent to Little Italy and Pier Six Pavillion...all within a 5 minute walk. Hotel is very clean and comfortable, although room with king bed is pretty cramped. We stayed on Hilton points, so can't comment on price. Breakfast included for Hilton Honors top tiers. Guests have access to Maryland Athletic Club, a really nice full health and fitness club. No free parking....valet seemed to be only option and it was pretty steep at $32/day.

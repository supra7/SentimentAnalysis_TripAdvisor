My family (myself, my husband and our two girls ages 10,and 9) and I just returned from a 7 night stay at the KBH. I had not gone to Trip Advisor before booking as I booked through AAA. This was a package deal including airfare, rental car and hotel. I was not expecting a deluxe experience and did not receive one. What we did get was a clean room, exellent customer service and an unbeatable location. Our family does not go on this trip to hang out in our room or swim in the pool. While an awsome pool set-up is fun for the kids, the girls had a wonderful time boogie boarding (boards bought at Longs Drugs $16.00 each for the week, then given away to new arrivals) and snorkling at Black Rock. Yes, there is a shorebreak and a bit of an undertow. Our kids are excellent swimmers, so if yours aren't it could be an issue. The beach was huge and never crowded. Yes, everything is expensive, but that's Hawaii. It is possible to spend less if you try eating at fast food places and buy breakfast stuff for the room. The road to Hana was great, but we did get tons of misquito bites( our fault for not wearing repellant). The highlight of our trip was seeing a turtle while snorkling at black rock- the girls were thrilled. Yes the KBH is dated, and the pool is small, but the people who work there are friendly and full of the aloha spirt. I have stayed in far more luxurious hotels but the staff makes a difference. I would absoultly recommend the KBH to any family that wanted a great beach vacation at a reasonable price.

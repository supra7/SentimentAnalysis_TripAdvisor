I stayed here for the weekend. Great place for diversion. I love the artwork especially the room doors. I was welcome to use their business room anytime. I also like their idea of lighting candles in the evening, they only not save energy but make the place cozy and homey. It is right in the heart of downtown, it's walking distance to shopping center, monorail and at the market. The only downside is their shower room. It's too tiny. I wonder how a tall person can fit in there.

As always, the bed and bath at the Westin were 'heavenly,' as advertised. Also, the hotel is very close to some nice restaurants (about a block away) and only a short walk to Pike Place Market (~10-15 minutes). If you're traveling to the airport, the Downtown Airporter Shuttle stops conveniently right in front of the flagpoles at the main entrance of the hotel. I think this Westin distinguished itself because of its service and the spectacular views from the hotel. I e-mailed the hotel a few days before arriving and asked to be upgraded to an SPG Preferred room with a view of the Space Needle. The staff phoned me back promptly and took care of everything. The view was amazing!

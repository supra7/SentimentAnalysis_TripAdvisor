As many others have reported, we stayed at the Sheraton one night prior to taking a cruise. We had only positive experiences there. Check in was speedy, the bed was comfy, lunch the next day was good, and the employees were pleasant and helpful. We walked to Pikes Market with no problem, and if we ever return to Seattle we would most likely stay at the Sheraton again.

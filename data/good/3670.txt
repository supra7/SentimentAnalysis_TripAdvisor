Went for a long weekend with a lot of extended family. Hotel was in a great location, you could easily walk to the inner harbor and all the attractions and places to eat/shop. Some family members had rooms on the smoking floor which smelled awful and the hotel was great about switching rooms for them. Unless you smoke I would make sure to not book a smoking room, you will just end up with a headache from the smell. I'm actually shocked that hotels even still have smoking rooms available so lesson learned to double check. At the hotel you also have access to a private gym and pool which are awesome by the way! Anyway I would not hesitate to stay again!

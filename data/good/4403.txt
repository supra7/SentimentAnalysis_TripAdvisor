We had 4 days here in Nov. We were upgraded to oceanfront room which despite not being the ultimate in luxury fittings, was really comfortable and just the perfect position. The balcony was a reasonable size and the view was to die for - all along the beach to the rocky point, where the snorkelling was great. I saw a couple of turtles and really colourful fish, the coral doesn't quite match the Great Barrier Reef but hey, you can't have everything! Short walk to the Whalers Village for food outlets, restaurants and shopping, also the little bus into Lahaina was handy. The hotel offered reasonable food, tho didn't eat there much. Had a good massage there too!

I stayed at the Bayfront for the Thanksgiving Day weekend. I was surprised to receive an upgrade to a double queen room (2652). It was a corner northwest room with a spectacular view of the city and the bay! The rain-covered streets and streetlights were breathtakingly holiday inspired. I had dinner at Vela and the atmosphere was fantastic, the fare was just average. The pool and spa are great! V, a female barkeep, was exceptional. Be sure to visit the Odysea Lounge for happy hour (4-6 and 10-12). My second visit was over the Christmas holiday weekend. This time I rec'd a Coronado Bridge/Bay View king room (1002). Although the view was less spectacular than my previous visit, I was still pleased. There was a glass encased shower bath and a convertible sofa in the bedroom.

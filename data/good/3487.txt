While all your accommodation's were top notch I was disappointed in most of the food there. The steak house food was horrible and the Seafood wasn't much better. However your breakfast Buffet was actually pretty good with a good variety as well. I did not eat in all your restaurants so I cant be critical of them. Your room service menu could be a little larger as well as could the servings. I will say that your personal are a top notch crew and very, very helpful and polite. They definitely are your best asset. Our concierge I believe his name was Roberto was the greatest. He is the number one employee that I am first reminded of. Again they were all very good. I would come back again and could only hope that the food is vastly improved upon.

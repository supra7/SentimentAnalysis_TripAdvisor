Spend 2 nights there in May and was impressed with both the facilities and the service. The spa is great but the staff speaks little English. The Reception was helpful in translating. View from the corner rooms is worth the price. Spacious and well designed. Walking distance from the main shopping street. One restaurant only. Was empty most of the time but there were a lot of other places around to eat.

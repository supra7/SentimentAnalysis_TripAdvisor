A lot of people have written bad reviews... And it sounds like they have REALLY high standards! Me and my daughter came the night before a day FULL of doctors appointments at Seattle Childrens Hospital, and the TRAVELODGE was in an incredibly convenient spot for being at our appointment early in the morning. In 1 word for my stay at the TRAVELODGE it was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was our second time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn. We chose to stay at this hotel again due to its location and costs. Though there are hotels that are closer to the Inner Harbor (where there is the most to do) the high costs of those hotels were enough to deter me from staying there. From Hilton Garden Inn, you are about a 15-20 minute walk to Fells Point and Inner Harbor, or a $5-7 taxi ride. Conveniently, there is a 24 hr CVS, and a Whole Foods around the corner of the hotel. As for the hotel itself, it is an above average hotel. Nothing may particularly leave you in awe about this hotel, but it is definitely nicer than some hotels which I've paid more for. The room we stayed at is a standard room, but most importantly, I have no complaints about the room's cleanliness. The facilities and the complimentary wifi were the highlights of this hotel. I believe the gym is a privately owned gym but guests are allowed complimentary access; that is why it is much nicer than your typical hotel gyms. Due to extra company this time, we booked a room with 2 beds instead of 1 King. We were slightly disappointed though that the rooms do not offer queen size double beds. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay and look forward to it again.

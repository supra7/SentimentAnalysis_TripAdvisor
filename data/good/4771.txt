The Outrigger Maui Eldorado truly met our expectations! Our unit had a fully-stocked kitchen, spacious bathroom area with a roomy closet and many clothes hangers, a washer and dryer unit, a lanai with tables and chairs to have a meal, meditate, soak in the sun or catch an evening breeze. We LOVED the view of the well-manicured grounds and golf course. The Front Desk and housekeeping staff were friendly, always available and ready to assist in a moment's notice. We had an awesome time walking or jogging the beautiful grounds almost every morning as the sun was rising and ending up at the Cabanas to take in the beauty of the ocean or other islands at a distance and watching the surfers and ocean swimmers. We also LOVED the fact that the Outrigger Maui Eldorado is centrally located in Kaanapali Beach and VERY conveniently located off of Highway 30 which is the main vein to other nearby towns and the airport. We cannot stop raving about Outrigger Maui Eldorado to our family, friends, co-workers and students! We will definitely choose to stay there again for our next Maui vacation as it was truly our home-away-from-home!

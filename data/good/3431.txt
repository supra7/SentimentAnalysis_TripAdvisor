Loved the resort, would definitly go back to another Secrets resort, but now Mexico. Got sick on the 2nd to last day of our trip. Came back to the USA and was hospitilized. The doctors said I got sick from eating food that was contaminated. Probably one of the worst experiences of my life. Would recommend to a friend with extreme caution when eating or drinking.

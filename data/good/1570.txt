I decided to go with this hotel wtih the reviews I read here. The outside of the hotel does not look very fancy but the inside and the room was just superb. It has a good location and is very close to many attractions and bus transportation. Pike Place is just a few blocks away and you can definitely walk to the Space Needle. Make sure you join the Stash Hotel Reward to enjoy free wifi.

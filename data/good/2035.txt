I was looking for the best possible deal, in order to catch a baseball game, while in Seattle. Using "Hotwire", I got a "traditional" room for $95.00 US per night. This would be a "standard" room in most hotels. Unfortunately, the Westin site only provides photos of their "deluxe" rooms and none of the tripadvisor member reviews included pics, either. I've included them, in this review. The hotel has two towers - 40 stories each - with 3 elevators serving each tower. We were placed onto the 19th floor. I don't know if things are different on weekends - we were there mid-week - but we had no waiting issues whatsoever. The room had a nice city view and a king-sized bed. The headboard had separate dimmer lights so that either occupant could read without disturbing the other. Nice touch, I thought. Great sleeping. The mattress was very good quality. The staff and service was all great. Friendly and professional. One thing that we look for, when we travel to hotels, is room fridges. These rooms contain mini-bars, but not fridges in which to place your own stuff. We brought a small electric cooler and it was fine. The valet parking is expensive, but, if you're comfortable with it, there's a 24 hour parking lot directly across the street from the hotel. Great location. About $10.00 US, by taxi, to Safeco Field and a short walk to Pike Place Market. The pool was nice. Good for laps. The hot tub was above average if you like lots of jets. We enjoyed an awesome dinner experience at the "Ji Bacchus Sake Bar & Bistro" at 1401 Broadway Avenue. Emiko was our hostess and she was wonderful. Excellent food menu - reasonably priced - and a top notch premium sake menu, too. Really...you should consider checking this place out. Given the price, I'd say it was a really great deal and hotel stay.

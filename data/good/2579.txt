Normally on trips we go all out for our hotels. This time we were in town to see a comedy set, i didnt know that part of town real well and wanted a hotel close to the venue. (also just had a child one month earlier) The hotel was within walking distance and a great deal. WE were very satisfied. the rooms are small but you definalty get that hip modern vibe with them. The bed was amazing, the shower, although awkward was fantastic. The room was clean, the service was great. Slept with a window open to the sounds of the city. Perfect vacation. Defianlty for the younger crowd or the aging (old man at the club) hipster. great restaurants and shopping with in walking distance. Oddly it seemed safer at night than during the day?

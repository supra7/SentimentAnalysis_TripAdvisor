There were many things to love about the Hyatt. The grounds, beachfront and pool were the best. You definitely pay for the lush gardens, etc. The lounge chairs had thick, comfortable pads to relax on. We went to the luau and enjoyed it very much. Our package included free breakfast and the breakfast buffet was fantastic. There was a large variety of foods to choose from. We paid for a deluxe ocean view room and I would say it was slightly above average but nothing to brag about. The room had comfortable beds, a small refrigerator and walk in closet with a safe. I do not recommend visiting in August when the heat and humidity can be excessive. The pool felt like bath water in late afternoon and some hallways and shops had no AC and felt like a sauna at times. The Hyatt does not have adequate parking and if the self parking is full, expect to pay $12.00 per day for valet parking. Overall, I enjoyed our stay and would consider staying here again.

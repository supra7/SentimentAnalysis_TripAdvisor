i think this hotel is very nice , i will give like a 9 because im mexican and im sure service could of been better. its very big so the distances to walk from ur room to the restaurants or the beach are long distances... many ppl dont like that. the food is v nice , specially the japanesse resto! aaaaaalsooo my friends, they have glenfiddich , chivas reagal , grey goose etc ( premium alcohol) but its never in the bar where u can see. you have to ask for it cuz it hidden in all of the bars but honestly make sure they give u always good alcohol quality in ur drinks cuz they make cocktails with cheap alcohol (no good) aaaalways ask for a brand to put to. also partial ocean view has no view at all , so if ur expecting th have a view (dont) i stayes in a premium suite and they are lovely!!! but still ( a looot of walking) the beach is one of the top 3 in the world! honestly from all riviera is my far the best!!!

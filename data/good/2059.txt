Traveled to Seattle to hangout with a friend for a couple days and stayed at the Westin while out there. The staff was great, very helpful with any questions I had about the area and awesome with tips on where to eat. Room was nice size, very clean and nicely furnished. I didn't spend to much time in the area but if I was to come out again I'd have a tough time staying somewhere other than The Westin. Was a decent price as well.

We've stayed here several times but the same problems don't seem to be corrected. There is too much focus on selling time shares to the guest. No rules for the guest at the pool. I was hit in the back with a football. The management did nothing I spent one day at Maui Memorial Hospital. Children are allowed to jump off the waterfalls. No Personnel Watch! The food needs some improvement. If you can overlook those things the hotel is really in a great location and the other guests are fun.

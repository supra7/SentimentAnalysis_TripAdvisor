I booked Sixth Avenue Inn because it was the cheapest hotel I could find in downtown Seattle. The total price for one night was 62.00 plus 15 for parking. The front desk was so helpful, they gave us great suggestions from ways to walk to places, to restaurants to driving directions. They were great and made the experience even better. The rooms are a little small, but clean. Biggest bonus this hotel is in walking distance of the Space Needle, Pike Place market, shopping and good food.

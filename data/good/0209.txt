We are relocating to the Seattle area, and thought that the Warwick would be a good place for us to stay while we were house hunting. Returning to the Warwick after a day out with the realtor was just what my husband and I needed. The staff were always welcoming upon our return, and very helpful in answering all of our questions. Our room was lovely, clean and comfortable, with an absolutely spectacular view of the Space Needle. The location is perfect for walking almost anywhere, and we enjoyed many delicious meals in the Brasserie Margaux Restaurant. We especially liked their crabcakes and the tapas selection at "Happy Hour". The Hotel was decorated for the Fall season, which added to to the warm, welcoming atmosphere. We did find a home in Seattle, but hope to come back to the Warwick for a weekend getaway once we are settled. We also now know where we will be putting up all of our out of town guests. Thanks to the Warwick Staff in making our first few days in Seattle such pleasant ones!

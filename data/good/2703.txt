We stayed at the Roosevelt for two nights. I was concerned based on other reviews, but our experience of the Roosevelt was very good. Our room was clean and quiet. The services that we used were excellent, and I found all staff that we encountered to be friendly and helpful. The location is wonderful for first time visitors to Seattle, especially if you are looking for a close location to the Conference Center. We truly enjoyed our stay and have no negatives to pass on. Return visits to Seattle we will likely stay here again. We'd recommend this hotel.

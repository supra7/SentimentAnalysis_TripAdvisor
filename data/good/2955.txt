I was worried this hotel might be noisy since the bar & restaurant in the lobby were very busy, but my worries were unnecessary. Like most Marriott's this hotel was a haven for me to rest and relax. I had a room with a king-sized bed. The bed was wonderfully comfortable, with a mountain of pillows. Each bedside lamp has a plug outlet at it's base for charging your phone - although one of the lamp outlets wasn't working in my room. There was a LCD TV, coffee/tea maker, but no refrigerator. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and had a real hairdryer (not one of those horrible wall-mounted things). This hotel has Bath & Body works amenity products in Orange-Ginger scent. The scent was a bit strong, but nothing I couldn't deal with, however someone will a perfume allergy might find it overpowering. The hotel charges 12.95/day for WiFi or wired internet access unless you have a voucher (for a convention, etc). There is an ethernet cable provded in the desk drawer. There are LOTS of conference rooms of various sizes. The indoor pool is gorgeous - it has an outdoor feel since it's located in the atrium of the hotel. It made me think of a lovely cruise ship/ resort. There is a complimentary airport shuttle to SEA that runs every 15-20 minutes.

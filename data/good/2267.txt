This hotel was perfect for our group- we did not want a pricey hotel that had no personality- we did want a convenient location of downtown Seattle and we got that hands down. The staff wascourteous and helpful and rooms and beds were well appointed and for the most part comfortable ( I personally had a bed that was uneven/slanted- but of the 4 couples there- I was the exception). The wine hour is a sweet and unexpected addition and the restaurant and bar make having a quick drink and meal so easy. Rates were more than fair, especially considering what everyone else was charging. We were very happy with our stay of 3 nights

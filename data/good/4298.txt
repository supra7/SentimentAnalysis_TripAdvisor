I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in an ocean front room, and I must say it is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever been to. The open lobby is very lush with many palm trees and parrots on perches. The grounds are kept very well and the pool is amazing and includes a 250 foot water slide. I was surprised to see how small the beach is, as it did seem larger in pictures. The staff was very friendly with the exception of 1 valet person who just sat there looking at me for a minute or two before finally giving me a valet slip. One thing about this hotel is the guests are very snooty. I suppose you could expect that as the rooms start at $400 and go up to $600 + for an ocean front room, but I was still surpised to see how snooty everyone was. Besides this, the hotel is terrific.

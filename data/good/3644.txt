I use Tripadvisor for ever trip, big or small ,that we take and have never been disappointed. The location of this hotel is just fine, safe and interesting. The room was small but that's the City for you. the cons were the bedside lighting was a bit dim, we did have some trouble w/ the WiFi and we could hear the people in the room next door at one point. BUT, the pros far outweighed these ! The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the heat worked well , the bathroom was a good size and had all one would want. The staff were what made the hotel . EVERYONE there was helpful and pleasant. Anything we requested was delivered quickly and with a cheerful attitude. When we had trouble hooking up to the internet someone arrived immediately. When we asked for ice, we got that quickly too and they had no problem holding our bags until well past 10pm the day we checked out! Plus we got a wonderful suggestion for a place to eat and subway advice. I would definitely stay there again and hopefully the weather will cooperate and we can go up to the rooftop terrace. Thanks for a great stay!

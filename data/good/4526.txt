This was my second stay at KBH = I stayed here back in 2007 and I loved it then too; since I was here last the Kauai wing (where I stayed both times) has been renovated and the new room furbishments are wonderful: new carpet, new furniture - incredibly comfy bed. It was a real treat to open my door and discover a room that was furbished better than my room next door at Sheraton (where I stayed for the first few days of my trip, due to a really fantastic deal which made it only a little more expensive than the KBH (instead of 3-4x as much) for the first few days of my trip. The staff are as fabulous as ever, and because this time around I was there peak season (Christmas-New Year) instead of low season (late January) everything was open - the grill, the pool bar etc. I went out twice with Trilogy - this time making it to Molokini which was fantastic, and up to Honolua Bay, and I also got up at 1.45am to head up to Haleakala Crater for the sunrise which was simply astounding. KBH charges for internet ($10 a day) because there is no resort fee, but the first time I turned my computer on, my bluetooth whatsit showed that there were about a dozen unlocked networks floating around, so in the event I didn't pay for the internet the whole week - an unexpected bonus. I think KBH is just a fantastic hotel and I will definitely be back!

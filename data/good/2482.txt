I found out about Hotel Max through a coupon deal. I would definitely return, the artwork and decor alone is great, and the staff were nice, courteous and helpful. The location is great, right downtown. We didn't get a chance to go to the restaurant, but there were lots of great restaurants, bars, galleries and shopping within walking distance. The room was really nice, the bed and pillows were super-comfy. The only thing was that the bathroom was tiny! but totally functional (our room only had a shower, no bath). The goodies selection in the room was unusual and fun :) I would definitely go again.

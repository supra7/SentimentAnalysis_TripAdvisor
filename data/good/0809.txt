THis hotel couldnt be better placed and it was fantastic value for money. It was very close to Pike Place Market which is great and full of culture. It is not too far from the Space Needle and EMP plus downtown and shops. Our room had a view of the sound which was a lovely view. I was definately pleased with this hotel. It was centrally located, safe and clean and the bed was comfy. THe only thing I could find wrong, and even then it was not a big issue, was the bathroom was a little dull, but you dont go to seattle to spend each living second in the bathroom! The swans that they made from towels were great! One last thing, if you get the chance whilst in Seattle, go to Mt St Helens, you can get a greyline tour or you can do it by hiring a car. its fantastic!

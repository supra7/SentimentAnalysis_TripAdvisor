The Hyatt Maui is very conveniently located and the hotel itself is well maintained. Nice kids water play area for kids 6 and under. Only negatives are that there is very little sandy beach area so you have to walk to other nearby resorts. Also, the Main breakfast restaurant is so crowded in the morning so you have to wait for 15+ minutes to get a table or go an outdoor restaurant which has most (but not all) of what the Main restaurant offers.

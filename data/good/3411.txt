We stayed here for our Honeymoon. We looked at several all-inclusive resorts and picked this one from it's reviews on TA and from friends who got married there. We had Bldg 22 on the third floor. We could see the ocean from our room and pretty much see the whole resort. They had a bottle of Champagne waiting for us, and a Honeymoon banner on our door. The Bed was covered in rose petals. The Beach is amazing. One of the best I've ever been on. It isn't a big deal but I noticed a few peices of trash on the beach (straws from drinks a few wrappers). I only noticed them becuas the sand was otherwise very nice. Food and Drinks were great. They will try to get you purchase non house wine in some restaurants, but a simple no and they didn't bother you again. Our favorite restaurant was the Itailian one. However our first night we ordered room service (included) and even that was great. The landscaping at SMB was simply beautiful. Bring a huge memory card for your digital camera as you will need it.

We just returned after spending six days at Secrets Maroma. The attention provided by the staff is unbelievable. Everywhere you go the staff goes out of their way to make your stay and unforgettable experience. Food: Outstanding. Dinners are very relaxing. Presentation is super. Drinks: Staff is always ready to refill your drink choice. Variety of drinks and quality of liquor is great (you need to ask for top shelf). Make sure to take in the Tequila test class. Facilities: While our room was very spacious and nicely decorated. We were not able to get in our room until 4:30 p.m. (we arrived at 12:30 p.m.). I had read other reviews that discussed the hot water situation. Our room had luke warm water at best. I did call the front desk; they did take a look at it, nothing change. My brother and his wife were 4 rooms down and they were fine. So ask for a room change. Beds are outstanding quality. Spa: My wife and I had massage and it was great. Money well spent. Beach: Super-never had to fight for a chair. .

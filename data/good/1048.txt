My boyfriend and I stayed here for the Thanksgiving weekend and we were happy with our room. It was spacious and clean, with great views. The hotel has a great 28th floor restaurant/bar called the Visions Lounge which has a good happy hour and great views of the city. Another great thing about the hotel was the free gym and pool access. My biggest gripes with the Renaissance was it's expensive parking ($38/day), location, and expensive internet services ($12.95/day). It is adjacent to the I-5 and it can get a little loud. Also, it's a bit of a walk to downtown attractions like Pioneer Square, Pikes Place, and the mall. Coming back after a long day downtown can be difficult as the Renaissance is located atop a San Francisco-esque hill. Still, with all that, I think it was a good value. Large, clean, comfortable rooms with a nice lounge, and good concierge service. I think it was worth the extra walking.

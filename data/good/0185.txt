While it may not be the most hip, luxurious hotel in Seattle, I found the Warwick Hotel to be an amazing value for the money. I got a great deal on their website and found the location to be perfect. About 3 blocks up from Pike Place market, you can walk to everything from this hotel. There is even an airport shuttle that picks up from this location to get you back to the airport for $11. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was slightly dated but beds and bath were excellent. The only problem that I had with this place was that the sliding doors are older and let in cigarette smoke from below and sounds from the street. If the person had not been on their tiny balcony having a cigarette, I don't think this would have been an issue. Overall, it is an amazing value for the money. I even left a power cord in my room by accident and one call to the hotel put me in touch with the lost & found dept. They packaged up my power cord and had it delivered to my door step in MA in only two days! Now that's service. I would definitely stay here again. There is even a pool, spa and workout room that all looked very nice.

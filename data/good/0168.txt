enjoyed memorial day weekend w/ great service. The beds were horrible. While service was great, One of the doubble beds was broken in like a horse. Water pressure non existent and hot water scarce. I hope that they update the bathrooms soon since the last time I saw that style marble was in 1985. it is a great location and the expedia fare ultra competitive.

Everything was superb with this hotel - book early as you get a great discount! Service was great though it varied from person to person. We could not get the paid wireless internet to work, but they didn't charge us. The other little thing that was annoying was getting the key to work to open the door. We had a bit of difficulty with this but the receptionist was able to help us right a way without hesitation. The bed was very clean and shower/toilet was kept fantastically well. Shower leaked water, however and had to put our towels to stop water from overflowing. This was only a minor issue...We had a great time at Lindemann's and would be sure to recommend it to others. The bus service M85 esp was frequent as ever and would take about 15mins to get to the heart of Berlin! Some great places to eat around the hotel anyway!

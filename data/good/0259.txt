We just came back from a one night stay in the water view duplex unit. Kids had downstairs and we in the upstairs bedroom. Luxurious. Great location. Windows open right in front of the Pike Place Market. You can't be more centrally located than this! Ate across the street at Steelhead. Great food. Would come back even though it's expensive!

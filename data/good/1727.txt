Stayed at The Edgewater for 1 night in early February. Beautiful, warm and cozy pacific northwest lodge style decor. Great location for Seattle sightseeing. Stayed in a Waterview Junior Suite on the top floor. View was awesome, could see downtown in one direction and across the Puget Sound to the Snow capped mountains the other direction. Ate lunch in the 6/7 restaurant on site. Food was terrific and so was the view. Husband loved the Fish and Chips and I had the house special mac and cheese with chicken added - yummy! The 6/7 bar also has a very nice Happy Hour from 3 to 6. Took a 10 minute walk to the Pike Place Market to roam. Concerning issues from other reviews: did not find noise from other rooms to be any issue, open walk in shower was a delight and did not get water all over the floor, yes it is an older hotel and the hallways look a little worn - but the view and location more than made up for it. We are for sure planning to return here on out next Settle visit. Tip: In the off season be sure to ask for a deal on the room you want. We really wanted the Waterview Suite and asked for a deal over the phone and they took about $125 off the price.

although surrounded by many of the other larger 'chain' business hotels, this one retained a lot of charm. the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the rooms and services were on par with any other 4* quality business hotel. although i was there for fun, i would pick this hotel in a heartbeat if ever returning for business. It's very well located, central to the CBD, access to monorail for touristy things, and right off highway for the day trip we took.

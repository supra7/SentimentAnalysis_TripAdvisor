We were at the Sheraton for 3 nights. The hotel is currently expanding and there is quite a bit of construction, but that did not interfere with our stay. We were appointed a room on the 26th floor with a great view of downtown Seattle. The Sweet Sleeper beds are exactly that -- best nights sleep I've had in at least a year. No problems with noise, one of the quieter hotel rooms I've experienced. Pikes Market is a few blocks away, easily within a 5 to 10 minute walk. Location of the hotel is ideal for those who want to shop. The shopping district is literally outside the front door. Only complaint is there are not many restaurants in the immediate area and the restaurant in the hotel has a limited selection with sky high prices. Airport Transporter run by Gray Line is very dependable stopping at the hotel every 30 minutes.

We only had one night here but wish we had had more. The hotel is very close to the Pike St Market which is a top attraction. Seattle was where Starbucks started and the original coffee ship is still there, next to the market. The hotel is also nearby the CBD with all modes of transport at hand. The facilities in the hotel are well above average for the price charged and we will recommend anyone who's going to Seattle to stay there. It's also the home of the HQ of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and of course the Space Needle, which is a must-do!

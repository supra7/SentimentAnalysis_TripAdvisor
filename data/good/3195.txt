We have stayed at Le Crystal Montreal from December 30th to January 03 2010. I traveled from Florida with my 2 kids 6 years old and 8 months old and along with my wife we have booked our trip through Expedia which we did get great rate. After checking the pictures and reading reviews I had to give this 5 star 4 diamond hotel a visit specially under heavy snow and -2 F degrees. We have booked all our arrivals and departures through hotels Concierge Claudine (via email) she has arranged everything that I asked for along with special new years Ball at the hotel with our friends from Montreal. Hotel is located one of the best place in Montreal , new and convenient. check in and check out was great. we have stayed Deluxe suit and rooms along with amenities was excellent (spacious Bathroom) . Hotel has 1 restaurant Le Couple and Small cafe. cafe opens in the morning and closes at 3.00 pm I have tried to eat lunch there (mainly sandwiches and salads But I was pushed off by the waiter stating the sandwiches were couple of days old and he suggest I eat in the restaurant. We have dine at the main restaurant Brunch and 2 dinner nothing specially write about rude waiters and tasteless food very disappointing. We have ordered every morning Breakfast room service slow cold and many of the items missing coffe tea but no sugar omllets cold and no toast etc.. Cleanliness of the room was great and they do offer turn down service upon request. Very small bar right inside the restaurant .. I would have expect more from 5 Star 4 Diamond establishment but again we may stay again in the future

Almost all was excellent: food, drinks, service, cleanliness, pools. The only issue preventing me from returning is the lack of a wall between the bedroom and bathroom. No bathroom activities are private. If one person needs to do something in the bathroom, the spouse who is trying to sleep is exposed to the lights, sounds, etc.

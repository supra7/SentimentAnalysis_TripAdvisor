looking for a nice hotel. not expensive, nice service, great looking lodge, but old / outdated rooms. this is the place for you. Try the breakfast. Great place to stay if you are coming in the night before and going to an alaska cruise out of seattle. Take the car service to the terminal. Great service and well priced.

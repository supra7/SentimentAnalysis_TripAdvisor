We just got back from the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, had a good experience all around, evening entertainment was the best. Hospitality genuine, and the kukua beads lei at the end was so sweet. Our rooms were in the Kaui building, I'm not sure I spelled this correctly, but i think it was the older section. We had two teens with us, the room had two double beds, and a tiny bathroom-our biggest complaint was that the dresser drawers smelled weird, so we could not put our clothes into them. But on the whole it was a good experience, and a reasonable price. We would go back, loved the beach and the board walk, and it was near black rock, for snorkeling.

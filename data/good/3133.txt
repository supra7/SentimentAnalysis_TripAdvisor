Although not the greatest hotel ever, we really enjoyed our stay here. it takes 5-10 mins n the tram to all the major sights, the breakfast is fresh and varied and there's a lovely roof terrace with a pool. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we had no problems during our stay. The only thing I would say that is a drawback is that taxi's cannot find this hotel very easily. Our room was a good size, but the bathroom is a bit small with a low ceiling above the shower so if you're a large tall man I wouldn't recommend this hotel! don't bother booking a shuttle with the hotel as taxi's to and from either aiport are much cheaper.

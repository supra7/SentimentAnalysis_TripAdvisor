I looked online, but didn't find a better rate than the hotel's site, and when there's a problem, orbitz is nowhere to be found, know what I mean? Anyway, it's a clean, comfortable hotel with interesting surroundings, and amenities that you actually might want when traveling, like a 24 hour place to eat a block away and check service for your luggage after checkout. The artwork it's famous for is funky and fun, if not life-changing, and the rooms are very functional, if a little small. The beds are comfortable, the linens are decent and the service was great (inlcuding bellhops that actually earn their tips). Close to downtown and pike place don't hurt, either. For $140 for a king room it was well worth it.

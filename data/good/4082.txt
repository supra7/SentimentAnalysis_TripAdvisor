This is a very impressive hotel from the minute you walk in the door - you instantly feel like you're relaxed and going to be well taken care of, which was perfect as we were on our honeymoon. We chose a garden room, and to be honest, were a little underwhelmed. The view didn't offer much, so we decided to upgrade to a ocean view room (for an additional charge) which had two twin beds...which wasn't exactly ideal, but we couldn't turn down the view. The breakfast was OUT OF THIS WORLD, and the whole dining experience was pretty cool. I have never seen a bigger buffet in all my life. The pool area is fantastic - waterfalls, little caves, basketball hoops, etc. The staff waits on you hand and foot, and it's in a good area. Plenty of things to go on the grounds given the fact that it's not an 'all inclusive resort'. (You aren't in walking distance to the local town, but it's a short drive away. Parking at this location is quite an issue (small cramped spaces, if you can find one). Bartenders were fantastic, and met some great people! Would recommend this hotel - but we would probably try something else next time.

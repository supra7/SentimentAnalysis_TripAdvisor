24 hours after making our internet booking, we received an e-mail from the hotel thanking us and asking if they could assist us with any arrangements during our stay in Istanbul. It was this great service that we were to see again and again during our mini vacation. We stayed (2 adults and 2 children) in a suite and although the rooms were small, they were clean and very comfortable. The hotel is ideally situated within walking distance of th Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofia and there are many small outside cafes, which serve great food, along the same street. The breakfasts were good with an adequate selection of food. Even my fussy 10 year old found plenty to eat. The kitchen staff did not speak much English and my Turkish is non existent, so we did end up with some strange omelets but it was all done in such a friendly manner. After a long day of walking around the Grand Bazaar, we tried out the Turkish Bath in the basement. It was a great experience and one the children will not forget. The staff showed us what to do and then left us alone to enjoy the experience as a family, apart from the occasional pop in to make sure we were ok. Our room overlooked the street and it was great to lean out of the window and watch the street life. We did find that it was a bit noisy with the windows open though.

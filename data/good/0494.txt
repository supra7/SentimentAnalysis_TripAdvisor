Just stayed here for 2 nights. Pros: location - walking distance to space needle, lots of great restaurants nearby, kitchenette - small and very basic but it was nice to have a small fridge with a stove top for some basic cookin, price - we paid $58/night + $8 tax. Cons: street noise in the morning, $18 for parking (you could probably find street parking but this was simple), very basic breakfast, wi-fi did not work well. Overall: I would absolutely stay here again but you get what you pay. A cheap, basic (but clean) hotel room in a good location. We drove to the pikes place market from here, it was 1.2 miles but you could probably walk.

The Hotel Opera was a really nice place to stay in Rome. It is convenient to Termini and Subway and Bus transportation. I took the train from the airport and walked the short distance to the hotel. It was easy to walk or take the subway or bus to all the sights of Rome. I bought a 7 day transit pass so it was easy to hop on a bus or subway and go where I wanted. I had a single room, which was small, but roomy enough to not feel cramped. The room was spotless and looked quite new. The marble bath was very nice as well. The breakfast room was very pretty and they served a continental breakfast that was very good and got my day off to a good start. I will stay here again on my next trip to Rome.

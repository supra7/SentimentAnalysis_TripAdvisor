We arrived in Rome on September 4th to stay for two nights and the hotel we have booked had a plumbing problem so they sent us over the the Boutique Trevi. We had a problem with the taxi driver who took us over to the Hotel - he had no english and the hotel that sent us in the taxi said they had taken care of the fare. Anyway, the receptionist at the Boutique Trevi was totally professional and sorted out the problem. She was extremely helpful. Our room was small but decorated nicely. We had a lock box and a refrigerater in the room. We also had a small balcony. I have to agree with other reviews about the shower. I had to build a dam with towels after getting out of the shower so the water would not flow into carpet in the bedroom. We could not figure it out at all but we were only there for 2 nights. The breakfast was the best during our stay at four different hotels in Italy. There was a great selection and the cappiccuno was the best. The Trevi Fountain was so close you could hear the water when you stepped outside the hotel. Hopefully we will be back in Rome soon and would definately stay at the Boutique Trevi again. We would also highly recommend it.

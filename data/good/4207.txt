When we checked in, the hotel gave us a room that seemed like it was practically in the lobby - right near the Gift Shop on the first floor next to the elevator. Perhaps this was because we had gotten the room on Priceline. At any rate, with one call the front desk promptly moved us to a beautiful top floor room with a partial view of the ocean. Never hurts to ask, I guess. The interiors of the rooms are nice - especially enjoyed the new HDTV's and balconies. The gym is the the nicest I have ever seen at a hotel - with new equipment and tasty orange/lemon water. The tennis courts are beautiful and seldom used. However, we did not find the tennis pro to be helpful. He didn't seem interested in talking to us unless we were buying a lesson or a clinic and was so unfriendly we decided not to do either. The concierge was more helpful though she did seem to want to sell us expensive helicopter and snorkeling trips. The pool area is beautiful although on most days the hot tub was too cold. You have to pay 50 dollars to get the very best location of lawn chairs with direct views of the ocean, though there were plenty of lawn chairs available by the pool.

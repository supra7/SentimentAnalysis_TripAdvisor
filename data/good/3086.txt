We stayed at this hotel one night on our way to Italy. It was great to have something so close to the airport. We had a late flight arrival and early departure the next morning and although we probably could have walked, we utilized the free shuttle. The check-in & check-out process was very quick and the room was nice & modern - even had a Sleep Number bed. We got a great rate on Priceline - King room for $85!

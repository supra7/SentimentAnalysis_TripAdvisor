My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma Dec. 12-18th. The weather was cool the first two days but ended up great. We paid for an ocean view room and were upgraded to the Preferred Club (4th floor in building 25). We really enjoyed the Preferred Club lounge where we could check e-mail, meet other guests (hi Jason and Cari and Allen and crew) and have some awesome drinks from our favorite bartender Samuel (hi Sami)!!! We thought the food was good overall. We really enjoyed the Secrets Idol on Wednesday night and thought the other entertainment was hit or miss. The staff here are excellent and always say "It's my pleasure". There are a few small construction issues that need to be fixed or completed. This is a great place to go if you are looking for a little relaxation and pampering.

I just spent a night with a bunch of girls at the W Seattle this past weekend. It was a great spot to convene and rest our heads after shopping and eating out. And because of its central location in DT Seattle, you can walk to everything! I was mostly impressed with the hotel's service, as the facilities were on par with other Starwood properties. The front desk staff were helpful and happy, and almost every other staff member I came across had a smile on their face. What I Liked - the lounge area below the lobby - free wifi in the lounge - the Acura car service that would take you around the city - the lobby's coffee by morn, and infused water by day - the mattresses and sheets were ultra comfortable - the rooms are a good size, and include a long and comfy banquette beside the window What To Know - the Acrua car service only runs until 6pm on weekends - if the valet parking is busy, you have to line up on the street to get in as the loading area is tight - there's a beautiful Parisian bakery across the street called Belle Epicurean {in the base of the Fairmont} - the valet parking is $45 with taxes which is on the high-end of what city hotels {not including NYC} charge for parking. - pets are allowed.

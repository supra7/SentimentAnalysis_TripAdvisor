we had a great time at the hyatt. the hotel had two large pools that were joined by a swim-up bar that was located in a cave. the staff was very accomodating and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. we saw a luau at our hotel which was amazing, very entertaining. couples from other hotels came to this luau because they heard it was the best. do not miss it. Shopping and nightlife was located 10 min car ride away in Lahaina. we went there for dinner almost every night. fyi, the locals that we met when we were in waikiki said they vacation at this hyatt in maui quite frequently. we now know why.

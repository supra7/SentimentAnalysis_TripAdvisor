The attentive reception personnel were welcoming and had me in a room although I arrived around 1:00. I missed having no tea maker or microwave - but in the land of coffee there is something available within a block in either direction. The free transportation around downtown is offered mid-day and wasn't available to get to Pier 66 for a conference that started at 8:00 am on a Saturday. The room was huge, clean, comfortable, view was to the north over the Olympic Hotel. Easy to sleep. Despite being downtown - quiet.

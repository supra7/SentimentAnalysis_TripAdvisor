My partner and I stayed at this hotel for the Inagural Grand Prix race over the Labor Day weekend. Overall the hotel is perfect for the money. It is in an excellent location that is within walking distance to many attractions and located in what is callaed Harbor East, a fairly new part of town. It is easy to walk from the hotel to Historic Fell's Point or the the herat of the Inner Harbor. The hotel staff were very friendly, especially the morning crew for breakfast!! WE did not get to take advantage of the fitness center, but it looked wonderful, with several pools. The rooms were clean and comfortable with great views of the harbor. The only small complaint that I would make is that the carpets were a little worn. Other than that, great stay!!

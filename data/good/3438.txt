The hotel is fairly new and Maroma Beach is definitely the best beach in the Riviera Maya region and I'd also go as far as to say in most areas of Mexico. The resort has beautiful guest rooms and facilities, however I found the service and food to be quite average. All in all I did enjoy my stay as who couldn't enjoy time on the great white sand beach, although a big improvement would be to have nicer beach lounge chairs. When considering a return, I think I'd choose the Maroma Beach hotel which is just a short walk down the beach and looked like it was worth the splurge.

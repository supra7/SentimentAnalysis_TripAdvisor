Great spot close to shops and dinning but perhaps a bit too close to the highway (if you get on the wrong side of the hotel). My first room was on the side & end closest to Rt 95. After the first night, I had to have my room switched because the traffic noise, especially in the early hours (@3AM) was much too loud (tons of truck). The next 3 nights I was on the opposite side and end, and all was well. The staff was very understanding and helpful in making the switch for me.

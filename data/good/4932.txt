Parc Suites was one of the best hotel experiences Ive personally had, and a place that we agreed would be one to come back to, for the experience of the hotel alone, in the future. Upon our arrival we were immediately greeted by a friendly individual who was seemingly awaiting us in the parking lot designated for Parc Suites guests. He explained to us where the best place to park would be, and then immediately proceeded to help us to the hotel with our bags. When we arrived at the front desk, the first words out of the mouth of the owner, besides greetings, were that he would first show us around the hotel and then offer us a deal on one of the nicer sweets thereby nearly making it of equal price to a regular one. All the rooms, though fewer then a "classic" hotel, were clean and apparently freshly remodeled with few things left to be re-done. The location was good relative to the downtown/core of montreal. Ultimately there was a constant feeling of genuine consideration for our welfare in staying at Parc Suites that ranked the place among the best of any Ive stayed at.

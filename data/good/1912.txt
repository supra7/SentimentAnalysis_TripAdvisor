I stayed here with a friend in August 2011. We planned the trip for shopping and dining out. The location is amazing! Everything is within walking distance - Macy's, Nordstroms, Westlake Centre, Pacific Place, and Pike Place Market. Not too far of a walk from Belltown either, if you are interested in bars, nightlife, etc. Went to Andaluca for breakfast - so good! The hotel itself is great. Quick check-in, friendly concierge. The best part - the Heavenly Beds! Never slept so well in my life. It was so comfortable that I'm thinking about getting one. The hotel isn't super fancy, but it provides a good stay. Parking is pricey, but we didn't cab anywhere so it made up for that. Booked on hotwire for a great price.

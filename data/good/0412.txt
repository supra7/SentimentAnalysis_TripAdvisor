We got a great deal on Hotwire for this hotel. Good Downtown location, right around the block from the 5th Avenue Theatre, 3 blocks away from Westlake Center, where you can catch the monorail to the Seattle Center. They upgraded us to the 29th floor and a room with a view. The rooms were a little older but well appointed. The Regetta Bar and Grille had decent prices for food and a happy hour. We could hear the conversation of the people next door to us, so the rooms are a little noisy. You do have to pay for parking, we paid $32 plus 20% tax. But I would not hesitate to stay here again because of the great location.

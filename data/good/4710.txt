We stayed here for one night before our flight the next day, so I wanted a hotel within easy walking distance of the bus station. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, even though it was 1.30 in the afternoon, but the lady behind the desk said we could leave our luggage while we went for something to eat. When we returned our bags had been taken to our rooms. The room itself was very nice. The air conditioning worked, it was spacious enough, spotlessly clean and the bed was comfy. There were fluffy towels and plenty of toiletries on offer. However, what I really didn't like was the wetroom. We appeared to have been assigned a disabled room as there was an emergency cord, hand rails etc in the bathroom and because it was a wetroom the floor was constantly awash. Our grown-up children had a twin room next door and they had a shower cubicle - much better. Better still would have been a bath. I assumed that all rooms just had showers but since coming back I have read on tripadvisor that some people actually had jacuzzi baths - the unfairness of it all!! I would have been happy with an ordinary bath! Breakfast was fine if a little uninspiring. Be aware that if you ask for tea you get a pot of boiling water so pick up the tea bag and milk yourself. Staff were friendly and free wi-fi is available. Expensive, but then so are all of the hotels in Venice.

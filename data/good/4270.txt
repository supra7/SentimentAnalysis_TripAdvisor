My husband and I took our 17 and 20 year old sons to Hawaii for Thanksgiving, and while most of our experience was good, there were a few things that irritated us. First the good: Breakfast at Swan Court was included and was good, but get there before 8 am or the line is very long. Dinner at Cascades was great. Grounds are beautiful, include open space, and not overly crowded like the resorts further down Kaanapali. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Shampoo/lotion smell great! The not so good: We booked two rooms, in April, and had to get two oceanviews in order to have the kids next door. When we got there they tried to put them on different floors. If we wanted to be separated, I could have booked them cheap garden view rooms! After 15 minutes of insisting that it couldn't be done, miraculously they were able to do it. Be persistent! The non optional "resort fee" was $15 per day/per room. We did not use the fitness center, or the tennis, and the inroom coffee was terrible, so we paid $150 over five days to receive daily Maui newspapers. They should make it optional or just charge more for the room! Beach is not good near the hotel. Rocky and tiny. Marriott beach was no better. Spa full of small children and not very warm. Mini bar tray takes up entire dressing table in the bathroom and is motion/weight activated. Be careful not to bump it or you will have bought a $3 candy bar. We'll stay in Wailea next time.

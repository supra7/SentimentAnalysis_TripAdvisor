The W was nice, but not as nice as expected....I don't think it quite lives up to it's reputation, at least not this location. It's nice looking but a bit away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Also the bar downstairs was not as happening as I had hoped, and there wasn't much to do in the lounge. The rooms were a bit smaller than what I was used to, however the bathroom was a really good size. The one thing that annoyed me was housekeeping because I had to wait about 45 min two mornings in a row just for towels. If I had to, I would stay here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

Great staff! Stayed here for New Years Eve and the 2 days after. Such a friendly staff. The hotel bar/restuarant was a great place as well. Really liked how the hotel was done. Very contemporary look and feel. Had issues with the room that we were put into. It was very small compared to other hotels I have stayed at. Felt like it was just the extra space they decided to turn into a room. The view was not good,it was of the back alley. I would suggest getting a room that faces the street so that you can have a better view of Seattle. The bed was very comfortable so that made up for the size. The bathroom was very small as well. The shower was a one-person with a curtain that was more of a cloth that just barely reached the floor. The happy hour in the bar was priced reasonably well. The spice of the food was pretty spicy for my taste and I'm a person who likes food to be spicy. The location I thought would be closer to the Space Needle and Pike Market. The market is a little far to walk unless it's a warm day in Seattle., it's worth the walk. Same for the Space Needle. The value was relatively high but for downtown it was expected. Again like I said, for the cost I was hoping for a bigger room. The staff made up the cost by being fast and extremely friendly, all the way from the valet, bell person, front desk to room-service. Pretty much everyone we encountered that was on the clock was most hospitible I have ever experienced in any hotel.

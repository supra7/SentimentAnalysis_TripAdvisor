We really enjoyed our stay at East Houston Hotel! The location is perfect, close to restaurants and shopping in the Lower East Side / East Village. The subway is just across the street. The room was really clean and nice. The bed was very comfortable. Amazing roof deck where we had our breakfast every morning. The free breakfast was great, including a wide selection of cheeses, fresh bread, croissants, freshly ground coffe from Illy. The room was a bit dark in the evening, it would have been good with some more lighting in the bedroom. Would definitely stay here again next time we visit NYC!

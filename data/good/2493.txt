I loved this hotel! I know there are some bad reviews on it but I honestly really enjoyed it! I do however, have a few bad things to mention. The elevator is TINY. You could only fit a few people and there bags in it. This may have just been our room but there was a breeze coming in from the window. The window may need to be replaced. I didnt eat at the restraunt downstairs but there is a reason for that. They are probubly the most expenisve place in the area. WOW. But agian, I didnt eat there, maybe it was worth the money? Ok, onto the good. I love how unique it is. I dont know any other place that decorates their building quite like this. They have black and white pictures on every door and down the hall way. The rooms are great. I read another person say that the rooms are small but I did not have that problem. No it wasnt the bigest room and no the bathroom wasnt the biggest but It defintly wasnt the smallest. Its my understanding that each room is different. It defiently had a modern flair. The bathroom was just as unique as the rest of the place. Service was great, the man at the counter actually did the best he could to help us. We tried to get a room at the last minute and man did we have a problem. Fortunatly the staff was really helpful and friendly. No, it wasnt right next door to downtown but it definelty wasnt far, It was within walking distance. All in all it was a great place. If you are looking for somewhere nice, that in downtown seattle then I would defintly recommend this place.

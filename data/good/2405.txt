Visited family in Seattle that I hadn't seen for yrs. The hotel was the one chosen for my husband with his business travel. The beds were very comfortable, though the scenery for us wasn't the best, as we had the view of a parking garage. This sits only about four blocks from the Harbor, though walking there was hard for us, as the hills are so steep. We had a nice restaurant at the hotel, but they had blaring music at the bar next to it and so it wasn't the easiest place to relax in. The food was excellent, (prime rib), but the cost for the meals were a bit pricey. It was in the hub of all the best shopping places that you could find! They had numerous high designer shops all the way down to Ross for Less. They had a nice German Restaurant, called Gordon Biersch at a mall a few blocks away in a wonderful three or four story mall. Great taxi drivers in the area and all seemed hospitable and those in Seattle just seemed laid back and relaxed sort of folks. Would love to go back again. Only negative is the loud, blaring music in the bar, but if you like trendy music, then you would like that too. Saw the Seattle Space Needle, which is a must for Seattle travlers. Must have their lunch or dinner package when you are there, which is pricey, at about 100 dollars for two people, but the Space Needle rotates and you get a complete view of the Seattle horizon. One of the prettiest skylines at night that I have ever seen!!! Had to pay for internet use in room, but the package was about forty dollars for a few days. Great fish meals at the harbor! Argosy tours were great too, to see the Seattle area.

I stayed here 2 nights while in Seattle on business. Picked it because it was close to SeaTac and my business colleagues and I were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were nice and comfortable. The airport was close by but I did not hear planes taking off or landing. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They have a shuttle to/from the airport which is very useful. Also will shuttle you to restaurants if you desire. The breakfast area was nice and the food was good. I would stay here again if I travel to Seattle on business.

This hotel has an executive lounge. I don't know why someone wrote that it didn't. It is in a very good location for retail and dining but otherwise fairly standard for a Hilton. That's not bad, it just means I can't think of anything that really stood out to report. Some of the room could use some freshening to show less wear and tear.

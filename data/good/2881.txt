Only a little further out from "the strip" by Seattle airport is the Hampton Inn, Tukwila. We had a park and fly rate for $160 including leaving the car for 2 weeks. Usual good beds (after a long journey, much appreciated!), hot breakfast, shuttle to airport. Much quietet that right by the airport, although we did hear a little train noise.

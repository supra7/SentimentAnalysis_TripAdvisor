We were there for 2 weeks in late December. Having arrived late evening we were very happy to open the door out to the balcony the next morning and see the grounds ! It seemed every hedge, tree and shrub had a flower on it ! After being in the midwest and freezing the last 2 months how nice it was to smell the flowers again and hear the birds ! Our balcony overlooked one of three pools. The hotel was very quiet and we heard no loud partying the whole trip. It is a very short walk to the beach and the cabana or you can tan at the pools. The biggest pool was cold the first 2 days but heated after that. There is a banana tree and a papaya tree close to the pool and lobby. The maids were very friendly and nice. There is a golf course next to the hotel which in our opinion added to the beauty even though we are not golfers. The rooms are clean and were perfect for my wife and I. We can't wait to go again although it will probably be a long time before we can.

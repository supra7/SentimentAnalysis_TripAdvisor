My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Max this past weekend (Feb 2007). The hotel is very hip & the staff was helpful and nice. The rooms are decorated very cool & I loved all the originality the hotel offers. However, the rooms are so incredibly small. We stayed in the "Queen of Art" room & spent a lot of time tripping over each other. The biggest disappointment was the bathroom....it was so tiny you could pretty much sit on the toilet and take a shower at the same time. Also, be aware, the walls are paper thin, we could here our neighbors like they were in our room. The location of the hotel is great, within walking distance of all the downtown attractions, restaurants & shopping & their Red Fin Restaurant located in the hotel was fabulous.

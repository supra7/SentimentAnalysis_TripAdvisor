We arrived early back from an Alaskan cruise.No rooms were available at the time so after leaving our bags with concierge and a trip to get some coffee and breakfast one was available. (side note: cannot believe how quiet Seattle is early Sunday morning). Staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. I chose this hotel as my partner likes historic places and for it's great location being central downtown Seattle and near to transport such as the light rail to the airport and monorail to go to Seattle Center. The decor is subtle and feels like a average persons nice hotel from yesteryear rather than plush like a Fairmont style hotel (which is what I think many expect it to be). I went for the deluxe room as I do not like small standard hotel rooms, the room was larger than expected, but a very small bathroom. During the day the room was noisy with banging from around and upstairs, however was quiet at night. The mattress was uncomfortable for me and I woke many times during he night with a sore back (stretches and a hot shower fixed that), my partner had no problem though. Olivers and the restaurant were nice and if you want to eat on the cheap, there's plenty of places to chose from next door in Westlake Center The room was on special at time of booking, otherwise I wouldn't have chosen this hotel given the amount to chose from in Seattle. If I needed to quickly book a hotel downtown for a night I would stay here again, but if I had time I'd try somewhere else due to the mattress and normal price.

We had two rooms, one was the superior room while the other one was executive room with a balcony and a beautiful view of the city and Bosphorus. The bathroom was very nice and clean though the tubs were uncomfortably high. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating they even upgraded our room. The standard rooms are small but the executive rooms are quite comfortable. The location is just right if you want to enjoy the night life. as the bars, restaurants and clubs are walking distance. However if you want to enjoy the more cultural and tourist locations Sultanehmet would be a better bet. All in all it is a cute hotel in the heart of Istanbul with a great value for money.

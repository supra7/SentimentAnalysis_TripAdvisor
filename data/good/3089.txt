We stayed here for one night before heading to Kauai. We did call the hotel for the shuttle and it arrived within 5 minutes. The room was dated yet, it is clean with a comfortable bed. We did ride the hotel shuttle to the lightrail station (two minutes ride/ten minutes walking); the shuttle driver was profesional and courteous. We ued the lightrail and connect the famous monorail to Space needle (the fare=$18.00 for two people travel time one hour); instead of renting a car, lightrail is the way to go; we ate at the Space needle restaurant with the money we saved from transportation. The view at the rotating restaurant is amazing; food is decent. We had a wonderful time and excellent rest before our flight to Kauai. The hotel's close proximity to the airport and courteous service made our trip really enjoyable and hassle free. We had breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant before hopping on our morning flight; it is okay.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel and ompliment to the Radisson management.

We (wife, myself, & 6 y.o son) spent 4 days here at the end of November. overall experience was quite good after a rough start. we checked in on a friday and were given a room right above the front door. while it was noisy with no view, i could live with that. what i couldn't live with were the ants i found the next morning crawling all over the bathroom counter. upon finding our invited guests, we called management and they were very understanding and moved us to an oceanfront room for our trouble. they had sent staff up immediately and we were in our new room in about 15 minutes. pretty good service! oceanfront room was great. the views, waves, sunlight-- and best of all no ants. rooms are a bit dated but size is adequate This property has quite a few good things going here: the lush tropical grounds, the old-school hawaiian decor, the penguins & flamingos, open air lobby, pools, and the health club that is just unreal (even if you don't exercise you may think about starting if you walk in here). there is some shopping in the hotel if that's your thing as for the negatives, i couldn't help but feel i was getting 'nickel & dimed' as there is no free WiFi & resort fee of $15 a day. parking here is quite a walk and both lots are usually quite full. beach isn't that good and the rooms (as well as some parts of the property)could use some updating. the restaurants are on the pricey side all in all, this a quality place as positives certainly outweigh the negatives. i would not hesitate recommending this place to anyone.

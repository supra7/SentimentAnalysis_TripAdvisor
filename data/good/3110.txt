Quite a nice hotel although there is a problem parking...no enough spaces! I was told if I left to go for dinner I would lose my space and probably wouldn't find another. Restaurant for dinner was average and breakfast buffet was not good...food had been sitting for a long time and only 1 person seemed to working in the restaurant.

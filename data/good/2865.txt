Had a conferenc at this hotel and was very concerned when checking in with the amount of children and could only imagine the noise. The rooms were much quieter than I had thought. The "managers happy hour" sincerely needed more than one bartender working it - I guess they never have to worry about anyone haveing more than one, you could never make through the line to get your second! Lines for breakfast just as bad. It is not free when you pay a premium at a specail conference rate the "extras" are really not so free. On a good note the catering staff did an excellent job our conference ran smooth and the food was excellent.

Most of the reviews I have read sum trhis place up brilliantly. It is not the most plush hotel on Maui (or even on this stretch of beach) but it has other things going for it. KBH has a great location and has a brilliant atmosphere, it is more relaxed than the Hyatt and Sheraton on the same stretch, we would rgeularly sit round the bar and chat to other guests, the staff were all helpful and fun and the location is top drawer. It is cheaper than the other hotels and in my opinion friendlier than the other hotels, even little things like the number and availability of sun beds round the ball and in the grounds (several people told us the other hotels charged for these). Dont go here if you want 5 star rooms, do go here if you want a hotel in a brilliant location, with a lovely atmosphere that costs less and leaves you more spending money for other things.

Weekend stay in a Lux Suite (rate was $169) - lots of room in the Suite, a little street noise on the weekend from revellers but nothing which keeps you up. Very friendly staff and a convenient location to hit either Belltown (start at the Rob Roy for actual cocktails) or the Downtown. Tips: Remember to hit Lola during happy hour for $6.00 appetizer specials - solid effort. If you can get a special on parking, it's reasonable, but otherwise for $40 a night, there a several cheaper lots nearby.

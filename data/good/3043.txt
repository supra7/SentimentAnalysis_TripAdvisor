Booked through Priceline for 40$. Got a room with double beds, decent sized, but a bit dated. The bed was confortable. The internet is free...however, the work station is a bit small, and they still have the old CRT TVs in the hutch. The hotel offers a good gym and decent outside pool. The shuttle service is efficient, and from there, its easy to take the bus to the downtown core.

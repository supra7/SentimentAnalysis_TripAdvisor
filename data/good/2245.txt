This hotel is a good choice if you do not care for a hotel bar or big lobby as both do not exist here. What you get is a nice, stylish room (mine was very quiet, which is a big plus) and although this is a pet friendly hotel, they have pet-free rooms which was important as i am allergic to cats. What i was missing was a computer in the lobby (being one of probably only a few who does not want to carry one when travelling - for all others there is free wifi). For travellers who prefer a kimpton that is more "grand", the Monaco is just around the corner.

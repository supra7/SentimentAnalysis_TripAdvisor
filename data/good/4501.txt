This was our first trip to Maui and our travel agent recommended staying here. We trusted her judgment and we were glad we did. They really emphasize the Hawaiian culture and you can't help but be enchanted by it all. I had reads the reviews of KBH before we went and so I knew what to expect. Still, we were very pleasantly surprised by the level of service we received. We thought all the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. They all said hello whenever we passed them. Our room was awesome. Some call them dated but we thought it was very Hawaiian. It overlooked the lawns and the pool but it was very quiet most of the time. The only complaint was that we could hear people in the hallways sometimes whenever they were being very loud. A bonus of our room was that we could watch and listen to the nightly hula shows from our balcony. Overall, I would recommend the KBH for anyone who would like a nearly authentic Hawaiian experience.

A lovely, small hotel near the world famous market. They have a gym deal two blocks away. The rooms are relatively small - I was on a high floor so the noise from the main road not too bad. The beds are very comfy. The staff were very helpful and the location is fantastic - right in the middle of everything and easy walking distance to all local attractions, including shops, museums etc. Wifi is free. Valet parking is charged by the day.

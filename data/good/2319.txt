This hotel was great. I was in Seattle going through a personal crisis and the staff couldn't have been nicer. I switched to the Vintage Park from another hotel which was TERRIBLE (Hotel Max). I felt like a wandering orphan and they took me in, gave me a warm and luxurious room, free ineternet, and free booze! (They have a free wine reception every evening. Great chance for those traveling alone to converse with others.) I am extremely picky and this place did not disappoint. One small note: The wireless internet in the hotel did not "mesh" with my computer. It ended up knocking out my wireless ability. This was remedied when I got home. I think this may have been a problem with my computer rather than with the hotel's system, though I've never experienced anything like it before (thankfully).

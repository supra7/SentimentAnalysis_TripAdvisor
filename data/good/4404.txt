My new husband and I spent the first few days of our honeymoon here and enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel may seem like it needs some renovating (the rooms in particular) but the grounds are lovely, it has it's own very accessible and surprisingly quiet bit of beach. It is a very short walk to Whalers Village along the beachfront where there are some nice shops, and a few pleasant bars and restaurants. As mentioned, the rooms are a little dated but not unpleasant. Lots of space for luggage, coffee maker with complimentary Kona coffee, safe, fridge and a lovely hot shower. We had a private little balcony although we didn't use it. Breakfast was very good, lots of options and the service was good. We made good use of the valet parking which was only a couple of dollars more although the proximity to shops and restaurants meant that we had the option of not having to take the car just to get something to eat and also not being limited to the hotel restaurant. I'd definitely recommend this hotel if you want something fairly laid back and comfortable and don't need the frills of a luxury chain hotel.

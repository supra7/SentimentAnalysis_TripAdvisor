Just returned and wanted to add a few things (other than aaagh! I miss Maui!). First, while the construction/refurbishment you may have already read about does detract from the overall experience and leave one wondering what the covered bits look like, overall this is a lovely hotel with much to offer. Hopefully the fix-ups will be done soon. The hotel itself is obviously older, but is so extensive and the grounds so pretty that ultimately it doesn't really matter. Many, if not most, hotels are like this in Hawai'i at any rate...the beautiful scenery takes center stage. Very good service, from front desk to maids to restaurant staff; all attentive, welcoming and friendly. The pools and grounds are very nice with waterfalls and much tropical foliage. Well defined and really fun kids' area keeps other areas mostly adult-oriented. Grotto bar and pool slide add interest, and there is a fair choice in restaurants, although it'll cost you a pretty penny to eat there, eg. two burgers and onion rings at U'malu = $50, two plates of pasta at Swan Court with tip = $85 (no drinks!). If this is no worry, ie. you've loads of cash or it's a business write off, then enjoy! Otherwise, I'd say get a rental car and go explore the island...there are SO many great places to see and lots of more affordable and delicious food options ranging from breakfast to dinner. Note that self-parking spots are TINY - very narrow - so choose your rental car accordingly. A quick note on the Ka'anapali area - it's very clean and safe, not to mention beautiful. You can walk along the beachside walk to other hotels and to the Whaler's Shopping Village, or you can drive (shops will validate your parking if you buy something), or take the trolley which runs often.

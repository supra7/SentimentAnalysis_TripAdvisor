As with another review we were concerned about what rooms we would be given having booked through 'TravelRepublic.co.uk'. We were given two first floor rooms, both with balconies. Spotlessly clean and the staff were helpful. We did have a problem with the air conditioning in the rooms not working - even after two attempts to have this fixed - didn't detract from our stay however. Make use of the roof terrace, especially at night! Breakfast is typical continental-style fair and the staff are polite and helpful. The Metro line is only 8-10 minutes away and takes you straight into town. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you want a pleasant quiet stay in Rome. We shall be staying here again!

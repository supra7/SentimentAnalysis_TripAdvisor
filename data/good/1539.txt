We booked our vacation through a travel agent in Redding,California through Clipper vactions.Because of the negative reviews on this website we asked the travel agent to book us in at the Paramount Hotel after our return from the San Juan Islands. When we arrived in Seattle on Amtrak at 9:00 pm we were pleasantly surprised at the very large and CLEAN rooms. Had we known it would be this nice we would have stayed the whole time we were in Seattle as it was every bit as nice as the Paramount. The staff was excellent (except for Andy who could use a little attitude adjustment) and we were very pleased with our stay and with the restaurant Thank you for a very pleasant stay. We would highly recommend your hotel to our friends going to Seattle.

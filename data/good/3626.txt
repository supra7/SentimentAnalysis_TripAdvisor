My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma from August 24 thru August 30 for our honeymoon. Overall, it was a wonderful vacation. The resort is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. The beach is gorgeous and the pool is wonderful. We stayed in room 1610 which is a swim out suite room. The swim out suite was awesome. And the room was very nice. My only complaints are the service issues and with any new hotels, you know they need the time to work out the kinks. My main issue was the rule about the men wearing LONG PANTS and closed toe shoes to the 2 upscale restaurants (The Italian and the mexican restaurants.) Due to the fact that we did not know about this policy ahead of time, my husband did not bring long pants. It was also 100 degrees everyday and long pants would have been uncomfortable in the heat. We were actually turned away at the hostess desk of the restaurant for not following the "dress code". Their suggestion was to buy pants at the gift shop. The most inexpensive pair were $70 US! I even went to speak with the concierge and the manager on duty to have an exception made, but to no avail. So needless to say, we did not have the opportunity to eat at these 2 upsale restaurants during our stay. This really upset me! Another annoying thing was the TV in the room. The ON DEMAND movie channel went out for 2 days while we were there. The explantion was that it would be up and running "any minute". Also one day we waited for room service for 1 hour and 35 minutes. And the housekeeping service really had no schedule when they came to clean your room. Sometimes it was early in the am and sometimes late at night. We went for 2 nights without the room being cleaned. The hotel is beautiful and the beach is amazing...they just have a LONG way to go before that can earn their supposed 4 star status. The service issues are MAJOR!

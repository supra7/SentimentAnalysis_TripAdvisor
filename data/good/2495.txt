We picked this hotel, after reading TA reviews, based on location and price. We looked forward to two days of downtown Seattle, prior to an Alaskan cruise, so location was key. We also hoped to not spend $200 + a night for a room that we'd only be using for showers and sleep. Hotel Max was perfect for all of the above. We were able to walk to everything, including Pikes Place, the waterfront, etc. The Max staff were more than accommodating, including car to departure pier on cruise day. Our room was small (as anticipated from reviews), but provided all we needed, clean, crisp and comfortable. A good bed is always appreciated by older backs, the linens were nice and a modern decor that I like. We had a view of the Needle, which when lit at night was especially pretty. After a long day of walking we popped into the Red Fin, next door, for happy hour cocktails & appetizers. We enjoyed it so much that we changed plans to eat elsewhere and stayed for dinner. It was busy, young, fun, very tasty, great service & our tired feet loved the short walk to our room. The artwork and photos in the hotel are fun. This boutique hotel might not suit travelers looking for more roomy, luxurious space, but if your stay is to experience downtown Seattle from a clean, comfortable and great location I'd certainly recommend it.

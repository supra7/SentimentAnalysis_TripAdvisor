The Mayflower Park hotel is a "historic" hotel, so it may not have all of the amenities (flat screen tv, large bathroom) of a newer hotel, but it served our needs for a short three day trip to Seattle. It's just a few blocks from the market, so it was great to start the day with breakfast from one of the bakeries and overall very central to the typical tourist stops in Seattle. The staff was very friendly and the free wifi is always appreciated (and should be standard in hotels) - they also had two computers in the lobby for guests to use. We did not stop at the bar in the lobby, but it looked very inviting. Overall a nice stay. One other tip if you do not rent a car (and if you enjoy exploring cities on foot, a car is not necessary and saved us quite a bit of money in parking) - definitely consider the "Downtown Airporter" to/from the airport. The taxi ride is $40+ and the Airporter picks up at a hotel very close to this one and was only $11 per person.

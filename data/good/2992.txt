1st let me say having checked around this was by far the best value for a 7 day Park & Fly $119...Having said that this hotel; is helpful,convenient,, free internett great breakfast till 9.20am everything was great. I must comment that compared with the other Quality Inn Hotels this one is dated, definitely needs a face lift . But that being said great value for money a 1/2 night stay is fine

I stayed here for business, it is located just off the I5 and is 10min walk from pike place market. They have soo much shopping all around. If you go to seattle make sure you do the market stroll and go to the original starbucks down there all very cool to see. The Westin is very nice, the rooms were a bit smaller then I expected but I guess when downtown they try to use as much space as possible. The rooms were clean and I would stay again strictly for location. We also were on the 20somtheing floor so very nice view. I am not sure how much it cost as it was a business trip so I can't judge whether I would pay what they charge to stay there again but overall a decent hotel.

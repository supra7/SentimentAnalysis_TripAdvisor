My husband and I arrived at the Hyatt Maui after spending a week in Kauai. We were very pleased with the hotel- got upgraded to the Regency Club on the top floor as soon as we arrived. The hotel is beautiful and everything is open. We were greeted by parrots and penguins! Our room was a gorgeous ocean view suite which we enjoyed very much. The pool was awesome and we spent a lot of time there. One drawback was that we had to get up early to reserve a beach chair in the shade but I am an early bird so it was no problem. The food was incredible- I loved the fish tacos at the poolside grill. The beach could have been better...it was short and not much room to relax on it. In Kauai we spent all of our time on the beach but in Maui we spent it all in the pool. All of the restaurants at the hotel were delicious! We attended a honeymooners activity and met a lot of other nice honeymooners. We took a cooking class and it was really fun! The swim up bar was great too. My husband and I enjoyed the water slide :) Whaler's Village is just a short walk so the location was great. We had views on Lanai and Molokai from our room- beautiful. We rented a convertible and toured the island. We really loved the north west part of the island and saw many gorgeous beaches. We took a snorkeling trip to Lanai one day and it was okay but I wouldn't recommend it. We saw some pretty fish but nothing spectacular. The sailing trip in Kauai was much better. The hotel was easy to get around and we were never bored. We had a wonderful trip and would definitely go here again! We ate dinner off of the resort quite a bit in Lahaina and one of our favorite's was Longhi's- absolutely delicious Italian food! Lahaina is packed with great little shops, art galleries and restaurants. We enjoyed our time there. We heard great things about the Lahaina luau from other couples but we did not get a chance to get there. Our honeymoon was spectacular and we loved staying at the Hyatt!

I stayed only one night in a Superior Queen room with one of the hotel's "Hot Escape" rates, August 2011. I was in Seattle, sadly only for one night, to meet my sister in law and niece who were coming to visit from Munich. I must say the hotel was perfectly fine. The front desk staff were superb; nice, friendly and professional (typical of Pacific Northwest people). We were in different rooms types on separate reservations but were accomodated on the same floor of the hotel. The room was great, looking out on Spring Street. It was a little careworn, but very clean and the bed, built in drawers and other furniture was in good condition. The hotel was obviously older and had lots of interesting places to put things. The bathrobes in the closet are always a nice touch. The bathroom was very nice, on the small side, but well appointed (shower/tub combo was great). I don't need a huge bathroom, since it is only used for a very limited number of necessities; however there was plenty of shelf space to put toiletries, etc. on. We didn't use the inhouse restaurant, but did have a lite breakfast in the Seattle's Best Coffee shop in the hotel. The hotel's location is wonderful!!!! We parked the car (using the self park option in the garage right next door) and didn't need it at all for the day and a half we were in Seattle. You can walk everywhere, so convenient to everything. Slept well the one night as the bed was comfortable and check out the following day was easy. We stored our bags for much of the day without a hitch. I would stay again next visit to Seattle, location, rate and comfort were all A+.

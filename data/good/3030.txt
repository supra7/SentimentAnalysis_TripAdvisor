Walk to this very nice hotel from Sea-Tac, skip the rental car and hop on the light rail to downtown minutes from your front door. Staff was awesome---pool is seasonal, good hot tub though. Breakfast is fantastic. Bathroom had one issue but easily taken care of---other than that a clean room. This is a conference center so there are great amenities. I booked on Priceline and got a great rate but will be making this my Sea-Tac hotel of choice in the future. If you can't or don't want to eat at the hotel 13Coins (open 24 hours) is right down the street. STAY HERE! Bummer, no fridge in the room or free internet, oh well. Very comfy bed---could hear hallway noise somewhat.

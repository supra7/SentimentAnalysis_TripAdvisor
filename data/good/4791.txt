My room was large & airy. Breakfast was great. The WiFi worked ok once I got it translated. The WiFi provider is http://www.hotsplots.de/en/ and you can find setup help under "Support & Downloads" Very good location. Bus stop just down the road for service 249 that will take you to the Zoo station. Also Hohenzollernplatz metro station on the U3 line. The only problem I has was the lack of cleaning. The communal bathroom was not cleaned in the week I was there or my room bin emptied. Apart from that it was great. I would defiantly go back.

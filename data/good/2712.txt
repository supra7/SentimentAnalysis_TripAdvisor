We stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport for our early morning flight. Although there was a queue at check in the staff offered us warm cookies and appologised for the delay. We were given a free room upgrade (we are Hilton Honors members). The room was a bit basic and dated but it was inexpensive and we could leave our car in their car park while we were on holiday. Shuttle to the airport every 20 mins 24 hours. The restaurant also had good food (we were given a $10 per person coupon to use in the restaurant from the hotel). Friendy waiter/waitress staff.

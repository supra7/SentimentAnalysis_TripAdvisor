My family stayed in March 2006 and reserved the garden view room w/breakfast for $220. This is the best deal on Kaanapali Beach. The staff there is incredible. This is not a chain - this is a family taking care of you. We were lucky and were upgraded to ocean view - just a few feet from the water. We left the glass lanai door open and slid the wood shutter door closed - and listened the waves all night. By far the most Hawaiian beach stay we had. The bedding is showing its age, there was not an elevator in our building - so do not go here for the facility. There is good entertainment at the Tiki Bar at night - not quite a luau - but good Hawaiian song and dance. The check-out ceremony is a classy touch. The staff presents each guest with a nut lei - not a cheap lei. These are $8 each at the ABC store.So, a nice touch for a family of four. The concierge is great. Within minutes, we were booked on a whale watch at the time we wanted. Go here for the location and the staff. The value is the best.

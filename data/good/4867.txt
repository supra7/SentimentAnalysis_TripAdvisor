The rooms are recently renovated and the hotel is very clean. The staff is helpful and cordial, the location is excellent (near the Termini station and a large street but nevertheless quiet), and breakfast very nice and satisfactory. The only negative point was the size of the room, but for Rome standards nothing unusual.

Stayed here for two nights on our way to Canada in August 2009. Loved the bed and the pool. The shuttle worked really well and its really close to the airport. So close that we walked to the airport to pick up our rental car the morning after our arrival. No problems at all to find parking space and the South Center Mall is just minutes away by car.

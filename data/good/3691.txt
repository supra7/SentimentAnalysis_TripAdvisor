My boyfriend and I booked this hotel after spending hours trying to decide where to stay on our first visit to Rome. We were pleased with our choice. The location of this hotel is fantastic and lots of attractions in easy walking distance. After an eight our flight delay and soaked with rain we were delighted to receive a warm welcome by the reception staff and bags taken to our room by a Porter. Our room was spacious with excellent soundproofing. Decor was in keeping with the Roman theme. Only faults with the room were thelack of tea/ coffee facilities and our shower head holder was broken. We didn't bother complaining as these were not a huge issue with us. Breakfast was fine for our needs. A variety of meats and vegetarian options, alongside various sweet choices. On checking out, the reception staff asked if we wanted to use their taxi service. This cost fifty euros and well worth the money. We got there stress free and in a nice Mercedes salon. This wasn't a cheap hotel. However, we would definately return to Rome and stay again at this hotel

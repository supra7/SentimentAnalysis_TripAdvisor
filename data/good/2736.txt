We stayed on a BUSY saturday night. When we arrived 2 of 4 elavators worked (about 2pm). By 6pm only 1 worked! We were on the 9th floor and traveling with a baby so we waited 15 mins one time. next morning still only 1 elavator worked. This is the only negative thing I have to say. Shuttle service to airport was great! Room was clean and comfortable. Service was excellent.

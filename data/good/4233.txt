Have stayed here 4 times, this time for 9 nights. Positves 1) Great location 2) Beautiful Atrium Lobby and Well kept clean grounds 3) Friendly wonderful helpful staff 4) Great Breakfast Buffet 4) Comfy Beds 5) Addition of Umala Bar Restaurant GREAT 6) Clean rooms. Negatives 1) I realize this is an older hotel but for what we pay the rooms and bathrooms can use some major updating, bathrooms majorly small, need new sinks and bath fixtures, balconies small 2) this was my 4th stay and for 9 nights and they would not upgrade us even though hotel was not at full capacity 3) our room had musty odor and we had to keep the slifding glass door open to get fresh air in Hyatt really needs to upgrade and update the rooms and bathrooms otherwise GREAT place. Also the Otter Pops at the pool ROCK!!!

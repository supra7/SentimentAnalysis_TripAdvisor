We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel (my wife and a bunch of my family) right after the New Year. The hotel was quaint and felt more like a local hotel than some of the resorts nearby. The rooms were clean and decent. We enjoyed the hula show in the evening and some of the food at the bar area. The Ka'anapali Beach itself is awesome for swimming. It was very calm and warm. At night, walks along the beach or along the path that runs the length of the beach, is absolutely terrific. Our only complaint was that our bill got really messed up. It was probably because some of my family members switched rooms and that caused all sorts of confusion about the package, but it involved a bunch of emails and calls that eventually got things cleared up. I'd definitely stay again...but would be careful about any itinerary changes ;)

Enjoyable stay for the price and amenities. It's European-style hotel. The building is old, but the furniture is classic style and comfortable. No A/C on upper floors, but able to open windows. Terrific grocery nearby (metropolitan market) and good restaurants as well. Next to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project, Science Center). Far from Pike Market and Waterfront, but Inn shuttle is available during the day. Parking is very tight. There are limited hotel spaces, but you can usually find parking along the street for a fee for 1-2 hours. Parking after 6 p.m. is free on the streets, but you have to move the car by 8 am Reported a slow toilet, but it was fixed immediately. Staff is responsive.

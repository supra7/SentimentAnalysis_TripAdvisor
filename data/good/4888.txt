We were booked into Hotel Sonya but due to over bookings were given a room in the Hotel Opera Roma( Sister hotel). The hotel rooms were comfortable and very clean, but lacked information regarding the services available ie how to obtain internal phone lines, mini bar price list etc ( minor irritation).The staff were friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was excellent both in choice and quality.The hotel is in a perfect position for most of the famous sites especially the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. There are many places to eat locally which offer value for money. I would certainly stay here again and would reccomend to others.

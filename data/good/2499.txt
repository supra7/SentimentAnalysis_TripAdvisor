We stayed here in August 2010 as well. One plus is the staff seemed much improved. Last year the front desk was surly and rude and we had difficulty getting our room cleaned. We gave it a second chance this year due to the fabulous location and good price. It is very close to public transit (we took train from airport to Westlake station. It was an easy walk to hotel even with luggage). You can walk to many restaurants, shops and attractions including Pike Place Market area. The staff was very friendly and responsive this year. Yes, the rooms are small but we had a great view of the Space Needle from our room and the bed is very comfortable. The Wi-fi worked great in the room as well. The big negative was the noisy a/c unit. It could make falling asleep difficult. We would go back again.

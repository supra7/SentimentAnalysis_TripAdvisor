This is not only a great hotel if you are travelling in and out of seatac but, as they are suites, its great if your also visiting seattle. Its 3 minutes from a massive shopping mall, 10 mins to downtown seattle and not far from the museum of flight which is brilliant. Rooms were clean and smart and we stayed in one of the renovated rooms which was loverly...room 405 i think. Staff varied from overly helpful to kinda grumpy but that didnt affect our stay!

A hip hotel, ideally situated, with good energy and containing a great restaurant, Lola. The staff are exceptional and the rooms are tastefully appointed. However, the mattresses on the bed are third-rate...odd given the attention to detail in the rest of the property. Not a good night's sleep, which is unfortunate given the hotel's other fine qualities. Time for a mattress change!

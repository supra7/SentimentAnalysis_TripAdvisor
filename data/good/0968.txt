Booked this hotel for a week long conference where my husband came along for a much needed break and we had a wonderful stay here. Staff were all great and the room service was perfect. We ate most of our meals in the hotel restaurant and have to say a huge thank you to Robert and Mark for the best service ever!!! The only complaints we have is that the room TV screen seems to be set on the wrong setting as the picture is very distorted and the rooms air conditioner allows the sound of the outside wind to come into the room and it was extremely loud where we had trouble sleeping over it and our final comment....the parking cost is outrageous at $30 a night plus $6 car tax...$36 for a staying guest is just way too much to add onto the price of your room each night. Other than the points mentioned we had a wonderful time here and it was within walking distance to everything we needed and the hills were not too bad to walk as some mentioned. The cocktail lounge was a real treat after an afternoon out shopping and makes the best Cucumber Martini ;-)

I stayed at The Moore a few years ago by accident. I had booked a place online that turned out to be a total dump when someone on the street recommended The Moore as a safer, bargain-alternative for a friend and I. We found it pretty bare bones but clean and with friendly staff that made us feel at home. Coming back a few years later, it appeared the place had a bit of a facelift- some new paint, upgrades to the room, etc. It is still pretty basic: a smallish TV and not much else in the way of amenities but the bed was comfy and the room clean. The place has some cool history and the room, despite the recent coat of paint, had some funky touches: big ol' Victorian bathtub, noisy but quaint furnace in the room, etc. The Nitelite Bar downstairs is also superconvenient if you want to stay close to the hotel but go have a drink/bite to eat. On the subject of convenient, that is probably the best thing about this place: the proximity of the hotel to Pike Place, shopping, the Seattle Art Museum, etc. etc . Great place to stay on a budget esp. if you don't want to rent a car and want to hoof it around the downtown!

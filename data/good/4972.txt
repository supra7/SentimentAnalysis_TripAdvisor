Right outside the front steps of the hotel are convenience stores, bars, & shisha bars. You need not venture fare to get to the Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Spice Markets etc. The hotel is clean, has free wifi at the lobby (at time of visit), a rooftop restaruant with good view of the city, but is a bit older. Friendly helpful staff, and the elevator was a plus for heavy luggage.

Once into our room the front desk called to see if everything was to our liking. We were on the 32nd floor and looking right into a construction crane - they moved us to the 42nd floor, much better view, same room. Stepping into the "heavenly" shower this morning, the smell of mold smacked my nose - the mold was growing between the tiles... maybe the room hadn't been let for a while but you'd think the Westin would do better than this... I love the Westin chain but that was disappointing. Oh, the internet access cost $19/day. Free in the lobby.

My flight was canceled and I had no choice but to stay over for the night. Going back into Seattle was not an option because I was re-booked for a flight departing at 5:40am. Given that it was already 10:30pm by the time my original flight was canceled all I wanted to do was go to sleep. The area at SEA_TAC where you wait for the hotel shuttles is full of fumes, ugly and overall unpleasant. This is no fault of the hotel but it does make for a good impression. Also, the wait for the shuttle seems like it took too long. Although the shuttle driver was quite pleasant. Check-in was a little slow as 10+ people exited the shuttle at the same time and all headed toward check-in. It would have been nice if there was a swing person at the front desk to accommodate the sudden influx of guests. The walk to the room was ridiculously long. The corridors seem to go on forever and ever. The carpets are hideous. Who designs those things?! The room was a amply sized with king size bed, nightstand, desk and chair, lounge chair, flat screen tv, and console. The bed was surprisingly comfortable with soft sheets, good pillows and a nice weight comforter. If it were not for the bed I would give a 3.5 rating to the hotel but the bed was so comfy that I boost the rating to a 4.

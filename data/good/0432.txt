We were heading to a Mariner's game, and this appeared to be one of the only places with rooms available that didn't cost an arm and a leg. We booked a room with a king size bed, for one night...the cost was just over $200 (American), not including $32 dollar valet service (the only option for parking there). Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very friendly front desk worker (Silver), who told us she could offer us a lower rate if we switched rooms. The room being offered was one of the big suites on the 34th (top) floor. The only catch was that the bed was actually two small roller style beds, pushed together. After going to check out the room, we decided to go for it (the rate was amazing, about $88 dollars for the night). Plus, Silver threw in complimentary appetizers, continental breakfast, and agreed to waive our valet parking rate. It took about 15-20 minutes to walk from the hotel to Safeco Stadium (the walk on the way there is mostly downhill). We were warned about walking through the Pioneer Square area at night on the way back (it's sort of a party place), but it was fine. All in all, the hotel provided a decent home base for our one night stay -- and we were very pleased with the friendly & thoughtful service at the front desk. I might have actually ranked them "average" instead of "very good" if not for the service. By the way, the roller beds weren't bad at all -- maybe not as comfortable as a regular bed, but we still got a good night's sleep. Plus, the view was great! Not a bad option if you're in town for a game.

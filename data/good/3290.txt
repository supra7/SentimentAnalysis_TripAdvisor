We are staying here at the secrets maroma and the people waiting on us are wonderful. We have had a few issues with a cold shower and a mixup on the room not being an ocean view when it was promised but after talking to hector at the front desk we worked it out. We are midway through our week here and i would rate it very good. the weather has been rainy and cloudy a lot but it is still nice. we have our sons who are 22 and 2o and they are enjoying the sports and the all inclusive. Roberto our concierge has done a good job too.

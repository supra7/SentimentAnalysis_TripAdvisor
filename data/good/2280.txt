I was very impressed with this hotel. My room was very large (I believe I was upgraded to a suite - without asking). The staff were friendly, the rooms were very clean, and the bed was super comfortable. I really like Kimpton's committment to the environment with Aveda bath products, recycling cans, and natural food in the mini bar. AND, I signed up with the Kimpton rewards program and at check-in, got a certificate for $10 worth of items free from the mini-bar. The evening wine reception was nice, as was the free chair massage. The 'fitness center' was extremely small, with only three machines and a tiny space to use weights. If it wasn't for that, I would have given this hotel 5 stars. The location was great as well.

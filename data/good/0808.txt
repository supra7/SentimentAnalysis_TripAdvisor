We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and had a European room. The room was large and clean and the bathroom was down the hall. It had just been painted so was as good as new. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and there was free internet access in the lobby. The hotel is situated a couple of blocks from Pike Street Market and the major shops, and about a 15 minute walk from the Space Needle. For the price you couldn't ask for anything better.

Walking distance to Seattle airport.Hotel price is reasonable. Suite room is nice, a small living room and bed room. Bed and matterss are comfortable and adjustable, Housekeeping did a good job. But their reception staffs are not really experience. They told me Suite Room and Business Room are exactly same, and dowbgraded me from Suite Room to Business Room due to Suite Room is still unavaible. However both room are totally difference size and style. Also, need 20 minutes walking distance to light rail station. If you hope more convenience, suggest you look for hotel which 5 minutes walk to lightrail station.

This hotel is next to the San Diego Convention Centre and within very walkable distance. What impressed me was the impeccable reception service. They served me very efficiently, and most importantly, also in a very friendly manner. The room I had was very fresh and true to what the hotel claimed - it was allergen-free! I did not know how they did it - I did not develop any usual allergic reactions such as runny nose - as I usually had due to my chronic rhinitis. The only downside was my room was facing the Dole container yard. I did not have the luxury of paying an extra USD20 to upgrade to a sea facing room. Anyway, it was great staying there during my conference at the Convention Cetnre.

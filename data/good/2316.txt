I first stayed at the Vintage Park 8 years ago. They are part of the Kimpton hotel chain, which I have also stayed at in San Jose, CA. Their hotel is pet friendly-which I appreciate because we were travelling with our dog. Some hotels will only allow pets in smoking rooms but this is not the case here. We like the Vintage Park because although you are in a large city, it has the feeling of being at a country inn with the inviting fireplace and comfy overstuffed furniture in the lobby. Another wonderful feature is the free wine service in the lobby in the evenings. After we had a few glasses of wine in front of the fire with other guests, we went into the restaurant for dinner. The gourmet dinner was excellent. The only negative input I have is that the room seemed to be a bit tired, and needs some freshening up. Also, there was a $30 per night charge to park your car, which I did not expect. That seemed a bit steep when we paid $179 per night and dinner over $100.

We have had a relaxing stay at this hotel in Jan 2011 The food was best we have had in Mexico, breakfast delicious ( except NO freshly squeezed orange juice was served). Cocktails just perfect. Outstanding staff, very friendly & engaging. The rooms are beautifully designed. The only thing I could complain a little was the beach. It is certainly with a lot of " character" & you have to wear shoes if you want to go for a swim in the sea, walking over little coral formations & tiny sea urchins. Also depending on the time of the day & wind there is a smell of fuel & often noise from the jet-ski's going up & down along the beach stretch, sometimes very close to the swimming area which is cordoned off for safety. Overall I would recommend this hotel.

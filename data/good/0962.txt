This was a beautiful hotel. The service was great and the room was very comfortable. The staff gave us an excellent recommendation for a restaurant. We walked to Pioneer Square and did the underground night tour. It was a bit of a hike, especially the 5 or so blocks up hill on the way back. I would stay here again, though.

Recently spent 2 nights here and will definitely stay here again. The staff were very helpful, and went out of their way to help us (we booked an extra room at the last minute and asked for this to be close to the other room we had booked, and if possible with a bath for my little one, and they sorted things really well for us). The breakfast was great (and in a lovely airy bright room on the roof). The rooms were compact, but well equipped, though would have liked tea/coffee facilities in the room.

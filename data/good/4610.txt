I returned from the KBH a couple days ago, and just wanted to say that those who think this place isn't very nice are total snobs! I am a travel agent, and have seen the worst and have stayed at the best. The KBH is definately one of the best! The staff was wonderful. The food, though a bit pricey I thought, was very good....not really excellent! We had a bunch of fun at the Tiki Bar and ate a couple times at the Tiki Grill. Our room was big and roomy and always clean. We left a few things behind when we checked out. When I called to inquire, I was told that the according to the "Log book" there was more than just a couple of items of clothing! The head of housekeeping started naming off all the things we left behind....which we didn't want to bring back...like candy bars, chips, crackers...! They were more than happy to send our clothes back to us, which I thought was awsome! Most hotels would say..."Sorry....can't find it...tough luck!" The KBH is in a great location. Spent a lot of time at Whalers Village. Hung out at the Rusty Harpoon when we wern't at the Tiki Bar. Rudy and the boys were fun! When you see them...ask them to play Free Bird!! (inside joke...but Rudy'll get it!) Next year my daughter and son-in-law will be renewing their vows at the Kaanapali so I'll be making another trip for the ceremony and I can't wait!! Aloha!

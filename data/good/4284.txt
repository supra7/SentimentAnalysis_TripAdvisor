The Hyatt at Kaanapali Beach is really a nice property for an older resort. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and the friendly, helpful employees. Their beach access isn't the best, but hey...all we had to do was walk a little further. The view was spectacular. I also had a scalp massage at the Spa Moana. It was wonderful. My husband used the spa/sauna facilities and really enjoyed it. There are better, more ritzy resorts on Maui, but we got a great package deal that included our rental car and daily buffet breakfast for 2. Kids under 5 eat free which was cool! I really can't complain about anything!

I treated my husband to a surprise getaway to Seattle to see one of our favorite bands. We stayed overnight at The Edgewater. The moment we drove onto the hotel property, I was impressed. A circular driveway complete with water feature and two-way fireplace greeted us as we stepped into the rustic, lodge-like lobby. We felt as if we were far from home (really, only 50 miles north of Seattle) because it felt like vacation. The reception desk was timely and courteous in checking in. We found at time of check-in we'd been upgraded from a waterside room to a waterfront room which turned out to be just breathtaking! Views of Elliott Bay on a perfect, sunny day greeted us as soon as we entered our room. Our room was spacious, our bed perfectly comfortable, and the bathroom beautiful with its slate shower and flooring. Perfect, relaxing and beautiful night away. We had reservations at the restaurant, Six Seven....the food was divine! The wait staff impeccable and professional, yet friendly. The concierge was most helpful in ordering us a taxi downtown. The next morning, we ordered breakfast in our room and were again blown away by the quality of food....we're still talking of it a day later! Overall, The Edgewater is a place we will return to and recommend to our friends and family.

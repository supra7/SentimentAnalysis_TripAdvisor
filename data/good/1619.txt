My husband and I stayed in a luxe suite for three nights in late August. I got a good deal on hotels.com for a package that included a $40 per night coupon at one of the Tom Douglas restaurants and parking. The other reviews generally capture the pluses and minuses of the hotel. Pluses -- rooms are nicely designed, and the location is excellent. I wouldn't describe the decor as ultra-hip, but modern and comfortable. The minuses -- the bathroom is small and not luxurious at all (basically a minimally remodeled older style bath from the 1930s or 40s); the internet access is not good (I had assumed it was free since it didn't say there was a charge on the internet, and there is a $10 charge, which I find annoying); and the service was on the poor side. This isn't a rant, but we checked in at 3 pm, our room was not ready, the front desk said we couldn't leave the bags in the room, and no effort to try to compensate us in some way -- not a really big deal, just tiresome and not the kind of thing that makes you feel like the service was great. No coffee in the lobby in the morning, which would be a nice touch.

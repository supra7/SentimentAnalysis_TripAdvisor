First time in Montreal and I did select this hotel based the positive reviews found in this web site. And I was absolutely happy for that. The service is really attentive , the location is perfect and within walking distance of the centre of the city. I had a deluxe suite , perfect and very comfortable. Nice additional tip the Nespresso Coffee machine for a nice espresso coffee. Excellent breakfast for quality of food and fantastic lunch at the Brasserie Restaurant. So I was really satisfied with my choice and next time I will be staying again at the Hotel Le Cyrstal.

The resort is beautiful, the grounds were immaculate, the rooms were charming and lovely, the smells were horrid, and the food was not even edible. I have not seen every beach in the world, but this one has to be one of the best in the world. Do NOT eat at the buffett by the pool for lunch unless you want to spend about $160.00 to have the resort MD to administer treatment for food poisoning. (this was my experience-disclaimer). I spent the last two days of our 4 day retreat in bed wishing someone would shoot me. The dinners were just plain weird and not in a gourmet kind of way. The deserts actually had gone through a de-flavoring process of some kind. The service was great and everyone spoke English with the exception of the housekeeper who refused to leave us alone until she made a duck out of our towel. I don't know what the heck was going on but the odors were enough to knock you over. I would recommend staying here, just be aware of what you eat. When I asked the driver what other resort he would recommend he said Maroma resort is the best (a couple north of secrets), but it is not AI as I understand and it is smaller. I must also add that the entertainment was really fun. OMG the beach was heavenly and the spa was crazy beautiful. Oh ya, and free internet.

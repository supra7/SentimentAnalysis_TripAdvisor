We loved it so much last year that we opted to return for our second honeymoon despite the fact that we rarely visit the same place twice. We once again had a wonderful trip, but there were a couple of changes since our last visit that we weren't as pleased with. Now upon check-in you are directed to a staff member under the guise of receiving resort coupons. Unfortunately, this is actually only a ploy to get you in front of one of their time share agents who don't easily take "no" for an answer. It wasn't my favorite way to begin my vacation. It does impact what used to be a serence environment as you are constantly seeing agentg giving people proptery tours while you are trying to relax in the sun. The other frustrating thing this year was the "no saving seats" policy at the pool. I fully understand the need to have a plan to keep people from coming down in the middle of the night to save their chairs only to sleep until noon before coming down. However, for someone who gets to the pool between 7:00am and 8:00am because we love the relaxing morning it is a frustrating policy because if you leave your chair for more than 30 minutes prior to 10:30 your belongings are removed from your chair. This means you cannot go to breakfast or a beach walk until after 10:00. I'm quite sure that was not the intent of the policy, but that is how it has played out. Despite all of this, we do love Secrets Maroma and we did have a wonderful vacation.

I stayed at the University Inn over the Labor Day weekend. The inn is a mere 20 mins drive from Sea-Tac airport, which is great because my husband and I only got into Seattle at midnight. The hotel, though not located exactly downtown, is a stone's throw away from most of the city's attractions eg. Pike Place Market, Space Needle. The public bus is convenient, if not, the free shuttle service offered by the inn is also a great way to travel. The inn is clean and pretty roomy. Beds are comfy and clean and the free wireless internet is certainly useful! Breakfast is wonderful, the only complaint I have is that there are hardly enough tables to go around in the breakfast area. However, they do offer trays so you can always take your breakfast up to the room. Other than that, the hot waffles are a wonderful way to start the day. This inn is definitely worth checking out if you're coming to Seattle, don't waste money on expensive chain hotels!!

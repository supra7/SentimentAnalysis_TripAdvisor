We spent 5 nights at the Hyatt Maui in a partial ocean view room. We barely noticed the view unless we stood on the balcony to see the ocean from the side. The hotel is very tranquil, in spite of the number of people that stay there. We love seeing the African penguins and the African cranes at the hotel. We spent a lot of time pool side which was nice, but they cram the lounge chairs together and there's very little space between you and the other guests. You also have to get the pool early to get a good spot. The food at Umalu is really good. Our only complaint has to do with the parking which is somewhat limited in the evenings when the parking lots become full. We came back from a luau around 9ish and couldn't find a parking space so we had to valet it for $18. We're paying a resort fee so we should be abe to get a parking space when we need it. Other than the parking, we would return to the Hyatt Maui on future trips to Maui.

This is my second stay in as many weeks. The first week, I was placed in a corner suite on the club floor. This review lost one star because the layout of the room was too closed in and not very comfortable to be in. The room had a small living area with a desk, large LCD TV, and a couch. The bedroom had a great view of the city, but small, and the bathroom was newly renovated. The layout of the room made you feel crammed. My second stay was in a normal king room on the club floor. This room was excellent! It was newly renovated, nice furniture, great linens, awesome view and plenty of room to roam around. This hotel is great for Marriott Reward Members. The club floor had breakfast, snacks during the day, a light evening dinner and desserts. The lounge on the 28th floor has an amazing view of the city along with a great happy hour!

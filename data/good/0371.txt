I took a quick trip to Seattle to visit a college friend. I booked a room at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Seattle. Although I was not impressed by the tiny lobby, I was happy with my 24th floor room which was spacious, well-appointed, and which had a great view. The hotel was walking distance to several Seattle tourist attractions, and I had a very pleasant walk prior to meeting my friend for dinner and a "night on the town." My friend joined me for a very pleasant breakfast (reasonably priced too) at the hotel served by friendly people. My former classmate dropped me off at the Amtrak station and I was soon on my way home. My visit was all too brief - I hope to come back soon.

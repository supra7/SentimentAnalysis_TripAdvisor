We stayed in Hotel Opera Roma for 4 nights with a couple of our freinds. We enjoyed our stay there: the otel is centrally located, we could visit all of the attractive places in old Rome by walking. the hotel and the rooms were very clean and newly renovated. The staff were very helpful and freindly. We got a free off charge access to internet and laptop. Its only minus was the size of the rooms; small.

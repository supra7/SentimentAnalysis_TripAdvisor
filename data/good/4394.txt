This is an older yet charming hotel in a great beach location. We booked through a 3rd party flight/hotel package broker and got stuck in one of the 20 or so rooms that face the back of the adjacent Sheraton whose guests are staring into your room. Couldnt switch because we didnt book direct we were told. Avoid these outward facing rooms at the back of the old building. Almost all the rest appear to look at the lovely grounds and at least partial ocean view. The staff is very helpful and friendly although some of the bar staff are a little past their prime. The older building has thin walls and small bathrooms but has been remodeled within the last few years. Our friends in one on the newer buildings had a much better room for about the same price. This is a semi-budget hotel but there is nothing cheap about the Kaanapali beach area. The hotel's restaurant is above average in quality and less expensive than the surroundinghotel's offerings.

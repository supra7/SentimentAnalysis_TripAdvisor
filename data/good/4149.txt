My husband and I just returned from the Hyatt in Maui. There were alot of things I loved about this hotel and only a couple of things I did not. The resort is beautiful and the service is great. We had an ocean front room in the alena tower. Our room was a great size with couch flat screen tv walk in closet nice sized bath and wonderful balcony. THe pool area was never overcrowded and we could always find a chair. The pool was clean. The only things I did not like about the hotel was our bed. It was quite hard and made sleeping a little difficult. Our room was on the 8th floor in the corner making it quiet except for when the luau was going on and then it became quite loud. The thing that disturbed me the most was breakfast in the Swan Court. The food was quite good, but the birds were terrible. If someone left there table upon completion of there meal as many as 20 birds would be all over the dishes making it pretty disgusting. I also saw waiters leaving stacks of dishes not covered on trays inviting the birds to cover them also. Would I return maybe maybe not. In the past I have stayed in Wailea at the 4 Seasons and Grand Wailea. The bed I can accept, the birds are another issue. Otherwise this is a beautiful resort. There luau was great and offered some of the best food during our entire trip.

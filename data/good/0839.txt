I flew to Seattle on a red eye from Alaska and upon arriving to the hotel at 7 a.m. after getting zero sleep thanks to a screaming baby all the way from Anchorage, the Executive allowed me to check in and pass out...best check-in experience ever! Rooms aren't big, but for the price, all we needed was two beds, a nice tv and a bathroom. AC didn't work all the time so we had to sleep with the window open, which was not a huge issue. Free wine was also good...highly recommend! Would stay here again!

We booked the Sorrento for a one night stay. As we arrived very late and had to leave very early, we didn't get to check out the whole hotel. The bed was comfy with plenty of pillows. The bathroom small, but nicely done. The staff was very friendly. We plan to stay at the Sorrento again when we have more time to enjoy this beautiful old hotel. Oh...and coffee in the lobby with paper travel cups and plastic lids were available when we left at 6am...nice!

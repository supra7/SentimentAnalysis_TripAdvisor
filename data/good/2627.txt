A friend and I stayed one night at this modern boutique style hotel. We booked through hotwire. Originally we were reserved a queen bed but the hotel was able to accomodate our request for two double beds upon check-in. Our room was on the 10th floor and quite spacious, which was a pleasant surprise. Instead of valet parking for $25/day we parked in the lot right across the street for $17/day on weekends or $10/10 hours. The Red Fin restaurant has a good happy hour menu starting at 10pm. Would highly recommend this hotel.

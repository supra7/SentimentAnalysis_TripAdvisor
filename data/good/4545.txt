this hotel was huge, including the grounds. we could have easily just spent our entire time just on the hotel property, cos there was so much to do! the pool was great (although there were lots of kids!), there was a massive checker board, which coconuts as the pieces, a tiki bar (with cool drinks in cute souvineer glasses), a tiki restaurant (with decent food), and lots of lounging space. the room itself was not bad. it was a garden view, on the main floor. we had our own little terrace, but since it was on the main floor, we didn't use it, and we kept the shutters closed, since anyone could have walked by. that was abit annoying since we were on our honeymoon, but they did give us a free bottle of champagne. breakfast was really good. there was tons to choose from, however the line up to get in was long! sometimes we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. the hotel was in a great location. it was walking distance to an outdoor mall, and its right on the beach. you definately need a car if you want to se more of the island though, and parking is not free! the hotels offers loads of free activities, living up to their slogan of the most hawaiian hotel. they can teach you how to play the ukulele, dance, make a lei, and many other things. the morning after you check in, there is a meet and greet, which was nice. and when you check out, there is a whole ceremony, and you get a really nice lei. whenever you return to the hotel, you are supposed to bring it back with you, and they will add a different colour nut on it, to signify how many times you have been. overall, a nice place indeed, and I would definately recommend it.

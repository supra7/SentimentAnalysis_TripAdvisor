Once you walk into the lobby, it really is like stepping back in time. Very beautiful. We ended up going to the happy hour and the food was fantastic!. Room was nice and clean and the walls seemed thick where you couldn't hear the neighbors having a conversation. (Although we were woken up at midnight by the people above us have a really good time, if you catch my drift). Oh, this place is right next to a hospital emergency room entrance, so you will hear sirens all night. Parking sucks, simple as that. You have to pay for valet parking which is $26/day! Nuts. The staff is friendly. One area they needed improvement on is that it the place seemed short staffed. When we got in, the man helping us check in seemed like he was running a 3 ring circus. No one was at the actual check in desk for the 3 nights I stayed there. He always was running the show and seemed stressed (understandable). He and the valet were so nice they remembered us and asked how our day went, etc. On the website they talk about the many services they have, from classes, to doggie day care, etc. I was very interested in the yoga/pilates classes. Went down to the studio to check it out, no one there. Called the front desk (the man running the show) and he told me i needed to call the instructor myself. I didn't see a phone number on the studio door so he said he will get back to me on this. He never did. Would I stay here again? maybe not. I would do better research on the parking situation to find a better rate. Between tipping the valet and the actual cost of the parking, it was way too much for 3 nights.

After reading a few of the reviews of this hotel, I was a little worried about it. However, once we checked in a was pleasantly surprised and it turned out to be a very nice hotel to spend a night pre-cruise. The hotel is very close to the airport and there can be some noise from the planes. As we are not light sleepers this did not bother us. Check in was pleasant and the staff was helpful. The shuttle was prompt both picking us up and dropping us off to catch our Shuttlexpress bus to the cruise pier. Waitstaff in the coffee shop was friendly and attentive. We were assigned a room in the tower. There are several 4 or 5 story buildings that are connected together and could make it a challange to find your room but we had no problems at all. The room itself was spacious but not overly large and had a nice bathroom. The room was clean and comfortable. There are two fitness rooms but neither is overly large. They did have up to date equipement. There is one outdoor pool and hot tub that we did not use. There were two onsite restaurants, on sports lounge and a coffee bar area with pasteries. The prices in the restaurant were a little high for what we wanted to pay so we had dinner in the coffee shop. Still not inexpensive but it didn't break the budget either. The hot food was hot and cold foods were cold. Overall a decent meal. My overall impression with our stay was this is a very nice hotel close to the airport. I would not be disappointed if we purchased through Hotwire and received this hotel again.

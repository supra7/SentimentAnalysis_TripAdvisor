The Outrigger Maui Eldorado is a condo complex partly owned by the holding company, and partly owned by private individuals. We stayed in a studio, garden view room. It was all GREAT except for the bed, which was in serious need of replacement. Unfortunately, we learned that our room was privately owned, so all we could do was to "say so" in our room evaluation at the end of our stay. Nevertheless, the staff were fantastic, friendly, helpful--you name it--from the groundskeepers and maids to the desk staff. There is a handy little "store" which stocks a nice supply of wine and spirits, as well as some snacks and fresh tropical produce. Our room was spacious and had a well equipped kitchen, washer/dryer, huge bathroom, and more than ample living area with a flat screen TV. We also had WiFi. One of the pools was 10 feet from our lanai door, which was fine with us! We would stay here in a heartbeat--with the caveat that we would want to know how old the bed was in the room before booking, if possible.

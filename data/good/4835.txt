We were put in this hotel for a day rest between flights. Room was clean (not counting some persistant stains not uncommon for airport hotels). Buffet breakfast and lunch were even better. And the staff at front desk was very helpful unlike the gentleman arranging city tours. Both check in and out were painless.

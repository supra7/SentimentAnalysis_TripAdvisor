THE GREATS ABOUT THIS HOTEL: This hotel was amazingly up to date and modern, and so clean I could eat off the floors The staff was impeccable. We were actually SHOWN around the lobby/elevators by the front desk staff. The valet got a cab for us with a huge smile. Our servers both for dinner and in the morning couldn't do enough for us. We were stunned. The bed had a goose down comforter that I seriously wanted to steal. I've NEVER taken a thing from a hotel, but if I could have taken that bed and those pillows in my suitcase , I would have. Water pressure was fantastic-the shower was terrific Lots of elevators and escalators. We never had to wait. THE NOT SO GREATS Be to be sure and get a higher floor--we were on the 12th floor, and could still hear traffic noise from the nearby freeway. There isn't much within walking distance as far as food, but the restaurant is pretty good. Have the Prix Fix menu of the salad and the salmon for $28. Best salmon I've had in years. Taxis are sitting in front of the hotel, there isn't a shuttle. Has teeny water pot and enough coffee for 2 cups or enough tea for 2 cups. That was a cheap little surprise in the coffee center of the universe-Seattle. NO microwave AMENITIES Room service was available Aveno complimentary products Ironing Board/Iron in room Blow Dryer in Room Extra blanket available in the closet Fridge in the room Small store on lower level-open until 10pm Pool and Spa Nicely equipped work out room, although busy I priceline'd this hotel for $73, if that helps. I would have easily paid double...and not been upset about it at all. We will return.

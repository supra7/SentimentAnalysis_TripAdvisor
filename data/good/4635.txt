I read all of the reviews that I could before I left and have to admit I was a little wary, but figured I was not as picky as some others might have been....BUT I was a bit disappointed that we were put in the Kuai wing---it is the oldest most run down building. The view however, was absolutely AMAZING!! The staff are incredible and the whole feel of the hotel was warm, friendly and relaxing. We left KBH to go on to the Big Island where we stayed at the 5 star Hilton and I have to say both my husband and I agree that the KBH was overall a much better place and much better location despite it being smaller and older. At the KBH we felt like we were in Hawaii, where as at the Hilton we felt we were in any resort that could have been in the middle of the desert. The incredibley genuine staff at KBH can't be beat. The rooms in the Kuai defintiely need updating and hate to say it but i saw a roach which totally creeped me out. So it's a great place to stay, great price, great location and people but definitely INSIST on getting into one of the other buildings. the Kuai needs to be completely renovated. UNBELIEVABLE sunsets!! Great scuba diving at Black Rock and awesome shopping down the boardwalk.

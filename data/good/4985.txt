We switched to this hotel for one night (Friday) to get a good nights sleep. Knowing that the area between Istiklal Caddesi and Mesrutiyet Caddesi is one big party zone on Friday and Saturday night, we asked for a quiet room and got a room on 5th floor facing the street. Perfect! The room standard is ok and the hotel is well run. Too few non-smoking rooms...

Overall, a very nice hotel as one would expect from staying at a Sheraton and paying a little over $200 for a room. Customer service both at curbside and front desk were top notch. We had adjoining rooms on the 24th floor with good views of the city. The pool is located on the 35th floor and was smaller than I expected. Weight room and sauna also on 35th floor. View from there was really amazing. Hotel was very accommodating, giving the kids (5 of them!!!) coloring books and a goodie bag upon check-in. Rooms were quiet, beds were firmer than I prefer but still comfortable. Internet service available for free in lobby only, which surprised me. You had to pay for wireless in your room. We did not try the restaurant or lounge. Hotel is within 5-6 blocks of Pike Place Market and only a block away from TRAM and mall. Lots of things to do and see within easy walking distance...even with five kids in tow! I would stay here again when visiting Seattle, the location was very convenient for us.

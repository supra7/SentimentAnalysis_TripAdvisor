Stayed at the Seattle Hilton for one night. We were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and were not dissappointed. We parked in the Hilton garage and took the elevator to the 14th floor (lobby) to check in. The area was very nice with an attractive lobby bar. After a short wait (2 min. or less) we were greeted in a friendly manner and checked into our room without incident. I had pre-ordered some amenities to be in our room (flowers etc.) and when we got to our room they were there as requested. The room was on the Executive level (28th floor) and had a nice view of Elliott Bay (looking toward the northwest). The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. As some prior reviewers mentioned the room itself was small but not uncomfortable. We had no complaints. As others have mentioned the executive lounge was very small but the view was nice and the attendant was very friendly. This was the only below average experience we had. All staff were very accommodating and the location of the hotel was convenient to shopping and Pikes Place market (a walk of about 1/4 mile). All-in-all we would stay here again when in Seattle. Don't believe the negative reviews. The Seattle Hilton is a nice hotel in a very good location.

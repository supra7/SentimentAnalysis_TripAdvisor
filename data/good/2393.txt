The hotel is cool and swanky. The staff is very nice and attentive. The bar downstairs has a good happy hour and on Weds have happy hour from 7 - midnight. The fitness center is adequate but cramped (after work), it's also dark (low lighting) everywhere - including the rooms. A couple tips: Happy Hour at the Monanoco (across street) is good, get a pizza at Serious Pie (look it up) and DO NOT JAY WALK (seriously, it's a $85 ticket and they really ticket people). Stay here if you get a good rate.

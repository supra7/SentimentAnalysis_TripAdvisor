The atrium pool is the highlight of this hotel. I've stayed twice and have enjoyed the tropical ambiance of the pool area. I love how close the hotel is to SeaTac airport. If you have to stay near SeaTac and want a great relaxing night, stay at the Mariott. Be aware the Mariott charges 20 dollars a night for parking. I give them a 3 for value because of the parking fee.

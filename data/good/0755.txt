I liked the Moore. They were doing some renovations and all the halls were decorated differently. Not a "cookie cutter" hotel like most chains. Interesting... I stayed in a 2 Queen bed room for 2 nights and it was fine but when my friend left, I decided to splurge and get a suite (for only $125!) for the next two nights. It had a sofa and love seat with a coffee table and an entertainment center with a flat screen TV. There was a glass dining table all set for 4 but you coudl fit 6 people around it. The bed was a king and very comfortable. There was a full kitchen and nice bathroom with vintage tiles. I was very impressed, expecially at that price. There were large windows in the living room and you could peek between the buildings and see the cruise ships. Pikes Market is a couple blocks away and you can get amazing pastries and coffee as well as flowers for your room and they open early. People at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. I noticed some people thought it was noisey because of the theatre. I didn't notice that but I may have been toward the opposite end of the hotel. There is a bar and a women's shelter and some other building for homeless on the same block but we had no problem with anyone on the streets. The area around Pike's Market is nice, shopping, eateries, really cute.

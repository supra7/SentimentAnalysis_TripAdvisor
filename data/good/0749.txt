Booked one night based on Frommer's recommendation. It was exactly as stated - an older hotel, inexpensive, fantastic location within two blocks of Pike's Place Market. The room was newly painted, had a clean bathroom, and decent beds. They issue discount parking tickets for a garage down the street as parking and driving are horrendous in downtown Seattle.

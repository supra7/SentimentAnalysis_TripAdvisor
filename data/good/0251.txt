This is THE place to stay if you want to be in the middle of the market scene in Seattle. It's delightful to wake up early and walk among the market stalls while the vendors are just setting up. We were fortunate to have gorgeous fall weather when we stayed here in mid-October. We did have a little trouble getting in. The room was not ready at 4 p.m., the normal check-in time, but we couldn't really complain because when we came back at 4:30 the room was ready and we had been upgraded to a suite with a perfect view of the iconic market sign, Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains beyond. This was a suite on two floors, with a large living room and kitchen downstairs and a spacious master bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Bed was very comfortable with great reading lights. We caught the beautiful sunset from the hotel's rooftop deck, where a lot of folks were sharing glasses of wine and snapping photos of the view. This is a great base for exploring Seattle. We walked down First Avenue to the Seattle Art Museum's sculpture park near Belltown and then walked back on the waterfront. Had breakfast at Seatown, one of Tom Douglas's newer restaurants, with an emphasis on smoked fish. Also walked the other direction, toward Pioneer Square, and of course checked out the fish, produce and craft stalls in the market itself. My only small caution would be that if you are looking for peace and quiet, this is probably not the place you want to be. The traffic noise from the viaduct below was quite loud all night even though I had my earplugs in. And the market action starts early so if you are a light sleeper you may have trouble sleeping in.

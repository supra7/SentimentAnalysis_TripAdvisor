We just returned from our honeymoon and stayed on the Big Island, Maui and Honolulu. We stayed the majority of the time (7 days) in Maui at the KBH and thouroughly enjoyed our honeymoon stay. I was apprehensive at first after having read some negative reviews, but understood it was on a nice area of the beach and because of the great price, decided to go for it. Boy was I relieved. Upon checking in, I couldn't have been more pleased. We were in the Kaui wing and had NO complaints. The room was spacious, clean and we had a partial ocean view while also overlooking the lawn and part of the pool area. The beach was great and we NEVER had to worry about getting a chair by the pool or spreading out. We walked the lovely boardwalk to the Sheraton, Westin etc. and they were SOOO crowded. I actually talked to a few people at the KBH pool who felt the exact same way. I'd personally never pay more money to stay at a more crowded hotel. Their poolside was literally chair to chair. The pools were much bigger at other hotels, but KBH was a decent size and perfect for getting in to cool off and float. Breakfast was included in our package and we went there every morning except when we did the volcano bike ride. Fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, toast, etc etc were on the daily buffett - what more would you need? I'm used to cereal and something healthy/simple at home so this was nice. I travel quite a bit and usually stay in "brand name" hotels and my now husband and I were VERY happy with our stay at KBH. I'd disregard the negative reviews. I'll post some recent pics of our stay when I get a chance.

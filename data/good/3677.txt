We booked this hotel through Priceline, so we weren't certain of what we were getting until the confirmation came up. Though I read reviews on Trip Advisor bashing this place, when my husband and I arrived we were definitely happy with what we found. The room was bright and clean, tastefully furnished, with nice little amenity toiletries of good quality. The bed is among the most comfortable we've ever slept on in a hotel. The staff was friendly and courteous. We did not use the gym or the breakfast room, but the attached restaurant has a fun atmosphere on a Friday night and the bartenders there make a mean mojito. We also loved this place because it is a stroll away from everything the Inner Harbor has to offer, as well as proximity to some of Baltimore's newest shopping areas. We grabbed a fresh (hot!) baguette from Whole Foods for breakfast, walked along the waterfront, and were quite impressed with our good fortune. I'd recommend the Hilton Garden Inn Inner Harbor to anyone.

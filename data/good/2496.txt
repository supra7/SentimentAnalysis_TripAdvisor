Overall I thought this was a great hotel. It's very centrally located, within walking distance to great restaurants, shopping, the water, and Pike's. It's essentially a boutique hotel: the vibe is rocker chic and the art is fantastic, modern decor throughout. The restaurant attached to the hotel has a great happy hour and the appetizers we tried were quite good, great service from the bartender as well. The only downside was the laughably small bathroom. There was no counter space save for the 3-inch deep floating glass counter and the shower was smaller than any place I've stayed (including Europe...yikes). If you're looking for some cool things to do in Seattle we toured the Theo chocolate factory in the Fremont district which was great, the Queen Anne area is awesome, and had two fabulous dinners at the Dahlia Lounge and The Pink Door. Happy travels!

KBH is not one of those fancy luxury resorts that you can find in Ka'anapalai Beach, but it more than makes up for this by being a very friendly hotel. Their motto is to provide the guests with the "most Hawaiian " experience. They provide free Hawaiian crafts for guests of all ages. e.g lei making and hula dance lessons. They also have a free nightly sunset hula show and music for their guests. They have one of the best beaches right off of their property and walking distance to "black-rock", which is a prime location for snorkeling. The hotel is very clean and reasonably priced and most rooms have a full or partial view of the ocean. 12 years ago,when looking to plan a trip to Maui, our travel agent recommended KBH, and we have been return guests ever since. For us, it is like going back home to be with friends and get our fulfillment of the Hawaiian experience.

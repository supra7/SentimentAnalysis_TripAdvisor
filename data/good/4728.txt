We stayed at the Maui Eldorado and let me first say that this is probably the best deal for the money you'll find on Maui! The rate was good ($155/night for a Studio with partial ocean view, but this was slightly discounted as it was with a wedding group), and we were upgraded to a 1-bedroom which was HUGE... I think it was bigger than the last place we lived! It had two full bathrooms, a well-equipped full kitchen, separate living room, master bedroom, and GIGANTIC deck with dining table and lounge chairs. It was immaculately clean, and service was friendly. All units have W/D which is really nice. Parking is $7/day and wi-fi is included. The beach access isn't bad, with a 5 minute walk down to the beach (or a quick call will give you a golf cart ride to the cabana), but it's not as easy as just walking out your door and onto the beach. I know a lot of it depends on which room you stay in as they are individually owned, but the property seems to lack the Hawaiian charm we've found elsewhere. You can walk down to Black Rock for snorkeling, but we found significantly better snorkeling in South Maui (Kihei/Wailea/Makena areas). We also liked the beaches better in South Maui. I think that the Maui Eldorado would be an excellent choice for families who want the amenities of a kitchen, washer/dryer, more space, and to take the kids to the beach for the day. As a younger married couple, we were a little bored here and didn't like the $20 cab ride to Lahaina for some nightlife. Whaler's Village (shops and restaurants) is about a mile away, but it is more family-oriented and wraps up relatively early.

You don't even have to open the door for yourself at this hotel and the lobby smells like flowers. King suite was perfect. Separate sleeping and living area. The sofa is a sofa bed if you're more than two. Large soaker tub and rainfall shower. Attended a concert at the Bell Centre which you can see from the hotel. Had a very positive experience and only wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy the pool and outdoor hot tub! Walking distance to shopping on st. Catherine st.

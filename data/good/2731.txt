This is my favorite place to stay when I need to overnight at SeaTac for an early morning flight. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. Free internet access in the lobby, and a nice wine selection at the bar. If you're up for the walk with your luggage, ask for a room overlooking the pond - and listen on the balcony to the frogs croaking through the night. And did I mention the chocolate chip cookies - waaarm chocolate chip cookies upon check-in. It's a bit more than I like to spend, but I enjoy it when I'm there. (EXCEPT - they say they're pet friendly, but with a $75 per night pet charge, I don't consider it "friendly" at all.)

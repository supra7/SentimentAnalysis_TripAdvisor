This hotel seems to be ideally located. I was here on business so I didn't get to explore as much as I would have liked. There is a Starbucks directly below so I was able to get my morning coffee quite easily (they did have in room coffee but who can resist Starbucks?). The meeting room was VERY nice and service was excellent. I look forward to visiting again when I'm in Baltimore.

Visited Secrets for two weeks in December. Stayed in a Preferred Club room which gave access to the Preferred lounge serving afternoon tea and other canapes through out the day - nice touch but so much was on offer elsewhere it probably wasn't worth the extra money. Wi-fi speed wasn't fantastic but sufficient to check e-mails. Room was very nice but maybe not quite 5 star. Breakfasts in the morning was huge, buffet style. Everything you can think just as good as a Vegas Buffet Breakfast. Service was great both around the pool and on the beach, the drinks just kept coming. And so did waiters with canapes and small bites. You really didn't need to leave you lounger all day. We also rented a Cabana on the beach for a day for about $60 which was a great way to spend the day. Lunch time you could grab a Grab a Burger, Chicken, Ribs, Fish from the Pool Grill. Or have a lunch in one of the restaurants. Great Sea Bass! The Japanese restaurant was great esp the Teppanyaki Table and the Sushi. Only gripe was restaurants wouldn't accept reservations so some nights you would have to wait for an hour for a table. Wasn't a big deal they would give you a pager and we would go to the lobby bar for a drink. The Bad Stuff The were LOADS of weddings held at this hotel. It seemed rather like a factory production of weddings, sometimes 4 wedding in one day. With the weddings you get the wedding parties. We had someone in the room above us partying straight for three days and three nights. Banging, Screaming, shouting playing loud music. The hotel seemed powerless to stop this. This lead to three nights of really poor sleep. If I did return I would only stay on a top floor and maybe just for 7 nights

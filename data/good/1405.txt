We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle as part of a group attending a large conference in Seattle (Fall, 2007). As many of our conference activities were at the convention center, the Sheraton's location was ideal, within easy walking distance. There were plenty of restaurants nearby for lunch and evening gatherings, and Pike Place Market was about 6 blocks away. Our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet with a partial view (between nearby buildings) of the water. The hotel itself generally was a nondescript downtown Sheraton-- not the nicest we've ever stayed in, but certainly more than adequate for our needs on this business trip.

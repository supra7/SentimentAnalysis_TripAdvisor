We booked the Hyatt through Priceline and got a great deal for this beautiful hotel in Lahaina. The grounds are lush and filled with beautiful plants, flowers, birds of paradise (penguins, flamingo, swans). The resort is located on "resort row" and has a small beachfront access as well. Many of the on site restaurants are al fresca overlooking the ocean. It's tempting to stay on the grounds and never leave to explore the rest of Maui! Our rooms were very nice and clean-as would be expected for a hotel of this caliber. My only complaint was that the first room we checked into on the 3rd floor had a leak in the cieling, and water was dropping onto the floor. However when we notified housekeeping, they immediately transferred us to a better room on the 8th floor with a partial ocean view on one side, and a great view of the golf course on the other. The staff was very friendly and helpful with planning our activities during our stay. Expedia reps can be found on site-they will help you book excursions at fair prices if you haven't had the opportunity to do so beforehand.

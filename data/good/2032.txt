We stayed at the Westin for one night before an Alaskan cruise. We took a red eye flight and arrived in Seattle at 6:30am. I thought check in would be a problem since we arrived at the hotel so early but the front desk was very courteous and had a room available for us. I booked the hotel through Priceline at a very reasonable rate and did not feel I was treated any differently. We never had to wait more than a minute for an elevator and I was actually surprised at how fast they came considering the previous reviews I had read. The location of the Westin was probably the most appealing factor of the hotel. It took about 5 minutes to walk to Pike Place Market and there was other great shopping nearby. Since we didn't have a rental car we could easily walk to the tourist hot spots including the monorail which took us to the Space Needle ($2 for a one way ticket). The room was typical of what you would expect from a Westin. The beds were very comfortable and the room was adequate in size. I always do a lot of research on TripAdvisor before booking a hotel and after reading previous reviews I was a little nervous about staying at the Westin Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised at how the hotel and staff exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend this hotel to any friends or family visiting Seattle.

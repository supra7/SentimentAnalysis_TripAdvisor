Booked a Club room, that gives you access to the private room. This is worth it for the free Continental breakfasts (other than a tip), but as we had used the ones in Tenerefie before, where the drinks were free, we did get caught out paying for a beer when we arrived! The staff are all excellent, and we had no complaints about the hotel. They even have computers in the lobby where you can do on line check in and print your boarding pass - what a good idea. Nice if small rooftop pool with specticular view over downtown.

Stayed at the Hotel Max last week (5/23/07) for one night on a business trip. I was in room 1005 which has a great view of the Space Needle at night. The hotel reminds me of some I've stayed in in Europe... a little on the small side, but it is a very nice room. The bed is excellent and so is the assortment of pillows. The service at the hotel was great. I didn't have any tooth paste with me and they have a "You Got It" button on the phone. I asked for tooth paste and it was brought up to me in 10 minutes. The next morning, I had breakfast in the restaurant. I came down kind of late and asked if they thought I could be done with breakfast within a half hour. The waiter made sure my order got in and got served a.s.a.p. so that I had 5 minutes to spare. Also, the porter helped me haul 3 BIG bags across the street for my meeting. I'd have given it a 5 if the room was a little bigger.

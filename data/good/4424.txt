I won this trip through the local radio station. The people at the hotel were very friendly. It is more of a relaxed, nothing fancy, atmosphere. Their courtyard area was beautiful and the beach was great too. The only thing we did not like is the fee rental for beach chairs and the bartender that would make you wait 15 minutes for your change when there was no one else at the bar but us. Frustrating. The room was clean. The housekeeper that we had was the nicest lady we encountered on our trip. I would return to this hotel.

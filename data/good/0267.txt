We had a great time exploring downtown Seattle and the hotel location was extremely convenient. The staff was courteous, the rooms were very nice & the hotel restaurants were fabulous as well. Parking for a large vehicle was a little challenging to find with only verbal directions to guide us, maybe a small map would have been more helpful. Overall it was a memorable experience & one worth repeating.

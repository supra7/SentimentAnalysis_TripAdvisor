I stayed at the Westin for the weekend with my 15 year old niece. We had a standard double room with was beautiful. We had great service from the concierge, who helped us with the monrail and advise on sites to visit. The only criticism I have is that there was no wireless internet, so my niece could not use he handheld devise, which did not have the Ethernet capability. I also had to pay for internet connection for my laptop. I really resent having to pay for internet in my room when you can go and get free wireless in the lobby coffee shop.

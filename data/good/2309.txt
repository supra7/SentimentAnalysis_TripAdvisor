Stayed just one night at the hotel prior to leaving on an Alaskan cruise, and wish we could have stayed longer. Nice rooms, good beds with soft sheets, and clean as a whistle. What more could you ask? It is close, about five nice blocks to Pikes Street Market and in the middle of up scale shopping. Nice restaurant in the hotel too. Wine tasting every eve and fresh delicious coffee starting at 5:00am. Kimpton does a good job and allows your favorite pup, too!!

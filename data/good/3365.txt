We stayed at Secret Maroma for six days five nights due to a friend's destination wedding; we had an ocean view junior suite, the facility is well kept, the price is reasonable considering that all food/service/majority of the entertainment is included. The beach is warm and beautiful and we kept ourselves pretty happy without setting our foot outside the highly secured resort property. Some pros and cons that came as surprises to us: Pros: * 24 hours room services, they gladly bring in anything on the room service menu within 20 to 30mins; the room service menu however is limited and the quality is mediocre. * Most of the staff are proud and happy to work there, therefore you get really good service from genuine people * While you relax by the pools/beach, staff will stop by taking your order for drink/food, etc. Restaurant staff will also bring dish samples around for your tasting at lunch time; in additional to the various open restaurants you can freely walk in. * All day free instructor-led activities (yoga, bike ride, volleyball, etc) and evening entertainment (definitely check out the Elvis show by Reggie Randolph) * Really safe and secured premise; all incoming vehicles are carefully inspected; the staff by the beach bar seems to be watching for suspicious activities Cons: * Mosquito and chigger bites can occur, stay away from the grass areas and do wear insect repeller * The quality of food at any of the restaurant is mediocre, don't expect to see lobsters or fillet mignon (the service however is excellent) * If you are used to Blue Bottle or Ritual Coffee, you will get really disappointed by the quality of coffee here * You have to pay for any good quality wine. * Although the resort is for adults only, some drunk adults acted like angry 5 years old * During the busy season, you will have a hard time finding a place to chill by the pool/beach; you will find them all taken by 11AM

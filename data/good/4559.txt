We stayed in this hotel for 7 days in January. The location is perfect. A very short walk to the Whaler's Village (shopping & restaurants) and a short drive to Lahaina. Ka'anapali area is very nice and somewhat secluded. The hotel is located on Ka'anapali beach and close to "Black Rock" for great snorkeling. Ka'anapali beach was one of our favorites... plenty of space, and never over populated. Service and friendliness of staff was amazing. They truly make you feel welcome and part of their "family." The room was OK. The size was good, with fridge and safe. However, the rooms we stayed at were a bit out-dated and slightly noisy. Good thing our neighbors were quiet. KBH is remodeling, hopefully they will get to the building we stayed at soon. Parking was "reasonable" for Hawaii at $9 per day. The garage was very convenient and safe. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel based on location, service, & amenities. Rooms do need to be updated.

I just read the review posted by someone from Phoenix. It was stated that those who have written good reviews on the K Beach Hotel are either owners or tourists who don't know any better. Well I'm sure not an owner, but I am a tourist who does know better! And I also do my research before I travel. I have been to Hawaii three times. The last time was Feb. 04, and my husband and I stayed at the KBH. I did a lot of research on this hotel before booking it. I found that some of the bldgs were renovated and some not. I then requested a room in one of the re-done wings. Our room was perfect, and very updated. No smell either. The ocean was a bit rough during our stay, but it isn't always like that. A lot depends on the time of year that you are there. Sometimes it is worth strolling a bit north or south on that stretch of beach to check out other swimming possibilities. The boardwalk that runs in that area is great for walking and exploring. In my trips to Hawaii, I have never had a bad experience with any hotel. And we never use a travel agent. I can do more research than a travel agent would ever care to, or have the time to do. My sister-in-law is an agent, and I'd never dream of letting her plan my trips. The KBH is in a great location. Their grounds are nice and kept up. They aren't a Hyatt but don't have Hyatt prices either. I knew before we stayed there that it wasn't a five star hotel, but I checked out everything about it. I went to their website and even printed out a map/diagram of the property which was color coded with the types of rooms, wing(bldg) names, proximity to the pool and beach. All of this paid off and we were not disappointed. I would stay there again!

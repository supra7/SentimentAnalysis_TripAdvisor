My friend and I went to Seattle to see the sights for a couple days and after reading lots of reviews I had chosen to stay here. Based on the reviews I had read my biggest concern was the hotel being noisy and being able to hear through the walls. We didn't have a problem with this at all, although we did stay on a Wednesday night so it could be a different story on the weekend. I did hear a couple voices in the hallway in the morning, so I could see how if there were people around being loud you would be able to hear them. Now I will start from the beginning. They have a loading zone right in front of the hotel so that you can check in and unload your stuff before parking, which was very nice. We had a quick and easy check in and the guy even asked which floor we would like to stay on which I thought was nice, we ended up on 4. We used the self park parking which ended up being $23 cause there was tax since it was charged with your room, but that covered us from 4:30 when we checked in till 9pm the next day, amazing! Also some of the reviews made it sound like the parking garage was blocks away, there is an alley separating the hotel and the garage, they're right next to each other. I don't know what people were complaining about. The rooms are a bit on the small side but they look nice and we had all the room we needed. There is A/C in the room that seemed to work just great, we turned it off cause we got too cold. The beds were comfortable, I slept like a baby. Our only complaints were that there aren't fans in the bathrooms which makes it really difficult to clear the steam after a shower, and the bathroom door was rather loud to open and close because the doors are very old. The shower heads are fabulous though. Checkout was also super fast and all in all we had a wonderful stay and I will definitely stay there again next time I am staying in Seattle.

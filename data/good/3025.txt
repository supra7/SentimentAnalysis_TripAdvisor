Great hotel if you want to stay near airport. We stayed here even though we did alot of things in Seattle because it is convenient to the light rail, only 20 minutes from downtown by car and great for heading west to the mountains or south to Tacoma. Rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Staff was helpful. the only downside was the charge for internet services.

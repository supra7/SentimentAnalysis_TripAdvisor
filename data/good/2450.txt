Stayed with friends in two rooms for a fun weekend. Trendy hotel with the standard "W" look. Rooms are a little bit on the small side - particularly considering the prices you are paying - but that's pretty standard for all the W hotels I have stayed at. Most everything is a bit on the pricey side. Hotel help was very friendly and helpful all the way around (front desk, bellhops, bar/restaurant). Terrific location in Downtown Seattle. A very reasonable walk up to the shopping areas, down to the stadiums, or over to Pike's Market - very centrally location. Beds are very comfortable, and room were very clean and has all the standard "W" upscale comforts (LCD TV, Stereo, well stock mini bar.) Nice modern decor. In short, nice hotel with good hotel amenities - but you aren't going to be spending a lot of time in the room and taking advantage of them - there are more reasonably priced options for hotels in the area.

I stayed here for 4 days the last week of August. It was close to just about anyplace you would want to visit in downtown Seattle. I especially liked that you are able to get to the Westlake Center and also to the Monorail without even having to go outside. The staff were very nice and I only ate at the restaurant for one lunch and one dinner. The food was good. All in all, a nice experience.

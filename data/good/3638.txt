I had a short trip for a meeting in NYC and this hotel was close to the venue. After finding the hotel on the web I recommended it to a friend who was also coming to the event. He noted that it was both closer an much less expensive than the hotel he had stayed at form previous meetings. So the prices are good for the area. The decor was very cool with definite Japanese influences. It was no surprise to see many Japanese staying at the hotel. On the roof there is a nice garden. The room I had was clean and well decorated. My only complaint was that it was a little cramped, but the big comphy bed was more important than excess space. The bathroom goodies were all of high quality. I will happily return to this hotel for future meetings.

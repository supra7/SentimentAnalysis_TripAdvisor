could not reach restaurant to make reservations. Called front desk asked them to reserve. Operator assured us she would contact resturanr to set table for 7. We arrived 20 min later. Very rude hostess Chyenne ststed she never heard from operator and we would just have to wait. There were at least 10 empty tables... But we waited over 30 mins. When we inquired about when we could be seated... Chyenne said I don't know, I had other things to do. We waited another 10 mins & finally one of the waiters pulled 2 tables together for us. Very disappointing as we had invited guests for this dinner. Could it be because a food critic was seated on our patio & all attention was directed toward them? Then, their appetizers were delivere to our table. When we looked puzzled, the waiter returned and wisked the appetizer away & tookit over to their table. Really lousy service for a supposedly upscale resort restaurant!

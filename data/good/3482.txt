Relatively new resort (3 yrs old) about 30 minutes from CUN airport. Decent rooms. Excellent food and restaurants for an all inclusive. Truly a wonderful beach with crystal clear water. Well laided out with comfortable chairs around a amoeba shaped pool so there's no sense of crowding. One of the two pools is heated. There are first floor rooms with private pools but the people we spoke with who were in them said they weren't worth the extra money. Good staff. English is still a bit of a struggle but they're trying. Only negative is the fitness center is small and has little equipment. They need to upgrade that.

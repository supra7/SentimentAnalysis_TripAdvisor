We visited Secrets for our first year anniversary and really enjoyed ourselves. The resort is clean and they do take care of all the communal areas. It is a very romantic resort and the rooms are great- very spacious and clean. The food is amazing! The breakfasts even has champagne and vodka for you to make your own bloody Mary's. We ate in all the restaurants and were dissapointed with only the Mexican one. They didn't have enough Mexican food and the food that we did try was not flavorsome at all. We really loved the Italian restaurant but didnt want to go all the way to Mexico and then eat Italian food! One thing that left us a little dissapointed was the large group of Americans who would behave loudly and rowdy on the beach and the pool bar. We are a young couple in our early thirties and although we love to go out we wanted a quiet romantic experience at the hotel which was somewhat spoiled. When you ask for a drink make sure that you name the brand of spirit that you want otherwise they use the local cheaper brands. We also found the entertainment guys to be somewhat annoying. When you are trying to relax on the beach they were almost in your face trying to get you to play volleyball or other sports. They do try hard to entertain but i think they try too hard. The night shows are awful and we sat through half of one and then walked out. All in all the resort is beautiful, service is good and its a nice romantic hotel for a couple.

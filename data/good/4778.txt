We arrived on Dec. 17, 2006. We stayed in room J204. Great location. It faces the golf course. It also faces the Sheraton Mau'i. The walk to the cabana is far, but you can call the front desk to take you to the cabana. The cabana is great, because there are towels and chairs available. So, you don't have to take your own stuff. There is also clean bathrooms. The personnel is good. The response is good. The beach is kind of rough for little kids. So, we went over to the beach in front of the Sheraton Mau'i. There's also a great place for coffee off of Keka'a drive. There's also a great place (deli) to get lunch and dinner. The best thing about the this facility/accommodation is the big condo. Not noisy at all except for the grass-cutters at 6 a.m. The kitchen is a full kitchen. The bathroom is small and the plumbing needs work. There also needs help with the cockroach problems. Scared the heck out of me. I sprayed 405 everywhere I saw it. The furniture is dated, but don't care when we were visiting "paradise". There was one thing that scared my husband and I the most: asking for a replacement key for our room. We asked for one at the front desk, and they just gave us one without confirming our identity. Scary. Maybe, we should have asked for a key for the bigger 2 bedroom/2 bathroom condo. Those are end units and they are HUGE! One more thing. Shop at Costco on the other side of the island. You will go broke shopping at Safeway. Or another recommendation, ship yourself a box of dried goods. Also, the air-conditioner is excellent.

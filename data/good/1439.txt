The Sheraton is going through some construction phase but as an update to the previous reviews, the entrance into the lobby is now open as well as the driveway to the entrance. However, the lobby is still block off on the left hand-side which make the lobby a bit restrictive in size. I don't linger in the lobby so that is not a problem for me. The check-in was quick and friendly. By my SPG status I was upgraded to a corner room on the executive level on the 33rd floor. The room is above average size with the usual Sheraton yellow and buff stripes wallpaper. The room has been kept pretty clean although there are sign of date on parts of the room. There are obvious upgrades that has been done to the room to buff up its 80's image but there are still a few pieces of the furnitures that shows its age. The Sweet Sleeper bed is comfortable and on the soft side. The bed covers and accessories are a level above the usual standard Sheratons'. The mini-safe in the closet is the largest in-room safe that I have seen. It is almost as big as the mini-bar and can fit my laptop and still have plenty of space left for my SLR camera and lenses. The bathroom is actually larger than the usual Sheraton but due to the layout, it feels as if it is the same size. The Pantene bath products are omnipresent here as they are in other Sheraton. Nothing exceptional here. The location of the Sheraton is excellent, close to the Convention Center and major malls or tourist sites are just a few blocks from either way. This is one of the nicer Sheraton that I have stayed in and at the top of my list of Sheraton hotels in North America.

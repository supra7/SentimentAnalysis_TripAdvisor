We went to the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for an anniversary celebration. The staff was friendly and charming. Our room was freshly updated and sparkling clean. We were very happy with the close proximity to Lahina, and the walking path to Whaler's village and the beach was fantastic. Our package included a buffet breakfast that really saved on the food costs. There is a fridge included in the room that makes it perfect for drinks and snacks. The warm water beach was beautiful and snorkeling was very close. The nightly Hawaiian music and Hula dancers really added that special touch. The only complaint I have is there is a parking fee of $ 9.00 per day, that alone added an extra $ 99.00 to our final bill. I know this is a "little thing" and we heard that every Hotel adds this extra. It was a surprise to us, and is the reason I gave it 4 stars rather than the 5 I think it deserves. So just be aware when you book. Even with this, I would totally return... and can't wait to!

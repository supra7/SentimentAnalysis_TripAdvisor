We stayed at the Hilton Bayfront for about 5 days. Although the hotel is beautiful, modern and has a great view of the San Diego Bay and city, it has the most incompetent staff. The service level throughout our stay was below what I know about Hilton standards. I reserved a particular type of room and when I arrived they did not have the room I reserved. Had to switch rooms the next day. We left the hotel for a few days and returned a few days later and the same damn thing. Even after I specifically requested the room while at the front desk, when I checked in they tried to pawn another room on me. To be honest I would stay in the hotel again because of the location and the cleanliness of the property. Hilton really needs to do something about the culture of its staff. They are untrained and do not understand the hospitality business.

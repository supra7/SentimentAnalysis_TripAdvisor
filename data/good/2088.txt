I stayed here for 2 nights on business. The hotel rooms are in two towers: north and south. I stayed at the North Tower. The top floor starts at 10, so if you like to stay on a higher floor, note that the "first" floor is actually the tenth floor. I stayed in room 1138. Stay away from this room if you do not like rooms close to the elevator. This room is directly in front of the 11th floor elevators. The elevator doors open - you see the door to room 1138. 1136, 1137 and 1139 are right in front of the elevators too. Not directly in front like 1138 is, but pretty much. I assume it is like that on all the floors, so avoid rooms that end with 36, 37, 38 or 39 if you want to avoid elevator noise. The ice machine was right in front of room 1135. Also, the business center is in the South Tower if that matters to you. There is an "internet access" room at the lobby level where you can print out your boarding pass for free (for some reason, it wouldn't work when I tried to check in for my jetblue flight, but my colleagues had no problem checking in for their Airtran flights). The cafe at the lobby level is delicious and moderately priced. I recommend the BLT and the smoothies. The internet access costs $9.95 a day. It is not wireless, so you have to disable your wireless connection and connect via ethernet (local) cable. I asked for a late check-out. Regular check-out is at 12pm. They gave me until 1pm. I was informed it would costs $20 for a 2pm check-out and $30 for a 3pm check-out. I took the 1pm. Housekeeping is good. They leave extra soaps, shampoo and conditioner the first day of cleaning. The bed is comfortable and the pillows cushy and soft. A bathrobe is provided. I didn't use mine. It is conveniently located to great restaurants and shops. 14 miles from airport.

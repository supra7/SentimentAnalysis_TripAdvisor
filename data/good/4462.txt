We kept our sliding glass door open, and the sounds of evening music, ocean waves and birds echo into our room on this property. The staff was always helpful. Being beachfront and steps from Whaler's Village was a bonus. My only disappointment would be that no free internet is available in the room. I heard there may be free wifi somewhere on the property, but my iPhone never found it, so I ended up in Lahaina at Starbucks for my downloading pleasure.

We stayed at the The Roosevelt over 4th of July Holiday for 3 nights and enjoyed the convenience of the location. The room decor was more traditional and all the fixtures have not been updated. We were given a large king size bed room with a separate sitting area. There was only 1 working elevator so there was always a long wait for it. It is across the street from Pacific Place Mall and about 10 minutes walk to Pike's Market. The location is central to everything. We got a great rate through priceline but my husband and I usually prefer more modern decor so we probably wouldn't stay here again due to our own subjective taste but for the price and the location it's a great value!

We often stay overnight in Seattle when we travel to or from Alaska. Usually we stay at the nearby HIlton, but when I went online on our return trip I checked tripadvisor to see if there was a less expensive but decent alternative. Glad I did. There is a discounted rate for Alaskans, which is a nice touch. No need to worry about a shuttle because it,s a short, safe 5 minute walk to the terminal building. I requested an upper floor suite away from the traffic noise of International Blvd. The room was ready when we checked in at an early 1:30PM...another nice touch. Lovely view of Mount Rainier as well. Excellent eatery next door...13 Coins...which has to be the best place near an airport we have ever eaten at. You can get a bottle of wine delivered to your room upon arrival for about 10 bucks. Clean Room, good bed, quiet room, what more can one ask? Oh yeah, the price was $100 cheaper as well. We will definitely overnight here again on our next trip "outside".

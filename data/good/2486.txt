Great location, great rates. Tiny rooms are fine with me - I'd rather not pay for square footage when I've come to see the city. Easy walk to Pacific Place Mall and Westlake Center Mall (a block each) and just slightly longer to Belltown and Pike Place. Noisy in window heating/cooling system was the only downside.

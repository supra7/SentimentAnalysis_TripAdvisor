We chose Hotel Andra in Seattle for our Business Summit over other Hotels in the area for many reasons and it resulted in a huge success. The meeting room was just the right size for our group and we as well as our attendees who stayed, felt that the experience was all about us. The staff was very attentive and responsive. The accomodations were wonderful, everyone loved the Hotel Andra and the rooms. The food was a huge hit! From the appetizers, to the lunches, and evenings at Lola, everyone made us feel that the Hotel Andra was ours for the entire duration of the Summit. We will return to Hotel Andra for our meetings when in Seattle. Hotel Andra is to be commended for making us feel special right from the time we pulled into the valet area. Even after we checked out, many of us stayed late in the day to see the sights and the Hotel staff kept our things safely locked up and never hinted of any inconvenience even when some of us returned past midnight. Great job! You get high marks from us. Thank you Hotel Andra staff!

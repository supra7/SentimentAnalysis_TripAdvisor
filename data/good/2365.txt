We were in town for the Rock n Roll Half Marathon so the location of our hotel was extremely important. We wanted to be within walking distance of everything to maximize what we could do and see in our 4 short days in Seattle. The W Hotel has an incredible location that will put you close to everything. The rooms are absolutely amazing with everything that is first class and all the comforts you would want and need. I do have a few issues with the front desk staff - just not very friendly at all - and the fact that there is no business center available on the weekend at all. And it doesn't open until 9 a.m. on Monday morning. I would highly recommend that you bring your own laptop if you need to stay in touch with the office or family over the weekend.

Please see my previous review for more details... To summarize: The Pike Tower is the older side. I had a priceline deal, and when asked to go to the newer Union Tower (like other priceliners have received when asked), the gentlemen said that it was a $20/night upgrade. Oh well. The only parking onsite is valet, charging $44/night. There are a couple of public parking sites within a half block of the hotel for $26-30 per night, with in/out privileges. I usually park next to the cheese cake factory, which is across the street from the back entrance to the hotel. We stayed in an --08 room, which is literally across from the elevator and the ice machine. Not too loud though, but the door for the ice machine swings back pretty loud. Save yourself a room cleaning, and receive a $5 voucher for food in the hotel. No free wi-fi in the room, but plenty of free terminals in the lobby and free wi fi. The rooms are decent, nothing to complain about. Good water pressure for the showers. Overall, a great place to stay in a very central location (pike place 5 minutes away, shopping malls 3 minutes away).

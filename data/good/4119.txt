This was not initially my first choice of hotels but since we were traveling with 2 kids it was one of the best choices. It is a clean and updated hotel. The grounds are really nice. Lots of things for the kids. There is a kids' club with activities for kids 5+years. There are a wonderful assortment of animals including all sorts of birds (parrots, penguins, swans). The pool there is nice. There is a section primarily geared towards kids with caves, waterfall, slides and a shallower wading area. We stayed on the club floor which is nice so the kids could get a cold drink whenever. Microwave is available upon request as is a minifridge in many rooms.There is a coin operated laundromat onsite which is great with kids as all your clothes will fill with damp sand quickly. So overall very family friendly. They have a takeout option at some of the hotels restaurant and the sushi was very good. Rooms are not particularly large and I would recommend requesting a mountain view or FULL ocean view. The only disappointment was the lack of beach on the grounds. Immediately right behind the hotel is a very narrow strip of sand and the waves can be rough. If you walk a little towards Whaler's village/Sheraton they have much nicer access to the beach and a protected cove with gentler waves which are much safer for the kids. Visibility for turtle and fish watching/snorkeling is better in this area.

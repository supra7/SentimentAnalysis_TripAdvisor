Overall I really enjoyed the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel (KBH). I stayed there November 11th through the 15th. My room was real nice and I paid $175 a night for it. Room number was 553 in the Lanai wing. I have read some reviews about rooms that needed to be remodeled. The room I was in was clean and was probably remolded recently. No bugs and the bathroom was a very good size (seems to be a theme on these review boards). The Tiki Restaurant is a little over priced but there is the Tiki grill in the courtyard a few feet away that is located next to the outdoor bar. Both are located next to the pool. The beach is very nice and wasn't crowded at all. Very small waves. Whalers Village is located 2-3 hotel\condominimums down. The Rusty Harpoon is nice and outdoors along with two other outdoor restaurants. The village has some nice shops along with some touristy shops and an ABC store in the back section (away from the beach). There are nicer hotels in the area with the Hyatt being the best in my opinion. As far as activities is concerned I drive the Road to Hana. It was nice but overated and a little dangerous. Get going early say by 7 am to avoid the traffic. I made it to the Charles Lindbergh's gravesite. As long as you are able to you must do the Haleakala bike ride from the summit to the ocean by decling 10,000 ft in 38 miles. It is awesome. Overall, this hotel was a good value considering where it is located and the price paid with an excellent beach and great view.

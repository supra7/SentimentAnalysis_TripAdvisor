After leaving Waikiki on Oahu, we spent the second week of our honeymoon in March 2004 in Kaanapali Beach Hotel. It was a bit difficult to receive some information at the airport, because the hotel does not provide an own shuttle. As booked in our German travel agency, we expected the "Garden view" room for a moderate price. We found in the room a bottle of bubbly and a nice greeting card, but unfortunately the room itself was located in the ground floor of Moloka'i wing, next to the fence & street and the room smelled like newly painted/treated in some way. We refused to stay in this room. After some arrangements we were offered a pool/partly over the ocean room upstairs in the Maui wing. Very friendly offer! The room was furnished the hawaiian way, quite clean. We found every evening some Hawaiian goodies on our blanket (cookies or chocolate). The complementary breakfast on our first morning was not so tempting: dark, too cold room, mainly Japanese specialities, lots of presentations "where to spend your money", elder audience. We decided to have our breakfast in the Whaler's village or in other restaurants in Lahaina the following days. The activities in the hotel, like lei making and hula dancing were quite fun. The Hawaiian teacher of lei-making - very nice person, curious about other cultures. My dried, self-made ti-leaf lei is still hanging over our window, here in Finland! And my ti-plant growing! Also, the beautiful Plumeria blossoms on the bushes and lying all over the hotel garden, made this stay unforgettable. However, we experienced also the rough weather changes (and huuuge waves) of Maui. The Tiki shows were nice to watch from the balcony, drinking a Maitai. I would recommend Kaanapali rather than Lahaina itself if you look for a quiet vacation. The sunset between the two islands: Molokai and Lanai is an experience!

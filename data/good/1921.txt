Stayed here for one night prior to a cruise with family. We got an amazing rate on Hotwire. In my opinion we received no less service or consideration because we booked on Hotwire. Our room did not have a great view, but I've paid more and had much worse views in downtown hotels in the past. I was a little concerned about noise because our door opened immediately in front of elevators. This was no problem though since the room layout really insulates the beds from the door. The rooms were comfortable, clean, and a decent size for a large city hotel. The bell staff and concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. The printer in the business center was not working, which was an inconvenience. There was a note that boarding passes, etc. could be printed by the concierge. The concierge hours were limited, but once the desk was staffed, they were great help printing my luggage tags for the ship. The kids loved the pool... a big plus on a rainy Seattle afternoon. The pool was warm and clean. A small cafe in the lobby was great for breakfast, but extremely crowded on a Sat morning. The hotel is an easy walk to the bus tunnel and light rail line, as well as the monorail. This makes it easy to get to most of Seattles downtown areas as well as Safeco field. Overall, we had a great stay. I would definitely stay here again, especially with such a great deal.

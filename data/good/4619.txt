Our family of five adults and one four-year old stayed at KBH two years ago, and we are still smiling. The food was great. Rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet, but not luxurious. Not once did we encounter any hotel representative who was less than gracious in the true island spirit. Moonlight chats under the trees, watching the gorgeous sunset, lying on the beach, after lunch naps, birds, lizards, beautiful flora, smiles all around...hard to beat. Heart rates slow, blood pressure decreases, all is right with the world. The goodby ceremony was touching and left us feeling we were leaving friends behind. Highly recommend KBH if on a budget and you don't mind driving to other locations. Close proximity to Whaler's Village and great shopping. Even the drive in from the airport was full of awe.

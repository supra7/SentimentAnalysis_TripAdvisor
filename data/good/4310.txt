We recently arrived at the Marriott Ocean Club only to find that we had arrived a day early. It being at 100% capacity, we took the opportunity to stay next door and are we glad we did! The Hyatt Regency property on Kaanapali Beach may be one of the oldest properties, but it still exudes Hawaiian charm and makes you feel like you have really gotten away. The lobby area architecture is noteworthy and the location on the beach amazing. Admittedly, it can be a bit crowded, but they manage very well for its popularity. Staff needs a little work... perhaps the hotel is successful regardless of their attitude(s), regardless, not nearly as warm or as interested as other Hawaii properties we have stay at. My wife did like the Spa, right on the beach. We would try this hotel again... the place is what we liked most about it. If the staff are still poor the next time around, it will be off our last visit.

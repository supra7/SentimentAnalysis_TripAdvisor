This is where our family always stay in Seattle (my Canadian relatives more often than we do). It's not palatial, but the rooms are always clean, the beds comfortable and the staff very friendly and efficient. Given it's location (10 minutes from the Pike Place market and close to the tram lines) it is a very good deal for the price.

Although we had reserved a non-smoking king we were advised that none were available upon arrival. However, the hotel was willing to accomodate us by offering a corner n/s room with a queen size bed (handicapped room), which turned out to be a king sized bed. The staff was very professional, but, as far as recommendations were concered well, they had their moments. Suffice it to say however, that we were definetly steered in the right direction on restaurant suggestions. It is a few blocks walk from Pike Place Market; however, it is not inconvenient. So when you hear the term "within walking distance" - believe it. You are about 3-4 blocks from wonderful shopping and the monorail to the Space Needle. And, there are several wonderful places to eat around this area. Clean, quiet & comfortable room and, although we would shop around for prices, we would definetly stay here again. I have always considered Crowne Plaza's a little bit of a "cut above" sometimes on par with some of the Hiltons and Sheratons I've stayed in. This one held up the Crowne Plaza reputation I have come to enjoy. Although we didn't eat at the hotel they do have a restaurant. We saw many families and tourist groups, as well as a business conference attendees in the lobby, so, I would recommend considering this hotel for business or pleasure travel. Our trip was both.

Arrived at the hotel to an extremely friendly receptionist who was very helpful in providing us with useful information about the city and the metro station. The room was small but sufficient and clean with everything a person could need in a room. The bathroom was relatively big given the size of the room and also spotless. The U-BHAN is a five minute walk from the Hotel, and there are plenty of supermarkets around. Overall great experience.

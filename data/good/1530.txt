i stayed 2 nights on Aug. Westlake sta. is about 5min walk and the way to hotel is flat, so its easy to carry luggage or cart using metro from Tacoma Airport. And, its located center of downtown, pike place market is 10min walk, so I really enjoyed walking/seeing downtown area. the hotel facility is not luxury or expensive, but good enough to leisure stay. front desk service was good, and room was clean. just one a little point, i wanted to use wireless internet on my room.

it looks clean, the design is up to date, rooms are clean and very comfortable. Helpful service, at both the reception and the breakfast room. Breakfast tasted better than most Hampton I ve been to. Only critic would be about the noise of the planes, that is not totally filtered. I would definitely go back.

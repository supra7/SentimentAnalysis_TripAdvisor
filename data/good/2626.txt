We loved staying in Hotel Max. Food at the Red Fin was great! I loved the sushi. Happy hour had great prices...food and drink. We went to a lot of great restaurants, this was up there! The location was perfect, about 4 blocks from Pike's Market. Contemporary design, small rooms, but well appointed. The rooms were small, but that was not a big deal, since we were only there to sleep. The bed was amazing!!! I would love to have this bed at my house. Don't forget to wear the robes no matter how warm it is! My (Steph's) personal favorite was the hot pink lighting outside the entrance! Take advantage of the pillow menu, we wanted to try it, but never did!

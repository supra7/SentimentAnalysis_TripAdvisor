The Crystal was clean, quiet and well appointed. We traveled with 2 young teens and used the pull-out bed in the living room in addition to a roll-away we requested; the roll-away actually had the better mattress of the two beds. We appreciated that they had the roll-away in the room and ready to use when we arrived, which is something we often don't find. Once the sofa bed was opened, you couldn't even walk in the living room but we only opened it at bed time and it wasn't a big deal to fold back up. We didn't use it but the little kitchenette had enough equipment available to make a meal if you wanted. As mentioned by other reviewers, there isn't much room in the bedroom for anything besides the King bed but the bed itself was comfortable. There are two closets in the bedroom and a reasonably sized hall closet. I couldn't fit my full-size suitcase in the bedroom closet and still access it's contents (I didn't unpack since we were only there two nights) so with that left in the corner of the room I literally had to step over it to get around to the far side of the bed but we spent so little time there that it didn't really matter. Bathroom was quite large and again, really clean. The hotel had a decent pool and workout room, with a nice deck for lounging in the sun near the hot tub if you were interested. The location was just a couple of blocks from the metro stop in one direction and a wide range of restaurants and shops in the other direction. It's just three metro stops from the Old Town area and a 10 minute walk to the train station so reasonably located if you want to be downtown. We had fun renting bikes down by the river and cruising around out to the biosphere - and if you have kids and are there in the summer, check out the Labrynth on the waterfront. It was an unexpected fun way to spend a couple of hours.

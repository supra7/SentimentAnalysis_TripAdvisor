Stayed two nights thx to a great deal from Priceline. Not sure we would have picked it otherwise - usual rate is pretty steep - but very glad we stayed here and have no complaints whatsoever. This is a clean, simple, friendly hotel. The rooms are truly small but well-appointed and neat. Housekeeping was efficient. The front desk was very pleasant to deal with and even greeted us by name after a few hours, which was surprising but nice. We had no problems with the valet - maybe tip like a Rockefeller going in to be safe on that count? (Shouldn't make a difference but those guys are pretty busy.) If you're really having problems with them, there's a parking garage across the street that looked fine. The hotel's morning coffee and evening wine receptions are a very nice idea and it was fun to meet some fellow travellers. (Most a bit older than us - maybe younger people stay at the Alexis? That one looked good too and out friends reported it was amazing.) All in all though, we had a great stay and our only regret was not staying another day. I'll know better next time. Love you Seattle!

My husband and I recently went on an Alaskan cruise out of Seattle and we stayed at the Hotel Max the Saturday night prior to our embarkation. We chose the hotel because of it's reasonable price and proximity to points of interest (Pike Place Market, Space Needle, Seattle Center). Our room was small but well-appointed; perfectly comfortable for 2 people. The hotel decor was artistic and quirky. We were able to walk to Pike Place Market within 5-10 minutes and to the Space Needle within 15-20 minutes. We utilized the fitness center which was small but effective. The hotel has a connecting sushi restaurant. We had dinner here and were not disappointed. The food and drinks were delicious. I highly recommend the "ginger manhattan".

We stayed here while visiting Maui for 6 nights. I will be honest, that my first impression of the hotel was that it was in some serious need of some modernisation as the rooms look like they have been stuck in a time-warp! But they were clean, and fresh towels and room cleaned every day. However, after meeting the bar staff and chatting with a few people staying there, we soon settled in. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and really made you get in to the Hawaiian way. The free Hawaiian activities that the hotel offered were really fun. There were always plenty of loungers by the pool area, and the beach is right on the door step. There are also plenty of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel at the Whalers Village, or you can also jump on the shuttle bus at the whaler village for $1 an pop into Lahaina town. Love, Love, Loved it! Mahalo to all the staff at the Ka'anapali beach hotel.

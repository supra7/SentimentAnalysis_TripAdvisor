We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and had a great time. My boyfriend was attending a conference and this was the conference hotel so we got a very good rate. We had never stayed in this area of Seattle and were very happy with the location. The light rail from the airport is about 2 short blocks away from the hotel and (after a 25 cent increase during our stay) is only $2.75 per person each way. The rooms had safes which were big enough for laptops, camera equipment and other electronics when we didn't want to carry them. Very nice 24 hour gym with plenty of equipment. It was a little cold in the gym but I think the temperature is set for a full gym and I was there when it was less crowded. No problem...after a little cardio I was warm enough. The downside is that the restaurant and snack bar are a little pricey...it can run you around $14 for a burger plate but there are other options right outside. Plenty of shopping around too. The room was quite big and the bed was comfy. Staff was helpful, friendly. I would definitely stay here again especially if we could get the same rate. One downside was the $10.95 per day internet charge in your room. There's free internet in the lobby area but if you're doing work from your room and you have phone calls you might not want to be doing them in the lobby.

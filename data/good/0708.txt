We stayed at the Moore when we flew into Seattle to tour the Olympic Peninsula, once at the beginning and before we left. The first night we stayed in one of their remodled rooms. It's an old motel but remodled. I like the older style and architecture so I thought it was real cool. The upgrades they've made kept in with the time period of the motel and looked real nice. For the price of a downtown motel, we couldn't beat it. It's clean and comfortable, the front desk staff was very helpful. It's within walking distance to Pike's Market and the Waterfront. The second night we weren't in one of the newer rooms, but the room was still adequate. Good value, good location.

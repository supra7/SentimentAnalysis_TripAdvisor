If we hadn't had 2 heavy cases and a ski bag we could easily have walked to the hotel from the airport. The courtesy bus came promply when we phoned the hotel and the driver was friendly and helped with the bags. Check in was quick and efficient. We asked for and received a quiet room away from the lifts and on the side of the hotel that faces away from the airport. The room was a king bed room, very large with desk area, huge television, comfortable bed with adjustable mattress settings. The bathroom was also large by British standards, although the bath filled with water when we took a shower and didn't drain very quickly. Everything was very clean and there was also an iron and ironing board in the room. We ate in the hotel restaurant, burger, fries and beer. Service was quick and friendly which was what we wanted as we'd just come off a transatlantic flight and were very tired. Breakfast buffet was fine. Plenty of fresh fruit, yoghurts, bagels, croissants, cereal. Also hot selections, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs (a bit rubbery) and home fries. The waiter brought hot toast, and also toasted the bagels for us. Plentiful supplies of juice, tea and coffee. Check out was also quick and efficient and despite being told the shuttle bus only ran every 20 minutes, a driver was summoned specially for us and took us across there immediately so no waiting around. All in all a pretty good airport hotel.

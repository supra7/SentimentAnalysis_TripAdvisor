I read many reviews before going to Secrets Maroma and found most to be very positive. My negatives and positives: Positives -- First ... this is a beautiful resort with the best beach in Mexico. The staff keeps the place clean and groomed perfectly. Their hard work deserves appreciation and recognition. Food -- fabulous and very healthy with excellent wait staff ... wonderful atmosphere. Bar -- excellent drinks with top shelf liquor Pool and Beach -- wonderful staff, clean and large pool, the beach - beautiful and I spent every day there Negatives - Not everything works - broken equipment in the health club, broken equipment in the Spa, toilets without toilet seats. broken or no ice machines Rooms -- get at 4th floor room cause you can hear anyone and every movement above you and some in the room beside you. Sports Bar -- a joke ... one small TV with just a few sport's channels ... but if you like ping pong there are 3 tables Management -- (not the working staff) - they are there to run a hotel and make money. You are not their guest, you are their income makers. Business Center - Put a fan in the business center ... be prepared to sweat as you sit in front of a computers Tipping - there seems to be confusion about to tip or not tip I decided to tip and I believe the working staff needs the money I have family that works in a management of a luxury resort and she tells me how poorly the working staff is paid. Would I go back -- Yes, but for the expensive cost of Maroma, I would shop around more ... Secrets Maroma is so close to being a 1st rate resort. They should train the management to communicate with guest, fix the broken equipment and if something is broken ... get rid of it. I compliment the lovely working staff ... they are excellent

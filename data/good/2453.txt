I stayed at the W in Seattle for 3 nights from December 11th on business. The rooms are lovely, really tastefully decorated and a huge comfy bed with everything in perfect working order. Certainly couldn't ask for more from a hotel room. As I was there on business I can't comment too much on the overall hotel itself as I left at 7.30am without breakfast and got back after dinner each night after 10pm to go straight to bed! However, I can understand why people might think that the hotel is stingy with extras as the bottle of still water that is normally provided free of charge in hotels like the Hilton was $8.00 (albeit the bottle was large)! The price marked on it was so tiny that I didn't notice it until I had opened it after waking up in the night with a thirst. The reception of the hotel was very trendily decorated and was very dark. I loved the little touches like the door mat at the front of the hotel saying 'Good Evening' 'Good Afternoon' and 'Good morning' depending on the time of day. The valet staff were great too - they literally ran into the road each morning to flag down a taxi for me. My colleague stayed at the Hilton around the corner and was very envious when he dropped by the hotel to see me one day - considering he had paid a much higher price for his room, he would much rather have stayed at the W. Finally, I was quite surprised to walk in on my last evening (Thursday) and find a DJ playing music and lots of people who were not guests sitting in the lobby bar drinking and dancing - the hotel felt like it had suddenly turned into a nightclub and was packed out. I certainly couldn't have sat there and had a quiet drink, so went straight to my room. I think it's a 'novel' idea but not really what I want or expect from a hotel........ It definitely caters for the younger set (20s to 30s). If I was staying there with a family or as an 'older' couple I would want to know about this before making my reservation as it might affect my decision.

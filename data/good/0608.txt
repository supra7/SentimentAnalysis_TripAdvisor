We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in a standard room. The hotel has a more older feel compared to the hotel we stayed in before arriving in Seattle which was more modern, however, this is part of the charm of the hotel. The hotel was very clean and our room albeit a bit small was clean and functional overlooking Macys. We enjoyed drinks in the hotel bar and the Lemon Martini is very good! The hotel is in a very central location, a 5/10 minutes walk to Pike Place Market and the front, next door to a shopping centre and also the Monorail link that takes you directly to Space Needle. There are 2 computers in the hotel lobby with free internet access for guests which was very useful for us to check our flights. A special mention to Wendy in concierge who was fantastic on our first day and gave us lots of hints and tips on what to do and where to eat. I also asked for a vase one day to put the flowers I bought from Pike Place Market and this was delivered to our room within 5 minutes of the request. We had breakfast here on our last day at the hotel which was very good and a good selection on the menu although I was still adjusting to US portions so slightly over ordered! Would we stay here again? Yes especially for the cleanliness and charm of the hotel, the friendly hotel staff and central location.

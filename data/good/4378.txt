Checked in on January 30th. We spent 11 days and enjoyed every minute. We sat in on the nightly entertainment and signed up for daily lessons in hula, ukelele, lei making and weaving. Walked to Black Rock to snorkel most mornings. This is the place to relax and enjoy your vacation. If you are looking to run everyday to some attraction or event you could do that from here also. Great location right on the beach. Walking distance from shopping and restaurants. You can take the Maui bus to Lahania with just a short walk to Whalers village.

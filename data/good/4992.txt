From 16 september till 20 september we stayed in Pera Tulip. We had one room at the front and one at the backside. The room at the front was big and also the bed was perfect. The room at the backside was small and also the bed. The second day we asked for a room at the front and we got it: the room was bigger but the bed was too small. The rooms looked clean and the service was perfect. The second day our friend got ill and had to go to a hospital. We were helped very good by everyone off the staff. We even got the private telephone number of the manager: we could call him day and night! Our friend was taken to the Germain hospital (5 minutes from the hotel). The last day we were allowed to keep the hotelroom untill 5 o'clock so we could transport our friend to the airport. We have good memories (good hotel; beautifull and busy city; kind people; good saloons and restaurants and so long).

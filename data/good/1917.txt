I stayed here for a conference and got a room on the 34th floor facing the water. Very nice. The conference food was easily the best I've ever had, the bed was fabulous and the hotel is walking distance to most tourist attractions. The lobby and bar area is a nice spot for a drink and some free wi-fi while you are waiting for others. Recommended, I would stay here again.

Can't explain why I'm not rating 5. Spacious rooms, W bed, great window ledge seat and fabulous service. Just seems to be something missing. Perhaps I'm unfairly comparing to a recent stay at a brand new Westin resort. Only concrete criticism is robes designed for people with chest size under 42". We had a great stay and would stay there again. The restaurant recommendations by staff made the trip as perfect as it was.

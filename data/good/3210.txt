Booked over octopus travel and found a bargain with breakfast included. Very clean and comfortable room and even though hotel was full nice and quiet. Room was serviced daily and all staff were very welcoming and friendly. Breakfast was your standard German selection, cold meats, cereal, eggs, etc. all very nice however head down to breakfast early as with every hotel every body wants to eat at the last minute Five minute walk from tube station and lots of local attractions nearby. Loved Berlin and will be staying here again on my next visit

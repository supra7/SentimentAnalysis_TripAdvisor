Room was spotless and extremely comfortable. Front Desk people were helpful and polite. Valet was uninterested and was verging on rude. Pulled in on Friday and tried to determine whether we would get Valet service or not. Valet would not give a straight answer as to when we had to have the car out the following day so not to be charged an additional day of Valet parking. Was told " Some time tomorrow " When asked the Valet a second time for clarification was treated like I was stupid. Decided to park on the street. Went out that night and came home around 1 am and asked the same question to the night valet, got the same answer. Decided to ask the front desk. Heard " tomorrow" again. It was actually a guest that told me that I should move the car by about 5PM so as to not get charged a second night. Was very frustrated at this point. Asked for Valet service anyways. That being said the night valet and the night desk person were extremely polite . When I called the next day for my vehicle, I again got the most curt reply when I went to pick my vehicle up. Because of that I decided to write this review. Other than the valet service, the staff was very kind and attentive, the hotel was clean and the location was great. I dont know if this would be my first pick, but I wouldn't object to staying here again.

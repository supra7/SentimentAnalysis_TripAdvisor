My wife and I recently travelled to Seattle for a business convention and were looking for a place that had great views of the sound and was not downtown. The Edgewater definitely did not disappoint with the views, they were great. We had a room that overlooked the water. The rooms were well spaced and had a very lodge like feeling to them. The location was great, within walking distance to Pike Place market...although if the weather was bad, it would have been too long of a walk. But there are some great seafood restaurants about a block or two down the street. We ate at Anthony's one night and it was great. I noticed that the hotel charged for parking, which I always think is very cheap. We also ate at the restaurant one night that is in the hotel. While the food was good, the portions were really small and meal was very expensive for what we got. My wife asked for a recommendation for a white wine to go with her fish, and the waitress recommend one. When the bill came, the glass of wine was $21! Did not think that was very good thing. Overall though, we would definitely stay at the Edgewater again.

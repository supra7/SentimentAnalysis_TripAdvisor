Nice comfortable room with good amenities. nice gym which was free. nice concierge staff. No room service menu when we checked in at midnight. front desk gave us a verbal menu as no room service menu found in entire hotel....went to eat at the w lobby bar instead $90 for fries, avocado, 2 glass of merlot and beer...unfortunately nothing within walking distance at that hour. not sure what regular price but thru hotwire it was worth it. only complaint was the limitations of food latenight other than that good property.

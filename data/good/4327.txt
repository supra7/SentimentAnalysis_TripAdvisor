We stayed at the Maui Hyatt Resort & Spa with 2 children. The grounds were beautiful and a bit pricey but great place to stay with kids.There are flamingos, penguins and parrots on the grounds. The pools were awesome for little, as well as older kids. We got the Terrance View which over looked the roof. It was not a nice view but it was cheaper and we were never in the room.The beach is okay in front of the hotel but not good enough to enjoy. We walked 3 blocks on the hotel path to Whalers Village, where the water was prettier and the kids got to body board.Great place to stay for first timers!

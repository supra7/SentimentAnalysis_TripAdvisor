The Moore was a great base for a first trip to Seattle. The rooms are large and bright, and although some of the bathroom fittings were a bit elderly, everything is very clean. My only warning - make sure you're not near the adjoining theatre if a heavy metal band are playing - on the last day of our stay, a band was rehearsing and it was so loud it made our teeth rattle!

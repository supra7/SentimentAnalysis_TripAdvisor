We stayed for four nights in early November 2006 and were very satisfied. This hotel offers comfortable and affordable accomodations in an older but well maintained building. The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. Don't expect luxury. This hotel offers great value given the accomodations and location. Highlights: Our deluxe room was clean and comfortable with a small walk-in closet, small efficeincy kitchen including basic utensils, dishes, glasses, pot and pan, etc. Shuttle service. Cofee, tea and juice service available in lobby 24/7 Free high-speed internet and cable service Across the street from the Space Needle, Key Arena (Supersonics), Seattle Center (Experience Music Project, Sci-Fi Museum, IMAX, Theatre (plays), etc. Public buses stop right in front of hotel. Two food stores and a drug store within one block of hotel. Excellent restaurants and shops on and around block (Thai, Indian, Continental, Record store, dry cleaners, etc.) The building resembles an older but well maintained smaller apartment building. The rooms facing the street can be noisey at night due to car traffic. If possible, ask for a room in the back of the building. Overall we highly recommend this hotel for the budget minded traveler that's not a "light" sleeper.

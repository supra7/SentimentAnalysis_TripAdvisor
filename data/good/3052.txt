Have stayed here several times when passing through SeaTac, but this time was stuck for 4 days and had time to really check the place out! The rooms are VERY large, and the beds are amazing(standard Hilton bedding). They had a small business center with 2 very high speed computers, and 24hr access. Never had a problem getting on one of them. They just remodeled a new fitness center, which overlooked the pool/courtyard, with several new eliptical and treadmills, all with personal tv screens. The staff has been here for years, and have always been very courteous and helpful. They schedule a free shuttle to take you to Southcenter mall, which is good, because the food in the hotel restaurant is very expensive and moderately good, and the mall area has every eatery you can imagine(Bahama Breeze is my favorite!). If you miss the last shuttle back (8pm), a cab is $12-15.(took them twice). If you like dessert though, be sure to order the strawberry shortcake at the hotel! It is the best, and HUGE! Also, the hotel is huge, so you may have to walk a ways for your room...and parking is pricey in the garage(also quite a distance). I did not rent a car this time, as you can do a very cheap shuttle to downtown Seattle($15 RT) if you want to sightsee there. The Hilton is directly across the street from the airport, and very walkable if you need to run over. They do have an airport shuttle that constantly goes back and forth. All in all, a great place to stay.

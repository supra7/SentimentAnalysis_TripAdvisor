The hotel is close to the metro, so it was easy to find and get to from the Airport. It is situated somewhat in the middle of all the attractions. close enough to pike, and close enough to the bank of america tower. The room was clean, comfortable, with a nice view of the city. I especially like the fact that you can print out your boarding passes downstairs at the business center. Overall a great hotel to call home while touring the city built above another city.

Overall I was very pleased with the Secrets Maroma. It was a great place for a couple to get away and forget about the kids for a while. Overall the food and service was really good. Paulo on the pool deck was extremely helpful and made each day special. The beach is top notch and the pool was great every day. The entertainment staff did a wonderful job, we even got to release baby sea turtles into the ocean. Overall would I head back to Secrets Maramo - Yes in a heart beat. Not everything was perfect but overall they did a great job and we met a ton of wonderful people.

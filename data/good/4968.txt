I choose this hotel as a last resort because i couldnt find nything else as reasonably priced in London. I had read all the reviews and i was terrified to be honest. Most of them seemed bad reviews and although i only wanted a place to sleep i didnt want it to be a depressing nightmare. When i got there the place was getting painted and the lift didnt work, so my first impression was reviews were correct. While waiting to check in i heard a couple saying to reception staff how they had stayed last year and liked it so were stying a week this time. This helped make me feel better as in no way would people come back if it wasnt ok, but then i wondered if they had struck lucky with a room. When i got to my room i was pleasantly surprised. The room was nice and bright and very pleasnt. It had a fridge, a kettle and also a toaster. The layout of the room was like a nice little cosy bedsit. Bathroom was small but not too small to be a problem. There was complimentary bodywash and towels were clean and in plenty. Breakfast was toast, jams, cheeses and cold meats, also cereal of cornflakes or museli. The drinks were tea, coffee or juices and although breakfast wasnt cooked there was plenty of it to fill up on. I stayed there 2 nights and my third night in London was a travelodge. I have used travelodge for yrs and i like the space and how the majority of travelodge tend to be clean, but this time in travelodge i was wishing i was back in this hotel as i prefered it better. Im going back to London in a few weeks and i will be staying in this hotel if it has a vacancy. so if i was happy there so will most people be, unless they are use to the hilton and by some of thr reviews im beginning to wonder if they used that hotel in comparrison. Well it was certainly perfect enough for me.

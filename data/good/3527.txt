My wife and I had a great time at Secrets Maroma Beach. The rooms were nice..the swim-out pools were fantastic..the food and drinks were good..However, we spent quite a bit of time in our room to avoid the mosquitoes!! Wish we would have known how much of a problem it was going to be. We had to coat our arms and legs with bug spray if we ever went outside...it wasn't a problem near the main infinity pool, just near the suites and restaurants that were outside. We would go back, but just not in the rainy season of September.

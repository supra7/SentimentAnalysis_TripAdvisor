We loved your beautiful hotel, the staff were all smiles and kindness, most of the days were sunny and the sea was warm. A few downs, some of the meals were not what we had ordered and one lobster tail was bad and there were a few battles about chairs and towels when the hotel was full on New Years Day (perhaps a note of the rules about reserving poolside chairs should be in your welcome pack). All in all a wonderful stay, we wish we had been on honeymoon it was so romantic but we have been married 40 years so it's a bit late for that.

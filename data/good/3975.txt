Stayed here two nights with my husband and infant son. Hotel is beautiful and staff was helpful and friendly. My husband was attending a conference and while he was working during the day my son and went exploring. This hotel has a perfect location! Beautiful views of the water (you can walk right out along the water from the hotel). Across the street from the baseball stadium, and a 5 min walk to the gas lamp district with great restaurants and shopping. We drove to the zoo one day and it was an easy 10 min drive. I defintely recommend this hotel, it was lovely.

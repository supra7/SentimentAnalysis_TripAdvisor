It has been two weeks since my 14 year old daughter and I returned from Maui. I took her there for Spring Break and we had an awsome time. When we arrived at the hotel, I was told that they had over booked the gardenview catagory that I had reserved. They had already arranged for us to have an oceanview room for the night and compensated us with a free buffet breakfast for every morning that we were there without me having to say a word! I thought the hotel was in a great location. It is an older hotel, but you can't beat the ambiance! They have a great dinner/magic show there in the hotel that is well worth the money. Another plus is they had a self serve laundry room in every building. That really came in handy! We enjoyed the evening entertainment which was different every night. The staff was wonderful. They even have a hospitality room that you can reserve for 30 minutes on your day of departure so if you have to check out at 11:00, but your flight doesn't leave until that night...like ours, you can shower and change after whatever activites you do that day before you leave. If I am ever blessed to be able to return to our heaven on earth (Hawaii) I will definately come back Maui and to the KBH!!!

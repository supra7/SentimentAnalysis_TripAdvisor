We stayed at the Moore for 5 nights over Easter, and loved it. The rooms were large and scrupulously clean. I have seen them described as 'basic', but the bed was really comfortable and warm, there was a large closet and plenty of drawers, table and chairs, big TV... our room also had a fridge and microwave. Not sure what else people are expecting - a trouser press? Staff at reception were really friendly (with the possible exception of the older chap - the manager?!). Housekeeping make animals out of the towels in the bathroom... The location is absolutely fantastic, close to Pike Place and all the bars of Belltown. And the price was the cheapest we could find in Seattle!

I did a group trip with 4 other ladies Oct 14-17th. We stayed in room 842 which is the top floor with no elevators. No big deal not having elevators, you can eat and drink a little more with the exercise that you get going up and down them! The room was very nice and they kept the fridge well stocked. Unfortunately we didn't get very lucky with the weather. It rained each day except for the morning we left. We made the best out of it and the staff did what they could to make it enjoyable despite the bad weather. The food and drinks were very good. My favorite was the Japanese, then Italian and then the Mexican. The breakfast was very good and the lunches at Sabores (sp?) was awesome. Very good pizza and fajitas. I received a spa and facial on one of the rainy days and really enjoyed it. The resort was small but it didn't feel like people were on top of each other at all. Overall I recommend this resort just wish we could have gotten better luck with the weather to make it an even better vacation!

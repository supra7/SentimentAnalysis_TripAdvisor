We have been coming to this Marriott for over 20 yrs. They changed the decor over the last few years, which is still fine; however, the music outside when you pull up and in the lobby is annoying with all the thumping noise. Coming to the lobby first thing in the morning, it is not the kind of noise you like to hear (I call it noise, because it is not music). The music in the restaurant in the evening is lovely, but the morning fare is not as good. We had complained about it when we stayed there 2 yrs. ago, but it went nowhere. After a long plane trip, this is not what you want to hear on your arrival. I don't know if we will ever go back. There is a Hilton next door, maybe we will try that next time. Sad thing is, the people there are very nice and always remember us when we return; but PLEASE, the music? (noise) has to go.

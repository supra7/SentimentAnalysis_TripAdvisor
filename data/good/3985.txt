The hotel is new and in a great location if you have activities at the Convention Center. However, internet access is $20.00 per night! This is really outrageous. Also, they have a very limited gym and charge $15.00 per day per person (not per room) for access to the gym. And, of course, hotel meals and drinks are exorbitantly expensive. So, if staying here, do not use any of the hotel services. Parking is $21. per night

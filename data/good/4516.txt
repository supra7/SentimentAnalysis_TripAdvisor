Loved the staff and location. Will definitely stay at this property with my family again. The hotel is 50ish years old and in process of being renovated...we were in a renovated room that looked great. The staff are very friendly and accomodating. The beach is awesome and a quick swim to Black Rock (snorkeling). Whalers Village is less than a 5 minute walk from the property via a ocean front walkway that runs about a mile and a half along Kaanapali Beach. Overall, the hotel is perfectly located for day trips to Hana, Haleakala, north shore, snorkeling and just about anything else you would want to do. If you have kids, they will love the pool - it has a shallow and deep (7 foot) end for all to enjoy.

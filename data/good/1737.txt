We returned to the Edgewater after a 15 year absence and were very suprised to see how it's been tastefully updated. Nothing beats sitting overlooking the water in the lobby with a nice cocktail. We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel. The place is now has trendy feeling unlike the old comfortable Edgewater.

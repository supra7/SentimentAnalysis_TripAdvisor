This is definitely not the cookie-cutter type hotel one is used to in America. They are definitely trying to be different -- from the choices of wallpaper to the complimentary goldfish, to the parade of dogs (most of them extremely well behaved) in the lobby. While there are definitely some misses -- and I can see how some guests could have disappointing stays -- overall this hotel is fun, comfortable and extremely well located for downtown Seattle. Definitely try to avoid bringing a car here as parking is expensive and most destinations are walkable, or accessible using the excellent public transportation. I found most of the staff to be very professional and friendly, and more than willing to help with special requests. I detected no snootiness, and little pretention. Unless you are totally not into "cool," I think most guests will enjoy the atmosphere. The free early evening cocktail party is definitely a plus, and the hotel goes out of its way to make children (and pets!) welcome. My only real hesitation in recommending this hotel is price. Honestly, it's not worth their typical rates. But if you can plan ahead, or are willing to try services such as hotwire, you can often snag a good deal here. Enjoy!

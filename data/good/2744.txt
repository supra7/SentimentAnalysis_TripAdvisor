I stayed one night at this hotel as it is very close to the airport. Overall the rooms were nice and clean, comfortable bed, and good location. Two issues: This is a big property so it is a long walk to some of the rooms. Not a big deal but could be for others. The issue I had is that my wake up call came 1.5 hours early.

Finally, a modern and clean hotel on a quiet street in the heart of Rome! I sifted through so many expensive Roman dumps, that the Opera was quite a find. A 8 minute walk from Termini station, tucked in behind Piazza Republica - on a whisper quiet street behind the Opera Centre. The entrance of the hotel is not obvious, but once buzzed in, the experience is great. Clean, and very modern - with luxurious room appointments. The rate was good, when paying by cash - and the service and breakfast were also very good. Their pastries especially were great! My only recommendation to the hotel is to get proper desk chairs for your internet stations. The ones you have are far from comfortable. A very minor blip, in an otherwise stellar stay. Thank you Hotel Opera!

My husband and I stayed at the Sorrento for three nights in July. While being a historically significant hotel, lovely decor, and the staff being friendly , its location is not good. Walking down hill to the market place and elsewhere is easy but walking back, up horribly steep hills, was a killer. The room we stayed in was very tiny and we heard ambulances all night long because a hospital is just a block away. Walking locally, it is situated in a neighborhood that we did not feel comfortable walking around safely. Their is a little diner type restaurant across the street which was excellent and very, very inexpensive.

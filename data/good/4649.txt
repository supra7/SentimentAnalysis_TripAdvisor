Just left Kaanapali Beach Hotel 2 days ago after 6 day stay 2/11- 2/16/06. We'd read many TripAdvisor reviews prior to going, and most were right on the mark. Hotel is in a great location on the beach, has lots of activities for the kids (we have 3, ages 9,6,4), decent but not great food in the restaurants, a VERY friendly staff, and reasonable prices compared to surrounding resorts such as the Sheraton, Westin, and Hyatt. On the negative side, the room (we had a family suite which had a main/living room plus a small, separate bedroom) was definitely dated, and the small bathroom looked like something you would expect to find at a Super 8 Motel. Several other reviewers had mentioned this, but some pointed out that part of the hotel has been updated, so apparently this is not a universal problem there. All in all, I felt that what we received for $425 a night, including breakfast, was a good deal since we don't require a ritzy hotel, and having the suite was mandatory for the 5 of us- getting a suite elsewhere, or 2 rooms, would have been far more expensive. Take your savings and stay another week somewhere, as we are currently doing in Kauai! Aloha...

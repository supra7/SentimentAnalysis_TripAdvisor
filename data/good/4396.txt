Husband and I stayed here in Dec. 2011. I have absolutely no complaints or negative remarks. It was the least expensive hotel in Kaanapali, it was clean, the service was excellent and the rooms comfortable. They have many perks for return guests. We loved sitting on the lanai and listening to the live music from the Brunch on Sunday afternoon. The beach is amazing, great snorkeling, great walking and people watching. There were a lot of families with small children here and also older individuals.

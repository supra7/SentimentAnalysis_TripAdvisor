love the fact that's its a short distance a way from Termini station so we walked from the station to the hotel. We were surprised by the upgrade and got the suite. It's sweeetttt. If the hot tub and jacuzzi shower worked during our stay it's definitely a 5 but since it was broken the whole time we were there (4 nights), I have to give it a 4. But, the room though is really nice. It's nice to go back to a clean hotel after a whole day of venturing the city. The service staff are very nice, friendly, and helpful. I would definitely go back to this place again.

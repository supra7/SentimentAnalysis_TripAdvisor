I found the Hotel Andra on Stash Rewards and was very happy that I picked this place. The hotel was very quaint and quiet while we were there, even though there was a pretty large conference happening in the city. Our room was on the small side. Nothing like the photos which others have posted, but I knew this going into booking the room as Seattle was one stop on a longer journey and we only stayed for 2 nights. Regardless of the smallness of the room, it was perfectly fine for our two large suitcases and we managed. The room is well appointed and was comfortable. The front staff was friendly and the bellman spent a long time on our departure trying to hunt down a cab for us, which was much appreciated. Hotel Andra is centrally located to Pike's Fish Market and The Space Needle via monorail- we even had a view of it from our room! Would definitely stay here again, but maybe get a larger room for a longer stay.

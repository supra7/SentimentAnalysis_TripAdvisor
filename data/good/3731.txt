We needed two family rooms as there were 6 in our extended family with one being a 9 year old daughter and we had difficulty finding suitable accommodation, in the budget price range, until I found the Fragrance Sunflower. The telephone reservation person was most helpful and when we arrived we were greeted buy the front desk staff member and checked in without any delay. From reading reviews from others on Tripadvisor, we were expecting some negatives but after three nights/four days staying in this hotel we all were most impressed with the manners of the three front desk staff, the service personal as well as how clean the rooms were. People that travel sufficiently know what to expect but there are also many travelers that just want to whinge for the sake of whinging as can be read from some of the reviews on this web site. My experience comes from 881 days overseas in the past 19 years. Budget accommodation, by it's name implies that the price will be cheap and the service basic, but at the Sunflower we were impressed as we could not fault this hotel. If we wanted additional towels - no problems; if we wanted directions or assistance in booking attractions - again no problems and with their assistance we did more and saw more than we thought we could in the 4 days we were in Singapore. Bathroom water temperature and pressure seems to be a problem in Singapore (refer many reviews on many other hotels), but at the Sunflower the water was very hot and the pressure better than other hotels I have stayed in in many cities around the world. The internet was available through an associate hotel across the road, a walk of 60 meters. The MRT was less than 10 minutes walk and taxi's were available from the main road at the end of the street - 140 meters. Food, drink and entertainment (including ladies of the night) were in plentiful supply from as close as 50 meters. We, including our 9 year old daughter, never felt uncomfortable walking in the streets at night.

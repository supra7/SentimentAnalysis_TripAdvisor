We didn't want to pay too much but wanted a good location - and I am very happy with our choice. Yes the walls are thin, and it is an older building, but the bed was awesome, the room was clean and after a very long flight the shower was excellent. I guess it is an example of moderating your expectations. I didn't expect a fancy new hotel, so I'm not disappointed. I did expect a good bed and great location - and I'm not disappointed.

I love clean, well-appointed hotels that I can safely walk to from the airport. That's the case with this Hilton. If you follow the signs for the "Link Light Rail" you will end up in a station on the west side of International Drive. Simply continue on the pedestrian bridge onto the east side of International Drive, take the elevator to the street level, and you'll be facing the Hilton. What's even better is that, once you check in, you can take the Link Light Rail to downtown Seattle in a scant half-hour for $2.50 each way. This Hilton is a low-rise surrounding a pleasant courtyard; ask for a room facing onto this courtyard. It doesn't have a Hilton HHonors lounge, but it does have a restaurant serving a decent breakfast buffet. (I can't vouch for the quality of food at other times of the day since I've only eaten breakfast there.) The rooms are appointed with good-quality furnishings and the comfy Hilton bedding. Despite its proximity to the airport, the rooms are quiet and I had no trouble sleeping. The staff members are very friendly and helpful. Traffic in Seattle is so awful that, if you've got a morning flight out of SEATAC airport, I urge you to stay overnight at the Hilton Seattle Airport on your last night in town. You will be treated well and will have no trouble making your flight in the morning.

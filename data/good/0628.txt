We were booked in here by a friend, and had heard good things about the hotel. The location is excellent. We liked everything about the hotel, but found it a bit cramped, and a bit tired, with a room that was on the small side compared with what we are used to in Seattle for the same price. There is an excellent bar/restaurant whose name I can't remember. I would recommend the hotel, but probably would look around before booking back in there again.

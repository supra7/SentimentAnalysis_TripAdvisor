We were pleasantly surprised at the size of the family suite. Three floors including a jaccuzi in the basement. My only issue was that the room has little natural light, but it had a lot of room for 2 adults and 2 teenage boys. The staff were always helpful and pleasant and breakfast adequate. Its a central location: Its 5 minutes to Republica Metro station, 15 mins to Trevi Fountain, 20 mins to Colosseum. From Barberini statiion its 20 mins to the Pantheon.

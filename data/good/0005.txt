My husband and I go to Baltimore often as he has family and friends from college in the area. The location was right where we wanted. The hotel was very nice overall. The main drawback was not of any fault of the hotel, there was a lacrosse tournament in the area so both Saturday and Sunday mornings I was awakened by noise in the hallways. I was surprised to see a manual thermostat in the room so it was hard to regulate the air conditioner. I also did not like the layout of the bathroom. The towel rack was inside the shower and the toilet paper was difficult to reach from the toilet. Anyone with young children would have had issues with this. We did not use the pool however there was a sign at the desk that there is a 17 person limit and a waiting list at times.

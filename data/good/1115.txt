The location is great, centrally located. Rooms are average. Only expect a good view on executive floors (24 & up). Parking is high, but normal for downtown ($32/day). I rented a car at the hotel for ($17/day) and just returned it each night to save on parking. Alamo & national are located in the hotel. I would stay here again...

We managed to find a hotel in the Seattle area when driving thru. Seeems like most hotels were booked in the Seattle area last week. Didn't think the Hilton had any rooms but they had 2 left. The rooms are nice and clean. Parking was expensive at $18/night for self parking. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice. I would stay here again.

We just returned from our long awaited trip to Maui - my mother, sister, brother-in-law, a family friend and myself and we stayed for 5 days. We had a wonderful time - huge clean rooms with a great view of the gardens (partial ocean view - we could see the water through the trees but the garden view was wonderful). Our welcome with the orientation breakfast and then the farewell ceremony were both really special. We felt welcome and then felt sad on goodbye. Special thanks to Malihini for her help in making our trip special - she gave us a really good idea of where everything was and significance so renting a car and driving was an excellent experience. Beautiful beaches, great food, and don't miss the road to Hana - some wonderful surprises along the road. Personally, I really enjoyed getting up early, before sunrise and walking along the beach. We talked to quite a few people while we were there and many were returning guests who said Maui was the best choice and I believe as well that KBH is the best experience.

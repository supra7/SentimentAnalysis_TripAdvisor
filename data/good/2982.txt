My wife and I have stayed at this property a number of times over the past four years. I can understand some of the reviews that complain about not having an elevator - it doesn't. Based on our stays, it seems that the higher the floor, the better the quality of rooms. On our recent stay, we stayed on the third floor. The room was spotlessly clean, had no odor, the matress very comfortable, the bedsheets and pillows clean as a pin, and the room was outstanding overall. The hotel has been renovated and modernized in the last two years, and I would rate this Quality Inn in the top 10% of Quality Inns in which I've stayed.

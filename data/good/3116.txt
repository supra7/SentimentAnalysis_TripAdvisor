We stayed two nights during a 36-hour visit to the Seattle area for a Wedding on Vashon Island. Since we didn't need to be downtown, we opted for an airport hotel to save money. With taxes it was $145 per night. The king bed was extremely comfortable. The room was nicely appointed, plenty spacious, with a desk, chair, large TV, etc. Everything was clean. Awesome shower head--maybe the best of any hotel I've ever been in. Check-in and -out process was extremely easy. Very convenient to the airport. Room was quiet, no airport noise. We never saw the pool or whirlpool or work-out facilities. We did not use the free broadband. We ate at the restaurant next door in the Red Lion, Gregory's, which looked pretty downtrodden, but our low expectations were exceeded. Still, not a lot of good "dining" options on International road, where all the airport hotels are situated. The Radisson breakfast looked expensive. All-in-all, a good experience. Everything you would want in a 3-star hotel with good value.

We had a lovely time at this Secrets resort, The food was great and the service was even better. We went with a crew of six couples. The swim outs were a great choice for some. The bugs were bitting but we managed. Our crew was lively and added much fun to the activities at night. My problem with the hotel came after I came home and my bank sent me an email about some international charges. My bill showed two different charges, one I had made and another for a different amount. that I know nothing about. I have been in touch with my bank and are refuting the extra charge that appeared on my bill, I also tried to speak to someone at the hotel regarding the extra charge and spoke to five different people who just transferred me around until I got to the front desk person who said they remember me and to send her the info to get it fixed. I have not heard anything since then and the charge is still on my bill. That is the only thing that has put a blemish on this resort. I would recommend this hotel but caution people to pay cash at the end of your stay for other item purchased instead of charging it on your credit card..

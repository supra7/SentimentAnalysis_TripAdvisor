Stayed for 2 nights in a Classic room. A bit on the small side, but very nicely appointed. Great location - I walked almost everywhere I needed to go, but the Westlake station is almost under the hotel if you need transport. Very pleasant staff and a welcoming atmosphere. Would definitely stay again if I returned to Seattle.

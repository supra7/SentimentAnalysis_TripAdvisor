http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVHRz1DvQ9c I liked this place and I would stay here again. We stayed here for a week in June 2011 visiting Disneyworld and Universal and it was an awesome value for the money. It is an older building and it seems like they have done a lot of remodeling with more that can still be done. Some of the work looked like DIY home depot fixes such as the tape foam on the door jams. The manager was very personable and nice. One night there was an accident down the road and all the power in the area was out when we arrived from EPCOT. The manager came back to the hotel, met us at the door, and explained what was going on. Then he walked us to the room with a flash light. The power came back on shortly after that. They have a small breakfast area with a bunch of carb type stuff, bagels, toast, cereal, muffins, etc and they have hard boiled eggs that they serve right above a very tempting microwave. DO NOT PUT EGGS IN A MICROWAVE. There was a young English bloke who put an egg in the microwave and within 45 seconds there was a messy explosion of egg and yolk coating the inside of that microwave. The poor cleaning lady had a look on her face like "please lord, not again". But she kept a smile like a trooper as the guy apologized over and over. The room was very small. They do have some larger rooms that have two beds but for the king rooms I would recommend no more than 2 people since there is no place for a roll-a-way. The bed was very comfortable, it was a pillowtop mattress with nice sheets. The location was great with a McDonalds pretty much in the parking lot and a 7-11 at the corner. It's right on West Irlo Bronson so there's lots of restaurants you can hit on the way to the parks or coming back from the parks. There's a Target Store right down the street. Unlike the East side of Irlo Bronson, there is NO bus that goes directly to Disneyworld and there is no shuttle.

I found the staff here very helpful and friendly...one of the nicest I came across in so many hotels i stayed elsewhere. The location of this hotel is great...right smack in the middle of old town city and lots of resturants along the street. My only dissapointment would be that while it has the stated facilities, it is not as just not as Grand and Premier as one would expect of a typical 5 star hotel , but to be fair to the hotel, I read that the '5 star standard' in Istanbul varies from elsewhere. Don't expect a typical 5 star style Suite and Spa Hotel. I would give it 3.5 - 4 stars with great location and very helpful staff so if you consider this as a 3.5 - 4 star hotel when booking and you are happy with the room rates, then you certainly won't be dissapointed.

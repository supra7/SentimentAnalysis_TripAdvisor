We basically had to "live" in this hotel for several weeks when we moved to Seattle, while we tried to find an apartment. Absolutely loved it. Great location, wonderful service, and very good food. Best of all is the Westin Heavenly Bed - it's a dreamy night's sleep. We've stayed at several Westins all over the country and found the caliber of quality and service to be consistently good, and this time was no different.

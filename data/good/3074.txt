Stayed there for one night before a flight out. The hotel is getting a bit old and the elevators definitely need a revamp on the cables (noisy, bumpy and it takes a bit to figure out waht floor it's on, so it takes forever to open the doors). Staff is great. Shuttle is great. Real close to SEATAC, so a good stop for an overnight before an early flight.Beautiful room with the "business" upgrade. Very nice desk to work on. Internet is a bit "sluggish" and difficult to connect to. Had to try a few before one would actually connect.

This was our third stay at this hotel. Kaanapali beach can be an expensive area to stay on Maui but the Kaanapali offers a great value with out all of the frills. The hotel could use a bit of updating and better amenities also the mixed plate was closed down "Due to the economy". It was all ok for us. We ate at the hotel's other resturant and also went to Lahaina for food. Over all the place has not changed much in the past ten years or so. The Aloha sprit is very prevalent at the KBH and we will return again for sure :)

My Husband and I needed a weekend getaway so we decided to explore Seattle! The Hotel Vintage Park is really close to the *downtown* core of Seattle. Pike Place Market and the major shopping malls/stores are easily within walking distance. I can't comment on the price of the place - we happened to receive a corporate rate - so for the price we paid - the room was fabulous. However, I can understand if people are hesistant to hand out the big bucks for normal rates. There isn't much to the Hotel as far as amenities go - the lobby itself is quite small, but the restaurant looked lovely. There's no pool or gym facilities in the hotel. Each room is named after a Washington Vineyard which was neat (for winos like us). Another *bonus* is everyday from 5:00-6:00 there is an open winetasting in the lounge. Sometimes they have local wine intellectuals or vineyard owners come in and lead the tasting, and other times it's a free-for all. When we went, the wine was just laid out for anyone to try - no limit and it was a cozy atmosphere once people got warmed up. The only complaint I had, was parking. Valet parking is the only option at the hotel and it's $30 a night. However, there is a parking garage right across the street which has cheaper rates if you want to carry your stuff across the street. We chose the valet parking, just for the convenience and we didn't have to worry abotu our car too much while we were in the city.

I originally was assigned to a 30th floor Starwood Preferred Guest room with two double beds and a tiny bathroom. After about half an hour I decided that the two miniature beds weren't going to work out and called the front desk who informed me there were no King beds available in the entire hotel (over 1,000 rooms) but that they would see what they could do and call me back. After several more conversations they were able to put me in a Studio King(directly across from the elevators with a dining table and roomy bathroom and living room area). Apparently they do not offer Queen size beds, rooms feature either a King or two doubles. The fitness center is very well equipped and the pool is nice enough with an excellent view of the city. This is possibly the only pool I have ever seen offering a wheel chair lift. There is also a mysterious room by the pool labeled "Massage", but it's always locked and I don't think they really offer massages there. Various other things happened during my stay that would have resulted in a much more unpleasant critique had the hotel staff not responded so promptly and appropriately each time.

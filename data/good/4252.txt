We stayed at the Hyatt for the first 2 nights of our trip to Hawaii. It was a good way to start our vacation and spend a couple days relaxing. The room was very comfortable and what one would expect from a Hyatt. The room was not a huge but the bed was so, so comfy!! And in Hawaii, if you are hanging out in your hotel room all day something i wrong, so a comfy bed was all we needed. The grounds at the hotel are wonderful, the food is fantastic, and the staff very helpful. We loved sitting on the bar above the pool area enjoying a wine and wonderful sushi. I would not spend the money to stay here for an extended period of time since after the first day we started exploring the island, but for 2 nights it was just right!

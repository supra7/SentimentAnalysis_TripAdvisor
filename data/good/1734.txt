The Edgewater Hotel bills itself as the only hotel in central Seattle that's on the water. It's actually built on a pier that juts out into the water. From the lobby, you can sit and look out the floor-to-ceiling windows and watch the ferries, tour boats and tugs come and go all day. My room had a view of the water, also. The staff in the restaurant were attentive and the breakfast I had there was great. Pike Place Market is easily within walking distance or a short taxi ride if the incline is too much for you. I highly recommend this place.

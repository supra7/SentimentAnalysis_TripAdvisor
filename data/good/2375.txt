We stayed at the W Seattle in December as part of our holiday season/vacation. I really can't find anything wrong with this hotel property. The staff was very courteous and friendly. The valet couldn't be more professional and helpful. The front desk immediately recognized that we were SPG Gold and upgraded us to superior room on the 24th floor with a great view of Macy's star and Space Needle. The rooms were very clean and well laid out. The furniture very sheik. It made you feel that everything in the room was personalized to your taste, like having your own interior designer. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows very fluffy. The bathroom was large and had plenty of amenities. It was very quiet and it felt like we were the only ones in the hotel during our stay. The hotel was walking distance (2-3 blocks) to Seattles shopping district where there is plenty to see, eat, shop, and do. Couple of minor things that may have been an issue during our stay - the hotel entrance was a little tough to find and the valet/parking daily rate was expensive - $44/day. I also found the lobby to be a bit small... Other than that, I highly recommend the W to travelers to Seattle.

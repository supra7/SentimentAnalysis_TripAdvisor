I stayed here for 5 nights in October 2011. The hotel is a great choice for anybody visiting Istanbul. The room was comfortable, spacious, clean, and modern. The staff was polite and helpful. The hotel serves a great complimentary breakfast. Finally, there is a very posh spa and a good gym in the hotel, my wife got a massage that she was very happy with. My only small complaint is the location. The hotel is within walking distance of all the action on Taksim square which is great. However, the hotel is located on the ugly side of Taksim square where the pedestrian area gives way to a lot of cars and traffic. So stepping out of the hotel is not a thrilling experience, but you only have to walk for about 3 minutes to get to the hip areas of the city. The hotel is also a hike, but a doable hike, from the number one tram line which leads right to all the major tourist sites in the old city. All and all a very good choice.

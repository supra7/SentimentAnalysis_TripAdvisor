The layout of the hotel is two-fold - one side is a retro- 6 wing (each 3 stories) complex. The layout is rather spider-like with the hotel's pool being the spider's body with 3 hotel wings on each side radiating out from the center like spider legs. The other portion of the hotel is a multi-story high rise. I did not see this portion of the hotel. The building, layout and design of the spider-like complex is somewhat old-fashioned and definitely retro. That being said, it is neat and clean. I had a king bed room on the second floor of the 4th wing. The room was neat and clean and allegedly smoke-free. However, to me, it smelled like someone had recently smoked in the room and no amount of cleaning had successfully eliminated the lingering smell. The room doors have a gap at the bottom that allows for a lot of noise to filter in from the halls. The cleaning staff began early the morning that I checked out and were EXTREMELY noisy. I was up already, but they were so noisy that they would have woken me otherwise. They were speaking in a foreign language and it sounded like they were shouting instructions at each other up and down the hallways. This went on for about 10 minutes before it stopped. Parking is an additional $19.95 per night for self-park and WIFI internet is an additional $12.95 per 24 hour period.

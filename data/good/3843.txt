I really need to agree with previous reviews: the only (not so) negative element I could find about the Cinemusic hotel is the size of our room. The rest is absolutely lovely. We booked a superior room, so we expected "more" space, but we got a rather small room compared to other 4star hotels we stayed at. We had small bags becasue we only stayed 3 nights on a romantic weekend, but with bigger suticases it would have been impossible to move inside the room :-) Bed is really confortable, nice balcony, great shower, clean room, nice breakfast, flat screen TV (channels in Italian only ), good location not far from the underground and the center, friendly staff and not too expensive compared to other hotels in Rome! One day, coming out of our room, the maids were cleaning the rooms in our same alley and we saw one bigger room (comapred to the one we had) and a smaller room (even smaller than our room!!!) so I think it is a question of luck...

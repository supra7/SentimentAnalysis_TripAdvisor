Paying for upgraded swim up suites and not being able to utilize the patio ruins this trip. Our evenings of trying to relax on our private patio were totally ruined by the smokers in suite 301. Smokers dominate the 24 hour bar in the evenings which is the only setting while waiting for dinner. EDM is fantasic resort, if your allergic to cigarette smoke or simply can not tolerate it stay away. Wine list very limited for a California preference. Pool water cold. Service and staff are excellent.

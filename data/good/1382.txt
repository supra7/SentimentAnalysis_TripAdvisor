Thanks to previous reviewers for guiding me to this hotel. It was a perfect choice for our one-night stay in Seattle before heading to destinations beyond the city. I took the advice of other travelers and requested a room in the new tower. My family of three agreed we were very happy with our choice. The location was excellent, close to shopping and lots of restaurant choices. Close walking distance to Pike's Place and major national retail chains and restaurants. The rooms were modern, well appointed and impeccably maintained. Beds made for a great nights sleep. Front desk was very accommodating about our request for a room in the new tower. The concierge was helpful in selecting family friendly restaurants Our teenager was disappointed the pool was closed (but we knew that going in); the cost of valet parking was very steep and there was no self park option. The bellmen were a bit unhelpful and borderline rude. This was definitely a tourist-dominated area and not for those wanting something more authentic. Overall a real winner with our family.

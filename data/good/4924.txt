My friend and I were delighted and grateful to have stayed at this hotel. We were happy right off the bat with the location and service. The hotel is very clean and decorated elegantly, yet not over the top with nice marble/tile floors, carpets, and other furnishings. wonderful connoisseurs were very helpful and informative, very pleasant to interact and engage with also. they were trying hard to accommodate our wishes and expectations. The only really downside would be the parking, even though it is free. We were just concerned because it is in a back alley and there were street bums sitting around, but they were benign, and after being there for four days, the parking situation was non-threatening and passed with a B. Luckily I own a Honda, but I would have felt uncomfortable if my nice car was just left there idle all evening. I believe they will address this in the future. The stairs can be a bit much for some. Expect to get a good workout. Not ideal for handicapped or disabled persons who can't move well. There is no elevator, so you need to get yourself up and down with ease. the water pressure issue ( We got used to it, but without a doubt, it could have been better). They had suite options, and that is what we had, with a sofa to sit on, two TVS, a kitchenette, etc. It was comfortable and very spacious. We walked to everywhere to because of the location. You can drive if you want, but it wasn't necessary based on this location. The linens and the king size bed is AMAZING---simply divine! I would stay here again and highly recommend it based on what you get for how much you dish out money wise. We didn't need a pool or business center or breakfast area or gym. the room was fine, so I can't knock them for that.

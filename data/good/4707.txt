Whle the views are not at this hotel, you also do not have to deal with the noise of the canals. The rooms are smartly decorated and of good size. They have a nice continental-type breakfast included. They did have meats, salad, and some wonderful pastries to go along with the usual light fares. We were maybe 2 blocks from the water taxi and the 2nd stop from the main terminal. With suitcases this is a piece of cake, no bridges! We ate at lovely restaurants not far from our hotel, with the locals. It is not marked well, but a local actually walked us to the hotel after we had passed it a couple of times. We found out that house numbers are not necessarily in sequence and your street may end and pick up somewhere else. But they said had we called they would gladly have given us good directions. We located it pre-cruise so we would not have any problems after with our stay.

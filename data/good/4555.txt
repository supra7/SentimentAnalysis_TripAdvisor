Stayed from dec 27 to jan 2, 2009. Not impressive when you first get there, but it grows on you. Kinda stuck in the 50's-60's. Picked it based on TA ratings. Didn't interact with staff much, but all experiences helpful/good. Didn't partake in any of the on-site activities. Buffet breakfast was part of our package and completely adequate. Much cheaper than surrounding hotels with same beach, shopping amenities, and snorkeling. Ratings vary so much because there are at least 6 different room types/sizes. Our first room was lousy and old, and we had to wait a day for an upgrade. Neighboring rooms smoking on the balcony was a problem, and when we switched, it was still a problem from the room below us, but rooms were much nicer (newer carpet/wallpaper/granite counters). King rooms have a twin bed/couch against the wall, perfect for kids. Some rooms at this hotel are great, others aren't. On-site restaurants were so-so, but plenty of choices within walking distance. We hit other TA recommendations for dinner, Hula Grill, Lalaina's, lots of places in Lahaina. Plenty of returning families - only hotel on the strip where everybody decorated their balconies with xmas decorations/lights. Felt homey in a good way. Large grass areas and beautiful plumeria trees are almost nicer to lay out than going to the beach. Rooms facing the courtyard/pool much better than the ones facing adjacent hotels. All are close to beach, not a big property. Snorkeling at black rock was great - go early for turtles (7:30-8 am). No good boogeyboarding on Kaanapali (while we were there) - drove 5-10 min north to Fleming Beach (public) and hung out there.

The Kaanapali Beach hotel is definitely the most Hawaiian hotel as they claim to be. The spirit of Aloha is exuded by all staff. They make you feel at home. The room rates are quite good for the area. The rooms are nothing special but are decent. The pool is a decent size and there are plenty of lounge chairs. The grounds are beautiful and perfect for laying out and reading. The value can't be beat, one can easily overspend in Lahaina.

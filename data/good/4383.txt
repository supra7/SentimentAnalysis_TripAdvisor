Stayed here from 2-2-2012 to 2-8-2012. Hotel is a bit aged, but is clean and everything worked. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room had a balcony, safe, iron, refrigerator, hair dryer. Shower worked OK, but takes a little while to drain. Provide a cord for plug-in internet access for $9.95 for 24 hours, but I was able to connect to a free wifi connection from my room (not from the hotel). TV is a tube type 25 inch. The breakfast buffet is offered as a part of a package or pay as you go. It was adequate, but very overpriced at $19.95 pp, standard fare of fruit, eggs, sausage and bacon.. Most Hotels in the area are even more expensive for Breakfast, Better to go to nearby CJ's or a short drive to Lahania for breakfast. Breakfast much less expensive and much better. There is no natural shade on the beach. You can rent an umbrella/lounge chairs or cabana for $30 per day, or you can go by the pool where there are plenty of chairs and tree shade. Pool is mediocre (smaller than most resorts). Towels are provide at no charge on beach or pool. Alcohol is not allowed on beach, but I think this is a law Maui-wide. Tiki Bar, and Snack Shack are adequate, but small. The restaurant is just OK, with much better options in nearby Lahania. All food in this area is very expensive, average is $30 for your base entree unless you go very early and get the early-bird specials. Parking is $9 per day self-park, unlimited in/out.

The Moore's location is ideal: easy walking distance to Pike Public Market, restaurants, and Westlake Center. The rooms have no frills, but are clean, comfortable, high-ceilinged and have refrigerators. Those used to staying in modern hotels like Hyatts, Holiday Inns, Sleep Inns and the like may be disappointed in the furnishings, but this is a turn-of-the-century building with that type of charm. It even has keys for the doors -- not key cards. Staff is friendly, internet in the lobby is free, and some floors have wireless capability (you have to ask for one. The only down side is that it doesn't have parking, requiring some hunting for lots that match your schedule. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others. For $100 a night in downtown Seattle, it's a real bargain.

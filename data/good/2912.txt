not to shabby Stayed there for a night, should have stayed two. The bed was to die for slept like a baby. The hotel needs up dating but it is in the process of that. We would stay there again next time we are down in Seattle. Didn't get to try the pool next time will, the breakfast in the morning was the best that I have ever seen. The ladies at the front desk where great, very helpfull. Hotels.com didn't send them are reservations, but that didn't matter they got us into a room and took care of it for us. The room was clean, the hallways where clean. The maids where even nice. Can't wait to see it when it is done being worked on for I think it is going to be a very nice hotel. Never heard a plane once! Try it out, we did, and we will go back!!

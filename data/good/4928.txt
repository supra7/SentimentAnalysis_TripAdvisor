We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is central, the staff and management extremely friendly and helpful, and the suite impeccably clean and comfortable. The stairs in the hotel are not an issue unless you are physically disabled. Assistance with luggage is offered as soon as you step into the lobby. The furnishings in the room and in the kitchen are tasteful and functional, the bed very comfortable, and the wireless internet connection flawless. We look forward to returning to Parc Suites many times.

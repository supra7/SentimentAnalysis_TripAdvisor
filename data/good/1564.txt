Loved it. Location was superb. Within walking distance to all the great tourist attractions: The Needle, the Market, great restaurants, AND within walking distance from the train station (about 3 blocks). An easy 40-minute ride to and from SEATAC. Serious Pie across the street is a serious must try... For a boutique hotel, they did a great job upgrading everything. We've been to some boutique hotels where the slap-and-stick fascades poorly hid what they were trying to conceal. This was not the case for the Andra. Rooms were up to date in decor and in technology and tastefully done. The bathroom is kind of small, but still nicely redone. Free Wi-Fi if you ask. My only pet peeve -- when we asked for a taxi to be called, we were told that their car service was about the same price as a taxi. Believing what they said was true, we climbed right in. They gave us a business card to call for a return pick up. Since a taxi was already available when we were ready to go back, it made more sense to take the taxi than wait for the hotel car. Much to our surprise, the cost of the taxi cab ride back to the hotel was LESS than HALF the ride back WITH tip. That was not cool. Fortunately the overall experience of the hotel makes up for that misleading tip. We would easily stay there again...we'd just avoid their car service thank you very much.

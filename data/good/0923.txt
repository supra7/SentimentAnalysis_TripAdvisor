I found this hotel to be a pretty decent place to stay in downtown Seattle. It was clean, the staff was friendly and the location is absolutely unbeatable. There's a small workout room, it was OK. I especially liked that the hotel is so centralized and close to everything - the stadiums, Pike Place Market, downtown shopping and restaurants, Belltown, nightclubs. We had a room facing over 4th Avenue and it was very quiet at night. However, the hotel is older and not especially fancy. The rooms are small and showing their age, but it was certainly clean. If decor and opulence is a priority, you could opt for the W or Hotel Monaco, which are on the same block -- and probably 2 to 3 times more expensive. For the price and convenience, however, it's a good deal.

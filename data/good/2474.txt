Just returned from a long weekend trip to the W Hotel and thought it was fabulous. It is very modern and the halls are too dark but the room was wonderful, the W bed was the best I have ever slept in, service was great, very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect, walking distance to everything. Highly recommend this hotel.

Brand new hotel that needs to work out a few issues. Beautiful views, right on the water, comfy beds, nice bathrooms, food was good and the bar is nice. In January, they had only been open a few months. Poor signage and interesting layout to meeting rooms from lobby and to the outside. Elevator to rooms was close to meeting areas. It was impossible to find the Starbucks in a 10 minutes break. The small meeting rooms used the big screen tv hooked up to the computer, instead of a lcd. Great outdoor space for reception gatherings.

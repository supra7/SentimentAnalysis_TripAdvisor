My husband and I stayed at the Westin for a long weekend in Seattle. We were given a lovely room on the 36th floor with a fantastic view of the city. The hotel was only 3 blocks to Pike's Place Market, so the location was perfect. We rented a car to drive to Vancouver and used it to navigate to other areas of the city. The concierge at the hotel was accomodating and informative. The room were comfortable and extremely clean. The beds were awesome!!!! The view from the room was spectacular. The room service was pricey and we did not eat in the hotel. Overall, a pleasant stay in Seattle.

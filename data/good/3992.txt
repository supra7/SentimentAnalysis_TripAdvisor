i enjoyed my stay here. Fast check in with no hassle. I enjoyed an upgraded bayfront view without extra charge. Room was a good size and was clean. Pool was nice. It is walking distance to gaslamp but if you are wearing high heels i would get a cab. I wouldn't describe this hotel as luxurious, but it is nice, new and clean.

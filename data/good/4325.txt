We stayed here for our honeymoon and LOVED the room! We had a full ocean view room and the accomodations were beautiful. Very nicely decorated room, you truly did feel like you were in paradise. The hotel grounds are amazing, especially all of the wild life the prominently display for guests. Spats Trattoria was and excellent fine dining italian restaurant on the grounds, very good food and a romantic ambiance. We dined here a few times while there. Overall, we really liked this hotel and would stay here again. Only downfall, a couple of the mornings one of the birds they display in the lobby was very loud and speaking for hours on end. Can be a distraction.

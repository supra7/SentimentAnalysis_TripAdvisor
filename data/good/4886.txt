We stayed at Hotel Opera roma for 3 days in November 09. Staff we very pleasing and went out of there way to help. Room were nice. First room they gave us was small but very nice and then they offered us a larger room which was big. Breakfast was one of the best we've had in Italy, very nice and plentiful and coffee fantastic. Great price and would recommend this hotel to anyone. Monica

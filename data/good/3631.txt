Great (tiny) hotel with an address that is easy to remember. The room was extremely small, but modern, new, and comfy. There was a little noise from the street but that is to be expected. Located near plenty of pubs, restaurants, and a whole foods, I would stay here again to explore the city. The hotel comes with a continental breakfast that was pretty good. Free wifi didn't work at all, but they have a terminal in the breakfast room for free use.

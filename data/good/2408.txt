I enjoyed my stay at the W but it definitely has an ultra modern feeling, seemingly targeted at a younger crowd. The location was great and we easily walked everywhere. They offer a free limo service around town but the drawback is they end at 5:00 so we weren't able to utilize it. Offered coffee and fruit in the lobby which was nice. Was surprised that the labeling on the bathroom amenities (shampoo, conditioner, lotion etc) looked like it was from a Motel 6. Doesn't have a pool, locker room or spa service.

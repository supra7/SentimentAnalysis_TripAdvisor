I wanted to let everyone know what a great time I had staying at this Hotel. My husband and I had ocean front room on the 5th floor. The room was very clean, it looks like a Holiday Inn, nothing fancy but nice. My view was great, woke up looking at the ocean from my bed. We had a great housekeeper by the name of Lena, who was so friendly. She left me flowers one day and nightly cookies. The grounds at the Hotel is so green and well taken care of. After walking around to other hotels I think this one has the nicest grounds. When one of the staff or workers walked by they would say Aloha to us, very friendly. I would use this Hotel again and would recommend it to everyone. Great for the price! Michael and Debbie

Stayed here for one night after flying in late into Seattle. I was meeting a friend before heading to our next destination. We booked it through priceline so we got the room for only $50 a night. The hotel was great!! Beautiful lobby, spacious rooms. The entire hotel was spotless. Most comfortable bed that I have every slept in in a hotel! Balcony on all of the rooms. The only bad part was the price of parking. We picked up our rental car that night, and looking back we should have just waited till morning. It would have been less expensive to park at the parking lot for the airpot next to the hotel then at the hotel! On top of that, you had to park in a garage that was quite a walk from the hotel.

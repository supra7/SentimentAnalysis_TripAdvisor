My husband and I were looking for a relaxing get away with a beautiful, swimmable beach and Secrets Maroma was an excellent choice. We enjoyed getting up early for the sunrise and then relaxing under the shade of one of the many beach palapas during the afternoon. Tip: In order to choose from the best seats I would suggest getting to the beach before 10am - you'll have prime pick. We stayed in a preferred suite with ocean view. At first we were a little disappointed that we were the 3rd building back from the beach, but we found that we had a very nice view and our building was close to everything. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. Other than issues with the air conditioner being broken, we enjoyed our room a lot. The restaurants were good and we always found something yummy to eat. Our favorite was Bordeaux - the veal chop was great!! The Japanese grill was fun and I loved the ice cream dessert served at the hibachi table. Tip: Just in case you decide to dine outside in the evenings, remember to bring along mosquito spray. We found all the staff to be very friendly and we received great service. Thanks to Carlos our concierge and Marisol one of the hostesses; they were both phenomenal. Overall we had a nice stay and enjoyed the accommodations and atmosphere of the resort. We would recommend a get away to Secrets Maroma.

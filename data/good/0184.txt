Lady and I stayed at the Warwick Hotel in downton Seattle in September. We loved it! It's older and it had tons of character. We loved opening up the sliding glass door to walk out on to the balcony. We loved being in the middle of all the action too. Pike's place was only a couple blocks away. Bring your walking shoes!

I was attending a meeting at the Fairmont and wanted to stay nearby but at a more modern hotel. LE Crystal was perfect! I loved my room design. Bedroom can be closed off from living room area. There was a small modern functional kitchenette for making tea or coffee in the morning. Small table and chairs. Loads of closet space and a good sized bathroom. I'm a big work out fan and the gym was small but functional. Not great, but decent. Hotel is walking distance to great restaurants ( loved Europea) and main shopping area.

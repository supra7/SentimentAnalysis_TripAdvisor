My wife and I stayed at the Inn at Queen Ann before so we knew it would be the perfect accomodation while attending the Lady A Concert at Key Arena. Since Key Arena and Seattle Center are just across the street, staying here was a no brainer. Rooms are small but comfy and each has a small kitchenette. The facility was booked solid yet it was peaceful and quiet after we returned from the concert. Lots of good restaurants close by and a liquor store just down the road for a bottle of wine before dinner.

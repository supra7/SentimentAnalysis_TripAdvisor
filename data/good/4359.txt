Stayed here 4 Oct to 12 Oct. Our room was in the Lahaina Tower overlooking the flat roof of the ballrooms but looking right from the balcony we could see the ocean and heard the luau every night!! Room did have stained carpet but otherwise the room was spacious and clean. Cascades Grill and Sushi Bar was excellent as was Spats Trattoria. Yes they were espensive, but this is a 5 star hotel so what would you expect. Staff were helpful. The pool area is fabulous - waterfalls/slides, caves, childrens area it really was great. No problems getting sunbeds at any time of the day. The gardens and animals were lovely. The walk along the ocean path to Whalers Village was lovely. Would stay at this Hotel again and recommend it to anyone.

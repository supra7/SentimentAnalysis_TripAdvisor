Have been here three times in the last ten years the most recent was just this past week jan 2005. the service has dropped off and the hotel is looking a bit worn..the towels at the pool are faded and kind of raggy..the linens are nice and rooms are clean but if you actually pay 400 bucks a night then you are way overpaying. worth maybe 200 only because youre on maui. pool gets crowded in mid morning better grab a good chair by 8:30 or so. the lobby is still very nice. took the kids this time and they have a nice sand play area though the mariott next door has a cool pirate ship in their play area which is bigger (but more crowded) the beach in front of the hotel is eroding big time. i swear that the last time i was there in 1999 there was more beach...in some places it's like 10 feet deep (the beach not the water) barely enoguh to lay down a towel. no snorkeling in front of the hotel either too wavy, rocky. Didn't use the gym last time but it's seems small for such a huge resort. it was packed the week i was there. the best beaches on that side of the island are a 10 minute drive up to napili and kaplua but you can walk down in front of the westin (10 minutes but not easy with kids) or all the way to "black rock" in front of the sheraton (20 minute walk - maybe a mile) black rock has good snorkeling for the beginner. overall the loaction is great since it's an easy drive to lahiana (cheap eats and the all important safeway grocery) positives - central location, safe, clean, big pool, Not far from SAFEWAY negatives - a bit worn, lousy beach, staff/guest ratio a little low (waiting for stuff) if i hadn't got the 200 rate i would have ranked it only three stars

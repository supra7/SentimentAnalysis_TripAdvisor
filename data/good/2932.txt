This is a "cut above" airport hotel. Nicer rooms, comfortable bed, soft linens and very professional and friendly front desk. But the very best thing is that you walk across the street to the train station, and can get downtown in expensively and quickly. I've booked this for $50 numerous times by bidding on Priceline, so you can save a bundle too. Just bid for a 3+ star Sea hotel for $50, and you'll either end up here or the slightly lessor Doubletree across the street.

This place fit our needs perfectly for our 3 nights in Venice. The location is really perfect in that it is close to the train station, bus station and Grand Canal, and a reasonable walk from the San Marco Piazza, but is in a quiet uncrowded location in Santa Croce. It was a perfect starting point for four of us to roam about Venice. I will say walking directions to the hotel are terrible. The easiest route to the hotel is the water taxi from the train station, which is fine if you are buying a 1, 2 or 3 day water taxi pass (and you should), but don't buy a single 6.50 euro ticket to go one stop. Walking works if you don't mind carrying your luggage up the bridge steps. Just be sure to cross the bridge in front of the train station, then try to follow their instructions. We did find it. The hotel was quite comfortable with a very friendly, helpful staff. We really liked our room. The only complaint was from our son and his wife in a separate room - they had no shower stall, just a curtain, so the bathroom was soaked each time they took a shower. I believe it was a room for the physically challenged. (Incidentally, Venice is not easily navigated by people with disabilities.) The breakfast is good. Wi-fi only works reliably in the second floor common area. It may seem expensive, but it is reasonable for Venice. Overall we were very pleased with our stay. Once there, get out and walk the streets and ride the water taxis.

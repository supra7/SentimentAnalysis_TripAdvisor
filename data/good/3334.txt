We chose Secrets Maroma resort for our honeymoon and overall were really happy with everything. We paid the extra money for the preferred suite with partial ocean view and the view was worth it. We were able to bypass the long lobby wait and drive to a preferred lounge for a more personalized check in process. We had access to the lounge any time we wanted with a full bar, appetizers, free internet. It was nice. We also had a personal concierge to make reservations for us and be a filter for any of our needs. Aside from a few miscommunications about some of the honeymooner perks and a very very hard bed that became even more uncomfortable with a sunburn, everything was great! The staff was so friendly, helpful and fun. they were never rushing around, rude or pushy. when you chose to tip them (and were never felt oblgated to) they were so appreciative but their service quality never changed as a result of more or less money which is such a nice change. Food was decent. Oceana had our favorite tasting food (lobster tails!!) and Bordeaux was our favorite dinner experience between service, food and romance. The beach was amazing! The water was refreshing and so clear. The pools were great but nothing beat that beach! The entertainment staff was a blast. friendly and fun. and what we truly appreciated were the staff members who remembered us by name, smiled when we walked by and engaged in conversation with us anytime they had a moment. Overall it was peaceful and a great time, truly something for everyone. Quiet and romance or games and dance parties, you could have either/or, or a little of both at anytime, no interference. We will definitely return to Secrets Maroma. and if you do the preferred suite, visit Andres in the lounge. Sweetest guy at the resort and a great bartender to boot!

Downtown Seattle is an expensive place to book a hotel room -- $99 per night rate is considered budget. (i.e., the Travelodge by the Space Needle is $125 per night). So, finding a hotel with the location that Warwick has -- for $99 per night --I didnt have great expectations, although it is part of an international luxury hotel chain. Getting to and from the hotel was easy on the Seattle city bus system, and surrounding it are numerous restaurants of all kinds. Its within walking distance of the Pike Place Market and the downtown shopping district and right next door to the Jazz Alley. We were on the 8th floor overlooking the parking lot but had a view of downtown, which was good because any lower the noise from the street would have made sleeping difficult. A room on a higher floor with a view of the Space Needle would have been great but, for a rate of $99, we were fine with the view and the quiet room. The room was not big but very adequate with a somewhat dated dcor, but it did have some nice touches (nice wall art and a Shoji lantern type floor lamp). The lighting was good and the bed was very comfortable. The marble sink and tub surround are very nice. I especially appreciated the vanity shelf (which I wish more hotels would have) and the complimentary bath items were rather upscale. But, what I was most impressed with is that I believe this hotel actually takes their water conservation program seriously. I was fine with the low water pressure because I was so impressed with the low-flow, QUIET flushing toilet. I was rather surprised, though; that the lobby was so nondescript since the Seattle Warwick is part of a luxury chain, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. So, the Seattle Warwick exceeded my expectations for a budget in the middle of downtown Seattle and we look forward to staying there again soon.

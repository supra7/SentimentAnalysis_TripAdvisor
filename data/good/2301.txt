This is a really lovely hotel. When we checked in we were given a queen bed instead of the king we reserved (apparently they are the same price and they can do this when they run out of king rooms) but I have to say that it didn't even matter. The room was luxurious with rich colors, a spectacularly clean bathroom and sheets that were to die for. The location is great as well, right near the new public library. When our DVD/CD player would not function, someone came to fix it within five minutes of our call. Great service!

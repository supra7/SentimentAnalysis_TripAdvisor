Stayed 3 days, 3 nights in junior preferred suite on third floor. Don't bother paying for a swim-up suite--those pools get no sun and have no view (we had a beautiful ocean view from the third floor). Room was very large and very comfortable/functional, with the exception of the bathroom. There is only a sheer curtain separating the bedroom from the bathroom, with only a glass half-door separating the sink/tub area from the toilet...not exactly private or romantic. Pool is nice but I had to sneak out at 6am each day to reserve good chairs (EVERY pool chair was reserved before 8am). Beach is well-groomed and peaceful but drink service is lacking. Food was rather good for an all-inclusive: Portofino's was great for Italian, buffet at World Cafe was very extensive and the 24 hour room service was awesome. Most importantly for me, Secrets was spotless and we did not encounter a single mosquito, ant, or bug of any other kind anywhere on the property--pretty impressive. Service was pleasant but not particularly accomodating or helpful, even when tipped. Overall, I would recommend, but don't expect perfection.

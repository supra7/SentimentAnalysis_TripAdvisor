My husband and I stayed at the Inn at the Market to celebrate his birthday, and overall, our stay was wonderful. We enjoyed a two-story suite with an incredible view of the Market and Sound. It was quiet and the location was perfect for us. My only complaint would be that the hotel needs to do a better job at keeping up with maintainance. Our room had major scratches on several walls and a few too many stains on the carpets. There were also many cracks in the bathroom tile and other significant signs of wear in the bathroom. For the price, we expected much more in regards to quality and upkeep. Hopefully, management will pay more attention to keeping this lovely hotel fresh and lovely.

Spent 6 nights at the Hyatt, partial ocean view room. The ambiance of the hotel (the open atrium, the birds, the grounds, etc.) was great. Room was comfortable and very clean. Service was very good. My only complaint is the self-parking; not enough spaces and the spaces are too small. I was told at checkout when I complained about the parking situation that valet ($15 a night) would have parked me for free if the self-park was full...kind of a little late to find that out. But other than that, we enjoyed our time at this facility immensely.

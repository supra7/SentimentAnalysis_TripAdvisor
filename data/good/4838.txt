I stayed for an overnight courtesy of Emirates airline as I had a 10 hour stopover in Dubai. On arrival, the friendly staff checked me in effortlessly and I was given a voucher for a snack and breakfast. Snack choices were various sandwiches, cake slices or Arabic snacks. Unlimitted tea, coffee and juice. Great selection for breakfast and the quality was good. The room had 2 beds and was clean and comfortable. Comp bottles of water in the bar fridge. Only criticism was the bathroom. Shower was a bit grotty.

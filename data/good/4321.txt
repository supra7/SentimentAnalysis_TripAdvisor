We had a mini family reunion at the hotel and for this purpose, the hotel was very nice. This was our first time staying in the Kaanapali area and was a bit disapponted in the amount of traffic noise you could hear from the main highway from the hotel room. Not that it was noisy, just noticable. The rooms were fairly standard but clean. The hotel hallways were a bit dated. The staff was very pleasant and made for a nice stay. The kids pool was great for the three year old as well as the other pools for everyone else. We didn't eat on-site as there are too many places good places to eat at on Maui. Good experience, not great. If you wanted great, you would choose one of the more expensive resorts.

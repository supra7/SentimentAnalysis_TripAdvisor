This is definetly a "mega-hotel." It's huge. Sprawling wings and a huge tower, it's EASY to get lost finding your room. The staff is generally nice and you can actually walk from the airport (10-15 mins max ) if you don't have much luggage. The rooms are pretty small, but the bathroom and on the large side. All rooms have baconies, although with no furniture. The rooms are newly renovated, although not as nice or modern as a Marriott room would be (i.e. no plasma tv). Nice pool area with a whirlpool which closes strictly at 11PM. You definetly feel safe and secure in this hotel as a lot of airline crew stay here as well. Great place for a quick night, not bad if you have kids either.

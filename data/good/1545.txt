My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night over the weekend. I got the room at a rate of $66 through Hotwire, which was a great price for a budget hotel. The room was clean and provided the basics, no frills. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even have a Bar&Grill located in the hotel that had pretty decent food and not to mention our waiter was very funny. The only cons I had was the road noise, which was bearable and the squeaking floors from the room above us other than that everything was fine. I would say this has one of the best locations for a budget hotel, there is a McDonalds at the corner and a Starbucks near by. Everything is withing walking distance but you can catch the free bus zone stop at the corner which can take you 3 stops closer to the middle of downtown and in to the heart of all the shopping. The Seattle Center is about 8-10 blocks away on foot, which took us 15 minutes for us to walk. Everything is walkable but just have your walking shoes ready. If you do decided to ride the Grayline Downtown Aiporter Bus, the stop is at the Westin, which is a block away. So if you are looking for the basics at a value, I would definitely recommend staying at the Sixth Ave Inn.

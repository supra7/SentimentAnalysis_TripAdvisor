Our room was on a floor that was just remodeled and everything was clean and in working order. The room was a typical size for two queen beds; the linens were fluffy and new, the lotions and soaps were from a well known bath shop and were very special, the view of the city and Elliot Bay were fantastic. We also had had a fridge and coffee maker. Yes, you did have to pay for parking in the hotel, but that is to be expected when you're downtown. I did not have any issues with the staff, they were very helpful and went out of their way to assist us with a late check in.

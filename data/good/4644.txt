We just stayed at the KBH from the 3-10 of April 2006. What a wonderful and warm place to bring your family. We had such a great time, and the staff was so nice and caring. A special Mahalo to Alan Caban in Guest Services. He was so helpful to our two children, he made the stay extra special!! We will be back!! The Myers' Family San Diego, Ca

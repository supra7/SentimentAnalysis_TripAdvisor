Ok - it is an older hotel but we were given a renovated room on the 22nd floor. The hotel does have that old smell to it...they should see about that. The room was lovely and all upgraded bath items. The view from the room and from the bar on the upper floor was fantastic. A nice walk to the downtown area and we had no trouble finding our way around. Parking is $28 a night and the drinks at the bar a bit pricey, but the view at night is wonderful. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for adults who want to see downtown Seattle.

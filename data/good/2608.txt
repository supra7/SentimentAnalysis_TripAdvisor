We stayed here two nights in Aug with some friends from London and the hotel provides to us what we wanted: very well located in the down-town area, friendly staff, and fantastic restaurant /bar in the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with a character and closed to bar/restaurant and the tourist attraction in Seattle. This is for you.

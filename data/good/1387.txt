Had a girl's weekend at the Sheraton in Seattle. I booked through Hotwire, so we got a really good deal (almost half of the normal price). It is located right smack in downtown, so it had access to everything. It's only a few blocks from Pike's Market, it's in the middle of the shopping district, the monorail is a few blocks away (for the space needle, EMP, Sci Fi Museum), and bus stops nearby. It was also a good location because it is a stop on the downtown airport transporter (Greyline), and many tours will pick you up from this hotel. We stayed in the union tower. The room was very nice and clean. Our view was of the other tower, so we got some giggles from the other guests that didn't close their curtains when getting ready in the mornings, but it still had a good view of downtown. Now, the room was not well insulated for sound, so that may be a problem for light sleepers (i.e. we could hear every time someone used the ice machines). The staff was nice, though things seemed hectic alot of the time. We had tried to find the pool in Pike's Tower, but couldn't locate it and gave up. All in all, a great stay, good location! Would definatly stay again if the price was right.

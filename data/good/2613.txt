We really liked Hotel Max - the look is different and fun and our stay was really very pleasant. I heard about how some of the rooms were smaller but I asked for a larger room if possible and I got one. At the same time when I called they offered to move our travelling companions to the same floor (if possible) and it was done. The doorman that first day was really nice and helpful. I'm from the south so I'm used to more open friendly types but I did notice Seattle was not exactly like that - nice, but not overly friendly so it may seem to some people that they are a bit cold - I think it is just a different culture. The only complaint I had was that when I called to ask them the best way to get to the airport they stated a cab or town car. I wish they had mentioned that there is a really reasonable Downtown/Airport bus as well - we could have saved some money as the cab drive was about $40 but the shuttle would have been $22 for two people. Other then that I would totally recommend this place - it was a good value in a very convenient location with a certain cool ambience.

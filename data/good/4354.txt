We just spent 4 days there during Thanksgiving and then went on to another area. The good: Fabulous grounds, great bed (similar to Heavenly Bed), convenient access to Whalers Village, great walking path along the beach past Whalers Village and many walkable restaurants. The Cascades bar and restaurant is gorgeous at night! They have a variety of birds around the grounds as well as penguins. Great for kids. The bad: Lots of kids (do not go if you are planning a relaxing romantic trip), weird "cave bar" set up - it's not an actual swim up bar like you see in Mexico, you actually have to get out of the water and sit at the bar that's in the cave. Not a very efficient check-in system. We had to check in and then wait in another line to give our ticket to the bell person only to then go up to our room to wait for our bags. Perhaps they were busy? I think this could have been managed better.

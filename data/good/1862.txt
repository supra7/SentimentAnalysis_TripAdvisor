We stay here often (more than 15 times) when we want the downtown experience. The hotel is centrally located for shopping, exploring Pike Place Market, the art museum, Monorail and downtown restaurants. If you are going to any of the games it is a nice walk or ride on the transit system. The hotel is great, with the Heavenly beds (these are beginning to show some wear) and spectcular views over the waterfront from the elevated rooms. We love the pool and hot tub. The lobby is large with a nice lounge and concierge station. The staff here has always been wonderful. Parking - we prefer the Westin Garage on the block next door, it is not part of the hotel, but more convenient for access then the hotel garage and less expensive!!

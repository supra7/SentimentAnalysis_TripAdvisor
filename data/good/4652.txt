This was a long planned 25th Anniversary celebration for us. We first went to Honolulu, Oahu for 4 nights and then the KBH for 9 nights. Could it use some updating? I suppose. But our room was clean, spacious and very pleasant. My one and only complaint would be that our "free upgrade" from a partial ocean view to an ocean view did not seem like an upgrade. I would call it a partial ocean view. But we loved our lanai, and slept every night with the sliding glass doors open listening to the sounds of the ocean and feeling the warm breezes over us. Just as I imagined it to be! This hotel is so much more comfortable and inviting than your more upscale hotels. Definitely a great family hotel. Our experience with every staff person we came into contact with was excellent. We asked questions frequently of the concierge staff and did not buy any tours. They could not have been more helpful and friendly. As soon as we got settled in our room, we noticed the light in the bathroom was very dim. We called the desk and in minutes a maintenance man was there changed the bulb. The grounds are relaxing, the beach gorgeous, and the pool was adequate (who wants to sit at a pool when they are in Hawaii on the beach???) We were more than satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the Mixed Plate. We ate breakfast one day at the Tiki Grill and paid alot more for basically the same food! The restaurants in nearby Whaler's Village and Lahaina offer a great variety of food and prices. We didn't eat dinner at the same place twice. I did not like that you have to rent the beach chairs every day, which can add up. We took the advice of another reviewer and bought a cheap beach chair (and some beach mats) at the ABC store and gave it away when we left. Problem solved. Overall, it was a wonderful value for the money spent and we were more than satisfied.

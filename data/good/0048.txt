I appreciate Kimpton Hotels. They're all a bit quirky (Monaco delivers a gold fish to your room upon request) with very stylized, current decor, activities for guests (an afternoon wine tasting the day of our visit) and a welcoming attitude towards pets. I don't have any pets, but I imagine it's nice for those who do. The service is casual and low profile, responding rapidly to all requests but not going out of their way to offer assistance. My biggest gripe would probably be the pricey and attractive sundries scattered around the room (at checkout my incidentals totaled $173.84). Ooh, I nearly forgot to mention it, but they have leopard and zebra and cheetah print bathrobes that are pretty neat.

My family and I had 3 nights here in July and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This hotel is small but well run. It is perfect for shopping, walking around the major sights or getting on and off the sight seeing buses and there are plenty of good restaurants within 15 minutes walk for all budgets. Downside is noise during the day particularly if you have a 1st floor room and small breakfast room. Upside is location, cleanliness and good service from staff. Breakfast is continental but offers hardbolied eggs, hams etc - plenty to eat - altho a tad cramped. We were grateful for trip adviser recommendations. There is no vehicular access so taxis will drop you about 1 minute away. Thanks to the staff especially Caterina and and the bellman whose name I forget but who was cheerful, helpful and hardworking.

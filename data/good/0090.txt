Stayed for three nights on the Memorial Day Weekend. The location was great and the rooms were clean. The service was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed the wine reception in the early evening. The rooms are not super sound proof and on the first morning we could hear our neighbors a bit too much but thankfully they must have checked out later that day because we never heard another thing after that. Parking was expensive but we decided to park on the street right outside the hotel because it was the weekend and there was no charge. We had such a great weekend and we would stay at the Monaco again ,happily.

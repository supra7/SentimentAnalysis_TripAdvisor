We stayed at the doubletree because we were catching an early flight the next morning, and they had a free shuttle service (takes a little more than 5 minutes). Checking in the night before, the lady at the front desk was a little rude. We booked a room for 2 beds, and she said non were available. We said we wouldn't mind being compensated if you couldn't grant us our booking. She then said, that's ok, we'll give you 2 beds. Got to our room and we probably got a larger than normal room, very nice, impressed. The room was very nice, but could use better customer service.

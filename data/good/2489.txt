I was told upon making the reservation that I had a room with a bath tub, but apparently none of the doubles or queens do. When I spoke to the reservation agent about it, he indicated they would upgrade me to a king. I thought this was a free upgrade. It wasn't a major additional expense--just over ten dollars, but I am on a budget and would at least have liked to be aware of this. But I was given free internet access and they comped my toothbrush ($15~!) from the honor bar so it evened out. Also there is an almost $20 per day city tax I was unaware of. Other than that we LOVED our stay--every person we encountered was nice and helpful, my dog got a bed she loved, I had more pillows than I knew what to do with and even ordered an additional one from their pillow menu (as well as Tao te Ching from the spiritual menu). Overall a great experience, even if it was a bit more expensive than I'd planned on. Thank you!

I booked this hotel at last minute. Was a bit worried about what it would be like because there was no reviews and no pictures as it was newly built. However upon arrival i was very pleased with its location and the hotel itself. The apartments are very well equiped with balcony, lounge with dining area, kitchen with all amenities, bedroom. bathroom and 2nd toilet. 2 flat screen tvs, dvd player and cable tv (although only 2 english channels but you don't come to dubai to watch tv!!!) The rooms were clean and cleaned everyday with towels being replaced and they even do your washing up. There are a few unfinished touches but we only used the room to sleep in and it didn't bother us. Has a small clean pool with sunbeds and table/chairs on the roof. There is also a gym, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. The staff were very polite and helpful. I couldn't really fault anything. The location is two streets away from the emirates mall so it was ideal for shopping and eating. It is right beside a main road so good for getting everywhere. Taxis are very cheap although the drivers know little english. Defenatly do ... desert safari, Wild Wadi, Jumeriah Beach!!!

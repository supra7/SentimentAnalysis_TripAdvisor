My wife and I got married here back on Labor day September 4, 2006. I will just start by a couple quick comments on the wedding then get back to the rooms and facilities. Our wedding was perfect and we couldn't have asked for anything better. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the ballrooms were gorgeous. Back to the review, The construction at that point didn't effect us for the most part. The front of the hotel was being worked on but the main entrance was still open. I was in a standard room the first night. Nothing special really except for the great Sheraton beds which are to die for. The pool was average as well and the gym was nothing to write home about. I would expect a little more from the Sheraton chain in regards to these areas. The hallways and lobby are very nice and extremely clean. The suite we stayed in on our wedding night was very outdated. Run down furniture, old time TV (with a VCR no less). It was very clean and we had the staff's full attention but they should really modernize some of the rooms, especially the suites.

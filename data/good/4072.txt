My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Lahaina in early October. It was a pleasant stay. The check-in process was smooth and the hotel included overnight valet on the first night. This was a nice touch as we checked in late in the evening and would not have wanted to find the parking lots at night. We had a hard enough time finding the hotel at night. The room was a good size, but it did not have much of a view. It overlooked the front entry and driveway. There was a small balcony that we used once for breakfast. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was okay. The room had two mini-fridges, one that was empty and the standard mini-bar. The only annoying part of the room was the hotel snack tray. It was very large and placed on top of the mini-bar counter. It was activated by movement and we had to constantly be careful not to bump it when getting into the mini-fridge or placing things on the counter near the bathroom. It always seemed to be in the way. The hotel property itself is very nice. They were undergoing some renovations so there was scaffolding and construction noise during the day. It wasn't too obtrusive. The pool is fantastic and the main water slide was pretty fun. WiFi was included (nice!) and parking was free. However, there are a very limited amount of spaces and if you did not get a space then you had to pay $18 for valet. There was also a $25/night resort fee. The hotel's "beach" access was pretty pathetic. The waves pretty much came right up to the grassy areas and there really wasn't much room for sitting on the beach. The water area was pretty rocky and full of sharp stones and coral. It wasn't very pretty or accessible. We ended up walking about 1/2 mile down the path to the Westin section of the beach. It was much nicer. Overall, we had a pleasant stay. The lack of parking and the resort fee was a little annoying, but the staff and the property was nice. We would stay here again.

I stayed at the Hilton Bayfront for a week in November, 2010 for a conference taking place there. First of the good: The room and bathroom was very, never had a problem with the maid service and she always tidied up my shopping purchases of the day (the Gaslight shopping district is just down the street) I had a view towards the harbour and it was great to see the sunrise over San Diego every morning. The hotel is clean, decently run and nicely decorated in a loose ocean theme, which while not my style, was very clean and modern. There are free iPad's in the lobby lounge so you can check your email. However they are located in the bar area so I assume they'd like you to order a drink while you surf. I never did as the drink prices were really high. I only tried the Sportsbar Grill at the resort but I found the food there to be quite good and fairly priced for the most part. They also have free wifi at the restaurant. The Cons: The wifi was expensive in the hotel (up to $18 a day) and rarely worked well, especially in the conference rooms. For a hotel that was designed with a business traveler in mind, and which has large conference rooms for business purposes, the wifi signal was very poor and disappeared in most rooms. There is a Starbucks at the hotel (you have to walk outside to get to it) and this is the only semi-cheap breakfast option. However it only has the regular Starbucks fare, with inflated prices, and often has a lineup out the door. When the hotel is at capacity or close to it there are long delays for the elevator. Often it would take 15 minutes just to travel from the lobby up to my room. All things considered it was a good experience at the Hilton but if you're looking for a relaxing/romantic or family vacation I'd reconsider this business-oriented hotel that is often busy and lacks that personal feel of smaller establishments.

Stayed here 5 days in a ground floor room overlooking the garden. I was watching my money on this trip and wanted the cheapest room available which was $149 a night. Although on the ground floor, there was no outside noise disturbing me at night. There was a problem one night when the people in the room next to me must have had a party and were loud and noisy until 2 AM when the hotel remedied the situatuion. This disturbance wasn't the hotel's fault and they did tell me the next day that these "guests" were no longer welcome and would not be there the next night. I asked to be comped for the night of the disturbance but the mananger declined. It would have been a nice customer relations move to give me some type of credit. The room was recently redone as everything looked and smelled new and the hallway carpeting still smelled new. Room was clean. The bed was comfortable and free WI-FI was very good. As any traveler knows, some resort hotels charge $10 to $20 a night for WI-FI and the free service was appreciated. Yes, the bathroom is small but who cares-you don't live or sleep there and it was clean. There is a nice desk area for the computer and an extra chair. The only drawback was a tube TV with limited channels. Self park was plentiful and close to the room. A big plus is that Whaler's Village is a 5-10 minute walk and has at least two good restaurants-Leilani's and Hula Grill. The hotel is next to the ocean and a walkway that goes along the beach. I did not hang around the hotel or interact with staff so can't comment on the staff. The good-bye shell lei is a nice touch. I did catch some of the free hula show which was well done and similar to what you have to pay to see at a luau. The bottom line is that this hotel is very reasonably priced for a resort in Ka'aanapali on the ocean and well worth it. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

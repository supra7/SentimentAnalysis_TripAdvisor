We went to Seattle for a weekend of dining and shopping, and stayed at the Hotel Monaco. We were able to walk to all our restaurants, plus the Pike Place Market, and even Uwajimaya, one of our regular stops. The hotel gave us a goldfish named Andrea for the weekend. After two nights I thought Andrea looked hungry, so they gave me a little packet of fish food. The New York Times was delivered to the room every morning except Sunday. The room was clean and quiet. Just as advertised there was a reception in the lobby every afternoon. I can't think of a single thing that went wrong here.

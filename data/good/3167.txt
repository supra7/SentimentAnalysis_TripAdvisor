This hotel is 'newer' for the downtown area and is right across from the Bell Center (Montreal Canadiens home rink). It's a 2 minute walk to St. Catherine St. (Ogilvy's etc) - great area for tourists to shop. La Coupole resto has a lovely breakfast. We travel to Montreal one a month and it's always the place we stay; keep your eyes on travel websites and book in advance for a good deal.

We recently stayed a week at the KBH. Loved the very friendly staff, nightly Hawaiian shows, excellent breakfast buffet & little touches like grounds staff raking every morning, but leaving plumeria flowers on the grass to put in our hair. We had an ocean-view room, which gave us a nice view of Kaanapali beach. Rooms were outdated, but totally functional & met all our needs. Only complaint would be that the mattress sets were very old & not comfortable. Amazing location, beautiful beach--can't be beat, so worth the trade-off. We took the Trilogy whale-watching catamaran excursion right off the beach & saw a bunch of whales right under & around our boat. The snorkeling off Black Rock is excellent. Props to Leoda's Pie Shop for the coconut cream pie, just south of Lahaina (Olawalu)--best in the world!! Would definitely stay here again.

I really did a lot of research on where to stay one night before a cruise. I was not only spending our money, I was getting a room for friends so I wanted to make sure I got a room to make 6 people happy. I think everyone was very happy. We were within walking distance for shopping, eatting and sight seeing ( pikes market) without having to grab a taxi for things. We even walked to a grocery store for last minute things needed for our up coming cruise. The beds were very comfy, and the room was clean and the staff very friendly and helpful.( we lost a cell phone for a short time) I would LOVE to come back and would I pick this hotel.... I sure would. Its the tallest hotel in the area which makes finding this hotel very easy by the way.

My husband and I had a kitchen fire that put us out of our home for 2 weeks. During our extended stay at the Parc Suites Hotel we were treated so kindly it made an awful situation much more endurable. From the free parking and great location to the excellent room size and wonderful staff - I would gladly recommend this hotel to anyone. The only negative side is that there are quite a few homeless people in the area, so walking to the car in the back alley can be bothersome at times, but overall this was not an issue whatsoever. For one night or a long-term stay like ours, the hotel staff will make you feel at home in this small, elegant, family-oriented hotel.

We didn't realize how close this was to everything until we arrived. It was a short walk to downtown and Pikes Place. Our kids liked it so much they didn't want to leave. Most hotels are sterile, but this hotel was very homey. We felt comfortable from the start. The staff was very pleasant, the breakfast worked out great for us and we really enjoyed having Cafe Ladro right at the end of our hallway. We took a number of walks up the hill to see great views, enjoy a wonderful bakery and relax with a beer. Having a partial kitchen and dining area helped as Metropolitan Market is just down the street. Other hotels gave us the runaround because there were 5 of us staying in a room, not the Marqeen! Even with 5 people we had plenty of room and didn't feel as though we were stepping on one another. The downsides....our view was a mural on a brick wall, no airport shuttle (or shuttle of any kind) and occasionally sound from the front desk area would carry to our room at night. Overall though, this is an excellent hotel and I would highly recommend it. I just can't say enough good things about it.

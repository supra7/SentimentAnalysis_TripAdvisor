This is a very well located hotel: blocks from the Pike Market, one block from the monorail and walking distance from much in Seatlle. The buildings, twin tall cylindrical towers, are easily located while walking around, so it's highly convenient for the directionally challenged. What about the inside of the hotel? There is a nice pool with a sky roof, a couple decent work out rooms, a little cafe with ok croissants, good food in the lobby bar area. The rooms have spectacular views (ranging from great to truly spectacular), nice heavenly beds. The not so great: some gross carpet stains and mediocre housekeeping. Otherwise, the staff was helpful if not effusively friendly.

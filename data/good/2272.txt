We stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park for 3 nights. The location is excellent, it is walking distance to the waterfront and Pike's Place. The rooms are well appointed with a comfortable bed and couch. The only things we felt lacking were a couple of small amenities - a small coffee maker and a perhaps a microwave; these would definitely help. We paid around 130$/night for 3 nights and thought that was excellent value.

Stayed 1 night after attending the Man U vs Seattle Sounders soccer game. Based on the ranking on tripadvisor I was somewhat hesitant about the hotel. My concerns were luckily unfounded as the hotel was much better than I thought. Check in was fairly quick though they didn't tell us the time for breakfast or the password for wifi. Luckily I overheard this info from the previous people checking in. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Monorail, EMP and Space Needle. There is free underground parking. I think we got a free upgrade as our room had a hot tub in it though it was missing the roll away I had requested. This was rectified by the time we came back from the game. Good selection of breakfast items including sausage. The dining room was full but they had a another room open for people to use. No problem connecting to the wifi at night but couldn't connect in the morning.

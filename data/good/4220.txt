After reading a mixed bag of comments, I couldn't agree more that the hotel is in a fabulous location and the grounds are beautiful. The rooms, we had a full ocean view and on the positive side this was lovely. On the negative, the rooms and bathroom are very outdated and not particularly cleaned that well. This did not ruin by any way the holiday as we were never going to be sitting in the room all day! The Sushi bar was not very nice, but the buffet breakfast was good, excellent range of all sorts of food. The pool areas are lovely, a little crowded at times and was very annoying to watch people bag a chair with a towel and then disappear for hours whilst others didn't have a seat. Didn't go to the Luau Show in the hotel, the venue for it looked a little disappointing and there was not a pig in the ground to be seen!!! I think the hotel thrives on it's reputation and location, personally I would not stay here again unless it had a makeover.

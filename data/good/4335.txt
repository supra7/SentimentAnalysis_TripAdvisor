Stayed here for a week along with most of our guests for our wedding. Originally booked a Regency club partial ocean view and upgraded to total ocean view for $70 per night. Pro's: Regency Club - free breakfast was pretty good, afternoon snack was very weak, evening snack was pretty good Spa - massages and treatments were excellent Grounds - very clean, not a circus, excellent pool, clean beach Staff - very friendly, concierge actually bailed us out with a last minute limo need. Excellent room service staff, it was refreshing to have them tell you upon delivery that the gratuity/service charge was already included instead of just hiding it like some hotels. Cons: Room was a little dated, wall paper slightly peeling. All in all, this place is worth the money

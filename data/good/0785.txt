The Moore only looks a little sketchy from the outside. Once you're inside, it's solidly average and a great value in Seattle, which has outrageously priced hotels, for some bizarre reason. We went into our stay open minded, not expecting any more than cleanliness and a great location. Yes, the rooms are spartan -- we opted to "splurge" on a room with it's own bathroom rather than to share. The tub/shower was fine -- an old clawfoot tub, which was cool. However it was very difficult to regulate the hot water and I got scorched a couple times. The initial staff that we dealt with when checking in were very pleasant but the night clerk, Bill, is a total jerk. One of our pillows was exceptionally flat and when we came in from dinner and a show approximately 10:30pm, I asked for an additional pillow and another bath towel. Bill rolled his eyes and acted like I had asked him to jog around the block twice in his undies. As Bill complained and slammed things around in a storage area behind the desk, I told him, "Nevermind -- I'll make due." He responded with a snarky, "Yeah, I'm just going through the motions here." In other words, he was just pretending to look for a pillow. What a jerk. Other than Bill, everything was fine at the Moore. The location is perfect, our room was clean and comfortable. However, I can imagine that in the summer it must be hot as hell on the upper floors and there is no air conditioning. Probably fine for most of the summer but if you got an unexpected heat wave, it would be really uncomfortable.

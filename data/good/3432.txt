I'm going to write this review more for people who frequent all inclusives but I also feel this will help the newbies considering this hotel . First off we stayed at this hotel during the second week of our vacation to mexico the first week we stayed at Temptation resort in Cancun.The reviews of this secrets hotel are pretty spot on, the service ,the grounds, the rooms all are 5 star worthy.the beach is one of the most beautiful I have ever saw. One has to expect these things in my opinion when paying this much for a vacation. To put the rest of what I have to say in perspective I will tell you that for the week for my wife and I we paid 4000 usd the week before at Temptations we paid 1600 usd now I realize these are totally different types of places but the fact that I can compare them at all might say alot. My minor grievences with secrets are there was very little air conditioning from the lobby to the show clubs to the dance clubs we were always hot to the point of being in discomfort,even the swim out suite we had didn't get cold enough at night. Now the real bad part, if you book on the ground floor swim out suites (can't speak for the other rooms) be prepared to be eatin alive while you are sleeping by mosquitoes they even supply you with insect repellent with your bathroom supplies, now that is not my idea of a good time. Sleeping with OFF on is not sexy lol..This is not the the hotels fault obviously.. The other thing about this place is one wouldn't expect alot of young people here (young 20's)because of the price but thats just not the case, we are in our mid 30's and we kinda expected it to be a bit quieter but it seems that this is the wedding and honeymoon destination of well everyone lol The food was good as one would expect but not better than many four stars we have been to.The service was awsome they do a great job can't say enough good about everyone. I guess because of the price difference and beauty of the web site I maybe expected to much, I was prepared for a farely exclusive experience but walked away alot lighter in the wallet without that wow facter.Save your money its no better than a dozen other places I've been to in mexico except the beach it is truly awsome.....

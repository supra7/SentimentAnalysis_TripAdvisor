We stayed at Secrets Maroma from Nov 17-23. Overall we had a great time. The resort is beautiful. There are a few ups and downs, but this is true with every hotel. We were there having our wedding and that would need to be a seperate review. If you are planning on having your wedding there and have questions, please feel free to e-mail me. We arrived at the hotel around 11:30 a.m. We didn't get a room until 5:00 p.m., but I understand we were there early. It was a little frustrating. We didn't really have as big of a mosquito problem as others are stating in reviews. Bug spray seemed to work fine. The spa is very nice. Even if you are not having a treatment you should check it out. The food is okay. The Italian restaurant is good and the sushi at the japanese restaurant was awesome. If you don't like French food then don't eat at this place. Others raved about the food there, but I wasn't a fan. The cook-outs by the pool are great. Some of the best food I had all week. This is definately a low key resort so if you are looking for night life, this is not the place to go. The crowd at this place averages late 30's to mid 40's for the most part. The service is very good, except they do tell you yes for everything and then you are a bit disappointed when it doesn't come through. Everyone there seemed to have a great time during thier stay and as I understand they are taking the feedback and trying to improve a few things such as the swim out pools are not heated. Don't pay for this room if you go in the winter because it is to cold to go in. I would go definately go there again. We really had a great time.

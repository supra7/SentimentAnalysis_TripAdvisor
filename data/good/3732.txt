We stayed here as part of a Group of 11 for 3 days. Accommodation in Singapore is expensive so we elected for this hotel to save money. The location is Geylang which at night is a bit of a lively area in many ways but it doesn't cause any problems. Check in was very efficient and the receptionist friendly. The rooms are homogenous and basic but clean, have powerful AC and plentiful hot water. We only used the hotel for sleeping so it was enough for us. I can't really say I had any noticable problems at all. The reception staff were always friendly and willing to help. The hotel is close to Kallang and Aljunied MRT stations or you can take a bus and be in Bugis in 15 minutes. There is a plethora of food in Geylang Road, just 5 minutes walk. I'd happily stay here again next time I go to Singapore.

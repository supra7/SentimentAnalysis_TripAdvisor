Loved this hotel for it's wonderul decor and great food but it's a bit isolated unless all your activities are in the convention center next door. You have to walk a bit to the middle of the convention center to be able to cross the street to where the restaurants, shop, etc. are in the Gaslight District and the rest of downtown. Loved the view of the water from our high room and the service was great but if you like to explore on foot be aware.

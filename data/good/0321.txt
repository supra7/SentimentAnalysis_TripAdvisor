We stayed for 2 nights last week, reception staff were friendly, helped us up and down the stairs with our bags (there is no lift, so pack light!) Parking is expensive, we found the best deal to be the hotels, though they did have free parking outside on the street from 8pm - 8am. Breakfast is great, toast, waffles, cereal, yoghurts and fruit. They didnt have any english breakfast tea which is a really minor complaint almost not worth mentioning, but would have been nice. Not everyone likes spice chai or earl gray :) The room was basic, but good for the price. It was a bit noisy over the bar and I havent slept in a single bed for a long, long time! Ipod docks and free internet a bonus. Bathrooms were always available and clean, and they give you nice robes. Sharing was not a problem, never had to wait. So for the price, it was a really good stay.

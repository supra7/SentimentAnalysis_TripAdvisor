The Hotel Max is literally a block away from the Nordstrom department store and the main shopping area. It's a nicely designed boutique hotel with a comfortable bed, good staff and a fantastic restaurant which has happy hour for food & drink between 4-6pm. It's really worth eating here.... The only negatives are that you can't get free wireless internet (for that you have to go to Starbucks which is almost next door) and that the rooms and bathroom were tiny - in fact they were New York size. If you like sleeping with your window open make sure that you're on one of the top floors at the back of the building as the hotel is on a major through street.

I was nervous about this hotel, as I had read mixed reviews, but definitely wanted to try this "most Hawaiian" of all hotels. My first impression, as we stood in line to check in July 6th, was dismay. The wallpaper behind the check in counter was stained and peeling, the lobby looked in need of a makeover. I was slightly reassured by our two teenaged girls (15&17) who explored the grounds while we waited in line. They declared it was fabulous, pretty grounds, nice beach, etc. Our room was not ready, so we walked out to the Tiki Bar for a drink. Let the vacation begin! The bartender (Dale) was great, courteous, seemed to know all the people there. The guests were incredibly friendly and helpful. We met two women in their late 60-s or so who were at the KBH for the 25th time! The girls ordered food from the Tiki Grill, which they enjoyed and we relaxed while waiting for our room to be ready. Our room, when we entered it was just at it appeared on the web site, and perfectly positioned as I had requested, ocean view in the Lanai wing. Things were definitely improving! The girls were a little disappointed by the lack of room service, but got over that rather quickly. The staff is incredibly friendly, and all the guests were, too. We chatted every day with different types of people from all over. I did receive a dirty glass and knife in the Mixed Plate restaurant, but that was it for poor service. The food was mediocre. The sunsets were glorious, and the nightly entertainment was fun, and we all learned to "Just Hang Loose". The farewell ceremony was very touching, and our Hawaiin hostess actually cried. My 17yr old felt guilty as we were just moving down the beach to the Marriott,, as previously planned. The KBH is a lovely, friendly place to stay. I recommend it.

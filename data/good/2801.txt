This hotel staff is very friendly and the location is extremely convenient to SeaTac airport; I even walked back and forth during my stay. The rooms are clean and most have a small balcony, which is nice. Flat screen TVs and a good cable variety makes staying in the room pretty easy. The hotel offers reat Neutrogena soap, shampoo, conditioner, and sunscreen. Also, don't forget the free cookie when you check in! One thing to note - the halls are very noisy and the rooms could use some soundproofing around the doors. They all slam very loudly and you can actually see under the door from inside your room which allows a lot of sound to come in. I stuffed a towel in front of my door and that helped!

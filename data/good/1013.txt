Fairly recently renovated so rooms are new. Fitness facility was tiny and not suited for a real workout. Great location right across from the amazing Seattle Library and near all the downtown sights. One big problem: the water was scalding. It was impossible to get cold water! Better than the opposite problem but still strange. Aveda toiletries was a nice touch.

I agree with many of the reviews that this is not the best Westin I have stayed in. The carpeting needs upgrading, some of the fixtures and furniture is a little dated and the workout facility and pool are dated as well. However, it is a very functional hotel and I have no complaints about the really important things. It was a great location, the room was clean, quiet and comfortable, the bed was great and the service was good too. Also, the concierge was very helpful to us even when recommending some out of town hiking areas. If you want a good view ask for an upper floor (20th floor and up) in the north tower. The needle was right outside our window.

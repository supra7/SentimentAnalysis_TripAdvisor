Enjoyed a very relaxing week at Secrets Maroma Beach in May 2010. The hotel is situated on a beautiful stretch of beach on the Riviera Maya just south of Cancun -amazingly only a three hour flight from Washington DC. Our room had a great ocean view and wonderful balcony (thanks to tips from other Trip-adviser reviewers) and a centrally-located marble whirlpool tub- it looked just like the room on the web-site. Truly picture-perfect. Several issues with the room - the fridge was broken, the security latch on the door was broken and we had an ant infestation on the last day. All issues were dealt with quickly and to our satisfaction, however. And the room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The food was generally very good to excellent (except skip the mid-week seafood buffet) and the service in all restaurants consistently outstanding. We especially enjoyed the amazing breakfast buffet. For various reasons (getting ready to close, too long of a wait, closed) we were never able to try the seafood restauraunt closest to the water and we found the hostess there very rude. The disco had a very good live reggae band one night, but was apparantly not air-conditioned and unbearably hot - too bad. The staff was friendly and eager to please. The beach is outstanding and we never had a problem getting a chaise by the pool. If you like to choose your seat on the plane, watch out for booking directly through the hotel - they go through a travel agency and seat assignments cannot be made in advance. This did not cause any issues but made us nervous at first. All in all it was a great place - we would return.

My husband and I and 3 other couples stayed here from Oct 16-19. This resort is beautiful, fun and a great get away. We absolutely loved the accomodations.The restaraunts were good and staff was friendly. The beach was pretty but rough waves kept us from enjoying snorkeling or other activitieson the water,so we spent alot of our time just relaxing . I would highly recommend this resort but I would definetly use the safe as we had about 150.00 stolen from my bag as well as my ipod. We left the resort and did not realize they were missing until we arrived at the airport .I have called the resort twice since we have been back. They are "investigating" it but have yet to hear any thing back from them. So, if you go keep your valuables close. But, I have to say besides this we had a wonderful time with our friends.

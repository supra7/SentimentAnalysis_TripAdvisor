We stayed here from Setember 30th- October 3rd. I found this to be a very nice hotel. Our room was quite spacious and very quiet. We overlooked the "Drums of the Pacific Luau" so I am guessing it may not be that quiet during that performance, but it is over by 9pm. LIke other reviews I have read I do agree the the rooms are a bit dated, but I still found it very comfortable. The pool was very crowded, but we were able to find chairs each day we were there. This is a Maga-Resort, so if you are looking for peace and seclusion at the pool, this is not the place for you. But if you like the fact that you can stop of at Macy's on the way to your room from the pool, this is the place for you.

My husband and I travelled to Seattle and stayed here for 5 nights. We were given a complimentary upgrade and placed in a very large room on the top floor which had a sofa and coffee table and a huge bed. Very good blackout curtains which helped with noise and light, even tho generally speaking you couldn't here much traffic outside. The staff were always friendly and helpful. We both felt the decor was only a touch outdated but nothing to stop us stayin there again. The hotel is pet friendly too but our room was very clean. There was no breakfast served (which I have learnt is something of the norm at US hotels) and no small coffee machine in the room. So if you felt like morning coffee you had to go downstairs to pick up a morning drink which was a bit of a pain in the backside. The bathroom was a nice size and had bath and shower. The shower was ok, not fantastic. Internet was only free if you joined with the Kimpton hotel loyalty scheme (which is free) but if you don't you had to pay per day or 24 hours. The business centre was small. Just one apple pc and a printer and was not free to use. I believe it was $5.95 per 15 minutes but I may be wrong. They had a gym as well which was small. Treadmill, stepping machine and another machine and some weights. Up-to-date equipment. All in all the hotel was nice and we paid a good price and got a huge room and free internet after joining up to the loyalty scheme. I would recommend this to others and if we go back to Seattle wouldn't mind staying there again.

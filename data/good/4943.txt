This is one of the most relaxing hotels we have ever stayed in and we've been married and touring for 47 years so we've seen quite a few. It's beautiful, clean, food is excellent and not outrageously priced and we found the service faultless.There are one or two things to be wary of before booking. The road; it is unmade and very bumpy for the last 1/2 mile and it is about a 10 to 15 minute drive to the main road and access to other towns etc. if you ever decided to go anywhere, we didn't. Your tour operator will tell you the road is under construction,it isn't. The hotel is not connected to a mains electricity supply so the hotel operates a very noisy generator 24/7 which is a problem if you are a light sleeper. If you have children aged beween 3 and 10 be warned that the very attractively styled stairways and balconies are potentially very dangerous, and would almost certainly not be allowed under UK building regs.Wheelchair users would have regular difficulties Either side of the hotel are large vacant sites, one has some buildings on it but is now for sale and the other is scrubland. Check very carefully with your agent about what is happening to these sites before you book. This real gem of an hotel could be ruined by the building of "disco all hours" hotels on either side.One last tip; whatever anyone tells you there are mosquitos, take some spray and relax,that's what this hotel is all about.

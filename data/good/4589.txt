This was a great place for the kids. They LOVED the whale shaped pool. We had a pool level room which was great -- we just ran in and out the screen door all day from the pool. The grounds were nicely kept and the staff was wonderful!! The extras (lei making, skirt making, etc) added to the stay -- and they were free!! They had a ping pong table for guest use ... no charge! Just get the paddles from housekeeping. The Aloha passport was great -- the kids got gifts at different locations throughout the hotel. A backpack at the restaurant. A frisbee at the gift shop. Take advantage of the welcome breakfast. They give away lots of stuff in there!!! The magic show was fun. The dancers were the best -- they told the story of Pele and it was very entertaining! My daughter liked the Hawaiian dancers better than the magic. My son, the magic. Kinda pricey but they will work with you when its slow ... One bad thing, you have to pay for chairs on the beach??? There is a rental place where you can get snorkle gear ($$$) and RENT chairs for the beach (they are free at the pool).

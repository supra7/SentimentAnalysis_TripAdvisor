What a great find and what a great price! Thank you TripAdvisor! I stayed at the Moore for two nights before moving to the Grand Hyatt for a conference I had to attend. In my humble opinion, the Moore's location was infinitely better than the Hyatt's. Although it's 100 years old, the Moore glows - the restoration was done well and the rooms are quite comfortable. Downtown Seattle, in all its splendor, is just a couple of short blocks away. The restaurants and nightlife of Belltown are right there too. I loved having Starbucks on the next block for my morning coffee, and Pike Place is just a few blocks away for breakfast The young man who worked at the front desk each evening was also fascinating to talk to. I can't wait for my next visit. The Moore is a jewel!

We stayed here this past weekend. We loved the location as it is a short walk across the bridge to Petco Park and a short walk to Seaport Village and the Gaslamp District. The main problem is the parking which is $27 to self park or $35 (I think) to valet. If you happen to be there when a Padres game or another event is going on, the parking lot tends to fill up.It took us 1/2 hour to get out of the parking lot one morning due to some sort of pet event and we stayed away until the Padres game was over because we knew we wouldn't be able to find parking. The room wasn't ready at the 3 pm check in time but they called us when it was ready a half an hour later and they didn't give us our points on our Hilton Honors card because we booked the room through another site when Hilton said there were no rooms available for the days we wanted. Other than that it was a great trip!

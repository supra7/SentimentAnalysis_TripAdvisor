Arrival went smoothly, public areas are stylish and comfortable, gym is nice sized and functional, rooms have great windows and comfortable beds. Rooms could use a clean coat of paint to freshen up the place. Bar was hopping at night, but restaurant deserted. I'd travel there again, but might choose the four seasons to get an outstanding view and convenient access to Pike Place market.

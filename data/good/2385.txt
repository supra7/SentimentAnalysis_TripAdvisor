Used Priceline and got the W. Check in was easy. Got to our hotel room and looked out the window and we faced a wall. Oh well. Room was nice. The location was perfect. We walked (with a stroller) from the W to Pikes place then to Space needle then to Fremont. We walked all over. We enjoyed the duck tour it was cheesy and fun. I would recomend this hotel if you use priceline I got it for 149. I wouldn't pay more.

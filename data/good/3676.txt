Guests have complimentary access to a terrific fitness next next door, Another reviewer complained of the pool being crowded, but that depends on when you go and even at the peak hour, it wasn't particularly so. I liked the hotel's Inner Harbor location, near interesting restaurants and good for an after-dinner stroll. I had no complaints about my room, which faced the street but was reasonably quiet. The bed was comfortable and I appreciated the free internet access. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. Some other reviewers had gripes about the staff, but I found them quite alright.

The Radisson is definitely within walking distance from Seatac if you don't have much luggage. No need to wait on the free shuttle. The hotel is very clean and the lobby is quite large and very nice. We enjoyed time there. The rooms are a very good size and comfortable. Amenities are pretty standard, and wireless Internet is free. The front desk staff is quite nice, however they seemed to have a limited knowledge of the area. We discovered a number of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (take a left out of the lobby for a Denny's, Jack in the Box, Taco Bell, Roaster's Ale House, and a very good Thai restaurant), yet the front desk staff knew of just two of them. There is a complimentary shuttle, but it only takes you to the airport or to the light rail station. The hotel is 40 minutes from downtown on the rail. Negatives: (1) The breakfast buffet looked quite good, but it is $13 per person so we walked to Denny's. (2) The Sleep Number Beds in the rooms are hard to work with and I thought they were horribly uncomfortable. Overall, this hotel is very convenient to the interstate and the airport. The staff is friendly but not too knowledgeable. The rooms are clean and large, but the beds are not comfortable. Ultimately, we enjoyed our stay here.

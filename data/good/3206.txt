Great building, awesome location, excellent service, the Crystal is hard to beat in Montreal. The location is very close to the party atmosphere of Crescent street and shopping/nightlife of St Catherine, but the property itself is a chic and sophisticated retreat when you've had too much of the local scene and want to relax. We especially liked the 12th floor pool/hot tub with a view of the city and Mount Royal. We will be back!

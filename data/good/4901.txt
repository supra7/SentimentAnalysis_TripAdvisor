We had a great stay at the Hotel Opera in June /July 2009. We hadn't been to Italy for many years and found Hotel Opera to be a very pleasant surprise. The room was recently (and quite lavishly) refurbished and quite spacious (even with an additional bed for our 14 year old son). The bathroom was huge. There was free wireless internet access from the room, The hotel seems to be a smaller off shoot from a nearby hotel and so there aren't a lot of staff. But those that there are, were friendly and very helpful. The manager Reza seemed to be everywhere and very willing to help. When my wife enquired about a coffee shop when we first arrived after a long flight - Reza was back with a cappuccino almost immediately. Breakfast was basic but more than adequate. The hotel is centrally located near to the main railway station - but off a quiet street. And the cost was very reasonable compared with other places we stayed in Italy. We would definitely stay there again.

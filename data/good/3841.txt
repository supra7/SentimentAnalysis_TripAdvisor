This hotel exceeded my expectations as I entered the very small reception area, but when you enter the room you realise you made a good choice, if you wanna be far from the tourists and experience real roman life then stay here as the San Giovanni area is beautiful and not crammed with people taking pics, just across the block from the hotel is San Giovanni in Laterano Basilica that is breathtaking during the day and even more so at night, also close by is the famous pompi bar where they claim they have the best tiramisu and the locals from all over rome come and get their piece, the hotel is 4 metro steps from the spanish steps and is nice and clean, breakfast at the rooftop is also refreshing although the service isn't top notch, all in all if you want an authentic roman experience then stay at this hotel and go walking and explore the area

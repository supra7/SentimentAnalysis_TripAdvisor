I had a great stay here! The location is perfect and within walking distance of many things. There is a grocery store across the street that is open late for snacks. If you want a great view and less of the city noise, I reccommend paying a few extra dollars to get one of the deluxe rooms- that way you are guaranteed to have a view of the Space Needle or the City. My room was on the 17th floor and I was lucky enough to have a view that included the Space Needle, and a little bit of Elliot Bay and Lake Union. There was new bedding/mattresses, and carpet in our room- the bathroom was the only disappointing part- the shower head was small and didn't have very much pressure. The staff was very friendly and willing to help- a complete turnaround from when I stayed here about 3 yrs ago. When I first arrived, I was given a coupon for the restaurant in the hotel (didn't eat there- not much variety and pricy) and a very helpful map of the city. Overall, I had a great stay and was glad that I didn't read into some of the not so good reviews!

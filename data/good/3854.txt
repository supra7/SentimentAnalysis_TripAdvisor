Just returned from a week stay at the Hilton Bayfront and anticipating the run of the mill conference center I was happily surprised. From the check in to check out customer service was their priority. Both the room and bathroom were large, clean and mine had a beautiful view. The food in both restaurants was good, plentiful and tasty (although The Vela was more expensive). The Fox Sports Grill had good food (less expensive) and fun atmosphere. I liked the location, right on the water with a great boardwalk which took you to the Eastport Village in about 10 minutes (lots of shops and restaurants). Downtown Gaslamp Quarter, restaurants and the Westfield shopping plaza were all easy walks. I also think that just being across the road from the Quarter made this location less noisy.

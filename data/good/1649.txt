Although this is not in the centre of Rome it is easily accesible by metro or bus, it is in a lovely residential area that is safe and offers an insight into how people live in Rome. The rooms are modern and clean, the shower has good pressure for Rome. There is a lovely terrace were they serve breakfast, staff are lovely and very helpful.

I stayed at the Mayflower Park the last weekend in April. For a tourist, it was located in a great location. Quick 4 block walk to Pike Place Market, and the monorail to the Space Needle is connected to the hotel. I had 1/2 price appetizers and sangria in the Andaluca restaurant just off the lobby on Friday afternoon. This is a tiny restaurant and bar, but everything was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I also tried the world famous martinis at Oliver's Bar which is also in the lobby and they were great. It was very quiet on a Sunday night, but a very nice place to relax and enjoy a cocktail. The room I had was tiny. And the bathroom was even smaller. Because it was just me, it was fine, but if there were 2 people it would be claustrophic. I was lucky enough to be given a room on the top floor...it was very quiet. However- waiting on the elevator did require some patience. All in all, it was a quaint little hotel and I would recommend it.

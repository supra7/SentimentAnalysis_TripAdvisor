This Hilton property is in a great location for airport stay over or conferences. Access to the light rail system is right across the street, which offers a 30 minute ride to downtown Seattle ($2.50 one way). The staff is friendly and efficient and the rooms are comfortable. I would recommend this property for folks utilizing Seatac, but there isnt much more than the airport in this area. The rooms will be in need of some minor upgrades soon. The TVs are still the old tube style and the bathrooms, while clean, are beginning to look a little dated.

Less than 100m from the Fontana de Trevi this is an excellent hotel to stay in the heart of Rome. Occupying 6 floors, the rooms are nicely decorated with a decent size bathroom. The rooms were clean & the sheets were changed after 2 days. Breakfast is plentiful, with a good selection of pastries,cold meats,cheeses etc. The staff were very helpful-their restaurant recommendation was a great success. I am sure there are better hotels in the heart of Rome, but as a value for money base for your trip I can recommend this little hotel.

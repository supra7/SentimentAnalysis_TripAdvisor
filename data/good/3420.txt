Pros: Beach - All the good things you've read about the Beach.. They're true. It was the best beach i've EVER been to. Crystal clear water.. soft white sand... schools of fish that swim around you.. (only saw 2 types of fish, but there are LOTS of them.) Service - We stayed in one of the preferred suites. The service was in general very good. All of the staff tries their best to please you. Cons: (very minor in the grand scheme of things, but still, one should know) Food - I guess it's considered good for an AI, but one of the reviewers said it best... The menu is very similar at ALL of the restaurants. Grouper, Beef Tenderloin, salmon.. just different sauces.. Were weren't impressed with ANY of the dinner restaurants and really puzzled by all of the raving reviews about SMB food. I don't really understand the concept of being an AI, yet charging for "premium" liquor? For example, at the Japanese restaurant, they wanted to charge $20-something dollars for a can of Sapporo.. ???? Rooms - for what's its hyped up to be, I felt the rooms to be a bit dated. The only other AI resort I've been to is the Moon Palace Punta Cana, and the rooms there were much larger with a more modern clean feel. Insects - bring your bug spray.. Room Service - We had a very bad experience with this one.. We ordered breakfast one morning and apparently our order was sent to the wrong room, so they had to make our food again. All in all, we had a great time at SMB and would definitely recommend it. If the food quality improved, we'd definitely go back!

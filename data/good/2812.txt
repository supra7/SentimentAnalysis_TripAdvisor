We paid $69 for the room through Hotwire and were thrilled with the value. The rooms are very large with a very nice bathroom layout. The bathrooms have granite counterops and are loaded with extra amenities such as facial cleanser. The beds were comfy and the pillows were great. The bar/restuarant was suprisingly good. I went in with low expectations and the restauarant was actually astonishingly good. An earlier review mentioned lack of free wireless internet. This appears to have changed and we did have free wireless. This is the best Doubletree I believe I have stayed in. We were catching a flight out early the next morning at Seatac, and this was a great choice. I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would stay again. Frankly, even if the price doubled this would be a good deal and a great place to stay.

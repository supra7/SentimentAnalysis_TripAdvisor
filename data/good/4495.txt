My husband and I stayed here in May for the first part of our honeymoon. It was a very enjoyable place with so many delightful features. The location is prime- with just steps to the beautiful beach. The sunsets and starry skies on the beach are breathtaking. The grounds at the hotel are beautifully landscaped and the ambiance is set with a centralized tiki bar. The bar offers DELICIOUS cocktails and reasonably priced daily specials. The LAVA FLOWS were to die for! The rooms were comfortable and since we had a ground-level room, we had a very large lanai that opened right up to the lawn. We loved being able to sit on our lanai and listen to the music from the free nightly entertainment. Also, for any running enthusiasts out there, I very much enjoyed running along the boardwalk in the early morning. It was peaceful, but there were other enthusiasts running and taking in the various resorts and beachscapes along the way. The morning weather in Maui was perfect for jogging. As far as local activities go, my husband and I loved the beach so much that we didn't do much else on the island aside from beach bumming it. But we did go to the Old Lahaina Luau, which was good. We also checked out Whaler's Village and a few of the restaurants around.

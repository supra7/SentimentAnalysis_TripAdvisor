Spent 5 nights in Maui. Small Island of Hawaii, easily accessible with a rented car. Hotel rooms comfortable but small bathroom. Car parking limited. Self parking not well signposted, but when found certainly better than Valet parking. Swimming pool good, but may be overcrowded during peak seasons. The Beach is very narrow. 5 minutes drive from Lahaina centre and "Safeways" for groceries. Hotel Luaau was on special offer (2 for 1). Not really worth it at full price, but acceptable at the reduced price. Drove to Hana - very windey road which gives you a headache. Not much in Hana to do! Also drove up to the volcano crater, very picturesque. Overall good holiday for those that windsurf!

Our family of six stayed at this hotel in two rooms. We had one room with two queen beds and two bathrooms. The room was well-decorated and the beds were comfortable. We had a great view of the Space Needle and the Sound. The other room had two queen beds and a sofa bed. It was an interesting set up--not quite a suite but the living area was separated from the beds by a wall. The hotel is convenient to downtown shopping. It is between Macy's and Nordstrom. It is attached to Westlake Center so you can shop and eat at nice restaurants or even a food court. I like historic hotels and enjoy seeing them well-maintained. The bathrooms weren't gigantic but had everything you would need. This is the part of town that I spend the most time in. It's safe and there's a lot going on. You can take the Monorail from Westlake Center to Seattle Center and it's a short walk to Pike Place Market. Although I am local, my family and I stayed downtown to celebrate the Market's 100th anniversary and were quite pleased with our visit. If I go to a play or want to stay downtown for a Christmas shopping outing I'll choose this hotel again.

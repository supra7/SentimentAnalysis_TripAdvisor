Top Notch service by all the hosts at the reception. Litu was the best. The rooms very larger than any that we had seen in Europe and very modern and trendy. The breakfast was good too. We had problems with the laptop that they provided as it was in Italian and i screwed up by trying and losing all my songs on the Ipod (but I got them all as soon as I came back home to Seattle). It was nothing in compared to the comfortable 3 night stay at the hotel. I would go back there again and would recommend it to anyone with a family.

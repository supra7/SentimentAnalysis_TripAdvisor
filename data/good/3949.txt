We stayed at the Hilton San Diego bayfront for a long weekend in March, after we drove from LA to go to San Diego Zoo and Seaworld (both well worth a visit). The hotel itself was beautiful, lovely, spacious, clean, fresh rooms. We were in a middle-level corner room with a fantastic view of the bay and the Air Force base. The bed was large and very comfortable, with quality bedding. Whilst the location meant that we had beautiful views, it was a fair walk to the Gaslamp Quarter, where all the nice restaurants and bars are. We drove there in the evenings. The service was a little bit lacking, little things like the way you were greeted, and the Valet guys counting how much you tipped them in front of you. we ended up staying for tree nights, pay two get one free, so the hotel cost us around All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the stay, because of the hotel itself, but I'm sure that would be better places to stay whilst in San Diego if you were to stay longer. All in all a pleasant stay.

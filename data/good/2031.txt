Like most reviews, the Westin is conveniently located to Pike's Place, shopping, Monorail, dining, etc. It's close to a Bartell's - basically a CVS or Walgreens. The hotel is not bad. Hosts lots of conventions. The beds are excellent. The hallways can get noisy. Try not to get a room by the elevator. The North Tower rooms are better - equipped with the Westin Workout. The South Tower is good too. Concierege is very helpful and knowledgeable. i did not dine or order room service, so i have no idea what the food tastes like. But i did see quite a bit of people eating at the restaurants. the room as Starbucks coffee, so i made my own in the mornings. I definitely would not pay more than $175 a night for this hotel... regardless of time of year. If you need to print out your airline boarding pass, the business center will do it for free. That's a plus.

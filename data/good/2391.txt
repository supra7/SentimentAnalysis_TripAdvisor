Anthony checked us in -- very friendly, helpful, and thorough -- took care of us so we could be on our way. Our room was quiet, spacious, and full of wonderful amenities -- Bliss Spa products, super soft towels and robe, and super comfy bedding -- exceeded our expectations and experience. The W was a real treat at the end of a long day of travel! Other pluses ... The W is just a short walk from the waterfront (ferries, restaurants, aquarium) and Pike Place. The hotel also teamed up with Acura to provide complimentary rides to nearby spots -- check out the new MDX (without the pressure!) and get a nice ride too! We'd stay here again. There was just one minus -- the fan on the A/C seemed to be on all night -- not sure if the thermostat was malfunctioning or if we just missed a setting.

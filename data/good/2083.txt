We just returned from a trip to Seattle where we spent seven nights at the Westin in downtown Seattle. We were visiting my niece who also lives downtown. The Westin was very nice and they accommodated our need for two beds even though it didn't look like that was available on Expedia. I just called the hotel and they said that we could have that as long as they had availability when we checked in. The Westin is very convenient to all of the attractions in downtown Seattle. We could easily walk to Pike Place Market, the waterfront and ferries, lots and lots of restaurants, and could catch buses to the Fremont district and the baseball stadium with no problem. The Westin is great in that they provide you with a running map which I used most mornings. The run takes you to the waterfront. It was really nice. Then I would walk back through Pike Place Market, pick up a coffee at Starbucks or pick up coffee and donuts at Top Pot (just a couple of blocks aways - and a must try). The concierge desk was helpful in helping us figure out how to get places. We had no problem getting back to the airport and even though there is a shuttle, opted for the taxi since there were four of us and it would have been about the same price with a reduced driving time for us. The Westin offers free wine and snacks in the early evenings, but I always seemed to miss it so I can't comment on that. The rooms were small, but nice and comfortable. The bedding was very nice. The only complaint I had was that they don't have free wireless internet in the rooms and they charge you for internet use in the business center. I think that's just silly for a hotel at this price.

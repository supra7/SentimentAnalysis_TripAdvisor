Our stay at the Inn at Queen Anne was great. I'll mention up front - we got an amazing deal on the rate. At only $60/night in the Seattle area, this place was a steal. They put us in a 1 bed room when we first arrived, but they had no problem switching us to appropriate accommodations. Sure, there are a few flaws in the decor and the carpet is old... but it's an old place. If you want high end decor, go pay the price elsewhere. This is a small-scale old building with relatively friendly staff at the front desk and an unbelievably helpful shuttle driver who will make the effort to take you wherever you want to go and give recommendations along the way. With the free shuttle service and access to bus stops less than a block from the hotel, staying here was no inconvenience at all. We made it to all the locations we wanted to see and had a great place to sleep at night. Not too loud outside, and surrounded by decent eateries and a great grocery store. If you can find Nielsen's bakery a couple blocks away, get a snitter. It'll all be worth it! I was in Seattle in April, so no A/C was totally fine. And the proximity to the grocery store made having a kitchenette a wonderful amenity! This is not a luxury hotel, but the service and quaint local atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for to get a true feeling for a new area. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone, especially those who tire of modern, uniform hotels with no character.

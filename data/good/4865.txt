Very quiet with good amenities (computer access in room, coffee maker, TV to watch ESPN). Staff was helpful. Morning breakfast was cheerful and a nice way to start the day of sightseeing. Close to Termini station for easy transportation without paying for taxi rides. The only negative was that the hot water fluctuated with cold during a shower. We slept well in the hotel and would not hesitate to stay again.

When going to Maui - particularly Kaanapali Beach - it's likely that you are going to spend a majority of your time at the beach or sightseeing. That's what makes the KBH perfect. It's right on the best beach on the island and by far the least expensive motel along the beach. The rooms were clean and plenty big and the pool was good enough (why stay by the pool when the ocean is that close?). Plenty of chairs were provided for those who wanted to stay near the pool. This is the second time we've stayed at the KBH and we've enjoyed both stays, mainly because of its proximity to Kaanapali Beach, which was a 60 second walk from our room. Pros of the motel: Right on the beach, clean, good service, plenty of parking, Whaler's Village is less than a five-minute walk away, Lahaina is just a five-minute drive away Cons: No grills to use for personal cooking

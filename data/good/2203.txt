We were traveling with a family member who was going to have treatment at the UW medical facility, so we wanted something close by. The University Inn had been recommened to us, so we booked 3 nights there. It was very convenient, had adequate parking and if you didn't want to drive yourself, there was also a shuttle to the hospital. The complimentary continental breakfast each morning was adequate and they even offered an afternoon snack, although we were not around at those times to enjoy it. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The beds were one of the most comfortable we had stayed in recently. Lots of fun restaurants nearby. The staff was very helpful and polite at all times of day. Would definitely stay there again.

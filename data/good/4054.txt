Arrived at the Hyatt for 5 nights at the start of our honeymoon in mid-October, the guy (Brian I think) at check in was really nice and when we mentioned we were on honeymoon he checked to see if a better room was available for us. We were upgraded to a sea view room and it was fantastic. He also gave us a photo album to store our holiday pics and a bottle of wine with a meal in any of the hotel restaurants which was a lovely touch. Breakfast was included in our hotel price and I would definitely recommend going for that option, the buffet was great, the queue's looking daunting, but moved very quickly, we were no longer than 10mins waiting any morning. The pool area was fine, plenty of sun loungers although to get a good spot you had to be poolside very early! Took advantage of the Ala Moana Spa and the massages were excellent, the staff were very friendly as well which makes the experience even more enjoyable. Lovely walk ways between the different resorts along the beach and good restaurants all along. One of the nicest restaurants we dined in during our stay in Maui was in the hotel-Sonz at Swan Court. Beautiful setting and fabulous fresh fish, couldnt have asked for more. Will always remember my trip to Maui with great memories!

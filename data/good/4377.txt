The nice thing in Maui is that all beaches are public. Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is located just down from Black Rock on one side and Whalers Village on the other. Older hotel, with tiny shower and horribly uncomfortable bed. However, the location right on the beach was AMAZING! Affordable beach chairs/umbrella was also available.

Before departing to New York, we stopped overnight in Seattle and stayed at this hotel after scoring a great deal from Priceline. The hotel is huge and they give you warm cookies once you check-in. The design of the hotel is a little maze-like but still beautiful and the pool definitely makes you feel like you're somewhere else rather than beside the Sea-Tac Airport. Beds are comfy, showers are great - the floors are marble which made going to the bathroom a little painful on the feet (COLD FLOORS!). The only downside is that the lady at the front desk gave us the weirdest directions to get to our hotel room. We ended up going outside, and around and got lost when we found out later that we could have just gone around the corner from the check-in desk. We loved that they were playing the Canucks game in the restaurant/bar, too! The airport shuttle service was great, friendly and on-time. Staff is very courteous and friendly.

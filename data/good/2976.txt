This property has not gotten rave reviews, but I wanted to sleep on a Revive bed so gave them a try. We arrived after 10 pm very tired and were greeted by Eric at the front desk and he found us the 2 rooms we wanted and even took us up. We came down and had dinner in the bar, ordering from the dining room menu. We had very good food. I'll return to stay a night just for the horseradish crusted salmon. We faced the very pretty atrium and didn't hear noise until 9 am. The reception area downstairs is comfy and has a warm feeling. Not like the # 1 ranked hotel I stayed in over Christmas. That was a cold uninviting space. I don't know if the one elevator to the 3rd floor and above would be a problem when the hotel is crowded. Maybe I missed another elevator. All in all, we had a wonderful. comfortable relaxing stay and I'll go back. The rooms are just as nice as the Marriott Waterfront as far as comfort goes. I'm hooked on those beds. This is a great place for fussy older women, young men that have to travel with their mother( the fussy old woman), and families would love it.

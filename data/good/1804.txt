We loved the spaciousness of the rooms, the friendly staff, the ambiance, and the bakery across the street. We were disappointed by how little was in the vicinity of the hotel. Long walk or ride to any restaurants, shops, attractions, or anything worth seeing. The hospital is bounded by a freeway, a hospital, and some residences.

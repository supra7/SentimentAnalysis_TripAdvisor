Stayed here for a couple of nights in May. Very large twin double room. Very tastefully decorated with huge extremely comfy beds. (Why can't European hotels take note of the fantastic beds provided by most US chains? It really makes a difference!). Great night's sleep. Very central location. Beautifully appointed if a bit impersonal. This is very obviously geared towards the business/corporate guest as witnessed by the lobby both in terms of its size and layout. Main gripe - a little on the pricey side especially if you add in breakfast/valet parking. Seattle was very cool - really liked 1st/ 2nd Avenue area for funky stores and restaurants. Just ignore the homeless issue in these neighbourhoods. Also new Sculpture Park is a little Oasis of calm in this busy city...

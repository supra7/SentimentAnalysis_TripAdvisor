What I was really impressed with this hotel was its excellent and detail oriented services. Staffs carry such a friendly and warm attitude. I felt they truly paid attention to make customers happy. I was very thrilled. I shipped a flat box of snorkel and swimming equipment to Hyatt. At check-in, they reminded me that they had it. Front desk was very accommodating. They did not push to sell an upgrade. When I asked if I could pay an upgrade, they offered a free one instead. When I went to my room and requested my shipment, it was delivered immediately. Bell boy was very nice. Service at the pool was excellent. Rooms are tastefully decorated. Hallways and surroundings are clean and nicely maintained. The hotel is situated at the south end of the beach walk. The beach in front of the hotel is rocky. From the hotel to walk to Black Rock is about 1 mile long with Whaler Village in the middle. The hotel has a very nice and beautiful pool. But water was minimally warm so no one was using it. However, kids didn't care. Kid's pool was more crowded. It has a little slide and a few pool toys. My kid had a lot of fun. He also enjoyed the penguins and parrots in the lobby. I would definitely stay at this hotel, again.

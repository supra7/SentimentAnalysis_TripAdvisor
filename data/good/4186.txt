We stayed for six nights in May at Hyatt Regency Maui. We were so pleased with the hotel grounds, room and food. Only 5 minutes from the town of Lahaina, the hotel is the first along Kanapali beach. We stayed as part of a package deal (three nights for the price of two, with buffet breakfast), and it was a great value. This was seriously the most outstanding buffet breakfast we've ever had. Valued at $30 per person, we only paid a small tip each day and were filled for hours from our delicious meal (omelets, pancakes, fresh fruit and cakes, even miso soup)! The pools were beautiful and refreshing; there wasn't much of a beach right there but we didn't really miss it. The concierge was helpful in booking a snorkeling tour, and at check-in we were even offered a bottle of champagne to celebrate our anniversary! The staff was friendly and accommodating. Our room (partial ocean view) was clean and of optimal size. The resort (there's a $15 a day fee) is very large with a ton of rooms; this is a chain that services many guests. If you want something intimate, this is not your place. If you can get a deal/reasonable rate, this is a lovely spot to stay in Maui.

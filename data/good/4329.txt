We spent 7 nights at the Hyatt in Maui, arriving on Thanksgiving day. The hotel itself is nice, the grounds are well maintained and attractive, but I would not say they are over the top. We stayed in a deluxe ocean front room for $398/night, which again was nice and clean, but nothing special. During our stay we received good service and really had no problems. We used the valet parking service just about every day and had no prolems whatsoever. Going the week after Thanksgiving turned out to be a great time -- the hotel was only 60 to 70% full, so there was plenty of room at the pool every day (no need to rush down at 8am and reserve pool chairs). The beach in front of the Hyatt is narrow and not great for swiming (rocks), BUT if you take a short stroll along beautiful Kanapali beach you will find that it opens up quite a bit with plenty of room for everyone. Overall, I didn't love the Hyatt, but I certainly did not dislike it. It is definitely an above average property on a beautiful island. Just don't go there expecting the Four Seasons Resort.

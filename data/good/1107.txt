My Mom, brother, & I stayed at the Hilton Seattle pre/post Alaska Cruise (via NCL Pearl). The location of this hotel is just awesome (IT'S WALKING DISTANCE TO EVERTYHING), and two blocks away from the Train that takes you to the SEATAC airport! We were located on the 20th & 21st floor. The rooms are pretty quite, but you could hear noise from adjacent rooms if you were in the hallway, but not like that is a big deal and it's something that can't be prevented. There weren't many places to eat near the hotel, as we were there on Sunday on both days, but there is a Rock Bottom Brewery & Restaurant located just a block away. All-in-all I think if I were to visit Seattle again, I would most likely stay at this Hilton Seattle!

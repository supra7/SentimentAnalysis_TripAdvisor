We had no problem with the rooms. We had 2 connecting rooms before our cruise, and 2 connecting rooms after our cruise. ALL 4 rooms were clean, comfortable, quiet, and nice. No problems with check-in. In fact, both times rooms were ready for early check-in. We had excellent internet rate of $149 which included breakfast! I don't think I would have been happy if I had paid $300 per room per night! Our only problem was with the front desk, which didn't want to recognize our breakfast deal - lucky I had my email confirmation. Also, after the trip was over, Starwood points were never credited to my account, and they definitely had my starwood #. I had to argue with Starwood and hotel manager for my points! That was annoying! they didn't want to issue the points because of the great deal. (It might have been an internet error, but nevertheless, I did get that rate! I booked it Xmas eve for August - maybe it was an Xmas present! )

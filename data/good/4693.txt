The hotel itself can use some renovations, and the rooms arent the best in the world, but the location is great! Beach is great for swimming, walking, sunbathing. Staff is very friendly and attentive. If the beach is the most important for you (as it was for us), Kaanapali Beach is a great place and this hotel offers a good value. If you are looking for a great pool and exotic rooms this property probably isnt for you. The restaurant is great and one of the best on Kaanapali Beach. The food is exquisite and while not cheap it is not outrageously priced either. Nightly hula dancing is fun too.

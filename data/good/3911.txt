If you are looking for a relaxing, intimate hotel experience this may not be the place. On the other hand, if you have an event at the Convention Center this is an amazing hotel. It is a 5-minute walk to the Gaslamp District. The hotel is very clean, almost sterile (which can be a good thing for some people). I gave it a "very good" rating because the hotel staff, valet, bell hops and restaurants are very good. I was there for business and my needs we met and usually exceeded. It's just not the intimate, couple retreat. Pick a smaller hotel in the Gaslamp District if that is what you are looking for.

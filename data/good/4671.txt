Review somewhat delayed for this hotel as we stayed in 2003. But generally I really liked this hotel, although first impressions at the welcome meeting were a bit mixed, but then we relaxed and destressed. We had an Ocean view room at the front of the hotel - which was great although the room was a bit dated, it was very clean - the rooms around us at the time were just being revamped. The staff at this hotel were friendly and very helpful, and we visited a couple of the hotels along the beach and we both felt they were a little bit posy and we were glad of our choice we would definitely go back to this hotel.

Distiney Palms was a great place for us to stay on our band trip. We got great rates. The rooms were clean and had a fresh smell. The Manager and Staff were even better. Twice the manager ask if we needed any uniforms cleaned for the group that he would be glad to do it. They had the equipment and it wouldn't cost us anything.

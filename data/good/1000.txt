Admitting, we didn't spend much time in our hotel, and the Renaissance (pretty much) did everything right. We arrived early Friday morning, fresh off a cruise ship and ready to drop off our luggage and freshen up. Fortunately, a room was available. It was nice enough. The bed was very comfy. The chairs and TV were fine. I could do without the sliding/non-latching bathroom door. The concierge was helpful, providing us with a map and suggestions tailored to our limited time and list of sights to see, even printing directions for us to get to one out of the way restaurant. Getting around from the hotel wasn't terribly difficult, though it is in somewhat of a bad location. If you're walking up Madison, the road is very steep uphill. The sites (Pike's Market, Space Needle) are further north, though, so we took the concierge's recommendation to walk down 6th a few blocks to minimize the slope. There are a number of similar hotels closer to all the sites, but the Renaissance was still accessible enough on foot or by bus. Our only real complaint came when housekeeping awakened us at 8:30. We were checking out that day! Why would we need our room made up? We weren't planning on sleeping in too much longer, so it didn't really ruin our day. We booked through Hotwire, spending more than we wanted to, but ultimately, I think it was worth not having to shlep in from outside of town (45 minute train from the much cheaper airport hotels) since we didn't have a ton of time to see everything.

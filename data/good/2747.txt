Stayed here with my 7 year old son overnight on our way to Asia. It was convenient and friendly. Clean rooms and love that they had room service. Prompt airport shuttle and amiable staff. Used the gym facility which was adequate and pleasantly unexpected in a hotel this size. Will be staying here again on our future sea tac layovers.

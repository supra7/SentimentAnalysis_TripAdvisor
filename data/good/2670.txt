This hotel was a great place to stay. It was located about 6 blocks down to the pike market. About a mile to the Space Needle. There was 2 movie theaters within about a 2 block radius. I went this August 2011 and stayed 2 nights here. The hotel room wasn't the biggest but for what my daughter and I needed it was good. They had valet parking so didn't have to worry about driving around Seattle. Parked it for 2 days and spent the time walking around, it was just a perfect position for us and what we wanted to see.I had asked the front desk clerk on my first night there for a wake up call the next morning but didn't receive it ,he must've been busy but was glad I wasn't going to a meeting or anything important, I just didn't want to waste the day away by sleeping in. I did complain the next morning and had a very apologetic front desk clerk. They were very helpful when we wanted directions or what restaurants were good to go to etc. I would stay here again if I was staying in the city.

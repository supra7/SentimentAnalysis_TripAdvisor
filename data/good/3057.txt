We stayed 2 nights at this airport hotel. At first we wanted to stay downtown the 2nd night but we couldn't get a hotelroom under the price limit we set downtown. Afterwards we were quite happy that we stayed 2 nighs in the Hilton. We liked the accomodations and also the staff was friendly. We didn't have any noise problems with the planes and if you have a car you can easily visit Seattle Downtown after a 20 minutes drive which is not too bad. On the other hand I disliked the 18$ parking fee for which I couldn't find cheaper alternatives in that area. Also as usual Hilton is not offering free internet access which is a shame for a 4 star hotel according to me. If you have a mobile phone with WIFI you can pick up free signals when you talk a walk around the hotel. You'll see ;)

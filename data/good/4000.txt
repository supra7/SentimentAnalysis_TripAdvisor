Great value budget accomodation We were a little anxious when we saw the hotel from the road as it was cross sectioned by 2 very busy streets. However we were put at the back of the hotel over looking a small courtyard and it was very quiet and peaceful. ( On my booking form I asked for a room with a view)Our room was large and airy with great air con. The bathroom was quirky, very old fashioned tiles which may not be to some people's taste but it was clean, the shower worked so I had nothing to complain about, in fact I thought it was charming and made a change from characterless white.The breakfast was OK, mainly strange coloured pastries but plenty of them.It was in a good location and within walking distance to all the main attractions in Florence.We paid 102 euros for 2 nights and did not expect much. We were really pleasantly surprised with what we got for our money.

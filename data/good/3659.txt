This hotel is really, really lovely. The only downside is the rooms are TINY! It's in a great location a short stroll to the Soho shops, Little Italy and Chinatown and there is a fantastic Wholefood Market a few doors away. Lovely Thai restaurant called Kuta one street away and lots of friendly bars near by. It's on a big main street but noise was not an issue at all. It's beautifully fitted out and has an amazing roof deck which is also very tastefully and stylishly finished. You can take your breakfast up if it's fine weather. The breakfast that is included is great. Good choice of food and beverages, cozy basement room where you can also use the computers and the whole place is spotlessly clean. Staff are helpful and offer advice on local restaurants etc. Bathroom was small but with a large shower cubicle and again very stylish. The only negative is that there is absolutely no storage. A small shallow cupboard near the door which at best would hold your coat and no drawers at all. You really do have to live out of your suitacase the whole time. Fine for us, as we were only staying 2 nights. Any longer and it might drive you nuts. This really is the only downside and if you travel light and don't shop much it may not be a problem. Would I go back? Yes, but only for a short stay.

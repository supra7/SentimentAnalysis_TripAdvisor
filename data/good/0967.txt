I booked this through a 3rd party website... and was glad I didn't pay full price. It was a very pleasant stay, just not sure it was 4 Star as Priceline rates it. In reading other reviews of this property - I was surprised about people who complained that internet is charged... (I stay at many nicer properties similar and everyone charges it) but what got me.. was it was $12.95 per item (so my iPhone and laptop would be $26 per night) and I didn't bother getting it at all. Would I stay at another Marriott? Probably, given that this was the first time at one (I'm usually at Westin or other Starwoods) but - would I book through the hotel website? Probably not. It was Columbus Day weekend, and a parking spot was difficult to find, and manouvering around in the mornings was difficult given that the shortage of parking spots made people park in down ramps, or anywhere in the parkade. Also there was a bad storm, and staying high made for wind to go through the window frames (not enough window sealant) and not sure what would have been quieter... traffice noise from the I-5 or the other side with the high winds. I was surprised with the actual size of the room however - the benefits of an older hotel versus a newly built one.

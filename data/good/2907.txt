This hotel is very close to the airport and they offer a free shuttle. The breakfast in the morning was great! All of the front desk personnel were very kind and helpful. The room was more than I expected for a moderate hotel! The bed was wonderful and I love the little lap desks that they put on each bed. I will stay at Hampton again soon.

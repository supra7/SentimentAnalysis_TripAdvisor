As a GM for several hotels on the Mainland, I can be very critical and watchful for service and overall quality of a hotel. I was very pleased with our 11day stay in Maui. Although this is not the most modern hotel-I found it clean and functional for all of our needs. This hotel has one of the most pleasant and knowledgeable staff I have ever met. It is obvious that they love their jobs and that the hotel is run very well. You should take advantage of the morning welcome breakfast-it really helps to plan the activities available on the island. The free classes offered at the hotel are great for adults and children. Mikala was our guide in two our classes. He was so patient and kind-a real asset for the hotel. I am looking forward to our next visit.

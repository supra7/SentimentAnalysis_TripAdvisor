We stayed at this hotel for a weekend in Rome. It was easy to get to from the airport, just a train ride and couple of subway stops, and it's location next to the Trevi fountain was fantastic. The hotel itself was welcoming and friendly, the staff helpful and the rooms clean and tidy. Great for a two day stay. We had a room on the back of the hotel which had no noise from the busy streets around the Trevi. Hope to go back soon.

Well, it has been a while since our stay at Hotel Max - we stayed there in October of 2006 for 9 nights/10 days. the only incident we ran into was the valet parking elevator broke, so they could not get our rental car out of the garage in time for us to return it to Enterprise. Very clean, our room was painted all red, we were on floor 5 or 6. The doors are the coolest part, we went to every floor, especially to find the Charles Peterson photos of the local music scene in the late 80s early 90s. Great stuff, fun to see it so large. Not much room inside the room, but the bed was great and I loved getting a daily copy of The Seattle Times. Great service and a great location to walk to a lot of the "touristy" spots in Seattle; Pike's Place Market, The Showbox, Space Needle, KEXP radio, the Monorail, downtown shopping, and TONS of places to get cool meals (our fav was Ivar's on the piers). Love the coffee, love the city, loved the Hotel Max.

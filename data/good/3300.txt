This is a beautiful hotel with a great staff, very comfortable beds, great restaurants and a beautiful beach but for the price we paid for this vacation we should not have had to deal with a unsolicited, "2" hour, time share presentation that they tried to get us to attend. In addition to offering time shares within their group of resorts they let you know that the best rooms and prices are only available to those people in the time share program. They also have now opened this hotel up to corporate events, one of which was for four hundred people. This made it hard for timely room service and taking advantage of some of the other perks around the property. This is too bad for such a nice hotel!

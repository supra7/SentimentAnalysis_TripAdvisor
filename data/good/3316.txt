My wife and I spend 6 nights at the beautiful Maroma Beach secrets for our honeymoon and I must say I was pleasently suprised. We purchased the oceanview swim out suite and were delighted to hear it was one of the best rooms on the property. Having the swim out was something we thought was really worth it due to the busyness of the pool area during mid day. The rest of the room was modern and very clean. The resort really quiets down early and you can see very few persons out past 10:30 at night. The staff for the most part was extremely helpful and sometimes overly helpful. The food was much better than I had anticipated, that being said it was OK. Secrets had several different restaurants each with its own menu and ambiance however I felt that a lot the meals were similar as the meats and/or vegetables were prepared similarly. The only one I felt that was completely unique was Hamitsu. Portions were small but not too small. This included the portions on our paid romantic dinner on the beach. The paid meal had a beautiful setting and excellent service however the meal was just OK, not worth the extra $$$. Be sure to get a massage on the beach, it is one of the best massages I have ever recieved. Afterwords my wife dragged me to the complementary aqua therapy session that absolutely blew my mind. After the sessions I felt most relaxed than I have ever been. Be sure to bring a can of OFF for the mosquitos as they can get really bad, cash in small denomonations for better service you should be set. Overall Secrets Maroma beach is a really relaxing and romantic getaway for couples.

Again, I had a good experience with this hotel. I can always depend on it being a moderately priced hotel, clean, with friendly and accommodating staff. We ate in the restaurant and they were very nice in fixing me a Cobb salad that wasnt on the dinner menu when I asked about it. Good food. We stay there on the " park and fly" special so we don't have to get up so early to make our plane. My only on-going complaint is no free wifi in the room but this time I had my 3G phone with me so I didn't need it.

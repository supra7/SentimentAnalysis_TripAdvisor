This was a very nice hotel, very very clean, staff was accommodating. Only complaint: there are no vending machines so we were forced to buy overpriced minibar drinks the first night (not much of a complaint, huh?). Parking is outrageous in Seattle!! But the parking attendants at this hotel were extremely professional: fast and very friendly and efficient.

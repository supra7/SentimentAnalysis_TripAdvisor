I enjoyed the Hawaiian theme. We had problems with check-in for our complimentary breakfasts, but management finally cleared it up. convenient to the beach. concierge didn't tell us that we could get cheaper luau ticket at hyatt, though, so we ended up paying higher price. evened out by getting discount to hotel's own magic show.

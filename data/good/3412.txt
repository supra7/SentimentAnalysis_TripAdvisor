Firstly, I do not recommend this resort for a solo trip unless its business or a wedding. This resort is absolutely beautiful!! You dont want to experience it alone. This is a very romantic resort, great for Honeymooners. There were over 13 in my building alone! My stay was for 6 nights. Great food, service and luxury accommodations. The spa was amazing! I have nothing but great things to say except, I got a bit tired of people asking me "just one?" when making dinner reservations or "why are you here alone". That got old quick. I guess the culture there does not mind asking those questions. Also, for a resort of this caliber the decorative pillows in the room had an odor. They must not get cleaned often and the beds are not very comfortable, kind of on the hard side. But I would still return with a friend in a heart beat!

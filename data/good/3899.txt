New hotel. Stayed in a standard room. Furnishings were modern and clean. Bed was a little soft for me but comfortable. Nice views. Only one restaurant for breakfast which cannot handle the crowd when there is a convention/meeting at the hotel. Self parking lot is close, convenient, abundant and easily accessible to hotel entrance.

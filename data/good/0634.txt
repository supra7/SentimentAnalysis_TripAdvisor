This was a classy joint. It was non-pretentious and encompassed what a downtown hotel should be. The interior was vintage yet classy. The service was 5-Star. The only thing I noticed was that the walls seemed thin. As I sat at the desk in our room drinking my coffee I could hear the conversation in the room next to us. That was the absolute only thing I noticed as a negative though. The downstairs bar was great! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a classy, nice hotel that isn't trying to prove something. We plan on going back to Seattle next year and will be booking Mayflower Park!

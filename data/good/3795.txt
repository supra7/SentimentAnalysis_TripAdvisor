My husband and I just returned from EDM and this was our second visit. Once again the staff was incredible! Special Thanks to Lizbeth, Ariel, Ruben, Paola and Carminia - very wonderful people! We especially enjoyed the new restaurant - Papitos, this is a great addition to the resort. We always find the lunches to be the best meals, but we also very much enjoyed the Italian restaurant and our candlelight dinner on the beach. The reason we have returned and most likely will again are for three reason: the beach as it is just gorgeous, warm and crystal clear, the intimacy and boutique feeling of the resort - note to management: please do not change this about EDM..this is what makes it special and finally the staff..we have traveled to many resorts in Mexico and Riviera Maya..this staff is the best...friendly, happy and accomodating! My only slight complaint would be the front desk/reception...we didn't get our luggage the first night and we were not offered any essential kit, etc...only when asked. The other critique/suggestions would be to have a beach bar closer to the water and to open Papitos for dinner. It would be nice to have outdoor or open air dining options and to have more entertainment options other than Rick's Bar..again something outdoors. But those are suggestions to make the experience even better...as the resort is near perfect....

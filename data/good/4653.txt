I just returned from a week long vacation at the Kaanapauli Beach Hotel and I had a great time! I went with one of my best friends for a girl's trip and we loved it! We had a first floor room close to the lobby, partial ocean view. The room wasn't outdated - as many postings claim. It was exactly what I would envision as far as decor in a Hawaiian hotel. The room also wasn't musty, smelly, etc. It was clean, nice, perfect for us. The Tiki Bar was fun and the bartenders there were great! The pool was a little small, but when you're right on the beach who needs the pool? The staff members were very friendly and helpful. In fact, when I got the flu halfway through the trip the hotel's restaurant even made me chicken noodle soup - which wasn't on the menu. And I must say it may have been the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had! (My healthy roommate agreed.) Once out of the hotel, the guys at the Trilogy Aquatic Center and the cabana boys made sure we were well taken care of, and the prices for activities were fairly priced. If there was something we wanted to do they didn't offer, they'd make the calls and get us set up somewhere else. We loved them! All in all, I'd definitely go back to the Ka'anapali Beach hotel. We got out of it all we wanted and needed.

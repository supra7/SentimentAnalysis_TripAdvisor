Drove up and stayed for a night last month (had a meeting in Seattle early the next morning) Quick check-in, just got a regular room --it was tiny but clean and quiet. Service more than made up for the older building. The free-wifi is convenient, and they even have an iMac in the lobby for guests to use. Had a couple of glasses of local wine during their "wine hour" (lots of hotels do this and but it is a nice touch) The Koolhaas designed Seattle Public library is right across the street (great vertigo-inducing architecture on the upper floors) The one thing that really stood out was the restaurant (Tulio) I'm in Seattle often and will make it a point to eat dinner there again even if I don't stay at this hotel. Cramped, loud, delicious. Enough said. Room service/breakfast was prompt but just average. Valet was quick, noticed that they charge ~$10 more for valet/overnight parking than just about all the downtown hotels (I'm not sure why) It is really close to the I-5 freeway onramps so if you need to go north or south in a hurry, it's really convenient. I can recommend a stay here, although personally I prefer the Monaco nearby. For tourists/first time visitors, the Paramount or Inn at Market are closer to the walkable sites for about the same price (not that this hotel is really far, just not as close-in as the others)

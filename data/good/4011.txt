During my one week stay, I have had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. The staff is very professional, courteous and accommodating. They even surprised me with a cake on my birthday. Special thanks to Mr. Gokhan, Ms. Nese, Ms. Hilal, Can, and all the other staff members. The rooms are clean and provide an excellent view of the Bosphorus. The price is very reasonable. The breakfast was sufficient. The location is very central and convenient. Whether you are in Istanbul for business or pleasure, and if you are looking for a boutique hotel, you should consider staying here.

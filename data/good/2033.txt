Stayed for 5 nights from Sept 19 and enjoyed our visit. Our room on the 21st floor and was spacious and very comfortable. It had views of the city, bay and space needle. We had booked through Hotwire and found it did not affect how we were treated as guests, in fact everyone was very nice and accomodating. The elevators were always FAST, even with a conference happening during or stay. We cannot comment on the hotel restaurant but did eat at Hana Sushi (excellent), Serious Pie (great tasting pizza), and Lowells ( Pike Place - Great breakfasts with an awesome view). I'd definitely stay again next Seattle trip.

From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I knew I made the right choice. Beautifully done, very classy lobby. I was greeted quickly and given a room on a high floor, after requesting a quiet floor. The rooms are great. Well appointed and very clean. Some of the HDTV channels did not come in but that's ok. There were plenty of other channels to watch. My room was always made up quickly, bathroom very clean. Didn't feel like I had to lock anything away for fear of it disappearing. Had room service one night. Very good chicken wrap and it was delivered quickly - within 15 minutes. Didn't eat at the restaurants, only drank at the sports bar and hotel lobby bar. Everyone was very friendly. I paid $11 for a martini, which seemed high, but I'm from the midwest. I loved that they had iPads in the bar so I could check my gmail quickly. It's weird that you have to walk outside to Starbucks. Was there for a conf at the convention center so that was an easy walk. It's a little bit of a walk to Gaslamp. Being by myself, I would have liked to be closer. But I never felt scared or threatened, even walking back after 11 one night. Sat at the pool one afternoon. Lovely view and no one bothered me about anything. Walked down the by the water, lovely walkway. All in all, I would stay here again. When I returned home, I told my BF that we would definitely be staying at this hotel. We'd like to come back for a long weekend w/o having work stuff to get in the way. Thanks Hilton!

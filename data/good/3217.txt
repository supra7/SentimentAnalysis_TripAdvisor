This hotel is located on a quite street and can be easily accessed by public transport from Tegel airport (take the TXL bus to Karlplatz) or the Hauptbahnhof. There are a few good restaurants within a few minutes walk (at the end of Albrechtstrasse there is a very nice Italian restaurant). There is public transport near by, so access to the main sites is easy. The Brandenburger Tor and Bundestag are about a 10-15 minute walk away. The hotel was clean, the room was on the small side, but adequate for two people with one medium case. If we had of had two cases this would have been a problem as there is not really anywhere to put a second case. The breakfast selection was good (cost 8 per person). However, the breakfast room had too few staff and replacement of the cooked breakfast food was slow and also the making up of new tables slow. There is free WiFi throughout the hotel. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

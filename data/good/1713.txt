My Wife and I were very lucky to stay here two nights as they accepted our bid on Priceline's Name Your Own Price and except for a few minor complaints really enjoyed it. We had a room facing the city but really it wasn't all bad as we had a great view of the space needle hovering just above the landscape. The room was a little small and there wasn't a lot of room for our 2 large and 2 medium suitcases but other than that it was cozy. My biggest complaint was the valet manager giving me an attitude when we arrived and I told him I wasn't going to valet and I wanted to leave my car there for just a few minutes to check in. DON'T GET FOOLED INTO PAYING THE RIDICULOUS VALET FEES! There is plenty of parking out on the streets and the meters are free from 6pm-8am. For one night we parked in a garage off of Vine and Elliott and it was only $17 for 24 hours. Other than that, all staff I met were very friendly. Pike Place and the space needle were really short walks away and we really enjoyed our stay! If you have time, drive up and do the Boeing tour in Everett, it is awesome!

It was a pleasant Hotel. It was very busy upon arrival after getting off the cruise ship. They did store our bags and let us sit in the lobby which was very nice by the way. Evenutally we left to go to the Space Needle. Took the mono rail, which was fun. We had reservations but they couldn't find it. The concierge from the Westin was suppose to have made them. The resturaunt is nice but very pricey. The view was great again very pricey. You could get away with sharing a dish. We loved Pike's place. Our kids are 15 and 13 and they really lliked it to... Ulli's saugages are excellent. I butcher who was trained in Mannheim Germany. La Panier was a great cafe, great baked goods and sandwiches to go (like for the airplane ride). The W was okay. It has great Bliss products. We asked for a scale to weigh our luggage and they couldn't for the life of them accomodate that. Oh well, there are worse things in life. All in all it was a nice place to stay. Hotel Monacoo across the street accomodates pets.

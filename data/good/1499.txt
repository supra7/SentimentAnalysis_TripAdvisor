It would be hard to beat this spot for convenience to transportation, shopping, the Space Needle, the Convention Center, the Pike Place Market, etc. The staff was among the friendliest and most helpful I have encountered; they even have stamps and envelopes if you have unexpected business to take care of. You wouldn't want to be too fussy about appearances, as there were some stains on the carpet, dirty windows, etc. But if your needs are more functional than aesthetic, this would be a good choice.

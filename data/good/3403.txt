Stayed Thanksgiving weekend... mostly everyone is on honeymoon so everyone is in a good mood. We were three couples in our 50's and "not" on honeymoon. The service at the pool was fantastic. No reason to eat in a restaurant during lunch. They bring food to the pool area and cook it right there. Do not stay at building 11. It was horrible service. Was there 4 nights and had turndown service only one. Never saw our concierge. Drinks are definitely weak even when asking for premium liquor. Food was nice though and everyone enjoyed the freshly made crepes for breakfast.

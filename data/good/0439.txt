The hotel is a nice hotel. The staff were all great. We liked our room, the view and the little kit of sleeping aids they put on the bed. What sent us through the roof in anger was the $30 plus tax parking fees. We only paid $64 for the darn room!! We booked on Priceline and requested a 2 1/2 star hotel in an effort to avoid these upscale places that charge so much for parking. Priceline "upgraded" us to the Crowne Plaza. I'm wondering if they get a kickback for the parking fees. Thanks for letting me vent.

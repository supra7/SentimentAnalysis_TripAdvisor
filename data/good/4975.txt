pera tulip hotel is a nice classy boutique hotel, i really loved it. the hotel is very clean very well located ( istiklal street is just 2 mn walk) the breakfast is nice with a selection of cheese, bread , sausages & the turkish simit, nothing very special but u will find several choices. the agents on the front office are really polite & helpful it was a great stay. for me the only negative point was the room, it was very small with no space to moove on it & the bed was 130 cm for 2 adult, so it was a very tiny room . this time a will have my child with me so we booked the twin room & i hope it will be larger & more suitable for us. finally i will say even they have small rooms the hotel is brilliant.

We stayed at the Warwick Seattle for one night between Christmas and New Year. The Hotel is a nice 4 star typical American Hotel. The room was very large, clean a comfortable. Definately worth the 90 dollar a night rate. Furthermore, the location was perfect, we were a 5 minute walk from Pike Market and the main shopping area. The only complaint would be that the price of parking was a bit high. If you book just make sure to ask for a higher floor with a view of the space needle, the view is great!

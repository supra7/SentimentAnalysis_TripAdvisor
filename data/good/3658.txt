This is a nice hotel and the location is ideal as other reviewers have noted. We found the staff to be really helpful and friendly as well. And yes the rooms are tiny. We enjoyed our stay here. Do note that, however, that in an attempt to give the place a nightclub type cool ambience it is dark - real dark. Our rim was lit by just three very dim bulbs and no option for additional light. Don't plan to do a lot of reading or fine needle point work in your room!

My Fiance and I arrived in Seattle for along weekend. We were able to take the light rail from the airport which stopped only 2 short blocks from the hotel. We received a friendly greeting from the doorman and front desk clerk and had an easy check-in. The rooms are clean and the bed was very comfortable. If you like a large room however, this is not the hotel for you as they are quite small with little bathroom space. Otherwise this is a great place to stay. We will stay there again the next time we visit Seattle.

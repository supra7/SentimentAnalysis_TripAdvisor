The hotel is very clean, very nice. The drawbacks are very tiny room, for 2 ppl its ok, but not with 2 suitcases as no place to keep even one suitcase. Location next to bus stop but MRT station 5 bus stop away. For kids its may not be appealing as no restuarant or food items, but just a 20 steps away is 24 hour food court, where lot of Food variety available. Staff very friendly, 100 times better then other fragrance hotel in gelyang street. Try to take fragrance oasis in comparison to fragrance classic. Overall good.

This is an 'airport' hotel, located a stone's throw from the terminal. I was expecting something very average but was pleasantly surprised by the facilities, service and food. We had a room facing the airport but were never disturbed by the planes. Pros: Nice pool in the atrium. Lots of families used it. Cozy yet spacious lobby and bar with a central fire place Very good gym with free weights to 50lbs and lots of cardio machines Better than average restaurant Clean room and very comfortable bed Cons: The bathroom was showing it's age a little Also, I personally like a ceiling exhaust fan in a bathroom which these didn't have Atrium rooms could get a little noisy The parking in the hotel lot can get full quickly The cons are really quibbles. For this style of hotel, it exceeded my expectations. The location is also convenient to gas stations and some decent restaurants, especially Mango if you like Thai food.

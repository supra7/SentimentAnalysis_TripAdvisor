I was at this hotel last week and it was perfect for our needs. I did NOT like the cartoonish lobby with penguins or the sheer quantity of people at the pool. I did NOT like needing a wrist band in order to get a towel. I did NOT like the hustle and bustle of Kaanapali. On the other hand the room was bigger then the one that we had at the Four Seasons. We had two balconies one ocean side and one landward. The bed was perhaps the best I've ever slept in at a hotel bar none. I liked the location as far as getting out to the snorkeling at Black Rock and Honolua Bay. Despite the quantity of people I felt that the staff did a passable job in being responsive. The price was right and I felt like I was getting what I paid for which is usually all I ask for in my lodgings.

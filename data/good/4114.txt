This was our first stay at a Hyatt, and we weren't disappointed. The staff was very personable and friendly. We asked for adjoining rooms when the reservation was made, and were happy that our request was successful! Room size was good, neat bathroom area, with a handy closet. Beds in both rooms were Japanese style - low, with a mattress and no box spring, which we found odd. Not uncomfortable, but different from upscale hotels where you have to climb into the bed! I don't know if all rooms in the hotel had the same type of bed. Room was quiet, never heard our neighbors. Great for families, two pools, kids' pool was fun - for kids. Restaurants were a bit pricey. We ate all our dinners outside in the casual restaurant in the pool area, which was more than adequate. Breakfast buffet was better than average, again a bit pricey, but we had 2 for 1 coupons. We're from Hawaii, and found the Hyatt Maui to be a good value for locals and fun for our family.

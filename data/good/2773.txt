This is a huge, full service property close to SeaTac airport. You get what youd expect from a 3-star airport hotel: convenient parking, very confortable rooms, easy access to the terminals. At first the property seems a bit old (carpets are not in the best conditions in the hallways), but rooms are impeccable. Our rooms were very spacious and confortable, with great beds and big desks. Bathrooms were very convenient as well. We also had small balconies with a nice view of a lagoon at the back of the hotel. Everything is perfectly clean. Wi fi is complimentary on common areas -it worked well, but the night I stayed here there was a blackout. Quite a creepy experience going back from one of the lobbies to my room, which seemed like one block away. Staff is friendly. I would undoubtedly stay here again.

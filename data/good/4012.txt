I recently had the extreme pleasure of spending a night at the Gezi. My room had the most incredible view of the Bosphorus and when I woke up in the morning watching the ferries cross the Bosphorus river whilst I dreamily lay in bed. The hotels staff were very polite and friendly but do need to brush up on their local knowledge of what is on and where. However the waiters were fantastic and the breakfast in the morning was delicious. I really enjoyed the spa which although small was very private and extremely good. I loved the rooms and their layout and as the Havas Airport shuttle was just across the park ( some 25 metres) the whole experience was easy clean and perfect

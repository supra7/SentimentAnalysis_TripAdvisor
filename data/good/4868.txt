My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Opera Roma in July for a total of 7 nights, 5 nights the first stay and then 2 nights the second stay. Both stays were excellent. Rooms: The rooms were both small, but definitely served our needs. There was a mini-fridge with a selection of drinks, a fairly large wardrobe, and a desk for a computer or for reading. There was also a kettle with coffee if desired, and we were able to ask the staff for tea when we wanted. The bed was very comfortable and everything was very clean. The bathroom was also a bit small, but in Europe, hotel rooms are always small. There was a full shower, and the counter wasn't huge, but all in all I have no complaints at all. Location: Simply excellent. Just minutes away from Main Termini, just like advertised, and also very close to Piazza de Republique (where there is also a metro on the red line). It's also very close to Via Nationale, which is a large street in Rome that has a lot of shopping and eateries. Walking in the area was great and it was easy to get on a bus or the metro whenever we wanted. Misc: We got the rooms for what we think was a great deal so we were very happy. Breakfast was included - they served salami/prosciutto, boiled eggs, various pastries, yogurt, coffee/tea/orange juice, and fresh fruit. Definitely more than enough for a great start to the day. Free wireless internet, and there are also a few computers in the lobby in case you need them. The staff were excellent, ESPECIALLY Litu in the front desk - just superb. We didn't have any problems with noise or anything like that. I would definitely stay here again!

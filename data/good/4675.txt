Bought a Sell off vacation last minute deal. There are 2 great benefits of staying at the KBH. The first is the location. Right on the best beach in Hawaii, 5 minute walk up the beach to Black Rock for great snorkelling from shore. The beach itself must be 2 miles of the nicest sand and warmest water you'll find anywhere and absolutely clean. Second, and as important, the staff are great and respond quickly to anything you request. Turn down service daily and free buffet breakfast are just a couple of the unexpected things we were happy to receive. The hotel itself is older and a little outdated, but very well kept and very clean. We ate at the Tiki Terrace one night and weren't dissappointed with our dinners. The restaurant is competitively priced to similar fare in the local restaurants in Lahaina. There is a very nice retail mall about a 2 minute walk from the hotel called Whaler's Village with nice shops and some very good restaurants. Although not as highly rated as the Sheraton next door, or the Westin a couple of hotels down, you're not paying $400 US a night either. For the money the KBH is a great bargain. We will go back.

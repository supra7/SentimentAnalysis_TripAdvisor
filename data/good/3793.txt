El Dorado Maroma is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff. We were well taken care of throughout our stay. Every one of the staff made a point to learn your name and make sure that you were well taken care of whether it was on the beach, or calling for room service. They were always friendly and made sure to say hello. The rooms were nice. We stayed in a Mi Hotelito suite which was a good size, but almost like a regular hotel room you would find. There was a nice balcony with a bed to go out and catch a nice morning breeze and enjoy your breakfast. The beach is beautiful although a little shallow. The food was just mediocre. Definitely would not consider it gourmet. We did suffer a couple of small problems during our stay such as no hot water on one of our nights but the staff was quick to issue and apology and make amends. The internet is basically on again off again but not a problem since of course you are on a beach and shouldn't be too worried about that. It may have been our own fault but we had really built EDM up to be this oasis based off of all the TA reviews we read. It was a nice place but just not what we expected for the price.

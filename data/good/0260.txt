We've stayed at the Inn at the Market before and always loved it. This time we were in town for just one night. The Inn was still as cute and well located as always. But I must admit to feeling that maybe it is a bit overpriced. With the Four Seasons next door now, the Inn has more competition than it used to. I also found the bellman completely unhelpful. But that's probably an aberration. Overall, still nice. But next time we may opt for the FS, whereas in the past the Inn has always been our first choice.

There's nothing particularly special about the Westin. It's a normal looking large hotel, but it's located in a perfect spot in downtown Seattle. The rooms are incredibly spacious , quiet and they have beautiful views of downtown. The beds are VERY comfortable. The room service menu has a wide selection. I would definitely stay here again.

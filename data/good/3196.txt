As you enter this amazing hotel, you will be impressed by the beautiful chandeliers. Reception staff a bit arrogant but courteous enough. My room was just stunning, very roomy and the bed amazing! so comfortable... Ipod system, great sound ! internet is free but i keep getting messages that server was down. A great espresso machine, and it made the best espresso ever... yummy. The bathroom, just incredible, very spacious and with a beautiful large bath, including delicious bath salts for the body and great shampoo and conditioner. Negative/s: in the morning I was waking up by trucks, not sure what they were, maybe rubbish collectors or street cleaning cars... Breakfast, was okay but we thought it was expensive, and quality it was not that great.

Moderately priced hotel room right in the downtown area. Across the street from the Main Public Library which is an architectural gem and within walking distance of Pike Place Market and a lot of other attractions. Nice thing about the hotel is that it is not an anonymous chain. On the down side, the rooms are somewhat smaller and it lacks the amenities of the larger hotels - minibar, etc - but there is a nice cozy feeling about the place.

We normally stay at the Iberostar Grand Playa Paraiso but wanted to try something else and this was a good choice. Not as oppulent as Iberostar but we liked the food better, the staff was very attentive and the grounds were very nice. We're a couple in our late 40's and the place was almost completely newlyweds but we had a great time nonetheless. We booked through AmEx and they were very attentive, too.

I recently came to Seattle for a conference and stayed at the Vintage Park. I was not overly impressed. The location is great and convenient to everything downtown. The restaurant downstairs was excellent, in fact the hotel staff should take customer service lessons from the restaurant manager. Rooms were small and a little dated, but I did get a good laugh from the leopard bathrobes. The nightly wine tasting is a nice touch too. Over all the hotel is nice but just too expensive.

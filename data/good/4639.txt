A wonderful value for this location. Ka'anapali beach is so beautiful that we ended up staying at the hotel and enjoying the beach and pool there far more than we had expected. A very short walk along the beach to black rock for snorkeling. Another short walk the other direction to Whaler's Village for shopping and dining. On-site restaurants are average in quality and high in price (but price is on par with other restaurants in the vicinity). The nightly hula show was very nice -- the performers really seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Our room was in the Kuai wing. A bit dated, but not horribly so. Always clean. Even though we were on the "outside" side of the hotel, we could still see the ocean from our balcony.

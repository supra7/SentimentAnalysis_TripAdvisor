Love the way it is decorated, great art pieces, brilliant door pictures. Quirky little things like not a standard bible but a spiritual menu. Standard rooms are on the small side, deluxe are a nice size. Restaurant next door is also great. Travis the FO Manager has done everything to make us leave happy and happy we were!

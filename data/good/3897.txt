Walking into the Hilton Bayfront you are greeted by a modern, soothing aquatic theme. This property boasts amazing city and bay views and an awesome pool. The good: -friendly staff -good sized rooms -tasteful decor -gorgeous views -comfortable outdoor spaces -great pool The bad: -the bar (overpriced, understaffed, ran out of ingredients for signature drinks) Highly recommended!

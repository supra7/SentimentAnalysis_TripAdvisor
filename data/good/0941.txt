My boyfriend and I stayed here last November, just before Thanksgiving. Not the best time to visit, of course, but i used to live there and wanted to show him what it was like (rain, dark, wind) for me the years I was there. As someone who DID live in seattle, i thought this was the perfect location in between downtown and the financial district, to get a perfect taste of the downtown area. From there, we could walk to Pike Place Market or in the other direction to Pioneer Square. Our room faced the gorgeous architecture of the library. Our room was extemely cozy, but we got a good deal on a package so it was worth every penny. If i'd paid a lot for the room, i would be less pleased. Our room had a door (locked of course) connecting it to another room. The people in the other room were quite loud. And we're not fussy people that need silence or anything. But through the door we could hear them talking and what seemed like a dozen babies of different ages crying and babbling. Not very romantic. BUT! We loved the bed! It was so comfortable, we were inspired to take many naps and someday have a bed just like it in our own house. The linens were amazing, as were the pillows. I would definitely go back to this hotel, and plan to, in a more sunny time of year. Nice that there was a Seattle's Best Coffee shop connected to the lobby.

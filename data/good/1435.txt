The hotel is in a great location to see the sights of downtown Seattle. The customer service is excellent, and the concierges were very helpful in showing us where to go and what to do. The hotel may seem a bit pricey, but you can't expect any less in a downtown setting. We didn't take our meals there, as there were so many exciting places to eat outside the hotel. Most of the places to see where either within walking distance, or within close distance of some type of local transportation. We loved our room, but hated being charged for Internet service. Our view from the room was spectacular - downtown, with a glimpse of the water. Wonderful! We would stay here again, with pleasure.

I am reviewing the Mayflower Park Hotel because my husband and I have had 3 company dinner parties here and have been very pleased with the service. We have used the Green Room (for our first small party of 12), the Plymouth Room (for one of our largest dinner parties) and the Fireside Room (for our cozy Christmas Party). Our guests consistently come back for the parties and favorably commented on the beautiful and ornate decorations, the no-hassle valet parking (which is free!) and the incredible food prepared by Chef Wayne Johnson. This is a wonderful place to host your parties! It is worth the investment and the planning staff works hard to meet all your company needs. The hotel sleeping rooms are also nice. We usually have random drawings at our dinner parties and one of the gifts is a night's stay at the hotel and the winners have consistently expressed their thanks and satisfaction at having been able to stay in the Queen Anne- style rooms. I do look forward to hosting another dinner party here soon. One of the things that the catering manager always assures you is that the decorations and atmosphere will be beautiful and he has been right everytime. It is perhaps one of the most elegant places in Seattle. You will have a wait staff to take care of all your needs during the party- but make sure to request that the staff members be veterans and not new ones (that is, new on the job) because you want the attentiveness to detail that only the seasoned waiters consistently provide. Also they offer a coat check service - but it is best to have one of your employees/assistants to take care of this. Otherwise, everything else is just wonderful!

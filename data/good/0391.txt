After reading reviews I booked with dhr.com & received a surprise when the booking included a free upgrade & breakfast on 35th floor !! Our spacious room was on a corner on the 10th floor with views to 2 different areas of the city. Some of the features were a bit out dated but staff were very helpful. It was an easy shuttle ride from the airport & 10 min walk to downtown.The location is very good to get to most places.The street at the front of the hotel- Senaca St , is very steep down to the harbour, but we walked several times & my husband has difficulty walking but managed it.

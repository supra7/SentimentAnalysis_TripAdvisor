This hotel was very professional and friendly. A staff member, Aricele, treated us with excellent service and a friendly attitude the moment we stepped into the hotel. They accommodated every request we had. The rooms were a good size and the beds were extremely comfortable. No refridgerator in our room though. Since it is next to the convention center, you will notice that the clientele will be largely business people. So if you're going to San Diego for leisure, this is something you might wanna think about. The pool is decent size and includes a walk up bar. The only drawback may be that since it is right on the bay, it can get windy at times. If you're looking to go to a baseball game at Petco Park, all you have to do is take a 5 minute walk across the bridge and you're there. All in all, the location is very convenient to the gaslamp quarter, and a very clean and comfortable hotel.

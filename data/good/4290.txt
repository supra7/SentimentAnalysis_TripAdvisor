The Hyatt Maui has everything you would come to expect from a giant resort hotel. There are numerous restaurants and stores and they recently remodeled the entire spa. The pool is huge! There is a small waterslide near the back and there is plenty of seating available. If you're looking for a beach, the Hyatt does have one. Its about a 10 minute walk up to Kaanapaali Beach. We never ate in the hotel itself, better restraurants in Lahaina, but we did enjoy sunset drinks at the Weeping Banyan bar in the hotel lobby. Its a typical open-air bar with Hawaiian music and great drinks. My wife and I went to the luau that the hotel offered but I would not recommend it. It's around $80/person and its all you can eat/drink but it felt too-Disneylandish. We heard the better luau is Lahaina itself - the old Lahaina Luau. Overall, its a nice hotel with all the typical Hawaiian amenities.

We got a great rate for this Embassy Suites by prepaying on the website. Cheaper than several comparable chain hotels in the area. The room fit us perfectly. We had 6 of us and the two 'boys' crashed on the hide-a-bed which wasn't too bad as hide-a-beds are concerned. The 4 girls all slept in the separate bedroom, the beds were full size at best but nobody complained. The pool was well kept, we went twice. One time it was way too crowded as was the hot tub. The second time (morning) it wasn't used nearly as much. We never did manage to get the sauna to work properly. Location was convenient for our needs. Took in a ballgame, and girls wanted to shop around the renovated Southcenter mall. It was a quick 10 minutes to the ballpark and we miraculously avoided traffic. The location isn't anything special other than convenient. My only gripe was the breakfast. Not the hotel's fault as we were there on a busy weekend but holy cow. A total and complete zoo. The staff worked hard to keep up but it was out of control. If my kids hadn't wanted to eat there so badly I'd have just went and had breakfast elsewhere. Other than the breakfast deal (which is a great bargain, and on regular days I'm sure is great), I'd recommend this property for anyone seeking a functional, convenient and nice/clean property.

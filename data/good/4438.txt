I was nervous because we have never stayed at a place like this but was pleasantly surprised. The free hula and history classes were wonderful, the location was AMAZING, there are great little seating areas in the middle of the complex where you can have a nice picnic dinner, you can walk to fancier places. Great family place and although there is some cheesiness, our kids loved it. Not fancy, not upscale, but very homey and friendly.

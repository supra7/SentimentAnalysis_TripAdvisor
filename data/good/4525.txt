My fiance (now wife) and I just got back on 1-5-10 from a two week stay in Maui at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. We got married at the hotel on their site the Naupaka Lawn at the beach. It was a very serene setting with black rock in the back ground. We were so pleased with their wedding coordinator, Madalene, who helped us arrange our wedding while we were still in RIchmond VA before our trip. She recommended a few ministers and the one we picked was absolutely wonderful. Reverend Laki is incredible and will make your day if you are getting married in Maui. The staff at the hotel were so friendly and hospitable. They really make you feel like you are at home away from home. The hotel is located in Kaanapali, which is very convenient to shopping, etc. in Lahaina. Our room was always cleaned by our excellent room attendant Mi Nan, who was so friendly. The view from the 6th floor in the Maui wing was beautiful, a nice view of the grounds beneath directly out to the ocean. We went to the magic show at the hotel and would highly recommend to everyone to see it. The magician, Jodi, was very funny as well as the magic show. We also ate dinner one night at the hotel restaurant, Tiki Terrace. We were very impressed with the food. I had lobster and my wife had hawaiin beef kabobs. The beach in front of the hotel was always nice and never crowded. Plus, you can walk to black rock in a few minutes, which has excellent snorkeling. Overall, very good value for the money. Would definitely stay there again.

We stayed at the hotel in mid June for 5 nights which was arranged by my wife as a surprise birthday present.The staff presented me with a birthday cake and wine and fruit in our room.Totally unexpected, and really appreciated.the Hotel itself was excellent, and the room was 1st class.the decor was elegant , modern and extremely clean. The staff ,especially the manager, were very courteous and friendly and I would recommend the hotel for its location and general ambiance.

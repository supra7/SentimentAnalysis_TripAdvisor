This was our second time staying here in three years. Near the downtown centre, with a fabulous view of the Space Needle. Online booking revealed no rooms, but a phone call to the property gave us an upgraded room for the price of a regular room. Parking is next door but pricey ($30). In honour of our return visit we were treated to Perrier and baked goods, along with a thank you note. Very classy. The concierge was helpful, saving us money on transportation to the Mariners game ... who knew Seattle had an underground bus system, and it was free to the ballpark? Will stay here again. Some freshening of the common areas and better/cheaper parking are the only reasons this isn't a 5.

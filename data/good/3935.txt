This was our 1st trip to San Diego, and we were not disappointed with the hotel. Except for an oops when we checked in (we were accidentally given a room that was already occupied) we had a great time. The rooms are very comfortable and the view did not disappoint. Easy walking distance across the street to the gaslamp quarter. The hotel itself is reasonably priced but parking is pricey, though probably about average for SD, we paid $26/night for self parking.

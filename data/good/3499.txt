Very nice hotel and great location on Maroma Beach. Enjoyed our 4 night stay at Secrets Maroma Beach and overall I'd recommend the resort to others. Positives: - Service was very good and the staff attitude was very positive with the aim to please. - Great beach. - Food was good but not great . Negatives: - Need more sound proof doors for the ground floor rooms - very noisy - Gym needs to be increased in size by 4x as way too small for a 400 room hotel. - Check in could have gone smoother - waited a bit longer than would expect - Grounds were not as nice as they could have been but we came for the beach and not the lanscaping in the resort. Additional comments: - The mini bars are pretty silly - a can of pringles and a bag of M&Ms. Also while I don't drink vodka, rum or whiskey they had 3 nip bottles for alcohol which is also a bit silly. Of course you can order anything from room service so no big deal. Overall had a good time and for the price the resort is fine.

No doubt I would choose this place again and have recommended this hotel to my friends. The staff members are friendly. Close to subway station and there is a supermarket nearby. Free wifi in rooms and public computers in common area. Daily breakfast included. There is enough to fill you up in the morning, cereals, toasts, yogurt and fruits. Not to mention great coffees. May not be good for business travelers as there was no desk in room, just 2 bedside tables. The room I stayed was small but I didn't mind at all. Nice bathroom.

The two restaurants open at lunch time (World Cafe and Seaside Grill) do not permit bathing suits, despite one of them (Seaside Grill) being right next to the main pool. The maitre'd, not realizing I am a native and fluent Spanish speaker, kept insisting to the hostess in Spanish that we had wet bathing suits when we asked to be seated at the restaurant for lunch (we did not). I think the resort should revisit this policy and perhaps simply remove the seat cushions (which are not attached) for lunch time or use different chairs altogether. People lounging pool or beach-side don't really want to go back to their room and change just to go eat lunch, only to change again to go back to the water. There IS the barefoot grill option if one wants to select from a very limited number of grill and buffet items and take them to your pool chair. Other than that one annoyance, the resort itself is great, on a wonderful beach with great pools, manicured lawns and gardens, and lots of attention to detail.

Typical large chain hotel but very comfortable room with good ensuite bathroom and excellent views over Seattle. Hotel is centrally located within easy walking distance of shops etc. Dining room is large and impressive but I don't like the American policy, which is catching on in Europe too, of having to pay extra for breakfast, especially when it is buffet style and you have to go and serve yourself.

3 of us stayed 3 nights at the Vintage Park. Wouldn't hesitate to do it again. ++ Great location within walking distance of top shopping and Pike's Place Market. Around the corner from W hotel and Hotel Monaco. 1 block to Seattle's Finest coffee and Starbucks. Across from spectacular new public libary (for architecture geeks like me.) Friendly environment. Excellent front desk, valet parking and concierge. Our concierge, Francesca, never erred in her recommnedations: Brooklyn for oysters/cocktails; Cafe Compagne for brunch; Dahlia Lounge for dinner; drive to UDub and Asian Art Museum. All very fun. Wine tasting at 5 pm a nice treat in front of the fireplace. Rooms: large with 2 double beds plus foldout couch. Small bath. Restaurant: Tulio's is fine but just ok. Less than I expected. Bar is small, friendly with excellent beers and scotch selection. No fitness facility is a problem. No problem staying here again.

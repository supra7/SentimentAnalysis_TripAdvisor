I like to work out and because this hotel is enormous I thought the gym will be nice, believe me, the rooms are big and comfortable but the GYM is SMALER than a guest room. There is an area separate to do cardio that is bigger but is only for cardio: to lift wights is an area smaller than a guest room. Is the only thing I didn't like about this huge hotel; ah! and the pool is small too and ugly. But the guest rooms and beds are very nice! Make sure u don't get a room facing the other towel.

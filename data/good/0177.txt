I stayed for two nights and was generally pleased. I selected this hotel because the rates are very reasonable, they are on the Grayline Airporter route for convenient ground travel, and they have smoking rooms. The staff was all very pleasant and helpful. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. The only downside for me was the walk from the Monorail station back to the hotel after dark, which is not the hotel's fault. It's not well-lit and goes through some marginal blocks on the fringes of downtown.

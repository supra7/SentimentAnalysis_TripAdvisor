This is a beautiful well maintained hotel with nice rooms. The staff is professional, but a bit cool. It has a nice view, but it is at the end of the convention center district and bit of a schlepp walk to the Gaslamp - or anything else. They are building a pedestrian overpass that will connect the hotel to Petco park which stood help with this problem. Also, there is no breakfast for HHonors elites, they give you a coupon for the Starbucks on the ground level. In addition to the Starbucks, there is also a Fox Sports Grill on the property. There are several restaurants that are part of the Hotel, but I ate at a catered dinner in one of the ballrooms and it was so bad, I have never again braved the food prepared by the hotel.

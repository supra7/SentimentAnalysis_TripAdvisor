This hotel is in a great location however you may not have the greatest view. Our room had a partial view of the Coronado Bridge which was nice but also a bigger view of the truck yard .The room was clean but very small and basic. No refrigerator and no microwave. Since I was there for a convention the rate was cheap enough but if I had not had a special rate it would have been about 350 per night and it definately was not worth that.The location was good with access to a nice walking area along the bay and not far from the Gas Lamp District and across from the Petco Stadium. The staff was very,very nice and welcoming.

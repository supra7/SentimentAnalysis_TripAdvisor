I travel to Seattle frequently for business and typically stay at the Westin. I decided to try out the Sheraton this time around. The hotel has a nice lobby and the rooms are decent. The main reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars is the location and club lounge. The hotel is within walking distance of many great restaurants and shops. Being an SPG Platinum member, I was put on a club floor and had access to the club lounge. I believe Gold members get access to the club lounge as well. The club lounge had complimentary breakfast and hors d'oeuvres (chocolate covered strawberries, several hot appetizers, cheese, crackers, vegetables) in the later afternoon/early evening. The lounge also has a great view and is great place to relax or do some work on the laptop. I will be definitely switching to the Sheraton when I travel back to Seattle.

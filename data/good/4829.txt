It's a small hotel located in a good place which has a bus stop right close to the door.I always take Bus 21 or 131 to go to the nearest MRT station NOVENA.It only takes me 10 mins. There is a modern hawker stall in the other side and providing lots of delicious foods. Hotel room is small but clean enough.There is no laundry service in the hotel,however you can ask the reception to recommend you some other laundry service.They always are friendly. I think I will go to this hotel again.

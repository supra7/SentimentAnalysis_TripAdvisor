All the previous reviews are correct- the rooms are 'cool' but tiny and hotel offers no creature comforts; bathroom (nothing beyond soap & shampoo etc, paper cups), very basic breakfast (on paper plates), we took our own bags up etc. However the hotel was the best value I could find in the area. The subway is metres away, round the corner bars that are opened till late (cool east village types), the main strip of Broadway shops is 5 mins walk (chainstores: zara, topshop, h&m etc) soho is about 6 mins away (where I preferred; you get the unique boutiques, cafes, Lomardi's- best NY pizza, MoMa design store) I wish I found how close it was earlier! You have to walk through some barren areas first, but like most of this area it's part of the charm. The area was perfect for what we wanted out of new York for the 4 nights (catching up with friends in nearby bars/restaurants, shopping). The city is huge and it is best to pick 1 area and explore it well. I was told by our friend in NY that the room size is pretty much standard for the price & area but a few more creature comforts would have made up for it. If you want to be closer to all the sites perhaps midtown is better, but we enjoyed the culture that this area has.

The hotel is tucked away down a side street near the Metro Station and Al Ghurair Shopping Centre and within easy distance to the Airport. The staff were cooperative and friendly and ensured that our needs were met with no fuss. The hotel is rated as a 2 star by the Dubai rating agency but would easily meet 3+ Star status in another country. There is a swimming pool and other facilities available in the hotel which would not be normally available in a 2 star hotel. The area is close to a mosque and among a lot of low rent apartments so there are a lot of workers moving along the streets during the day & night. The hotel is a good hotel to use for a transit stop or weekend in Dubai although car parking would be an issue if you were driving there.

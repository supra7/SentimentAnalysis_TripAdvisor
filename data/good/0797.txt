My husband and I stayed at the Moore for 3 nights while attending a professional conference in Seattle. The hotel lobby is pretty spartan, but the front desk staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay. There is one free internet terminal in the lobby, but we did not use it. Unlike many similar hotels I've stayed in, the elevator at the Moore is modern and pretty speedy, though small. Our 7th floor room (714 - single queen bed) was clean and comfortable, with a nice view of Puget Sound over the rooftops of neighboring buildings. We enjoyed watching the ferries come and go. Amenities were minimal (no clock in the room, no toiletries beyond basic soap, poor TV reception) but we felt safe and comfortable for our entire stay. The building has been renovated, but historic touches, like original solid wood doors and old-fashioned brass keys, remain. Lack of water pressure and temperature regulation in the shower are my biggest complaints. We didn't have any problems with noise. The location was excellent; within easy walking distance of the convention center and major hotels where our conference was located and major attractions such as Pike Place Market. The neighborhood felt reasonably safe. We arrived by train and found it easy to hop on a city bus that took us almost to the door of the hotel. The bus ride was free because it was within Seattle's downtown "fareless" area. Overall, we were very satisfied with the Moore.

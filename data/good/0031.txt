From the Monaco you can walk everywhere easily in downtown Seattle. It is also very near the LINK train to go to and from the airport (for those with minimal luggage). The front office staff is very helpful and eager to please. One downside... the computers in the business center downstairs are not "free" for those of you who did not bring a laptop. A bit disappointing considering this is very nearly a "given" at most hotels these days.

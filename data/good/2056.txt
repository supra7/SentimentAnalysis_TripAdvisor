I stayed at the Westin Seattle for 5 days last fall. I booked the trip plus flight through Expedia. I have a thing about clean sheets and always carry along a pair of my own. I specifically booked the Westin because of a friend's recommendations and wasn't disappointed. The sheets looked clean and were changed every day. The view from my room overlooked Elliot Bay directly in front of me, a little to the right of construction in one building, and the Space Needle to my right. I got some great pictures during sunrise and sunset. Westin Seattle is a convenient 5 minute or so walk to Pike Place Market and restaurants. Do not eat at the cafe if you can help it, the food (though good) is ridiculously expensive. I didn't get to try Coldwater Creek but plan to on my next stay this june. My only gripe is that one of the ladies at the lobby desk offered to mail my postcards for me (I'd stamped them and everything) and when I checked with the addressees, they never got them.

My company books this hotel. The rooms are quite small but immacutely clean. There is a coffee maker . I think there is only one ice machine, which was located on the 3rd floor. This is not acceptable in a 20 floor hotel.(my only real complaint) The elevators run pretty quickly. The heating and air conditioning unit worked nicely. This hotel is in a great location.Let me reiterate ,THE LOCATION ROCKS !!!!!! You are near Macys, Nordstroms, Borders,Barnes and Nobles, 2 movie mutiplexes and the Westlake Center( great food court and shopping). Pike's Market is a very short walk from the hotel as well as many eateries, restaurants, etc. This is the best location my company has used for Seattle.

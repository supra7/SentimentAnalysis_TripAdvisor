I was pleased with our room at Parc Suites. Although smaller than I thought it would be, it was certainly not too small, even for my husband and I, our two children (1 and 3 yrs), and my father. It was very clean and we found the bed comfortable. My three year old and father shared the pull out couch, and while my son and his toys were quite comfortable, my father did mentioned that he had to position himself around the support bar in order to get comfortable. I would suggest replacing the pull out or offering guests a thick mattress pad to add to the mattress. We loved having the kitchenette in the room, which was very convenient for breakfast since a grocery store was nearby. The only negatives are that the convenient store next to the hotel seems to be the local drunk hangout, which can be disconcerting when walking around it to get to the free parking behind the hotel. Also, there is no elevator, which, before we decided to leave it in the trunk of the car, made using our double stroller a little bit of a hassle. However, the staff was always more than willing to help us, which was nice. I would stay here again and would recommend it to others.

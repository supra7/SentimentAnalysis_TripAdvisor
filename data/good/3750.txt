Stayed here to attend a football game. The location could not have been better. Fans gather here for pre game eats and then across the street to the stadium. Zoo, park and downtown are all with in short walk. The pool and hot tub were clean and convenient. Only problem was one elevator broke leaving only one operational for the stay which made for long waits. Bus from airport ($7) drops you and picks up right across the street from the hotels enterance.

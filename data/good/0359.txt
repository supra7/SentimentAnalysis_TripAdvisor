I am writing this review as I feel compelled to let everyone know that this hotel is exceptional for the price. I booked through a 3rd party, one of those deals that you dont know where you are staying until you have paid. The Crowne Plaza Seattle was a delight to deal with. Once I had booked online I called and spoke to a gentleman call Dontay, he was polite, helpful and attentive. He answering all my questions and reassured me that my reservation had been received. Upon check in we were greeted by Paul, he was very friendly, helpful and was kind enough to give us an upgrade to a bigger room with a view of the Space needle. After the exceptional service that we received At the Crowne Plaza Seattle I would highly recommend this hotel for any one either on business or away on a weekend with friends. Overall: Clean, comfortable, happy staff from the desk to the housekeepers. My only down point is that there was no hot tub I will definitely stay again :)

Enjoyed a nice stay for a convention. Pluses, nicely decorated rooms, high definition plasma television, nice shampoos and conditioners. Opportunities for improvement: didn't understand the green policy as some towels I left on the hook were changed. Others that I left off the hook were not changed. Sometimes I had 3 sets of towels, sometimes 2 sets. I found it a little odd that in the capitol of coffee, there wasn't a coffee stand available in the hotel. The closest Starbucks was a half block away at the Hyatt. Why one couldn't be made available in the hotel was a little odd. One inconvenience was that the work out room was being renovated and not available during my stay. If you are attending a meeting at the convention center, the Sheraton is directly across the street, but many other hotels are extremely short walks and less expensive. I'd probably recommend another hotel as the amenities were really nothing to write home about and the hotel is more costly.

We traveled to Seattle for a conference. I have stayed in the city many times, but never at the Vintage Park. We truly enjoyed our stay! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We met many fellow travelers at the wine tasting in the lobby, which was a bonus. One of our party needed to connect with someone in the Pioneer Square area and we were close to that was well as a short walk to Pike's Market and the major shopping areas. Our room was spacious and comfortable. I have stayed at several Kimptons and have not had a negative experience!

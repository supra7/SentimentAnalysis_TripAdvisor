I just returned from the Hilton where I stayed as part of my company's global sales conference. My overall rating for this property is "Excellent." (I use four star reviews to reflect great stays that are not at world-class, luxury levels.). The rooms are really nice. Totally new feel, comfortable beds, very functional (not mega-luxury by any means, but very satisfying. The common areas are very nice as well. We used two levels of the convention space and the property feels new and works very well for large-scale conferences. Convention food was fine. I don't think that you can review a hotel based on serving 900 people. It's just not a fair comparison. One note of precaution... We often travel with our kids to San Diego for vacation (this was not one of those trips), but I would not recommend this property for a trip with children. While there is harbor access, there is no beach access. The location is central to many attractions, the property itself is somewhat landlocked by access roads. But if this is a business trip -- particularly one where you need access to the convention center and would like easy walking distance to both the ball park and Gas Lamp District, the Hilton is an outstanding choice.

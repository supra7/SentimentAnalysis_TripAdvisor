We booked our trip via Jetsetter. We've been to Playa before & stayed @ the Banyan Tree Mayakoba. Obviously it's not the BT, but we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless. It's a great value for a charming boutique hotel that's quiet, relaxing and romantic. The food was great & reasonably priced. The staff was very kind. If you're into tacky large resorts, bad all inclusive food, annoying guest....this place is NOT for you.

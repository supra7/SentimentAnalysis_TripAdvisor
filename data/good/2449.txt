Just returned from a 5 night stay at the W Seattle and really enjoyed my time there. Like all W Hotels, the lobby decor is trendy, dark, and moody. Our room was large, with nice city views, a,super-comfy bed, and a big bathroom stocked with fabulous Bliss products (the best part about staying in a W Hotel if you ask me!). There were some really nice features of the hotel, like the cozy lobby with big fireplace, free hot chocolate, a tiny gym, and a great bar. This hotel is also well-located, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square, and literally next door to shopping. Service was friendly and helpful. My only complaint was the exorbitantly high cost of extras--including the internet, valet parking, and food. There was free Wi-Fi in the lobby, but this is less than ideal for business travellers. Overall, though, I really enjoyed the W and would stay there if I find myself in Seattle in the future.

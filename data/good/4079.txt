Just came back yesterday, rooms were ok, very little drawer space could not unpack as not enough space. Honor bar took up way too much usable space. Undergoing renovations in the lobby, which we were told were emergency repairs but then one of the valets said it wasn't going to start for 2-3 weeks, which is not an emergency in my book. Hotel definitely has wear and tear issues. Had fantastic oceanfront room and view was spectacular dead center in front of main pool in Atrium section. Breakfast buffet was excellent though and service top notch. Self parking was a long walk. Valet service was excellent.

We came to San Diego from NYC to celebrate our 5th Anniversary and my wife's pregnancy (first child - 7 months pregnant), and I have some positives and some negatives: Positives: 1) Nice, new hotel, within 10 minute walk of Gaslamp Quarter 2) Due to us being Hilton Gold, we were upgraded to a nice room overlooking bay and Petco Park. Beautiful view. 3) Due to us being Hilton Gold, we were given a free food and drink item each day from Starbucks. We kept kosher, so Starbucks allowed us to get 2 free drinks each day. Also, because we kept kosher, the hotel had also given us a free food item from a restaurant in the hotel, which they also allowed us to exchange for Stabucks credit. 4) New pool was really nice and modern, and overlooked the bay. Negatives: 1) $25 a day parking. Way too high in my opinion, and no alternative in the area. 2) We reserved a king bed, but when we got there they said they were all sold out due to a convention, and only had 2 Queens. No choice at that time but to accept. Wish they had told me earlier. 3) Walk to Gaslamp quarter has a lot of homeless people, and we did not feel so safe walking it. Maybe once the bridge is finished. Overall is was a nice stay and we would stay there again given the right price. Any questions, please email me at yoshapman@hotmail.com

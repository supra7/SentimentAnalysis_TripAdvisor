Be prepared, there are airplane bathrooms that are larger than the bathrooms in this hotel. However, it could not be beat for location and value. By far the best priced for the quality in the area. Perfect for the traveler that has a short time and needs to cram in plenty. Walking to everything touristy was super easy and lots of great choices for restaurants/bars in the area. Simple, free WiFi, clean and comfortable enough for the smaller accommodations. No easy access to the elevators from main level entrance either.

The hotel was nice but the rooms and bathrooms are tiny. There wasnt a mini bar but the hotel offered to bring a mini fridge at no charge. Our room (471) over looked the pool area. The only drawback is that voices echo in the pool area and it can get a bit loud in the room but thankfully the pool was only used one afternoon while we were there. No free WiFi in the room. In this day and age, that should be free in every room. You could get free WiFi in the lobby. The staff was nice and helpful. They printed off directions for us anytime we asked. They helped me get connected to the free WiFi in the lobby and called me when I left my coat in the restaurant. We ate lunch and breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The lunch was great. The breakfast was not. Overall, if I had to stay at the Seattle Airport again I would stay at the Marriott.

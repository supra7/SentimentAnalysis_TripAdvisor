When we arrived we were told we would have to come back at 3pm as our room wasnt ready. No big problem as the Warwick is so close to the shops and many restaurants that we could easily fill the time. They took care of our bags and had them delivered up to the room. Bit of confusion as we booked with expedia which included free brekfast every morning. The warwick had no record of this but the manager happily obliged and gave us breakfast vouchers. They were good for almost $19 and could be used for anything on their breakfast menu in the restaurant. So we were not restricted to just the usual continental breakfast. The restaurant is really nice and the staff very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and there is also a lovely bar area which is very nice to sit and relax in. We decided not to pay for the space needle view and probably wish now that we had. Lovely to have a balcony but ours was just above the car park. However, it was no big problem as there was very rarely anyone parked there and if you did not look down it wasnt a problem! The room itself was a good size and had a big queen bed. Strange layout with the bath and toilet in the bathroom and a sink and dresser area opposite, but nice. In room safe, mini fridge, hairdryer and tv all good although the air conditioning was very loud and quite annoying. We were lucky we didnt need it on. The pool was nice and clean, but i felt it a little scary to go down to by mysef as its in the basement and the pool area is dimly lit!There were very few people around. The Location as mentioned was brilliant and everywhere in Seattle is pretty much within walking distance - especially the shopping area, space needle and pike place market. I would definitly consider staying at the Warwick again and am a little shocked by some of the bad reviews. We enjoyed our stay and found it to be a really nice, comfortable, clean hotel.

This hotel is right next to the Trevi fountain, down one of the main streets off the square. The downside of this is, if you get a taxi from the airport, it can't quite get to the hotel! However, not a big deal. The hotel itself is quiet, clean and has a fairly luxurious feel to it. Our room was on the top floor, and although it was very small there was adequate space for a city break. The bed was very comfy, there was enough wardrobe space (although very few coat hangers!) and despite what some other travellers have written, our bathroom was lovely if prone to flooding when the shower was used. It was extremely peaceful despite its central location which was great. Breakfast is in the basement, get there early to get a table (we had to wait a while one morning). the choice is what I'd expect in a central European hotel - lots of different hams and salamis, some cheese, bread, yoghurt and a small seletion of fruit.

Stayed here for the Maui Marathon. We got a free room upgrade without asking. The staff were all very nice and helpful. We loved the large lawn surrounding the pool and noticed that many local families (perhaps relatives of employees) enjoyed it too, which gave it more of a park-like atmosphere than a typical resort.

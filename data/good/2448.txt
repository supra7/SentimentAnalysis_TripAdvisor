I booked a great on-line rate for the W Seattle for a weekend in March and then got nervous when I read the reviews here. I'm happy to report that our stay was a positive experience. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable (though terminally trendy), and we had a great view over the downtown area. Parking was a bit pricy, but that's what you get at a high end hotel in a downtown area when there's no other options. I'd stay again.

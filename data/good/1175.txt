This was the perfect location for my meeting at the Seattle convention center. The room was nice and reasonably quiet. However there were 2 problems that I encountered: 1) The gym was exceptionally crowded each time I went. There were always lines for equipment and some items were out of service. 2) The stairwells were filthy, though one did get cleaned when I complained. I was surprised as Seattle seems to encourage people to be green, use stairs, compost, etc. The stairwells had many cigarette butts, beer bottles, candy, chips, razor blades with white powder, and sticky substances which made the walk unpleasant.

This hotel has a beautiful lobby/entrance and pool area. Our room was nice as well. This hotel is situated right on the bay, at the end of the walkway/boardwalk. You are able to walk all the way from this hotel, past the marina into the village seaport. If you are going to a Padres game, it's a short walk to the stadium right over a walkway bridge. The staff was very pleasant and always willing to help and give advice. One day we felt like just relaxing, since it was vacation...and lounging by the pool was perfect... Good to know there is an enterprise car rental associate right in the building! Enjoy!

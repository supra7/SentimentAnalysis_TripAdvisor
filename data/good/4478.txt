We just got back from an eleven-night stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel in west Maui. We're not impossibly picky, but at the same time know a gem from a dud. This is definitely a gem. Perfectly situated right on western Maui's most beautiful stretch of beach, the KBH is neither opulent nor extravagant. What it is is clean, comfortable, friendly, full-featured, and quite frankly your best bang for your buck. I'll be posting more in the future (just got back!), with lots of detail, but for now just know that you can't go wrong here...

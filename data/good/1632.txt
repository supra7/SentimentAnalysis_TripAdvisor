This hotel was pretty good - the best thing is the size of the rooms: they really are very spacious, with a separate, large closet area, and also a kitchenette area. You're right in the heart of downtown and can walk pretty much everywhere in the centre/Capitol Hill. Reception staff were a little bit snippish, but nothing too bad. The hotel restaurant - I can't remember the name now, but right off the lobby - served good breakfast and the staff there were v friendly and helpful. All in all the experience was good!

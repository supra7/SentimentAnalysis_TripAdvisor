We have been coming back 4 out of the last 5 years and the only year we did not we took a cruise and missed Maui. From magical Ruby who gets us our unit every year, the maids, maintenance guys, gardeners, cabana crew, our friends from Seal Beach, and Pam who stocks our unit before we get there from the Eldorado Store. Thanks! A couple of musts! Happy hour and music at Hula's. Good reasonable take out from CJ's and China Bowel. Whale watching in season. Long walks on the Kaanapali Beach Walk. Golfing Kaanapali courses. Snorkling at Black Rock. This is our Maui and we thank all that make it special year after year. .

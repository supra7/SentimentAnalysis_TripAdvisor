Nice airport hotel. Front desk staff is (almost always) friendly & helpful. Tower rooms are great - spring for a corner king with huge wrap-around deck. Rooms are very comfy with nice amenities. HBO is free. Typical for Seattle Airport, they charge for parking if you have a car. Want a drink? You may want to bring your own -- service can be spotty in the lounge. Long waits appear to be the norm even when not that busy. Good sized outdoor pool & hot tub. Suites are very nice & have oversized showers & deep soaking tubs (no jetted tubs though). If you're HiltonHonors Gold internet is free; otherwise they charge except in the public lobby area.

This hotel is NICE , i went there for a performance buisnees trip , arrived after a 15 hour plane trip , really needed my rest before my show , they did not have the room i was booked in on the 9th floor ready so they offered me a room in the 2nd floor , i was told i could change it in 2 hours if i did not like it.Very friendly Staff. I accepted it , the room did not have a view but was very quiet so it was perfect for me , the bed was so nice!! just like the pillows , the minbar was extremely expensive but well worth it as it had an amazing amount of choices ...Minibars are always expensive anyways!The bathrooms are small but also nice that the toilett is separated to the bathroom , bath products are also great .. my only complain the AC was very near the bed and was very noisy , i did turn it off but the noise continued , it was white noise so not so much of a problem , but i did not understand why when turning off the machine still sounded ... the decoration of the hotel is also nice , is modern and perfect for artists on the road or young -middle aged modern couples.. My friends had sushi and drinks and they rated them quite high as well.. Recommended!

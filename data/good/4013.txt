Spent 4 days in this hotel recently.. The hotel is very nice . Nice design, very good service. Everybody is very kind and helpful. Spent 4 wonderful days there with another person...On the negative side i would just point out taht the rooms are not so big as hoped and that we had to keep the curtains down almost all the time in order not to have people looking into our room. For sure there will be other rooms that allow you more privacy, so i guess we were a ittle unlucky under that aspect... But all in all, i would recommend the hotel, especially if you can find a good deal....

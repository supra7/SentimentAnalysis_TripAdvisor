We went to Secrets Maroma from Dec 2nd to Dec 9th. The overall experience was wonderful! We stayed in building 14, which is called partial ocean view, but you really cannot see past the pool from any of the buildings closest to the main building. The room was beautiful and very clean. The housekeepers came twice a day and did an amazing job. The balcony was great for sitting out in the evenings but a swim out suit would have been good for early mornings or for afternoons right after lunch when you did not want to trek down to the beach. We spent almost all of our time at the beach however and loved it. It was really quiet and so relaxing. The water was so clean and the sand so soft. We only went to the pool in the afternoons around 4pm to get our Mango Tango drinks from Jamie. We thought the loungers at the pool were not as comfortable as the beach. There were some activities throughout the day...my husband and I did a kayak tour, played beach volleyball, soccer. We also took advantage of the tennis courts, which were open to all guests. The breakfasts and lunches at the world cafe were the best meals of the day. The main reason that I didn't give the resort 5 stars was because we were not that impressed with the dinner and alcohol selection. We ate at all of the places except for the Mexican and all were ok. My least favorite was the French. I would not have been satisfied if we paid full price. The service was exceptional. We came to relax and spend time together and we did just that. Secrets Maroma was so relaxing that we lost track of the days and came home rested and happy! I would definitely recommend the resort to anyone wanting to get away and to be pampered by the great service and hospitality offered at Secrets Maroma!

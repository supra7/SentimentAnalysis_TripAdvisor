I have to say that I disagree with the review comparing the Westin to the Hyatt. I stayed at the Westin on my Honeymoon 15 years ago when it was fairly new and while I enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it was spectacular either. It was done on the same grand scale as the Hyatt but in much smaller quarters (i.e. less land). For my 10th anniversary we returned with our son but stayed at the Hyatt this time and totaly loved it. That was in 2000. In 2003 we returned to Maui with our son but decided to go back and try the Westin again. After one night we all woke up in the morning missing the Hyatt. I called the Hyatt and they got me into the hotel and we moved that morning. The beach in front of the Westin had suffered tremendous errosion that year and was virtually non-existant. While the Westin did have all the nice features like the pools and slides, everything was crammed into a smaller space and you just felt like you couldn't breath without someone right there. Granted, the Hyatt can be very crowded as well around the pool but the grounds are big enough that you can escape if you need too. The Westin used to have a beautiful restaurant comparable to Swan Court in the Hyatt but now it's been replaced by Tropica and it's more of a beachfront casual place than upscale. All in all, the Westin is a nice place but the Hyatt sets the standard. Needless to say that this coming August I'll be returning to the Hyatt again.

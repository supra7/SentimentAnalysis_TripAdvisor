We just got back from Seattle. We stayed at the Westin Hotel in Downtown Seattle for 5 days. We booked our hotel through priceline. We were very pleasently surprised. Great hotel service from the front desk to the parking valets. The bed was great,room was clean. The carpeting needs a little update and cleaning. Service was very good. Would gladly stay again

I stayed at the Warwick with some girlfriends while I was in town for a weekend wedding. The hotel is very nice and the front desk clerks are very helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a great location: right across the street from a Ralph's Market which has plenty of champagne; a 7 - 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market; close to some great restaurants (Local 360, Serious Pie, Lola) and right next to a cool old cinema (which I didn't go to). The rooms are comfortable and well equipped with nice glasses to drink from and plenty of them. I have no complaints about anything having to do with the room. My main complaint is the horrible room service food (not the guy who actually brought it up, he was very nice). We ordered breakfast in our room both mornings (Sunday and Monday) and the food was not only bland, badly cooked, and cold but both mornings they messed up the order. The last morning I ordered one of their special omelets that comes with mushrooms and cheese and my omelet came without the cheese! That's ridiculous! They did offer to make me a new one but as I had to catch a plane I didn't have a time so I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, literally. Because there are so many great restaurants in the area I'm sure you can find another place to eat breakfast, but if you're on a schedule and don't have time to spend leisurely finding a good breakfast joint, you're going to have to suffer through the room service. Sorry and good luck! I slept on the sleeper sofa which was terrible and why I gave them a 3 for sleep quality. I didn't hear my friends complain about the bed so I assume they were fine.

Pleasant surprise as this was booked through travel office for business. Had an early morning flight to catch so was put up for the night here. Very nice room and comfy bed. Easy to get to and easy to get back and forth from rental car agency to airport/hotel. No airport noise that I heard. Room service was very good, not quite as pricey as I'm used to, appetizer, meal, tip, tax, and service charge made it just over $30. Only complaint was crappy view but it being only one evening it was no big deal. Easy to get downtown on mass transit if you so desire. I'd stay again!

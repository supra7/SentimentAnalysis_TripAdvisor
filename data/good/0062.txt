My wife and I stayed here in March 2011. We enjoyed the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions. We like the free wine tasting. The room was comfortable but a bit small. The staff did an excellent job of accommodating our request for a view. We had a view South down 4th Street. I do not think any rooms have views except of the high rises around the hotel. We ate at Sazerac Restaurant in the Hotel. They had a four course meal for a very reasonable price. We were full by the third course and had the last desert course sent up to our room. The hotel staff and Restaurant staff were very nice about it. My only real criticism was the small fridge was chock full of mini-bar treats and parking costs forty plus dollars per day. We had no room for the delicacies we bought at nearby Pike Market. So I pulled out all the little bottles of Jim Beam and put my stuff in the fridge only to reverse the process at check out. I suspect everyone that stays at the hotel does the same thing.

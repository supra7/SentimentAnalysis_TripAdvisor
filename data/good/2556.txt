We drove down from Vancouver to do some Christmas shopping and found the Max within close walking distance of the downtown Seattle shopping areas; no problem to get back to our room with bags a few times during the day. The rooms are small but very well decorated. The bed is fantastically comfortable with cotton sheets and bathroom good. The area is quiet at night but close to several very good restaurants and just a few blocks from Pikes place. We didn't realise there is free Valet parking at first; a great convienience since you don't really need your car to explore downtown Seattle.

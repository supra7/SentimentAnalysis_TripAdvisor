The hotel location is excellent especially if you like to visit Chinatown, Little Italy, Soho, Greenwich Village and etc. There were also good bars and restaurants very near. Didn't feel unsafe or anything like that by the surrounding area. Subway was around the corner and the excellent Katz's Deli. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast which was included was well enough too. The room was small and the bathroom quite big compared to the room size. It was still well enough for our use. We did miss a proper closet space though as the only closet we had was full from our two coats. A coat rack could be useful. Our room was situated on the second floor but the noise from the street didn't bother us at all. Slept like babies. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

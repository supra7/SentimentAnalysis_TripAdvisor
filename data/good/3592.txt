Well we definitely agree with the good things . . . the beach was beautiful, warm towels plentiful, food was generous, bar fabulous, (I've never tasted so many delicious drinks!!) and above all . . . the service was wonderful! The road and the mosquitos are an issue, as is reception and management. They promise you a rose garden and give you a few thorns before you are satisfied. After promising us an upgrade, which by the way we were entitled to all along, we finally got to stay in an oceanview room the last 2 nights. And it was gorgeous! Not very nice treatment for honeymooners. However, the adorable, sweet coincerge, Makelia, building 24,comforted us daily and made it worthwile.( as did Rosy when we moved to her bldg. 26.) Great service. It was my birthday, and when we returned to the room after spending the day at the beach, there were ballooons, cake, champagne, and love birds (shaped in towels). How fabulous! I was disappointed with the quality of the spa personnel. The attendants in the ladies locker room did not speak English and my chocolate treatment for $150 was not good at all. There was no hot water in the shower, so I had to rinse off the product with COLD water. Freezing! The lady who gave me the treatment was not of high caliber at all. The water was cold in the jacuzzi, etc. They definitely need to kick it up a notch in the spa, which is just beautiful, if run smoothly. The entertainment crew is a bit much for those of us who wish to relax and listen to soothing music. I had to beg for quiet often times when they were blasting classic rock at poolside. Suggestion: keep the tumult separate if possible from the guests requesting peace. We would return, but only by invitation when they get the kinks out. Eric is trying very hard to do that . . . I think.

Booked last minute as recommended by a friend. Great hotel, all inclusive but much better than any alll inclusive previously experienced. Fantastic breakfast and lunch at the World Cafe. Lots of options for place to eat, Portofino & Himitsu stand out with good food but other spots not so great. Excellent staff who are warm, friendly and most cannot do enough for you. Only negative were, hotel was very busy, days by the pool were very noisy with loud music, lots of activity and 'bar' atmosphere - we were very happy on the beach which was great so were able to get away from the noise. Checkout was a bit of a nightmare as we had a late flight but checkout at 1pm, there was a room use but only half hour slots so only time for a quick shower and change.

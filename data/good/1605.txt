We stayed 5 nights in this hotel. The room size is ok. The bathroom a bit small, but there is enough space to place your things. We wished to have more space for our two suitcases. It is a bit noisy, but Seattle is a city with many streets. We tried the restaurant once and enjoyed our dinner. The location is good, not too far from the Space Needle. We liked the decor of the lobby, especially the fireplace. The small disappointment was when we checked out. First of all the wake up call came 15 minutes too late. Futhermore we were recommended to take a town car to the airport which would only be a few dollars more than a normal taxi and much more comfortable. However, at the end we paid 20 dollars more than confirmed at the reception desk. We informed the hotel about this price difference. I'm sure that future guests would be grateful to get a correct price information. Until today we have not received any comment from the hotel.

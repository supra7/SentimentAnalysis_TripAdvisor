We got back yesterday after spending 5 days for our honeymoon. At first we were dissapointed as our travel agent had set us up for early arrival and an ocean front room and we couldn't get into our room till 2:00 and then it was not ocean front, but faced another building (Mi Hotelito room 1124). After voicing our displeasure, the staff said they'd see what they could do and the next day we were moved to room 1024 which was oceanfront. The rooms were very nice and extremely comfortable, we really enjoyed the in-room spa's and being able to take a bubble bath together before dinner was awesome! The food at the restaurants was good and once again, the staff was amazing! The pool was clean, un-crowded and quiet! Quite a change from the other resort we had stayed at a few years earlier. Yes, they were under construction in a new center section, but it was being completed yesterday and as a contractor myself, I didn't mind the sound as it means $$$ to me! The finished product is amazing, well designed and the rooms are awesome. The final and most pleasent surprise for me being a fisherman was walking out to the flats out back and finding it loaded with Bonefish! And not small ones either! I caught about 8 with the average weight about 5 lbs! They were around all day long though a little skittish in the afternoons with all the swimmers, but once again, awesome! When the manager, Jose and one of the owner's Mr. Lugo stopped by to say hello and I told him what I was catching they were shocked! Guess no one paid attention... Overall, we began our trip saying we'd never go back but after taking it all in and the friendliness of the staff, I'll try and make this trip every few years if my wife will let us!

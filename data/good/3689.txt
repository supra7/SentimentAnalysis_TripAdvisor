Last minute trip to Rome for New Year's. Had a single room, small, but had everything I needed and was cleaned and re-stocked every day. The location of the hotel can not be beat, it is literally 50 steps to the Trevi Fountain. Walk out the door and there are places to eat, shops. Room had a fridge for drinks and snacks. Easy to walk to everything from here. The breakfast had a good selection, ask for an espresso - it's better than the machine. Everyone was smiling and helpful. It is a tiny hotel and they've made everything fit but I will definitely go back.

One free cookie per person when check in. No free internet for the room. There are 3 free public internet desktop computers. One break down but the speed is crawling and drive my patience nut . There are no free parking only 4 handicap parking spaces always filled . $16 per night . The room is spacious and nice. I can walk to the airport easily for 10 to 15 minutes max completely safe with red light to cross the highway . The distance to walk to this hotel is not very much longer than to walk to the monorail station . It is really a good exercise if you don't have big suitcase to lug around . The employees working at the double tree are super nice . You can request new towel or other stuffs very friendly . This hotel has a lot of ROOMS . They don't have enough customers, so they sell room rate at low cost but make up with parking fees, internet fees, no breakfast . However the bus transportation back and forth to the airport is very reliable . They do not hesitate to bring two or more bus in the early morning to take flyers to the airplanes.

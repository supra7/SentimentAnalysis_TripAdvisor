If you are looking for a hotel full of the spirit of Hawaii - this is the place! The staff is full of the aloha spirit! The rich tradition and heritage of their islands carry through with the activities, restaurants, entertainment and the service offered by the hotel. A friendly smile and aloha is always offered in the lobby or anywhere on hotel property. Comfortable, clean, and nicely furnished rooms are what you'll find. A basic style whale pool with no fancy slides or waterfalls. Nice, well kept, spacious grounds in a fantastic beach location. It's not a luxury property, but the friendliness, helpfulness,and aloha staff makes up for that. We have visited Maui three times and have stayed there each time. We love it and intend to go back! Aloha and Mahalo to our Kaanapali Ohana

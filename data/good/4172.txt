Stayed here for 3 nights recently during a family trip to Maui. The resort is beautiful and the best features of this resort are the pools. Kids and I love the pools and kids especially love the water slides. They have huge pools that are interconnected by the indoor water ways which you can swim back and forth. We spent most of the time navigating these waterways which was fun and adventurous for awhile. The room was comfortable but rather small for the price. The Son'Z restaurant was excellent; they served great seafood and daily specials. Make sure you go for the buffett breakfast too, great selections and I especially love the fruits. The loma loma massage was kind of plain and very expensive, so not worth the price of admission. It's by the pool area so things could get rather noisy while you are doing the massage nearby. Some small shops inside the Hyatt including a mini boutique version of Macys. If you have a car, parking could become a huge problem during the hours between 5 and 9 as outside visitors came to joined the big Luau event taking place every evening. Valet parking is expensive at $15 a day so that's not a good option either. I would recommend this hotel if you are spending most of your time within the hotel premise. Otherwise, parking could be a nightmere all by itself and you can get a better location stay elsewhere.

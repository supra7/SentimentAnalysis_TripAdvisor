Traveled to Seattle to see friends, stayed 5 nights in this hotel. Every evening there was a wine tasting with a knowledgeable pourer/host. Everything we requested from extra blankets, a coffee maker and a rental car was taken care of immediately. The rooms were clean, the beds comfy, and the location central. Would definitely stay there again.

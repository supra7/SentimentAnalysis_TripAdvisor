I just got done staying at the Westin for a few days with my wife. Overall, we had a good experience at the hotel and would stay there again. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. We checked in very quickly without any problems. We were very impressed with the room. We had a Deluxe King with a water view and it was definitely worth the extra $10. We had a fantastic view of the Sound with the Space Needle also clearly visible from our room. The panoramic window meant we had a very impressive expanse to enjoy. One big disappointment we found was that the business center cost something like $8 for 15 minutes of internet usage. We had planned on using the center to print off our boarding passes for the return trip, but ended up doing it elsewhere. At other hotel chains, the business center has always been complimentary. Breakfast was a part of the package we purchased. It was a rather basic breakfast from the cafe located in the lobby. It was a decent value, but nothing spectacular. The second day we had the food delivered to our room and it was much better than eating in the loud cafe. Our other complaint is with the concierge. We dealt with both a man and a woman concierge, and neither of them were particularly helpful or friendly. The woman was borderline rude at times, both with us and with other hotel guests. Compared with the incredibly helpful concierges I've dealt with at other hotels, it was a major disappointment. It's nice to have someone available to help with scheduling car rentals, tours, and the like, but in this case, I would recommend just doing it yourself.

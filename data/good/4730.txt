We stayed 8 nights in the Outrigger Eldorado. It was a great value - lots more space than a hotel room and a great location for family. The beach cabana is great, although it is a bit of a walk for someone with limited mobility. The pools on site were great. Quieter area than right on the ocean in the resort area, and just a short walk to Whalers village for food and shopping. Great hospitality at the front desk and activities desk, especially with rides to and from the cabana. Overall great stay.

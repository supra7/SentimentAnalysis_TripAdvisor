The Moore Hotel is an old hotel that has maintained its character. There were 12 of us (8 adults and 4 young adults) in 4 rooms including a suite. This worked just fine--people routinely leave their doors open and it's a friendly environment. The front desk staff were helpful and accommodating. The rooms were clean as was the entire place. There is no air conditioning but there are fans in each room and the windows open. Located within walking distance of the Pike Street Market and lots of other places. If you want first class and cookie cutter, look elsewhere. We loved it and would stay here again

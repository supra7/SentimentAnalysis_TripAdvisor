Stayed here for one night in November - travelling with my mother (83) and sister. The location was amazing for shopping, dining, etc - couldn't be better. The front desk staff were nice and helpful, and the attached sushi restaurant ( Red Fin) was good. However, the hotel is small, the rooms tiny.... the "queen" beds are small doubles (albeit comfortable). It was a nice stay, but I would not stay there again.

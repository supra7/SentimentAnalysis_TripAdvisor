So I booked a room at this hotel, 26 Euro for one night (single room), quite cheap for Berlin - A single room with a shared bathroom. The room was quite big, not luxurious but very clean and with a lot of light. Big, clean bathroom - and I didn't notice the others that I shared it with. - The staff was helpful all the way. - Big free breakfast with bread, different cerals, jam, nutella, coffee, juice etc. More than satisfying. - Only 20 m. or so from a U-bahn so very easy to get into the center. And very handy and convenient when you arrive home at night. Uhlandstrasse is also a great street with shops, restaurants etc. - Very good value for the money. - Nothing really negative to say - hmm.. maybe ... I couldn't make the elevator work but I didn't even ask, so :) - I can't really believe the other negative reviews here - I wouldn't certainly go again.

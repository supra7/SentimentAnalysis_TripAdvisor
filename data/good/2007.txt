We stayed in a Grand View room for one night before heading the Olympics. Reading some of the other reviews, maybe your experience depends on what room you're in. We splurged on a Grand View room that was part of their romance package. As you'll see from the pictures, the view was stunning. Our room was nicely appointed and was clean. Included in the package was Chateau Ste Michelle sparkling wine and room service for breakfast. We've stayed in many Westins and would definitely stay here again.

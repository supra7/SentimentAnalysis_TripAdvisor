We stayed here for one night before an early flight from SEATAC the next morning. Check-in was fine and they have a convenient computer right by the desk where you can print your boarding pass. We were pedestrian passengers on the ferry from Bainbridge Island to Seattle, and there were plenty of cabs to meet the ferry and the ride to the hotel isn't very long. It was just a quick overnight stay, but the property was as you'd expect a Marriott to be: clean, smartly decorated, professional staff, everything functional. The indoor pool was pretty although we didn't use it. The complimentary shuttle to the airport is timely and convenient. I would definitely stay here again.

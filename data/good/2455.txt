i just spent two nights this past weekend at the w hotel. after reading all of the previous reviews, i was fairly skeptical of this hotel. however, i was pleasantly surprised. the hallways and elevators weren't nearly as dark as i had expected, the people at the front desk were polite and not cold and/or rude, and nothing was messed up with our reservation. the rooms are beautiful and spacious (we were staying in a base level room). i found the layout aided the spacious feeling. we were at the end of the hallway, so hearing the elevators was not a problem. our room looked out onto the fairmont hotel, and i admit i looked enviously at the pool across the way. we visited earth & ocean for dessert one night. the desserts were tasty and artfully done, but were really tiny for the price. we visited jasmine, a restaurant on 4th street to the right of the hotel. it wasn't anything spectacular: the tuna sashimi was better than the salmon. the service wasn't so good. we also got dessert at shucker's, the restaurant to the left of the w hotel on 4th street, in the fairmont hotel building. the dessert was fabulous - blueberry blackberry pie with sour cream ice cream - flavors complimented each other, and the size was generous. the menu looked pretty good, as far as oyster bar restaurants gohowever, if you're planning on spending some good money on wine, bring your own wine glasses. regarding the valet parking - we didn't have to pay for it because i found an offer online at the hotel website that offered a discounted rate ($209 per night), free valet parking, and double starpoints. i couldn't believe it was valid for weekends. make sure you check out the website for the current specials. there's no way i would've paid the $30+ for parking.

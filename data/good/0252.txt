What a nice time we had every evening on the roof watching the sunset behind the water and mountains! The room was very nice with spacious bathroom and high quality linens. Partial water view has you looking directly down at side street...no balcony's. Only real problem was that window cleaning was to take place from 9am-? this meant we had to keep our "water view" curtains closed until the cleaners finished.You are paying $$$ for the view... We Should have been told this at the time of booking so we could have decided if that's what we wanted.

This was my second stay at this hotel and I do like the old ambiance of the place, with the plush carpets, places for you to sit and the ease of entry. The staff are very friendly and I appreciated Jennifer's humor at the front desk. The elevator though was another story. I had to wait at least ten minutes for the thing. And the staff finally had one of their own operating the elevator. When I returned some hours later, the elevator again would ignore the button at the first floor and would not open unless someone from another floor happened to come to the first floor. Quite annoying. There was one guest who was being particularly obnoxious to the staff and the staff were calm in the midst of adversity which I appreciated. The room: I think offering four dollars for use of the bottled water was a bit much and the hotel should re-think its policy on that. The television was appreciated. The coffeemaker ran well and did its thing. The divider doors in 1203 do stick and not close correctly, but I didn't need that. Overall good experience. I would go again, as soon as they fix that elevator!

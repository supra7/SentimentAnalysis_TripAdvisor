All the good reviews are accurate. Loved the hotel overall, the food, the shows were free and wonderful, great grounds, excellent location. Couple of things to be aware of; our bed was harder than we were used to (not a Hilton or Marriot bed, thats' for sure). No hot tub or gym (not important to us), ask directly for the free breakfast. EXCELLENT breakfast buffet and I noticed some people had free vouchers and some didn't.. We made our reservations direct. Also, the rate quoted on their confirming e mail didn't match the bill at the end of the stay. This waqs resolved satisfactorlily. They have old computers! Very clean 3 star rooms.

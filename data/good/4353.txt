We stayed at the Maui Hyatt in late September and were very happy with our choice. We were concerned before our trip that we would be disappointed with the quality, having stayed at a higher-end resort our last trip to Maui, but our expectations were well exceeded. We loved our room. The decor was pretty, the beds were wonderful, there was a small walk-in closet, and double sinks for the bathroom. The grounds of the hotel were also beautiful and we loved being able to relax by the pool or in a hammock swinging between two palm trees. The location was great -- even though the beach in front isn't the best, the walk along the beach path is fun and better beaches are a short walk away. We'd definitely stay here again when we return to Maui!

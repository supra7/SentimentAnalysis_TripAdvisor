I stayed here while attending a conference at the convention center next door. My room was quite nice, with an ottoman to relax on, and a decent-sized bathroom. I heard virtually no noise from outside from my room. Unfortunately, that meant I also slept through a fire alarm going off in the middle of the night, although I did hear the announcement of the all-clear on the speaker in my hotel room. The Fitness Club was nice, also, and unlike some similar hotels, you don't have pay an additional fee just to use it to work out. If you want to pay for wifi in your room, it's expensive, but we had free wifi at my conference and I also was able to use it in the hotel lobby for free. There's also free wifi in the sports bar attached to the hotel. I didn't eat any meals at the hotel's restaurant, but there is a Starbucks attached to the hotel also, and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the Gaslamp Quarter, which is a short distance away. Although my 10th floor room overlooked part of the hotel roof, I still had a magnificent view of the Coronado Bridge and the mountains of Mexico to the south. They are almost done building a walkway from directly in front of the hotel which takes you over the railroad tracks and right to Petco Field. I found the service from the hotel staff to be fine, although they neglected to slide my bill under my door on my final morning there. And unlike at some hotels, where they promise not to give you clean towels if you leave towels hanging on hooks, this hotel actually kept their word and didn't automatically replace my towels every day regardless of whether I wanted them to do so. This is actually the closest and most convenient hotel to the convention center. The Marriott is just on the other side, but due to construction that's a bit of a pain to walk through to get back and forth from the convention center.

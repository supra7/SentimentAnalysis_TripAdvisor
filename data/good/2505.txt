Honestly, when it comes to big rooms who really uses all the space. I sure don't. That's why I liked the Max. The rooms - yeah they are small. But what are you looking for. I thought the amenities were good - liked the pillow ordering service. Great sleep in this hotel! Though $6.00 for water was a bit much I did enjoy my stay. Recommended!

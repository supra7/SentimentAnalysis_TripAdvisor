my family just got back for staying 8 days at the kaanapali beach hotel, this was our first time in hawaii, i really think this was our BEST vacation ever, and we WILL go back. this hotel has got every thing you need, and then more. it is close to every place you want to go, if it isnt, they have DOLLAR buses and FREE shuttles that will take you where you need to go. but every thing is WALKING distance. we rode buses to ride the candy train, th e ocean center and the BEST kaanapali beach luau,that was the BEST i have ever seen.so if you go to hawaii you HAVE to seen a KAANAPALI BEACH LUAU.there is not one bad thing, i can say about this trip, everything was beautiful. we can not wait to go back.

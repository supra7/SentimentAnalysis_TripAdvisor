My wife and I spent part of our Honeymoon in Maui. From Oct 19 - Oct 25, 2003 and we made a great choice! We really felt at home and comfortable at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for the most part. The Hawaiians who worked there were very friendly! But the caucasion employees should take some lessons on how to treat guests. That is really our only complaint. They were, to say it bluntly, pretty rude! They are the most Hawaiian hotel but I think they need to be the "all Hawaiian hotel". There are a couple of guys who work in the towel hut that really need personality adjustments. I gave them the benefit of maybe having a bad day. But after 5 days of dealing with these guys I was glad when I turned in my last towel and never had to see them again. But the resort was gorgeous! We loved hanging at the pool. The water was perfect. And if you stay you must try the wonton apps at the Tiki Grill next to the Tiki Bar! They are awsome! The breakfast buffet is too expensive. The light buffet which was a glorified continental breakfast was like $11 or $12 per person! With tip it cost us almost $30 a day just for breakfast. When you leave they sing a Hawaiian farewell song and give you a lei. It was pretty special and it made my wife cry. She didn't want to leave. We would stay there again but will probably try another hotel only because there are so many to choose from!

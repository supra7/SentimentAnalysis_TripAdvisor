Even though this place is well worn, the place is kept very clean (not dirty). The room is spacious. The fridge smelled a bit and didn't keep cold very long, but mostly not a problem. This is a no frills, good affordable hotel. Free internet is available to one device at a time/one log-in at a time. Internet is fast and reliable. Bed is comfortable and clean. The staff is not over the top friendly but are helpful and nice. Very close to metro station on a quiet street.

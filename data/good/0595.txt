This is an edited review - I deleted my earlier review due to what happened after we checked out. Service - top notch, room - very comfortable, clean. Size of room - on the small side, but well appointed - coffee, TV, ice only on certain floors. Size of bathroom - ok, shower only, but only 18" between edge of sink & wall of shower - large people are in trouble. Back to service - have to mention how helpful the doormen were. They held bags for us before we checked in (after some discussion), and again on our return. Concierge & doormen were great with directions & looked up bus routes as well. Why the edit? We were here on a group rate and entered a special code into the website. The quote I was given had tax = 0.00. Since the regular website quote showed tax, I assumed tax was included in the special rate. When I questioned it on check out, it was taken off (I had the e-mail confirmation), but then charged to my card two days later. Though they were correct that the tax was due (I was going to challenge it on my credit card but checked the group's site & it did say "+ tax"), I feel a call or e-mail was appropriate explaining the re-charge. Thus, 1 star taken off a 5* review.

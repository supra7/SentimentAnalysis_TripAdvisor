We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in late September. The room we had requested was unavailable so they offered us another room which they called their superior room. We didn't like it at all. It was very dark and didn't feel very clean. When we complained they somehow managed to give us the room which we requested in the first place. It was very nice and light and had a small balcony with one chair on it. The room was clean enough but the carpet was badly stained and felt dirty. So much so that we wore the slippers provided when we were in the room. The hotel is in a great location. A few steps from the Trevi Fountain and a reasonably easy walk to all the other tourist attractions in Rome. Great shopping and restaurants all close by. The breakfast was more than adequate and served in the basement which always smelt musty. Get there early for breakfast as there aren't many tables and not a lot of room. I would recommend this hotel for a short stop in rome but mainly for the location.

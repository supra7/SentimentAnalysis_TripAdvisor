I'm very picky when it comes to Hotels, but the Waterfront really made me feel good. The room was very clean, the furniture had any very nice style. Bed is very comfortable Location is also great. You should try the restaurant - very good! Rooms are a little loud. Why I didn't give 5 points? There is one thing that annoys me so much about hotels, and that is when they try to squeeze the last penny out of you. What is the problem in giving guests a free 20c water bottle (at least on arrival?) no, there is only evian in the minibar for 4$ wifi internet is 50$ a week - you get this for free in most 3* hotels.. It seems management is overly concerned with money anyway: on sunday they give you a free newspaper - which has a sticker that you can return it for 25c refund if you don't want it - wtf? rooms are 200-400$ a night..

Really nice hotel. I have stayed here a few times. Nice spacious rooms, high rise and nicely located. The staff is really helpful and the hotel is easily accessible by train as well as car. The food is good. Fitness center is available all the time and is decent. The elevators can slow you down at peak times otherwise this is a great hotel to stay in Seattle.

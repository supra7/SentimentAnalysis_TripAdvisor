We stayed here during a trip to Seattle. parking was down the block but we were able to walk to the space needle from the hotel. Staff was very friendly and very helpful with maps and directions to nearby restaurants. I fell in love with this hotel and its adorable charm! not the fanciest of places but I felt safe and welcome. Also had an adorable courtyard to sit and eat or have a coffee. would stay there every single trip i make to Seattle!!!!!!

A lovely hotel in a great location. The room was a good size and not too noisy even though it was on the town side. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace with a glass of wine. Just one point make sure that you check out in person. We did an express check out and then when we got our credit card bill found that they had charged us even though we had prepaid through Expedia. This was promptly sorted out but was inconvenient

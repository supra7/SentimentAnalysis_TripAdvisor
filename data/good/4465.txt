This was our second trip to Kaanapali Beach Hotel (first was in 2009), and we'll gladly book again on our next trip. The staff genuinely treats each guest like family, and it's valuable to know that much of their staff has been with the hotel for 10+ years. When we spoke with locals around the area, their respect for Kaanapali Beach Hotel is genuine--the hotel is deeply rooted in the community and frequently participates/volunteers in school, neighborhood, and environmental initiatives. Everyone is warm & welcoming, and it's very easy to relax! If you're the type of traveler who is looking for 5-star everything, all-inclusive resort style vacationing, then you might not be happy here--the facility is on the older side (although very clean and well maintained). We enjoyed being able to relax at the pool, the expansive private beach area, AND being able to get out into town (Lahaina) to enjoy the local scene. Traveling with small kids here is easy, and we'll happily return next time!!

We stayed at the Crowne Plaza recently on a short trip to Seattle. The hotel is located in downtown Seattle. As with most North American cities, the downtown is usually separated into a retail district, a financial district, and a more sketchy "skid row" district. Crowne Plaza seems to be located right on the border between its retail district and the "down and out" part of town. If you were to walk outside and head towards Pike Place, there are decent looking shops and a very vibrant downtown feel to it. On the other hand, should you venture in the opposite direction (towards Chinatown), you see the less desireable elements of the city. Having said that, the hotel itself is well run, and certainly met our expectations. The breakfast buffet place was great, and the service (particularly of Filiberto) was excellent! Overall, the staff were cheery and generally very helpful. The beds were a bit too soft, but that may be a personal preference, rather than a reflection on the hotel. We were taken aback though, by the rather hefty parking charge of $32 plus taxes. But I guess this is to be expected of any downtown hotel. To partly offset this, the counter staff was graciously enough to offer us free WiFi. In sum, this is an excellent hotel, and is certainly on par with many of the other four-star hotels in the city. We would not hesitate to recommend this establishment to our friends.

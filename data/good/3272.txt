Stayed recently at the Secrets Maroma after previously staying at Excellence Resorts 4 times The food and drink are much better at the Secrets and we looked forward to our meal every evening and must say we never had a bad meal at all the food outlets. as usual for Mexico up market resorts the staff are fantastic and can not do enough for you. Now the downside, the resort is used by American Companies for corporate team building function and it gets a bit hectic. I don't know why Americans try to reserve up to 70 sunbeds at 0700 hrs in the morning and still expect them to be there with a towel or a single flip flop or book on them at 1130. The pool attandants and security guards try their very best to enforce a 30 minute only reservation period but this caused numerous stand up arguments around the pool area nearly every day. One American group asked the Manager what they resort were going to give them for them as compensation for losing their sunbeds at 0930 Hrs when two of a group of 12 turned up. The manager was a bit slow as he should have said " a course in good manners" !!! All in all the edge was taken off a great holiday by very selfish individuals

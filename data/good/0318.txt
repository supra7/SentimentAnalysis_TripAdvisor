My husband and I stayed at the Ace for 2 nights in August. We loved the uniqueness of the hotel; the decor in each room is different and super-cool and I haven't stayed anywhere else quite like it before. The location in Belltown is excellent and in easy walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops and Pike Place Market. Staff were really friendly and helpful and seemed keen to chat and offer advice. The self-serve continental breakfast was good (I particularly liked the make-your-own waffles) and the lack-of ensuite bathroom wasn't an issue due to the sheer number of shared bathrooms. One downside for us was that our room was right above The Cyclops Bar and therefore pretty noisy. We'd been in the bar earlier (excellent burgers and cocktails - I recommend the Pink Eye) but the music seemed to go on pretty late and we didn't get an amazing nights sleep. But I imagine our room was the noisiest as we were right above it and we didn't ask to move, so can't complain too much. Because of this and lack of private bathrooms, I'd recommend The Ace to younger people. I'd defintely return but request a different room (or stay out later!)

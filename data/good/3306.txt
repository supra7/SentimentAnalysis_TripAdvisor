I have no intention of repeating what everyone else has said. This is a superb 5 star hotel the staff, restaurants, facilities, beach etc. are absolutely first class, however . . . The first however is that the hotel is located in a mangrove swamp and the mosquitos are a major pain (in where ever they bite you) if you dont suffer with bites then this is the place for you, however if you do then be careful, we used 100% Deet and the little buggers loved it. The second however is they do conferences in a big way, when we were there about 400+ delegates appeared and just took the place over during breakfast for 4 days, now again to be fair the hotel managed it very well and in general that was the only time we were troubled by them  we were surprised at the size of the conference this is written so you wont be!

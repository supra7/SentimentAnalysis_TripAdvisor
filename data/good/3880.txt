We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Bayfront. Great views, quiet and relaxing. Great place to go for runs and get exercise. A bit of a walk to other restaurants in town but views made it worthwhile. Was very glad we purchased hotel package which included parking, breakfast and Internet as otherwise these are expensive add-ons. We had connecting rooms with our teenagers and worked well. Would stay again.

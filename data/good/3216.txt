The hotel is in a quiet street on the part of Albrechtstasse to north of Reinhardtstrasse and only about 15 minutes walk to the Hauptbahnhof, Unter den Linden, Museum Island and the bars/restaurants of Hackerschen Markt (also recommended.) The rooms were clean, good facilities - TV, air-con, desk, safe; though overall a bit on the small side for two if staying more than a few days. Wifi had a strong signal. Our rooms seemed to have new fittings - on Google Satellite view it is still a building site so assume it is all new (can see it on Streetview though.) Breakfast was decent and well worth filling-up on for 8 as Berlin can get pricey!

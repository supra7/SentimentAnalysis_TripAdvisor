We stayed at the Regency Suites for 4 nights over the Eid holiday in September with 2 young children. The hotel staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful. The room was spottlesly clean and had extra beds for both our children and the location is perfect for visiting the main sights of Istanbul. However, a couple of warnings. First, a suite in Turkey doesn't mean multiple rooms, merely a single bedroom with ensuite bathroom. Secondly, the deluxe suites (I don't think they have a standard class, the alternative is an executive suite) offer a view of a brick wall just over a metre from the windows. Not that we were there to sit looking out the window, but you couldn't even tell if it was cloudy or sunny without craning your neck out the window. Warning's out the way, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel - just be aware what you're booking.

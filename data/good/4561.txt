We spent a week at the KBH as the first leg of our Honeymoon. Fantastic. The beach is idyllic, golden sand, blue ocean and views of Molokai and Lanai. The hotel is lovely, the breakfasts were nice and there was a nice feel to the whole place. We did feel a bit younger than everyone else there but that wasn't offputting in anyway. The rooms weren't really quiet, but they didn't disturb our sleep at all and the live entertainment was a great way to chill in the evening and had finished plenty early enough so it didn't disturb guests. This is not as swanky as some of the other hotels on the beach but has character, great staff and makes Hawaii affordable.

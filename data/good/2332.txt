I am definitely a fan of the W, but if I wasn't paying Starwood Points for this hotel, it might be a little lower. We arrived on the weekend, and got a small box room for our platinum upgrade, which was slightly confusing. It was no different than any other, but they said it was one of their superior rooms. But, to the hotel's credit, they allowed us to change rooms to a lower floor that was a corner view, which was very nice, and had a larger bathroom and enough room for a seating area. The hotel staff is incredibly accommodating and helpful, except that a concierge forgot to make our birthday dinner reservations, but it wasn't an issue becauase I had called the restaraunt to confirm the reservations, and they were still able to get us in. It's located in more of a financial district than anything else, so it's a little quiet in the immediate neighborhood, but close to the Pike Place market, and shopping and the Seattle Art Museum, and the gorgeous library (worth looking at if you go to Seattle.) Overall, it was good.

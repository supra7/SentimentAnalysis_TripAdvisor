I was here for a conference and it was a good location. Close to restaurants, shopping, market, etc...the hotel was in good condition. Nice lobby with lots of cozy, quiet sitting areas. The rooms were nice, the windows very clean. Typical big city hotel where you have to tip everyone for everything. Conceirge was programmed for conference groups. We tried asking for some off the beaten path ideas and she was getting frustrated that we wanted something other than the "tour". She didn't want to talk anymore after we starting asking for non-tourist ideas. A park that would be nice to take a walk....she said if we didn't take the guided tours she couldn't help. There was a nice program for skipping housekeeping (green promotion). I don't like housekeeping in my room after I clean it upon arrival but I did not notice the little card offering extra points or $5 gift card for putting this card under the door. I had put the do not disturb all 3 nights. My collegue noticed it and told me about it so I did get credit for 1 night. Seemed like they didn't want to promote it. I was NOT told about it upon check in. The hotel stay was nice and it was a good choice for the conference.

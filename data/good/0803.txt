I stayed at the Moore for 2 nights recently and as most other reviewers posted, it was great for the price. ROOMS: The Moore offers both rooms with private baths and rooms with shared baths. You'll save about $15-20/night if you take a room with a shared bath. I was a single traveler and took a room with bath for only $65/night. The same room for two people in it would have been ~$80/night. You won't find a lot of amenties, but at this price, I didn't care. Like there was no shampoo or even glasses for water, but this was a very small inconvenience compared to all of the other great pluses (price, location, etc.). The rooms themselves were very clean, if a little worn in places like the bathrooms. Also, they were fairly large, so you won't feel like you're living in a closet. LOCATION: It can't be beat. It's between Pike Place and Belltown. The walk to each is about 3-5 minutes, if even that. TRANSPORTATION: From the airport buses (174 and 194), it's a 5-minute walk with luggage. You're also close to a ton of bus lines. I was able to save money and not get a car because of the great location. I took buses to the University district, Madison Park, Fremont, and Capitol Hill. All of these bus stops were about a 5-minute walk away as well. INTERNET ACCESS: There is one computer terminal in the lobby you can check email from for free. Free wireless internet is also available, but only in the lobby. STAFF: I found all of the staff I interacted with to be extremely helpful and friendly. CHECKOUT: Checkout is a little on the early side at 11AM, but I was able to secure a late checkout (noon). On busier days, I still think they would let you have a late checkout of 11:30AM.

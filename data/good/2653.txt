This hotel fit the bill for us. Once parked, it's an easy walk (or dash through the rain) to stores, restaurants, theatres. We were here to meet friends for dinner and shop, but I'd stay here again to attend something at the Paramount Theatre, down the street. Our queen room was small but nicely updated with comfy bed, nice lighting and a tiny, very clean bathroom. It also had a working thermostat, which is a big plus in my books! The only downside was the cost of parking ($36 for a little over 24 hours), but for a room in the city I guess that's to be expected. Overall a nice stay!

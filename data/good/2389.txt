We stayed here for a week and got the room through Priceline's name your price at a pretty decent rate. While I did not particularly care for the trendy look of the common areas (when we arrived at night the lobby was really dark) and the service was only barely friendly, the location is fantastic - a 10 minute walk to the market and a block away from the light rail stop. Our room was quite roomy and comfortable although the view was a bit ugly - not unexpected at our bargain rate. Overall I was happy with this hotel, but not overwhelmed. I would consider staying here again.

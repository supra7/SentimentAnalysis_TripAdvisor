What does this Sheraton have going for it? Front desk staff, Concierge, house keeping staff, great gym, great pool, nice big comfortable rooms, comfy beds, nice views on upper floors, antique stores, aquarium, parks, REI Flagship store (large wall climb), shop till you drop shopping, new and used bookstores, Pike Street fish and flower market (Saturday a.m. is best), restaurants to suit any palate and outdoor paradise a short ride away. Take the really cheap fairy across the bay for a lunch or dinner. I took the Seattle Underground Tour with Gael in Pioneer Square. Most of Seattle burned down in 1889. She did a wonderful continuous "one-liner" schtick about the history of Seattle while walking through the bowels of the city. Fascinating! If you can't find something you like in Seattle, you would be difficult to please anywhere.

We stayed for 3 nights at the hotel when we visted Berlin for a short city trip. Ofcourse after reading previous reviews on this site. As most of the other guests we too had a very nice experience. We brought our dog and they very helpfull in providing us with what we needed. The hotel staff is very friendly. Rooms are nice, clean and luxurious. Breakfast buffet is good and complete. Different metro lines are in the direct vicinity (5 min walk) and all major sites are therefore closeby. Neighbourhood is multicultural and not suitable for small childeren or fine dining. Nevertheless, an absolute recommendation.

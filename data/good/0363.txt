As a travel professional I'm in Seattle regularly as well as spending around 100 nights per year in hotels. The Good Stuff: Hotwire deals for well under $100. Front desk personnel were friendly and professional; very knowledgeable about the property and city. Food was reasonably priced (for a hotel) and tasty. My king room was large and partially renovated; with fridge, robes and was clean/smelled nice. Bed, linens and pillows were excellent. Areas that fell short: Bathroom is old (just like the building); partially renovated but not to today's standards. Desk and floor lamp were ugly and beaten up; like something from an old Holiday Inn. Public areas; especially the lobby are not inviting, old and dingy. Vales/Doorman never offered to help me with my 3 bags or even open a door?

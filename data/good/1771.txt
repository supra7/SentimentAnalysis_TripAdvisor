We spent three nights at the Edgewater in downtown Seattle. We bid for the room on Priceline and got a great deal at $110 a night, considering their room rates were posted at over $350 a night. Check-in went very well. Because we purchased the room on Priceline, we were given a very small room with a single queen bed. Since there were just two of us, it was perfect. Our only complaint was that the room did not have a dresser or enough hangers in the closet for us to unpack our suitcases. We were given a city view, overlooking the Space Needle. No complaints about the view, but we could've done without the train across the street, blowing it's whistle at 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. both mornings! We ate appetizers in the restaurant one evening and had breakfast one morning. The food and service were excellent on both occasions. We walked everywhere and felt safe, even after dark. Pioneer Square, Pike's Place and the Space Needle were all within a 10-30 minute walk. Unless you plan on leaving the Seattle downtown area to sightsee, you do not need a car. A free bus stops in front of the hotel and runs every 20-30 minutes. If you do have a car, they charge $28 a night. We would definately stay at this hotel again, and would highly recommend it to our family and friends.

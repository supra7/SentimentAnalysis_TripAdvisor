A friend and I toured Portland, Victoria BC, and Seattle at the end of July. We stayed at Marriott properties in the first two cities, and we knew the Moore was a different type of hotel, but we loved the location and the price. For $95 nightly, we had a very basic suite-type room that had been converted from two separate rooms - one with a private bath and one with only a sink. As requested, our room was on the back side of the hotel away from the street, so it was very quiet, other than some banging of doors in the morning as other guests came and went down the hallway. There is no a/c, but this was not an issue as the late July daytime temps never got above 70 degrees during our stay. Our bathroom was nice-sized, with a claw-footed tub/shower combination with good water pressure. Water pressure in the bathroom sink was a little weak. Arriving on the last ferry from Victoria, we checked in after 10 p.m. The clerk who helped us that night, Bob, was very accomodating and even provided us with three different options for dining that would be open late. The next day he helped us with recommendations for more dining options in Capitol Hill. He was very patient and thorough each time we came to him with more questions. If you need luxury, you'd be much more comfortable in one of the $250+ hotel rooms in the nearby chain hotels. If you're looking for a basic room for a great price, the Moore's a good option.

We booked a one night stay prior to flying out of Seatac the following morning. The rooms are a good size with really comfortable beds, nice bed linens and towels. The starbucks coffee shop in the lobby is great for a quick breakfast. The location to the airport is excellent and the shuttle bus drivers are prompt and friendly. The restaurant is quite upscale and on the expensive side. If you are looking for a good value meal in a relaxed environment, try Roasters smokehouse just across the road. Right next to the hotel is Wally valet car parking for the airport. The hotel charges $4.95 an hour for internet acess and $20 a night for parking, both are a complete rip off. The cheap hotels are offering free acess and the more upmarket hotels are charging, in this day and age there is no need for those fees. We booked our car in with Wally park which were charging $13 for a 24 hour period.

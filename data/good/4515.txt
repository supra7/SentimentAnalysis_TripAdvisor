I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. They truly did make you feel like one of the family. The food was great, lots of choices. The little Deli Store was convenient if you didn't want to walk to Whaler's village for snacks etc. I stayed in the Kauai building and the room was very nice, clean, comfortable. The grounds were large and nicely laid out, there was always a chair available either near or around the pool. There were plenty of shady spots to take a chair to if you wanted to escape the sun. There was always room on the beach if you wanted to sit on the beach. The location right on Ka'anapali Beach was very convenient. Aside from a quick shopping trip into Lahaina - I didn't feel the need to leave the Ka'anapali beach area. There is a lovely boardwalk that covers the whole beach so you can easily walk to other areas like Whaler's Village. The Teralani tour boats pick you up right on that beach so it was convenient for day trips as well. Traveling alone, I felt very safe there. I enjoyed the lei making classes and hula lesson, as well as the evening hula show and Kupanaha dinner show. Overall, I would be very happy to return to the KBH and would definitely recommend it to others.

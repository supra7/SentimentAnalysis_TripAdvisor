We chose this hotel based on the price and the few reviews available, which were favorable. The location is fairly close to a few metro routes. We found ourselves using the U2 most, which was about 4 blocks away. The neighborhood is not built for tourists. We did find a couple of good resturants and bars nearby. It just takes a little exploring. The room was sleek, in all black and white, with a walk-in slate shower. Its all very new, although it had an Ikea feel to it. Quite spacious and comforatable. I would have liked a second chair in the room, so that one of us didn't have to sit on the bed or the floor. Be careful when booking online. When I selected the rate with breakfast included, it calculated 'extra person fees' and taxes that amounted to $144 for our 4 night stay. We decided to skip breakfast, but the buffet looked nice and is available for 11 Euro/person. Overall, great value at $55/night!

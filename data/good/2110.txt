We stayed at the Westin Seattle July 2005 for just one night prior to leaving for an Alaskan cruise. We would definitely stay here again, and hopefully have more time to explore what Seattle has to offer. The Westin is a beautiful hotel. The only bad thing we can say is that check-in took forever. it is clearly a very busy place and they unable to handle the volume, we waited on line about 1 hr. But after that was done, we had a great experience. The room was comfortable, the view was amazing, the bed was as described, heavenly, the lobby bar was yummy, we had drinks and appetizers, before heading out for the night. Check out was easy and the ride to the Pier for our cruise was quick. Overall great experience. i would rate it Excellent if only the check-in wasn't so frustrating.

After much searching on TA, I chose this hotel for it's location. We traveled to Seattle from Philadelphia for a one night stay on July 10th before heading to Victoria (Vancouver Island) on the Clipper. I did not want to rent a car in Seattle so this was perfect for us. From Seatac, we took the Light Rail to the last stop and then a short walk to the hotel. Our room was smallish but clean and comfy for $200. We liked walking to Pikes Market, Elliotts on the water for a late lunch in the sun, and the monorail that took us directly to the Space Needle. At the end of the day, we went to the hotel bar (Oliver's) for their signature, award winning martinis. Early the next day we took a cab to pier 69 which was easy enough except we had to wait for a very long train to pass which jacked up the fare considerably!

Stayed at this hotel on the way back from Australia. The choice was more good luck than anything, but it was an excellent choice for what we wanted. Position. Almost in the City centre. Shopping mall very close, and about 10 minuites from the Creek, Not close to the beach. If you want to hear the sea from your room, do not stay here!! A lot of building work going on around the hotel but it was not intrusive. Reception. We arrived at 5.30AM Staff quickly dealt with the formalities and we went to our room. Leaving the hotel was equally painless. We used the hotels own transport back to the airport. Only 1 more than a taxi and worth it for the extra bit of luxury. On arrival at the hotel they want your credit card and take 500 EDoff it to pay for any services that you may use. If you don't use any, they credit your card with the 500ED at the end of your stay ( I hope!! ) Room. Average size, clean and well presented. Safe for documents at no extra charge Cleaned on a daily baisis. Towels changed and toiletries replenished.. If I were to go again, I would upgrade to a "Creek View" room, as the one we had overlooked a building site. Pointless paying for a balcony as it would be too hot to sit out anyway. Food. Breakfasts good. A request to the ever helpful waiter brought us fried eggs or an omlette of your choice. We were going to eat there one night, but it was a buffert and we didn't fancy anything on it so I can't comment on the evening service or food. A small cafe serves snacks and drinks-----at a price! This is a "dry" hotel so don't expect any alcahol to be served. If I ever went to Dubai again I would certainly stay in this hotel and it is in an ideal position for the city sights.

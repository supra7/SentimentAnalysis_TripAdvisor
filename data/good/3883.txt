I was at the Bayfront for a conference this past week and it is a great business hotel. All the amenities you need during a conference - large rooms, nice bathrooms and walking distance to the Gaslamp district. The best part besides the great service is the large array of TV channels (awesome when you are away from home) and a Starbucks that opens at 6am. The hotel has a resort feel so I can imagine it would be great for vacation as well!

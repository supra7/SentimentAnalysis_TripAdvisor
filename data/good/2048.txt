Stayed three nights in July and the stay was just fine. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Seattle, a short walk to Pikes Market, Westlake Center, and central downtown shopping. The rooms are nice in the circular towers and the view of the cruise port was nice. Check in was a litte rough as the hotel was sold out the evening prior, but a nice touch was the offer of a call on your cell phone once your room became available. Room is spacious with amenities of a 3 or 4 star hotel. Only problem is the air conditioning is not sufficient when the afternoon sun beats in. Staff, including housekeeping and front desk were kind and attentive. Overall, a good stay.

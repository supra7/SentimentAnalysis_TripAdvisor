I found this hotel on TripAdvisor and glad we stayed. I love the Pike Place Market and you can't get any closer for under $100 a night. And they validate parking so it was only $12 for almost 24 hours. The hotel is of course OLD but we like the way it has been renovated and the features such as windows that open. It was great to be so close to the market. We had a great dinner at the Virginia Inn, breakfast at Baaco's, and lunch at Lowell's in the Market. We noticed lots of young people and Europeans and other foreigners at the Moore. It definitely is not typical but so worth the price for the location. We would stay there again. There is a wonderful small Catholic church next door also. A really interesting neighborhood.

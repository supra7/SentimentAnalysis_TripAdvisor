I have stayed at the Hotel Max a couple of times and have never been disappointed. After having to cut my business trip to Vancouver short, I needed a place to stay in Seattle and knew I wouldn't be disappointed with Hotel Max. From the time my foot hit the pavement out front and my luggage removed from the trunk of my car, to the time I checked out --- everything was great. The front line employees are professional and friendly. They remember your name and are generally interested in how your stay was at their facility. The hotel itself is artsy and fun. I love the colors and the unique design from the reception area to the hotel rooms. This time I had a room with a full bath, rather than the shower in a closet (which by the way I thought was a great idea) and the tub was deep enough to soak all the way up to my chin! The bed as always is ultra comfortable and after a week on the road, this was the first night's sleep I actually had! It was great. I love the spiritual and pillow menus in the rooms as well as the "You've Got It" button on the phone. The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Pacific Center and Nordstrom's which is great for those who want to hit downtown shopping. Also, a walk to Pike Place isn't far either - I enjoyed a nice stroll in the morning to get a cup of coffee at the waterfront. I would easily stay here again....without a doubt!

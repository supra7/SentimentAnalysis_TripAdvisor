I'm giving this hotel an above average rating mainly for the enormous bathroom and the overall size of the suite, along with pristine cleanliness and extremely courteous, professional staff. Also, I dropped a hint that it was my husband's 50th birthday and they graciously sent up some chocolate-covered strawberries on the house, which was appreciated. We also liked the modern decor concept, although it did have a sterile, corporate quality. The pool area is beautiful. Didn't try the spa but it's a convenient asset. The only terrible thing about this hotel is the hideous lighting in the bathroom! We had a huge tub and separate shower, double sink, everything sleek and white... but the glaring, cold lighting made it feel like a hospital or laboratory. (On the other hand, they're generous with those fragrant Molton Brown toiletries). The bedroom lighting wasn't too cozy, either. You can't get movies on demand, strangely -- they offer only standard cable tv -- but you can request a dvd player and movies from their library. Fine hotel overall, with some quirks. Not a great choice for a real Monteal cultural experience, but probably perfect for business travelers.

I never write reviews, but because I appreciated reading the feedback from travelers who took the time to write about their experience, I thought I should return the favor for future travelers. My husband I loved the experience. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, eager to make our stay a pleasant one. We loved the food, quality and plentiful. We especially enjoyed the Mexican one, which we had saved for our last night. We were glad we did because it was a great way to end our stay on a high note. We thought the wait staff at the Mexican restaurant were the friendliest out of all the others, not to mention the excellent food. We wish we had known there was a dress code for dinners: casual-elegance, which meant no shorts for men. My husband, fully on a vacation-mode, only packed the most comfortable clothes for the warm weather, and so he had to borrow a pair of pants from housekeeping (but couldn't find a size to fit him so we had to creatively use pins and rubber bands to hold up the pants six waist size bigger than his). We stayed at this resort for three nights and four days, which was about the right length of time for us. It's a perfect place to do absolutely nothing but relax. It's quiet, peaceful, an ideal place for a couple but certainly not for singles looking for a social scene. Overall, we loved our stay here. Being a new resort, we got the sense that the staff really bent backwards to be as helpful as possible, and we truly felt pampered and relaxed.

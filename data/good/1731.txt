Edgewater - Room 317 I got extremely lucky and book this one night stay for 60% off using hotels.com in comparison to the rate they wanted directly that night. Check in was quick and easy. I really enjoyed the setting in the lobby area. The tv was in great conditon but the fact that the doors didn't prop open wide enough; we kept having to stick things in front of it to keep it open wide enough for a 180 degree viewing angle. We were hoping to catch the complimentary shuttle that evening (Saturday, October 30th) to Pike's Place, but unfortunately it was not running that evening. Strange.....you would think on a busy Saturday night with all the Halloween festivities nearby that there would be a shuttle service running. The bathroom door would not shut completely and there was no ventilation to air out the bathroom.The cordless phone was completely dead and wouldn't charge correctly so I had to constantly use the speaker phone. I've had my heart set on staying here for a year now. I was soo excited to stay here and I must say the two best things that makes me want to come back besides the small hiccups (like every hotel has people!) is the comfortable clean beds and great bathroom! Plus the view of the city or of the water can't be beat.

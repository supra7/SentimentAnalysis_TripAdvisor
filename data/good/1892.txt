This hotel has a great location! All the reviews sum it up.....a bit old, great beds, great staff, and within walking distance of everything. They give you the option of not having your room made up and in return you get a five dollar gift card to purchase food and drink in the cafe, but make sure to hang the card on the door before two am!

This is a very large hotel near the Convention Center and San Diego Airport. It rises around 30 stories tall and has great views north and south and across the bay to Coronado Island. The views really sell the rooms, especially those looking out across to the Island and the Pacific Ocean beyond. The rooms are nice, typical Hilton, the bathrooms a bit disappointing because those with King Beds lack tubs. Service was great. Maintenance came up and fixed a problem with my air conditioning system (it was making a strange noise) and check-in was easy. Restaurants are mainly down on the bottom floor and it is a hike to the Starbuck's on the property. The hotel has a good gym and business center.

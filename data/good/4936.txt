Overall, this is a great hotel. It is centrally located 5 minutes away from the metro (subway). Despite the great location, there was very little noise from outside. Our room was right near the stairway so there was occasional noise as people lugged their suitcases upstairs to their rooms but no big deal. We found the suite was immaculate with a stove and big refridgerator. The fact that the hotel includes free parking and wi-fi access is great! The staff was helpful and there is a Coras (one of the best places for breakfast) right on the main level. Now for two minor points: This place may not be for everyone. We have two young children and so we never travel light. You have to take two flights of stairs to get to the rooms and reception desk so forewarned is forearmed. Plus, there are none of the typical hotel amenities like swimming pools and exercise rooms so again, for your information. Overall our stay was pleasant and we loved the price and central location.

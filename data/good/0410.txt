With the introduction of the light rail service from Seatac, this hotel is easily connectable from the airport, being only three blocks from the University Street station. Arriving after a 12 hour flight and towards the end of a 24-hour day, the staff were exceptionally friendly, knowledgeable, and took an interest in why I was staying and where I was from. As a Priority Club Gold member, I was ungraded to a Club Room suite (with a wonderful view over downtown Seattle), so got a reasonably comprehensive cold buffet breakfast included. My corporate rate also entitled me to free internet - which would otherwise have been a fairly expensive addition. Although PC members are entitled to a late check-out if capacity allows, the hotel was extremely busy yet this was granted without question. Later collecting the bags I left in storage for the afternoon, the receptionist remembered me and asked how her recommendations had worked out - a mark of very high standards of customer care. Crowne Plaza's are not the cheapest hotels, yet I would have no hestitation in spending my own money in staying here in the future.

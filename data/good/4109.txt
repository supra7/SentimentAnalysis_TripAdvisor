We stayed here during the week of July 10th and it was a very pleasant stay. I had requested two connecting rooms, one room with a king and the second with a double on a high floor. When we arrived around 3pm, they were both ready. They were on the 19th floor with an excellent ocean front view and exactly what we had requested for beds. We had stayed at this hotel many years ago for our honeymoon. While the rooms have now been updated the hotel has matured well and is in an excellent, well maintained condition. The gardens and the animals were all as we had remembered them. Breakfast every morning at the Swan was very enjoyable with much variety to choose from. Used the pool a few times. Got there at 10:30 and could not find 4 chairs together right by the pool. As is typical, lots of saved towels but fewer people around. However if you keep walking down the path, the Hyatt has plenty of extra chairs facing the ocean and we had no problem finding 4 together. Used the valet parking and the service was always fast and courteous. The only improvement could have been the checkout process. The morning of the checkout there was no bill underneath the door to review. I checked the TV to see if the invoice was online, but it was unavailable. I would have liked to look at it prior to going to the checkout desk as we had pool service, bar items, etc on there that I wanted to check. The good news is that upon reviewing the invoice, there were no errors and it was perfect. Overall a very pleasant stay.

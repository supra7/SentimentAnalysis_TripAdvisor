Stayed 9 nights in April on a 'post-tax-season' relaxation trip. Nice hotel, great location, good pool. Japengo (high-end sushi restaurant) was very good. The poolside casual restaurant not so good. Mountain view room in the center building had ocean views if you stood on the outside lanai. Only "miss" is the lack of cleanliness of outdoor seating --- open to the elements (and birds), and there does not appear to be a concerted effort to clean up the bird droppings. Mentioned it to the front desk to bring to management's attention early on, and nothing was cleaned during the rest of the trip. Makes for hit or miss seating opportunities if you're looking for ocean view shaded seating, and I'm sure that there are health issues involved as well, since many of the chairs/tables are used for food service in the morning (coffee bar seating) and dinner (Japengo). The only real flaw to an otherwise good stay.

My sister had a business trip to Seattle August 4th and 5th. I met her for for two days while she was in Seattle. It was prime tourist season and all the hotels in downtown were full. My sister travel agent was able to book the last room. This was our first visit to this hotel. My sister and I slept very well. The beds were very comfortable. There was no noise from the outside or the inside (our room was near the elevator). The bathroom was huge and had nice Aveda products. My sister ordered room service for breakfast each day. The food was very good but very expensive. The locatoin was excellent. It felt like a safe area and we walked to dinner at night. There are some good restaurants and shopping areas within 5 blocks from the hotel. The valet parking was $26.00 a night. It seem to be very expensive at first but we found out that everything is paid parking in downtown Seattle. The TV was too far away from the bed, but we didn't watch it much anyway. The bathroom floor needed some extra cleaning. I left a note for houskeeping about the floor. When we came back to our room in the evening, the floor was cleaned. Housekeeping even opened the window a little to air out the room. We didn't smell any cleaner. All the staff was very nice and helpful. The 5 o'clock traffice is terrible downtown but afterwards there is hardly any traffic at night near this hotel. This hotel has easy access to I-5. I will definaltey stay here again

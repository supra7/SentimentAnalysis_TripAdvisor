My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt from November 16th through November 29th. The hotel is very nice, both clean and asthetically pleasing. The service was wonderful from the start! The rooms are smallish, it's true, but it was perfect for what we needed. We had a king sized bed, a small couch, a flat screen TV and a small lanai with a table and two chairs facing the ocean (deluxe oceanfront room). Breakfast was included, and very tasty. The food was fresh and variety was good. We ordered lunch a couple of times from Umalu which was also very tasty - we were always able to get serviced at the pool rather quickly. The food is a bit pricey, but not much more than you'd expect at any resort. We split quesadillas for $13...plenty to feed two. It's really the drinks by the pool that will rack up - $12 for a pina colada, etc. We went to Safeway (2 miles away), and bought snacks and alcohol and it was the smartest thing we could have done! They also have happy hour specials at Umalu...appetizers for half off, drink specials, etc. It was a really great trip - the locals were very friendly and helpful to us and the walk to Whalers Village was great! Definitely snorkel down by the Sheraton. And if you have to be laying on the beach, this is not the hotel for you. The beach in front of the Hyatt is about 5' deep - down by Whalers Village it is larger and folks have chairs out. The only thing I didn't feel prepared for when I arrived was the WIND - it is fierce! Bring some paperweights with you to the pool (which is really great, and the slide is fun)!

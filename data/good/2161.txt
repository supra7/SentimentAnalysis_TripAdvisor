For a "cheap" hotel, phenomenal. I had low expectations and was blown away. Three-ish blocks from the Space needle/Seattle Center/Monorail which was really important for us. The monorail is $4 round trip (runs until 11pm) and takes you to a mall that is about three blocks to the pikes place market. You could easily walk, but it is very convenient to have the monorail so close. The hotel was easy to find, has parking available for $10 a day, which is good in Seattle, free coffee/internet in the lobby, a large hot/cold continental breakfast (waffles,yogurt,cereal,fruit,bagels,muffins,juice etc when we stayed), and a pool/hot tub. Our room was small (King size bed, table/chair, love seat, TV, mini fridge all jammed in) but we didn't spend much time in it, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I am not a clean freak, but the room seemed quite clean, the bathroom was sparse with a smallish shower (no tub) but had exactly what we needed, no mold/dirt. Complaints: we had the room next to the elevator (this would be RARE) and I am a fairly light sleeper. It woke me up too early in the morning. No view out the window (just a hotel across the way). thin towels. I would still go back any time and would suggest this hotel to anyone who is there to see the city, not a fancy hotel.

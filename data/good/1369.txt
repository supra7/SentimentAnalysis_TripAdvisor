I stayed at the Sheraton for a conference held on-site. The rooms were fine...clean, well-furnished, what you expect. The location is great! It's about a ten minute walk to Pike's Place Market, shopping right out the door, plenty of restaurants, and close to the monorail to get to the Space Needle. The staff answered questions/made good recommendations for restaurants. The fitness room is probably the best I've ever seen at a hotel...it has two levels and if you go early in the morning, you can watch the sun rise over the mountains. However, it was crowded when I went on a week-day morning, which could have been due to the conference I was attending. One thing I liked was if you chose to by-pass your room cleaning, you'd get a $5 gift card for the on-site restaurant and/or bar each day you do so. I would stay here again without a doubt.

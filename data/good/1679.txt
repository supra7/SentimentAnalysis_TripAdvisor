My husband and I stayed at The Edgewater Hotel the third weekend in September. We live in the area and needed a short weekend to ourselves and away from the kids. Overall, I enjoyed the hotel and thought the room (although small) was perfect and lovely. We had a waterview and enjoyed sitting out on the balcony watching the ferry go by. My only complaint was upon check in and check out. We were using a gift certificate and the staff did not seem to know what to do with it. They got us checked in and said they would work it out but upon leaving we were billed (when it should have been free). After that got figured out, I was shocked to see the hotel had charged over 1,000.00 to our debit card! A few phone calls later it was cleared up but was a bit of a hassle to a otherwise nice weekend.

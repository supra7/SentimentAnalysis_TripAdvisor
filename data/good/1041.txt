This place was just great for a quick business trip to Seattle. It is centrally located near restaurants, business area, and tourist attractions. The rooms look like they were update recently and the common areas are very nice. We help several meetings in the hotel and the staff were very helpful. The food was excellent. Ask for a room away from the highway. Mine was facing in the direction of the highway and you do get road noise. One thing that annoyed me - the charge for internet usage. Why do i still need to pay for this when budget hotels give it away? Outrageous to charge what they do.

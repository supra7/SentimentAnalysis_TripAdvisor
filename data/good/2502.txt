Hotel Max is a great value for the location. The design is simple and modern. The beds and linens are exceptionally comfortable. I have stayed there twice now and I would stay again. My only complaint is that it's in the downtown area which can see boring for nightlife but you can easily walk or take a cab to just about anywhere.

Hotel Andra is a great little hotel in the heart of downtown Seattle. Pike's Market, shopping, and dining are easily within walking distance and the bus and light rail easily accessible within a couple of blocks. Great location. The rooms are large and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is small but there is a nice walk in shower and make up mirror with good lighting. The suites have a cushy sofa that pulls out to a comfortable bed. The lobby is warm and welcoming. I appreciated the fireplace coming in from the cold weather. Our check in was delayed due to linen arriving late which was disappointing after a long flight. We were finally given keys to a room that other guests were clearly occupying. The staff was quick to get us to another room and get us settled in. The front desk staff was very friendly, helpful, and efficient, however, two of the doorman were often too busy talking to actually open the door. Internet connection is not free. Overall, good experience and I would stay here again.

This hotel is a wonderful value. It is located right on the beach and located next to restaurants and shops within walking distance. Boats take off for snorkeling and other tours nearby. The staff is so nice and you can get involved with native Hawaiian culture. It is not the place to go for fancy water slides and extensive grottos and landscaped grounds. It is more a quiet escape where the beach and nearby snorkelling is the attraction. We've been back several times. Fantastic Sunday Brunch!

I read the hotel reviews here on TripAdvisor, both the good and the bad. I was concerned about the size of the room since that seemed to be the most often mentioned drawback. The hotel was centrally located for the football stadium and Pike's Market and was one of the lesser expensive options so we decided to risk it, figuring we wouldn't be spending much time in our room anyway. I love the modern look to this hotel! We were on the fifth floor - the ROCK STAR floor (5th floor). All the room doors at the Max have pictures on them. Ours was Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. The room was pleasingly large and not at all what I expected. Flat screen tv, mini bar, fridge, snack bar, wine, etc. all available for a fee of course. The room was clean and very attractive but had a view of the roof and the building next door but we could see sky and a sliver of water too. The only draw back was while they called it Queen Size room the bed was really a double. I did not complain because I liked the room and could handle a double bed for four days! The hotel staff was great and helped my husband surprise me with roses in our room upon arrival. The doormen for the most part knew there stuff, except one, who could not direct us to a B of A, ATM which turned out to be right across the street.

You really can't get much better as far as location is concerned in downtown Seattle. We were right in the heart of everything. Walking distance to Space Needle and Pike's Market, and the start/finish of the Seattle Rock and Roll Marathon. The rooms were quaint, nothing special, but clean and nice. They have the older-style elevators which were fun and the lobby joins to a Seattle's Best Coffee Shop, which is convenient. It's a little inconvenient that the lobby and the entrance to the elevators are separated by about 10 steps, which means you have to drag your luggage up those steps to get to the elevator. Overall, not that big of a deal. The bell-hop, Stanley, was so helpful to us in pointing us toward the right eateries and attractions, so ask for Stanley!

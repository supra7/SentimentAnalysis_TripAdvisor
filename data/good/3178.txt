We had an exceptional stay in an executive suite. The exec suite had the feel of a comfortable apartment complete with two full bathrooms (one with tub) well stocked with Molten Brown products , living area with fireplace, full windows on all sides, nice kitchenette (loved the expresso machine!) , a quaint patio, and more. It felt quite spacious and luxurious. Other tidbits : - We had room service which was fantastic (duck breast with sweet potato gnocchi .. mmmm). - The fitness center was way above average : large and with the best equipment. - Beds and linens were heavenly as well - Staff was extremely helpful On a side note : - Some of our traveling companions had a superior suite.... and it was VERY small almost to the point feeling crowded in with too much furniture. Night and day compared to the "executive suite". So if it is within your budget, I highly recommend it over the "superior" .

We just returned from a five days stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel (Oct. 30 to Nov. 4, 2010). We were there to celebrate my 50th birthday and were so very happy with our decision to stay at the KBH. The location is simply perfect! We were really impressed by the view of our top floor Ocean Front room. Breathtaking! We enjoyed the view particularly in the morning and before dinner. The sunsets were absolutely spectacular ! The hotel is a bit old but well maintained. Our room was well cleaned and we always had fresh towels and sheets. The grounds are beautiful, the beach is awesome and the food is good (we had lunch a couple of times and dinner once, after a trip to Hana). We only have good comments about the staff. Very friendly and hard workers, they do a wonderful job! Finally, the Aloha ceremony before we left was very touching and made it even more difficult for us to leave. If we ever go back to Mau, we would definitely stay at the KBH again!

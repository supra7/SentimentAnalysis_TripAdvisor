We stayed at the Moore from August 27 - Sept. 2 in a "3 bedroom suite." It wasn't exactly as one would expect: one entered, and had to pass through, one bedroom to get to the others. The bathroom was off of another of the bedrooms. But since we were all friends traveling together, it wasn't too bad. There were doors between each bedroom, so you could have privacy if you needed it. There were no kitchen facilities, but there was a small fridge in one room, and a sink in another. Two bedrooms had tvs. It was a shame to be so close to Pike's Place Market without kitchen facilities, but there were lots of good restaurants nearby. The location was great for being able to see the touristy sites. I took a public bus in from the airport, the hotel was only a block away. In fact, when we finally picked up a rental car, we just left it in the garage for 3 days, rather than deal with the whims of Seattle's meter maids. We had a view of the bay from one room, and the Space Needle from two of the rooms. The bar across the street tends to be a bit rowdy at night, and there was always some "interesting" activity down on the street at nights, but we weren't concerned about safety when walking about late at night. Almost as bad as the bar was a nest of raucous seagulls atop the apartment across the street - who needs a wake-up call? With the coupon, the week cost us $335 per person. It would be hard to find a better deal in such a convenient location.

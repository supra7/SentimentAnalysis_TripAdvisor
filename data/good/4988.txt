Very good boutique style hotel in an excellent location and great value for money if booked via the internet. The rooms are fairly small and really just for sleeping in but the fittings are good and my double bed very comfortable. My room had a marble lined double door walk-in shower and a marble washbasin within room itself. There was a big flat screen satellite TV but a lot of the channels were locked out. There was a good breakfast buffet selection which was certainly fine enough for a few days stay. Recommended

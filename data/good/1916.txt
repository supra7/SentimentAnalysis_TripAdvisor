Stayed at the Westin in early December. We were upgraded to one of the rooms on the higher floors, so we had an absolutely amazing view of the city and the water. The room itself was a bit tight (but it may just have been the specific room that we had). One great thing about the hotel were the roll-out beds. I've seen a lot of roll out beds in hotels that have a one inch thick mattress, the Westin was an exception to this. The mattress on the roll-out bed was just as thick as the mattress on the actual bed and it was extremely comfortable! The rooms were quiet (never heard our neighbours) and it was a perfect location for exploring the city by foot and also for catching a cab. The only negative thing I can say about this hotel was in regards to the valet parking. Aside from the fees being quite high, and the "you park" lot appearing inaccessible, when we would drop off the car for valet we would often wait for up to ten minutes (even if there was only one car in front of us). Twice we had to get out of the car to get someone's attention to take the car and give us a ticket for the valet. Aside from that it was a great stay!

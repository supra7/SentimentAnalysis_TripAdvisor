The lobby and concierge staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a couple of Acura's with drivers who will take you wherever you want to go locally during the day. (helpful if you don't want to walk across town or don't know where you're going) The drivers were very nice. The rooms need to have curtains -- the room I was in only had blinds and it was light very early in the morning in July. Good overall experience. Excellent location.

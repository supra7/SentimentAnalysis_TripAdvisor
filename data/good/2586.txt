The Hotel Max is an old downtown hotel that's been redecorated with art and interesting colors. The staff were friendly and we were able to check in about 3 hours early. The rooms are on the small side, but clean and comfortable and mostly quiet. Linens are nice. We were on the 8th floor and the street traffic noise was pretty loud - old windows. The room was on the cold side, but would heat up quickly with the window unit. But the bathroom stayed cool. And you have to step UP to get into the bathroom. The elevators are small and a good way to meet people. Nice exercise room and there are 2 computers and printer available for your use in a room off the lobby. The location is handy and easy walking to all the downtown/Pike Market/Pioneer Square spots. I'd only stay here again if I got the room for a really good price. I've stayed in other downtown Seattle hotels for less and gotten more.

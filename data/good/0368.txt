Spent 2 nights here in September 2011 and had a lovely stay. Our room was very spacious with a beautiful view of the Space Needle. The bed was very comfortable, one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. The room was clean and we had everything we needed. Only complaint about the room was that it was a handicapped bathroom so there was just an open shower with no sides, therefore we flooded the bathroom each time we took a shower. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We didn't try the food in the hotel restaurant as it was a bit pricey for us. The location was excellent. A short walk of 2 blocks to the light rail station which took us to the airport. And only a 10 minute walk to the market and the bay. Pretty much a 10 minute walk to all the attractions in downtown. Would definitely stay here again.

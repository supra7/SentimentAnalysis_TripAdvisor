My colleague refused to stay at this hotel because he said the noise was unbearable. I wanted the points and told the front I wanted a quiet room. They placed me right over the freeway, and by morning I wanted to shoot the front desk. I insisted they move me away from the freeway, they did and my next two nights were wonderful. Room and small but very nice and clean. Room service and the food was really terrific! The morning buffet was nice and the service was amazing with some of the friendliest servers ever. The only problem I found was at the front desk ... They are not helpful or pleasant and they will try to stick you in the worse rooms. Insist on good placement and rooms away from the highway!!!!

After reading the positive reviews about this hotel in that it's clean and basic I was sold for staying in it one night for seeing a gig in London. Me and my mate got a twin room for 42 with breakfast through Octopus travel which I felt was a total bargain, considering some hostels were looking for 45 each for a night!!! When we arrived we were greeted warmly and told that we were being upgraded to a family room as there were no twin rooms left. Our room was pretty huge for the two of us and very clean. I was thoroughly impressed for the amount of money we had spent. We both felt as female travellers to be safe and secure not only in our room but in the hotel. Location wise it was amazing for getting to Brixton Academy and on return we felt safe walking from the Underground to the hotel. I admit that I sleep with ear plugs and eye mask wherever I go so I had no problems sleeping but my friend did say that folk were noisy when walking along the corridors in the wee hours of the morning. But that's to be expected in all hotels! Breakfast was fantastic for the money. There was choices of fresh orange and apple juice, 4 types of cereals, white and brown bread/ toast, jams, tea and coffee. It was buffet style so you could pretty much eat as much as you wanted, which was definitely taken up by the guy at the next table who had 6 rounds of toast and 4 bowls of cereal!! Everything was clean and well laid out in the breakfast room. All in all I was very impressed for the money. It isn't the Ritz but if you need a hotel with excellent location and you use it as somewhere to get your head down for a night or two I would highly recommend it!

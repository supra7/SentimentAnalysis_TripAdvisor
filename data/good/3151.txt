Although the location is not within the best district or street in Berlin, the price and the room makes the balance. Staff were very friendly and very helpful, i had a problem with an internet booking and they were able to help me in it and another problem occured with the check-in (not the room i booked),however to make it up, i was offered breakfast and free internet (its not usually). If you have a mid budget (129 EUR),go to this hotel and book a penthouse, its a huge room (kind of apartment) with a terrasse, i was surprised when i saw the size with 2 LCDs and one corner sofa, its worth the price. As for the transportation, there is a bus stop just in front of the hotel entrance and its very easy to take the underground as well, one great thing about the underground in berlin which amazed me is the non stop operation in the week end (24hr)!!! 2 negative points about this hotel: 1. breakfast is poor and the breakfast hall is in the lobby (verz small) 2. Black color is too much invading the style, i mean that everything is black :from breakfast paper towels to walls to elevator ...

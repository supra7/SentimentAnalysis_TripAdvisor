The Lower East Side of Manhatten offers some great places for music & eats at a reasonable price. The Hotel East Houston is the perfect location to access the fun. The Hotel has a cool vibe - simple, Asian influences. The place is small but offers everything neccessary including a pleasant complementary breakfast. The 7th floor deck must be awesome in nice weather. The staff was helpful and attentive. Be sure to check out the Rockwood for great music and "The French Diner" for a unique lunch.

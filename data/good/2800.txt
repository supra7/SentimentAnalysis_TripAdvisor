Airport hotel with shuttle service. Staff is friendly, lots of airline personnel staying at hotel. Conducted 2 day seminar at hotel. Banquet stff were friendly and helpful, meeting room was small for 35 people, breakfast and lunch buffets were good--not great. Staff checked in and were attentive. Had truoble finding plug-in in my room that was near the bed--mvoved mattresses at headboard and there was very, very thick layer of dust on carpeting beneath headboard area. Room furnishings were older but in okay condition. Bathroom had adequate counter space but mold in shower corner. Flat screen TV but not Hi-Def. No make-up mirrors. BEST part of of room was nice fresh BEDDING and pillows. Starbucks is served in lobby with some breakfast items--including hardboiled eggs! Dinner from grill with one beer, salad and appetizer with tip was $28 and not worth it--the craft beer was the best part of the meal. Shuttle travels at regular intervals but often not enough--however getting a cab to take you to the airport is apparently difficult--hotel could not do this even with 4 hours lead time on request. Printing out boarding passes is quick and easy at lobby Kiosk.

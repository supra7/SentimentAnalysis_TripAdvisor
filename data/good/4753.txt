We just got back from 2 weeks at the Eldorado. We were in a privately owned condo - beautifully appointed, clean, wonderful view, and great location. We even had use of the grill on our balcony, which allowed us to cook in several times and splurge on some nice dinners. The walk to the beach took less than 5 minutes. We found the staff at the Eldorado to be very friendly and accommodating. I do know that some of the units are in need of an upgrade. You can request a recently remodeled unit or even ask to move if you are not satisfied with the one you are assigned. I recommend this property for anyone who wants reasonable prices, great location, and space to move around in.

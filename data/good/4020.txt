I am not considering it as a 5* hotel, but as a 4* one it is fabulous. Rooms are very small 25msq but very cozy and clean. Bosphorus view is great but a little bit noisy because there is a Bus Station right under the Bosphorus side of te building. We stayed in a corner room with a nice view. Actually there are some very small deficits there, e.g. very small bathroom, not a van inside the bathroom. some accessories do not exist like toothpaste, toothbrush, "do not disturb" sign. Breakfast buffet is very good with fresh and delicious stuff, but is closed and sometimes it is nice to eat breakfast or have a rest in an open area restaurant or cafe at the hotel. The roof restaurant was closed. Totally the hotel is very small and far from the imagination you have of Gran Hyatt, Swissotel, Hilton, etc. but according to the price it seems reasonable. The very best point is the location and closeness to the Taxim Square and Dolmabahce Sarayi. Also the metro station is very close. The free wireless internet is the other good point. Minibar and in-room services are very expensive, not recommended. Also, no balcony if you want to smoke. No pool but there is a nice and new spa and fitness center, although the massage price is very expensive. In total, staying in this hotel is very pleasant unless you do not compare it to other high ranked hotels like mentioned above.

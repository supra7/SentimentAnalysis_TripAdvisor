My boyfriend and I recently stayed here. I had done my research and noticed that a lot of reviewers mentioned that the rooms were a little small. I contacted the Max Daddy (a.k.a. - Chris Bebo), and asked to have a larger room. He not only booked us in a larger Artist King room, but also gave me the additional pricing if I wanted to upgrade to the Deluxe Rooms. We stuck with the larger artist king since we were only staying for 4 nights. It was perfect for the two of us. We had a great view and it was a cozy and hip room. The hotel and rooms really reminded me of a smaller, less expensive W that I have stayed at in NYC. There is little storage space and the bathroom is small. When I did more research, I found out that Hotel Max used to be an older hotel, which explains the smaller bathrooms. I personally thought they were cute and completely sufficient. To solve the storage problems, I asked for more hangers and less than 10 minutes later, we had them. The staff was very helpful, someone was always at the front desk for any questions or needs we had. Harry made sure we had a cab for our night out and a car for the airport. I HIGHLY recommend getting a car instead of a cab. It's cheaper, safer and nicer of an automobile. Also, the hotel is close to many attractions, shopping and restaurants. We only needed to cab somewhere once, we were able to walk everywhere else. I definitely like the boutique feel that a lot of hotels are doing nowadays and Hotel Max does that, but with much cheaper pricing, but not cheap service. Needless to say, we really enjoyed our stay and time in Seattle. If we were to visit again in the near future, I would definitely stay at Hotel Max!

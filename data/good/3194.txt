I have to agree with a precious review about the French manager, how annoying he was, the poor workers who have to endure this guy... I was having a drink at the bar and I could hear him yelling at the bartender how he wanted the glasses to shine, needless to say their are ways to talk to people. Stayed at this hotel for the first time and loved the view from the window... Could see the bell center. I loved the hot tube on the roof and found the pool to be perfect temperature for me.

A good location for anyone who is trying to get a neutral walking friendly location. With the exception of the Space Needle you can walk to most attractions including Pike Place Market and the stadiums. We were treated exceptionally by the staff, which really made this property shine. We felt like it was five-star white-glove treatment, the rooms were more on par with the 4* rating and the room could have been cleaner (windows/bathroom were a bit dirty upon check-in) but we did get a corner king upgrade with a fantastic bedroom panoramic view of the city. Be careful of the On Demand Network TV Shows  you will be charged without even seeing the price or a confirmation screen. Also, you can park on the street from 6pm to 8am for free and there is plenty of spots. If you go for a weekend, Sunday parking is also free.

We did not stay here, but wished we had. We stopped by the hotel for drinks and to check out the view. We lounged in the sitting area with fireplaces and comfortable chairs and couches. It was cold and rainy outside -which made this a cozy place to relax with a cup of coffee, hot chocolate, or glass of wine. The children played checkers while the adults enjoyed the ambiance of the fireplace. (Coffee mocha $7, glass of house wine $11-$14). The guys working the valet were extra nice and helpful.

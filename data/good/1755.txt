We stayed two nights in a city view room overlooking the front entrance. Whilst we didn't have the glorious views of the bay like my sister's room, it was beautiful to see Seattle lit up at night. The room was surprisingly large with two (small) double beds. It made for a rather cosy couple of nights. The bathroom was modern and well finished. The hotel is a mix between a lodge cabin and a metal and glass. The combination works surprisngly well. They have made full use of the view of the bay. We ate only breakfast at the hotel, and the eggs bebendict were superb. You have to ask for a children's menu - as it is not offered automatically, and is a fraction of the cost of the adult menu. There was a wedding going on on one of the evenings, so a good evening to go down the pier walk and make our way to the Crab House. Superb service there, and the crab legs were amazing. The hotel staff were polite and efficient - and would be happy to stay there again. Enjoy.

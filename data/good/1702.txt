The Edgewater's lobby is lovely in an upscale hunting lodge sort of way, and the view from the bar and restaurant is stunning, especially near sunset. Room decor, though stylish (especially the rock/slate showers), needs some paint retouching and decorative pillow laundering. We kept ours off the bed. Every hour until 9PM, the hotel shuttle will take you anywhere within a large downtown area. Be advised that it leaves ONLY on the hour, so make your dinner reservations for 10 minutes past the hour to arrive on time. They will also pick you up at the Amtrak station, but again, it will only be right past the top of the hour. The shuttle will also take you to Westlake Center from where you can catch the train to airport for about $2.50! There is also a free bus, #99, right outside the hotel. It takes you in a large loop down the waterfront, then around and back down 1st Avenue and eventually to the hotel. We booked this hotel because my husband loves seeing the water outside his window. It was fun seeing the constant traffic of ferries off to the left from our balcony, and more rarely, a cruise ship outside the window. Most cruise lines dock much farther down Alaskan Way. This is the only hotel built on a pier on the water. The Marriott looked nice and calls itself "waterfront", but it's across Alaskan Way (4 lanes of traffic) from the water.

Secrets is a nice resort tucked far away from everything in Riviera Maya. We stayed at Iberostar last year and wanted to try something different this year. The swim-up rooms piqued our interest about this property, and the good reviews from nearly everyone. Its true  it is a very nice property and the food and drink were about as good as you can get from an all-inclusive. The set-up of the property differentiates it from Iberostar  nearly everything is outdoors and there is a lot of vegetation near the pools and rooms so much that it brings mosquitoes and bugs which I did not care for. However the rest of my travel companions liked the fact that Secrets draws a younger crowd; I personally liked that Iberostar was not as crowded. The beach is also really nice  we went swimming in the ocean every day and it felt great. That and there are no rocks so you dont have to wear shoes. The Italian, French and Mexican restaurants were all very good. You do get very friendly and personalized service here. Really the only thing that bothered me were the bugs. Iberostar Grand is definitely more higher end as far as the property goes, outfitted with marble, statues, flowers, plants, etc. Ultimately just comes down to your preference and what you want out of a vacation.

The immaculate setting of this hotel is hard to beat; and I've stayed in some great hotels. the rooms are large, clean and well-equiped, with excellent room service. The beach is wonderful and kept in great condition. There is no real system for signing for your drinks or food on the beach so, if oyu want to keep control of your expenses through the day, keep a strict list of what you have to drink and eat. We found that breakfast was good and substantial, but dinners were small in size but large in price. Take a tip and eat from the bar menu. The activities are expensive ($220 for a two tank scuba dive) so plan ahead with other operators.

We just came back from a week vacation in Maui. We loved the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. Although the facilities are not as nice as those of some other resorts and the rooms are modest, we loved the location (perfect spot on the beach and close to Black Rock, turtles and great snorkeling) and the staff was VERY friendly. In addition, it is really the most Hawaiian hotel in Maui, and the sunsets, which you can see from the hotel, are spectacular. It is also within a pleasant walk to Whalers Village, where you can shop and have dinner in some very nice oceanfront cafes. I really recommend this hotel if you are an ocean lover. If you want a nice swimming pool go elsewhere. I have to say that we spent the last night at the Hyatt in Kaanapali Beach, and although the resort in luxurious and beautiful we wished that we had stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. In comparison, the Hyatt felt impersonal and the spot on the beach is not good for swimming or snorkeling.

I must say that there are many very good things to say about this property. Yes the beach is the best we've seen. It was quiet and romantic. The staff was attentive and helpful. But it wasn't a 5 star goumet experience. Don't get me wrong, the food was good for the most part. But it lacked the WOW factor and the selection was somewhat limited. We were put on a wait list for dinner twice during our stay. This wasn't expected at a resort that doesn't require reservations. I can't understand why no other reviews mentioned the smell of sewer gas that was evident for 3 of the days during our stay. The management said it was gas from the Mangrove swamp adjacent to the resort. However, we think it had something to do with the marina that is directly north of the property. It can't be a coincidence that we only smelled it when the wind came from the north. The marina also was dredging to remove sand and deposit it directly in front of the hotel. This process went on for 6 of the 7 days we were there.The result was churned up sandy water that should have been crystal clear. I should also mention that the water was only 1 or 2 feet deep in front of the holel. This is due to to the continuous depositing of sand from the dredging operation. It wasn't worth the money we spent and I honestly would not recommend this property.

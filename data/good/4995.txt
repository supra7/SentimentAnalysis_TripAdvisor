As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms at this hotel are very small, and the only furniture has the air of cheap flat-pack (desk/wardrobe). However, the tiny bathrooms are modern and well decorated, and it's unlikely you'd want to spend too much time in your hotel whilst in Istanbul anyway. The pool area was understaffed at times so it got a little untidy and meant getting your own towels (no hardship, but still...). The enitre hotel is poorly lit in a deliberate way that is meant to be chic, but I wouldn't have been very happy about this if I had any sight/mobility problems. The breakfast terrace area is lovely and is a taste of what is essentially the best thing about the hotel - the location. Beyoglu is full of lovely little winding streets and alleyways that at night are home to laid back bars and restaurants that feel so much less touristy than those in the Sultanahmet area.

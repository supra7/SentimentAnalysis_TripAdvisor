We have just returned from a four night stay in this hotel with our 22 month old (very active son) and parents in law. We have stayed in Rome before and have always found it hard to get a decent, fairly central and not too expensive hotel. While this hotel is not at the centre of things, it is very well connected by bus and metro to all the major sights, the Colesseum and Piazzo del Spagna being only three or four stops away by metro. Our first impression was of a small but very clean, modern hotel set in a period building. The neighbourhood was quiet. . The room was fairly small but not as small as some Italian hotels we have stayed in and the space was very well designed and utilised. The staff here are what makes the hotel so good - they were really friendly, welcoming, knowledgeable, efficient and helpful. While the bar didn't seem to be in use, this wasn't a problem for us but may be for others. We ate in the pizzeria down the street the first night and it was perfect for us after getting off a lateish flight. The hotel is located near to the San Giovanni area which is well worth a stroll to. It is a very picturesque part of town and there was a market taking place the day we walked there which was a Thursday. Also, for anyone with kids, there is a very nice and safe playground near the hotel with some very friendly Roman children to play with. All in all, we had an excellent stay at this hotel - it was surprisingly good for what we had experienced in the past. Well done to the owners for employing such great staff!

When we arrived at Domus Ester we were quite apprehensive after seeing the outside, a graffiti lined alley, but were pleasantly surprised when we made it up to the hotel (on 2nd/3rd floors of building, no lift but luckily the staff were insistent on carrying our bags for us). It had taken us quite a while to find hotel, the directions on the website are awful and the road wasn't marked on our map, luckily a helpful shopowner pointed us in the right direction! Look it up on Google Maps before you go, also take note of their phone number incase you get lost. The staff were very friendly and helpful, gave us directions/advice, happy to let us leave our bags after check-out. Our room was tiny, barely room to fit both our suitcases but very well decorated, beds were comfy, air con worked well enough and bathroom was clean and looked new. Breakfast was basic but what you expect in Italy, and served in your room as no breakfast room etc. Location was ideal, very close to lots of restaurants/bars and within walking distance to all the main sights (although we were lazy and took a bus to the Vatican). Walls were thin as commented in previous reviews but rarely noticed this, luckily had quiet neighbours! All in all a good stay, room very small but adequate for a few days sightseeing, staff friendly and helpful and very good location. Could be cheaper but is central Rome!

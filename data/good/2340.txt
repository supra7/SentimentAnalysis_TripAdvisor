I had high expectations that this property was going to be top-tier, but was disappointed that it was no different than any other full-service hotel. I had a good deal because otherwise this was totally out of my price range, but I can't figure out why. I had a co-worker as me when I returned if the W Seattle was the best hotel that I have ever stayed at and I replied that no it wasn't even close. I guess I was disappointed that the W did not live up to its excellent reputation.

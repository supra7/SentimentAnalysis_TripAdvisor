If you want to be in the heart of downtown Seattle, you can't get any better than this location. I booked in for 2 nights to attend the Emerald City Comic Convention in early March. 4 blocks away, walking distance, not a probably for haling my film gear ( occasionally with my costume on!). If you are coming down from Vancouver, BC, like me, the hotel is just off the highway. I was on the 26th floor. The view of Downtown Seattle is perfect. Sunrise view. Restaurant served simply and rustic breakfast, the bar had a happy hour beer selection. Good thing there were internet stations because I didn't bring my computer along, but they do have wireless. Slept well, very quiet. Friendly staff.

Great Staff, excellent service, beautiful resort with the best beach in riviera maya!!! however, one thing really struck a nerve with me, it was "freaking" hot!!!we were there last week, july being known to be a hot and humid month in the region, you would expect that all the A/Cs would be working in a 5 star hotel!!!but not SMB, our room (while gorgeously decorated) never cooled to below 74 degrees. called for maintenance twice, they said they fixed it, but we never felt the difference. also, some of the common areas like the lobby and gym (!!!)don't have A/C certain times of the day. this hotel charges 600+/night, i expect to have airconditioning for that price!!! would i recommend this hotel? yes i would....(just go on the cooler months),,,,

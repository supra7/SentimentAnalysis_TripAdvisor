My wife son and I stayed at the Edgewater this past labor Day and really enjoyed our stay. Stayed in the room on 1st floor facing the ocean and it was almost at sea level. Beautiful views of Mt St. Helena and a fireplace in the room what more could you ask for...well being alone with my wife for one thing. The bathroom had a remarkable rock designed theme. The hotel is right next to the Clipper Lines that bring you in from Vancouver/Victoria. This hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to Pikes Fish Market and the hotel is on the free bus route to take you to Pioneer Square or a short walk to the Space Needle. The restaurant in the hotel has an excellent brunch. Don't miss all the music memorabilia off the front desk in a sitting room. Great romantic place even though we had our son with us. Would stay there again

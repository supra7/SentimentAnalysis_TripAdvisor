This is the friendliest hotel I have been to since the mid-60's. The rooms are not exciting but no problems either. The location is great - on Ka'anapali Beach you want to be between the Whaler's Village (shopping and restaurants) and the Black Rock (Sheraton - for snorkeling). The hotel is not as crowded as the other here. Buildings are less than half the height of any of the other hotels and there is a large central lawn/garden/pool area. However, the buildings appear to be older, but very well kept up. Staff is great. I recommend the free nightly music at the Tiki Bar - many folks don't seem to buy anything but just enjoy the music. Wonderful friendly staff.

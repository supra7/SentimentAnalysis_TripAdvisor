Just returned from another great stay at the Warwick. I can't imagine there's a better deal in downtown Seattle especially if your rate includes parking as ours did. The staff are friendly and very helpful, our room (not one of the newly renovated ones) was comfortable and clean. Perhaps on our next visit we'll splurge and try a renovated room but really we had no complaints!

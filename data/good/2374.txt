Pros: Our room was spacious and updated, no problems with room or bathroom. Nice big double windows and lots of light (we chose a higher floor). Quiet. We liked the location and walked to the farmer's market, art museum, library, galleries, space needle, sculpture park, etc. Bar was nice but small and unpopulated (we went to many small local places and the busy Four Seasons on the waterfront nearby for drinks instead). Cons: While the help desk was great in person for directions and etc., calling for any amenities was not. We called several times for toilet paper (only had 1 roll for 4 nights/2 people), waited over an hour, and no one ever came. We finally tracked down the maid in the hall ourselves. Parking was really expensive at over $40 per day. Hallways dark as mentioned by others.

The hotel is located close to the metro. Friendly front desk. The rooms are very small,but i knew that in advance. They serve a simple continental breakfast. In singapore this is very good value for money. Everything was clean, and it's not allowed anymore to rent out rooms per hour so you don't have to be afraid of a certain kind of public. You can leave your bags for free in a locked room. So al together good value for money in a simple hotel.

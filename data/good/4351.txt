We stayed at the Hyatt over Christmas this year, splitting our stay between Hyatt and Fairmont Kea Lani. We really enjoyed the Hyatt much more. Nice property, comfortable well kept rooms - bed are unusually comfortable by Hyatt standards. We were on the concierge floor which was nice for breakfast and evening cocktails and pre-dinner snacks. The pool is expansive and also well kept. The Spa is top notch and the workout faciltity recently updated and expansive. The food is generally good, not great, and typically high priced for Hawaii. We did not try the high end Swan Court which is said to be very good or the luau which was fully packed every night. Only negative is the beach - its small and coral really precludes more than wading in a few feet. But a ten minute walk up the beach (in front of Marriott and beyond) and it opens up with surfing classes, volleyball and body surfing. I can recommend the Hyatt, particularly if you frequent Hyatt properties - this is a good one. Would easily choose it over the Kea Lani on a next visit.

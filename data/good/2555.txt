I booked a room at this hotel using an online special that included valet parking and a credit to the restaurant next door all at a discount since we are from the NW. The front desk and valet service was friendly and attentive. Check in was a breeze. Based on all the other reviews here I expected the room would be on the small side so that was not a surprise at all. The bathroom and shower were smaller than I expected though but we managed. The decor was fun and hip. We appreciated the minibar and fridge as well as the pillow menu. We found the lobby to be very comfortable but I did notice that some of the furnishings were looking a little worse for wear (blue ottomans near fireplace). The location was fantastic. We walked to a show at the Paramount, took a cab to dinner, walked to an arcade and then back to the hotel one night. The next day we walked around and did a little shopping downtown. It was very nice to be close to everything. We also enjoyed happy hour at the adjacent restaurant. Liked Best: Service at front desk, valet Liked Least: Tiny shower :)

The Hotel Max has taken an older property and provided a fun flair. The doormen and front desk are very friendly and willing to help. The rooms are a tad small, but for business travel that is alright. The biggest drawback I saw was the manual thermostat on the heating/cooling unit. I would have preferred a wall-mount thermostat. The Internet quality was average. VPN was sometimes difficult due to latency from their Internet provider.

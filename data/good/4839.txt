My family of four had a reservation via our tour agent for 2 superior rooms for 2 nights. Our flight arrived early in the morning and when we tried to check in, we were told that if we check in earlier than 2pm we had to pay an extra AED200 for the two rooms, otherwise, the reception staff offered us an upgrade to a Executive Suite with 2 bedrooms inside it at the same extra cost and we could check in immediately. We took the offer and was quite satisfied with the suite. The Suite was reasonably clean in the bedroom, but not consistently, like the sofa chairs in the small living area had stains on the cover. There was only one bathrobe and one pair of bedroom slippers in each room, this is a small detail but it could have made the stay even more comfortable, considering that there were four of us. The best thing about the suite is the bed. We had king beds in both rooms, they were really comfortable! The jacuzzi in one of the bathrooms was a nice touch, there was also a shower cubicle, but the tap didn't seem to work though. Breakfast on the first day was average and on the second morning, the hotel thoughtfully arranged for an early morning breakfast, at 4.30am, so that we won't miss our flight at 7.30am. Even though it was just some simple bread and coffee, it was the thoughtfulness that we appreciate. The hotel is near to the Deira Centre metro station, only less than 5min walk. Otherwise taxis are easily flagged down, even though the hotel's location seemed to be quite deserted, next to a site under construction. On the morning when we left at 5.30am, the concierge got us a taxi in seconds!

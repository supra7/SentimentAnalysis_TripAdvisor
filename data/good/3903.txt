This is a huge, quality hotel with plenty of facilites and in a great location. We had a good room, not as well appointed as other Hiltons that we've stayed in (e.g. no fridge/mini bar) but we actually wanted for nothing and were very comfortable. This hotel is last in the line of hotels on the bayfront so depending on where you stay in the hotel, you could have an industrial view of many shipping containers, as it's next to a dock area. Despite this, the location is excellent - the Gas Lamp Quarter is just across the road, the bayfront path which you can walk along to Seaport Village is just outside and it is also very close to the Trolley system. This hotel hosts a lot of conferences, so it may seem a bit "businessy" if you are there on vacation. If you have a car with you, they charge almost $30 per night for parking. Whilst we were there, a major power outage occurred in the area. The management of this hotel handled the situation very well.

I was in town for a concert with my girl firend, overall nice experience. The hotel is located in the middle of business district and next to the library. The hotel lobby has nice welcome feel. The front desk staff was very welcoming, inform us of live music at the bar that evening and provided direction when needed. At one point room door ran out of battery and we had to call for both an engineer and security. The wait was longer than expected (20 minutes), with that said the staff were friendly and enjoyable to talk to. The good: - Very friendly staff - Room and hotel is clean and welcoming. - Average sized room and bathroom The not so good: - The lack of easy pickup and drop off area (its just side of road) - The Cost of Parking - Internet is not free Overall its a nice hotel for short stay or for business. As a tourist this might be out of the way from most attractions.

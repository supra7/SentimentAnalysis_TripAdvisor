After reading some of the reviews I was a little sceptical going here. Especially as we rolled up to the hotel the surrounding area is a dive! However, the hotel staff were amazing. They gave us maps, directions to everything and where places were easy to walk to. Really helpful. The tube (Rebbebia) is literally a 5 minute walk away and within 15 minutes you are in the main city of Rome. It was dead handy! (3 day ticket is 12 euro- bargain!) The hotel was clean, sheets changed everyday. I could have done with an extra pillow but that's just my preference. The breakfast was a bit rubbish but what do you expect when you go on the cheap. It had everything we needed and we would stay here again if we ever come back to Rome.

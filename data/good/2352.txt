I have been here twice, and each time, I have had a fabulous stay. Overall, it's not a super huge hotel, but it is very nice. The hotel is centrally located downtown. The rooms are a reasonable size, and they are extremely clean. They have electronic safes. The rooms are quiet. The bathrooms are very nice, not super-luxurious, but nice. There is nowhere to park around the hotel, and there is a Starbucks across the street. overall, it's a very good place. The gym is very small, but good enough for cardio.

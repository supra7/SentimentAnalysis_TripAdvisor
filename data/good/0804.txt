We stayed here before a cruise last week. The location is great, the price is right, and the rooms are decent. The staff was very helpful. If you want to pay $250 a night for a few hours in a room go ahead, but I would saty here again in a minute. The bathroom was fine. Small TV, but your not there to watch TV. Don't expect the Ritz, but you will do fine. You can keep your luggae in a closet while you chaeck out Seattle before the cruise. Take a Taxi to the cruise. They will call the cab. Thanks Moore Hotel!!

I didn't know what to expect with the Hotel Max. My mother and I had stayed several times before at the Vance Hotel. We found our room to be very comfortable and clean. Super kushy beds. We asked for a quiet room and got a room on the top floor and we slept really well. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They seemed a little green though at times and one employee was downright rude. Although, I think he didn't know what he was doing (helping us when our electronic key wouldn't work). In all I was very pleasantly surprised by the service, standards and cleanliness. One particular bellhop was very sweet and went above and beyond. Thanks Andrew...Great location two blocks from shopping and 6 blocks from the Pike Place Market.

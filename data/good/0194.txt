We stayed here for 2 nights before an Alaska cruise and we loved it. Make sure you ask for a room on a higher floor with a view of the Space Needle. The entire staff is very friendly and informative. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel and its was very good. You'll be within walking distance of the monorail and waterfront area. Stop by Cascadia and have a martini with a scoop of Douglas fir sorbet. I'm not kidding, it's great!

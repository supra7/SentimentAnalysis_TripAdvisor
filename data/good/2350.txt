We celebrated our anniversary at the W and loved the hotel. While it is more subdued than many W Hotels we have been to before with less of a party scene or posh bar, it had the superb service that all W Hotels have and the location was perfect for us. The staff delivered complimentary champagne to our room without us asking to celebrate our anniversary and then happily suggested restaurants in the area. We had done our homework and already had a good idea of where we wanted to eat, but we were glad to see they had similar suggestions-- made us think they really knew what they were talking about! Since we were there for July 4th weekend they were very helpful in giving us off the cuff suggestions on where to watch fireworks and not have to be in huge crowds. The location is about 3 blocks from Seattle Market, so we walked almost everywhere during the day...WEAR FLATS!!!! (made that mistake day 1 and didn't forget it! ) The concierge made sure to have transportation lined up within 10 minutes when we needed a car. Rooms were updated and comfortable... look out for special deals- we got an EXCELLENT rate on kayak and were very pleased.

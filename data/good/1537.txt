Excellent value for money in downtown Seattle! Within walking distance from the Greyhound terminal and the business district. Parking space also available. Quality in-house restaurant, good breakfast, lounge with fireplace. WiFi is only available in the lounge and restaurant, and is of terrible quality (I never managed to get online).

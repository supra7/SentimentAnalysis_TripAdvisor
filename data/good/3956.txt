The hotel is cleaned, well maintained and just beautiful! We had an amazing view of the bay which was the best part of our stay! Nice outdoor cozy fire place at night and good restaurants and bar in the hotel. The only down side is parking fee for $25 a day!!! Other than that, staff were professional and friendly.

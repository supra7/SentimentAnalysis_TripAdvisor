My friend and I stayed here over New Years and had a great time! The beach is beautiful as is the overall scenery. While I feel that this resort is meant more for a honeymooning couple, I am glad I had the pleasure of staying here. The room was huge and had EVERYTHING including a washer/dryer. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a relaxing vacation.

The hotel seemed to match its 4 star rating. Very professional staff, clean and impressive rooms. It wasn't perfect though. The halls and elevators need a little update but it's a busy place. I got a special rate through my professional association at $214 per night. Note that the hotel is one block away from the convention center and within walking distance of Pikes Place Market.

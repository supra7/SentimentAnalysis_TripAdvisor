Stayed at the Hyatt for eight nights. The bed was comfortable and room had a 37" LG flat screen, but the furniture and bath area was pretty dated. The lobby, pool and grounds are beautiful. Half the pool is 6'-9' deep so it doesn't get crowded with a lot of people standing around in the water. Had dinner at Son'z that was fantastic ($150). Good location since it's close to town and also with the river walk right next to the pool. Keep valuables away from the pool and beach. Another couple we spoke to got their wallets stolen on the first day while in the pool.

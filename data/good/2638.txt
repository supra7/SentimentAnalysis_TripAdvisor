My wife and I stayed at Hotel Max on our trip to Seattle during the last weekend in August. We booked the standard queen room thru Orbitz for $199 per night (parking was an additional $20 per day) Pros: VERY friendly and helpful staff, the entire hotel was nicely decorated in ultra-modern style, the location was EXCELLENT just a few blocks from shopping, the Public Market and Space Needle. Safe walking at night. Room was nicely decorated, bed was very comfortable, nice LCD flat-panel TV. Free internet browsing on the computers in the business center on 1st floor. Cons: Drinking glass left in the hallway by previous tenant when we arrived at 4pm and throughout the evening. VERY small room and even smaller bathroom. Musty smelling shower curtain, no doubt because the bathroom door is shut most of the time. Musty pillowcase. Noisy air conditioning unit. Very swanky asian restaurant/sushi bar attached to hotel, meant limited in-room meal options. Summary: Hotel Max was very nice and excellently located. Above average, but not excellent. Maybe try a room larger than the standard queen next time.

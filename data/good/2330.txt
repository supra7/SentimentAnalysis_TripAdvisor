There are many reasons to like the w. I love the lobby bar and the constant flow of people and events out of this downtown Seattle location. The drinks never disappoint and the vibe is very cool. The rooms are nice although a little on the small size. Make sure you are above the parking garage as light and noise may effect your sleep but if above the views can be quite dramatic.

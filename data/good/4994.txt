A great little boutique hotel, nesled in vibrant Istanbul. Very well priced and the room we stayed in which was one the larger rooms was very well priced for what we got. They had a nice hammam downstairs although the pool was a little small. The staff at the hammam gave a great scrub/hamman and massage. Also it's in a really cool part of town which is full of lovely cafes, restaurant, art galleries etc. I would defintely go back and recommend for couples not really for families. I found it very romantic and Mandy loved it too. The decor was very dark and mysterious but also modern. They had nice modern design but with traditional elements too. Their reception felt a bit understaffed though as it felt enquiries took a while to get dealt with. Although once we were served the service of reception wre very competent. Also visit Reina which is an open air restaurant and nightclub overlooking the Bosphorus River. Have fun! Wishing you well, Leo Lourdes www.futureminded.co.uk No 10 Harley Street London W1G 9PF

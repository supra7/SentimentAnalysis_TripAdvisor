i have stayed here several times when I have a morning flight. For $100 pre-pay I get a nice room, free shuttle to the airport every 20 minutes and secure parking for my car. The staff is always friendly and helpful - and the warm chocolate chip cookie is such a treat. Several computers (no waiting) ready for boarding pass printing, a Starbucks in the lobby and a restaurant/room service. A wonderful way to start any trip.

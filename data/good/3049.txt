We stayed in this hotel for one night prior to an early morning departure from SEA-TAC. We appreciated the fabulous beds and the quietness. Other bonuses were the airport shuttle, the business centre (small, but fine for a quick check of email) and the pool. As it was about 40 degrees C (aka over 100 F) when we were there, the pool was a big hit. The restaurant was the biggest drawback. For our family (two adults and a 9 year old) we paid in excess of $125 US for dinner, that did not include wine. Rip-off about sums that up. We discovered a Denny's two blocks north on our way to the airport the next morning. As well it cost $4 for a bottle of water in your room which should have been free. These expenses make the difference between a fabulous hotel and an OK hotel. Unfortunately the Hilton grabs the money where they can.

The location of the Roosevelt is AMAZING! It is 6 blocks from the Pike Place Market and so close to all the shopping centers. We loved how we could walk out the door an be anywhere we wanted in less than 5 minutes. The elevator was slow, but since we weren't in a rush, it didn't bother us. There is free internet in the lobby which is really helpful, we only wished we could get it in our room too. Overall, I would definitely stay here again! There is a TON to do around the hotel. We ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel and it was pretty good. They have a good variety of beer to choose from and their corn bread is so good! On the next block (6th Ave) there is a really good restaurant called The Taphouse. They have awesome happy hour specials there. We also ate at Il Fornaio in the Nordstrom mall, which was delicious and decent priced for an upscale restaurant. The Roosevelt hotel is conveniently located right next to the Metro station in the Nordstrom mall and the ride-free time is pretty decent. Like most of Seattle, there are 3 Starbucks' (one in the Barnes and Noble) within 2 blocks of the hotel, so you're never out of options for caffeine. Overall, you cannot go wrong with this hotel and location! If you are going to do any tourist attractions, be sure to buy the City Pass. It is only about $60 and it allows you to skip lines and save a lot of money on admission prices. You also get a Day/Night pass to the Space Needle. If you take the bus, be sure to hold onto the pass that the driver gives you because it is a day pass for a certain number hours that saves you fares. Also, the blocks aren't nearly as large as they seem on the maps, so walk everywhere you can. You could even walk to the Space Needle from the Roosevelt hotel on 7th Avenue if you have 15-20 minutes to spare. Lastly, when it comes to getting to and from the hotel, the Greyline shuttle is the best. It is only $25 round trip and they pick up/drop off every 20 minutes.

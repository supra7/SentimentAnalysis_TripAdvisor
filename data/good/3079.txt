We loved it here. It really is a less-than10-minute walk to the airport terminal. It is also a very friendly hotel with terrific service. There is fast and free wifi throughout the hotel and apples at the front desk. We had a car and found it easy to drive to Seattle, to Mount Rainier and other destinations, and to countless delightful restaurants. If you don't have a car, it's a short walk to the light rail system and a ride into the city.

The staff is extremely helpful and always positive. The beach is one of the widest on the island and has good snorkeling at black rock just one hotel over. Ask for prescription mask if you wear contacts or glasses well worth it. We saw some sea turtles. The breakfast buffet was fresh and filling we did not need to eat lunch.

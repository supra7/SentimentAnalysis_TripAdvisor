This hotel does everything right as an airport hotel. I have stayed here twice for 1 night stays. It is easy walking distance to the main terminal, or they have a free shuttle. The staff are friendly and helpful, and it has a pretty good room service menu. This is one of the better airport hotels I have stayed at.

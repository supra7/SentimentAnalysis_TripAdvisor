I booked a one-bedroom partial ocean view. The condo unit itself is quite large with a fantastic lanai and fully 100% equipped with everything you could need for your kitchen, laundry, large flat screen satellite tv, etc. The only thing missing in my unit was a high-speed internet connection so if you need one, request a unit that has it or use a wireless capable laptop in the lobby area (which could be a pain depending on the location of your condo). My condo was in the A building and was slightly dated as far as dcor inside (lanai had great modern lounge chairs and dining table for 4). The couch and kitchen chairs were slightly worn and a little stained BUT the size of the place and how nice and quiet is it made me overlook that and they kept the place clean. The view is partial ocean as they say. I could not see it from within the condo but as soon as I stepped onto the Lanai (and I spent a lot of time on it because it was great), you do have a nice view. It is a little short walk (about 10 minutes) to the beach or main shopping/dining areas. The walk is also hilly so be prepared. For me (a fitness buff) I enjoyed the walk but if you have any issues with climbing a small hill, you should know this. They do charge you $5 a day to park but that is cheap compared to most the hotels in Lahaina. I liked the fact the area is quieter than the main hotel areas down the hill yet I had access to more action if I wanted it. You do likely need a car unless you want to stay in hotel row so I recommend getting one and exploring the island.

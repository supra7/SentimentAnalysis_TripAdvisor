Overall our honeymoon was great! The resort is huge, has plenty of amenities and a great pool. If you're looking for luxury however, you won't find it here. I don't know how the Hyatt Maui ever got a 5-star rating when the rooms are 3-star at best. They need updating badly. Even though we had an ocean deluxe room, I think we took advantage of the view only once because the balcony is so small. The staff was very nice however the "snack bar check staff" busts in every afternoon no matter if you have a do not disturb sign. .. very annoying. The grounds are beaufiful and pool side service is great although very expensive. Also, the sushi is very good! Because we spent more time on the grounds than in our room, we rated our overall experience above average. The spa is wonderful but also very pricey. Lastly, if you're looking for beach you won't find it here. Just walk down toward the Sheraton as the best beach will be found there.

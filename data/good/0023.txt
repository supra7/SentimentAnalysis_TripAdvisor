The Monaco is slightly quirky as is the case with many of the hotels in the Kimpton group - but it's good quirky! If you're looking for a hotel that has bags of character and doesn't feel like a generic beige property trying to be a boutique hotel, then this is the hotel for you. There are many nice touches: you can request a goldfish for your room if you like, you can get free coffee & tea in the lobby in the mornings and free wine in the lobby between 5pm-6pm. It's the decor that strikes you most.... lots of patterns that clash such as bold stripey wallpaper with patterned carpets, leopard print & zebra print bathrobes. The restaurant serves a pretty good breakfast and locationwise, it's great too. It's on 4th Avenue right opposite the W hotel, there's a convenience store round the corner on University St and it's only about a 4 or 5 block walk downtown to the stores. There are plenty of restaurants nearby too and it's a short walk down to the waterfront.

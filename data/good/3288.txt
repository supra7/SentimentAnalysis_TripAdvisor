Pros: great location, nice decor and very clean, wonderful food (exceptional food for an all inclusive), nice staff, awesome spa and very relaxing Cons: while the service was good it was not great. This may have been because it was peak season but they often missed out on the details which other all inclusives I have been to did not. they also tried to up sale a lot. They would try and have you buys bottles or romantic dinners/tables in the resturants that were not included in the all inclusive rate. They also try and sale you on the preferred club (which is not worth it if you are not already booking one of the suites that it is included with). Overall, it was a great time/ experience and I would good back anytime and recommend it to a friend! Also, they threw a great new year's party that was included in the room rate.

My girlfriend and I were in Seattle for a wedding and we did not want to spend too much on the hotel. We paid aproximatly $55 a night pre-paid, which was about $100 less then downtown. We had a rental car and we were only about 30 minutes away from downtown. The hotel is basic but it had everything we needed including a microwave, a refrigrator, free wi-fi internet and a free breakfast that included eveything that you would expect from a continential breakfast plus eggs and a machine to make homemade waffels. The staff was always freindly and accomidating and the average customer seemed to be travelers like ourselves. If I were in Seattle again I would definatly stay here.

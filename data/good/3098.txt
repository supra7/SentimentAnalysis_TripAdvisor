Stayed last week at this hotel. Booked through Hotwire and received an incredible rate. More than half off compared to the AAA rate. Hotel is directly across the street from the airport and depending upon how much luggage you are traveling with can easily be walked. The hotel does offer a shuttle to the airport as well. Room was nice sized and windows open which was a nice touch. Bathroom on the small side and no LCD TV upgrades yet but Sleep Number bed was awesome and nice work area. Friendly and helpful staff throughout my stay.

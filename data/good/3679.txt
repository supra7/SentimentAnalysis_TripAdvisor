The Hilton in the inner harbor is a nice stay especially with that significant other. The location is prime! you have access to many restaurants, bars, clubs and other amenities. The service is self explanatory w/ the hilton.. The rooms decor was nicely layed out, over looking the city @ night makes you feel good.The gym and pool over look Orioles stadium NICE! ( fabolous voice)My problem which is the problem that i always have in staying @ these hotels is the THIN AIR CIRCULATION in the room. I can't stand that [--]. You and your partner will wake up in the middle of the night with some serious dry mouth.. scavenging for some water. I know many people have experienced this before. Bring your humidifier.. LOL.. other things that bothered me which is always common in luxury hotels is that everythings overpriced! but for a nice getaway for young couples i would recommend this hotel and location

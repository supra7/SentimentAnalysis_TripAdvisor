I booked through Hotwire ($65) and was a bit concerned after reading the reviews. Check in was quick and impersonal. Two warm (and quite good) cookies were offered up. I asked for and got a tower room. The room was large, very clean and well worn. Old fixtures -- one fell off in my hand. Very little airport noise or room to room noise. Heating unit was noticeable but not obtrusive. Bar and restaurant:: OK food and friendly service. This, however, is NOT a four star hotel. At very best, three stars. It is too tired and worn to be anything more. I would not pay rack rate for the room, but for what we paid, and for a one night stay, it was fine.

This hotel has some good points and some bad points: Good: 1. Location. It is right across the street from 2 shopping centres, the monorail, and only 3 blocks walk to pike place market. That alone is worth it. 2. The view!! We were on the 21st floor, and the view even from there is outstanding! Perfect view of the space needle, some water and some neighbourhoods to the north. This was a big, big plus in my opinion. 3. The beds. The heavenly beds are just that -heavenly! Had perfect sleeps both nights. The bad: 1. The service isn't bad, just not really there. Nobody said hi to me in the 2 days I was there, other than the front desk of course. I don't like to pick on that, but even a friendly 'hello, how are you today?' and a smile would be nice. No one is grumpy by any means, but they don't exactly go out of their way to make you feel at home either. Maybe it was just my experience. 2. The carpets/floors desperately need to be upgraded. It was kind of dirty and not very nice. 3. parking is ridiculous at $36/day. TIP: DO NOT park in their parking lot. There is a parking lot a block away on 5th ave off lenora that is half the price. It says westin on the building but is not owned by westin anymore. It's only $18. Please heed this advice. 4. No free internet anywhere. You have to pay for it in your hotel room (!), and have to pay for it downstairs on the main floor! Not cool. Overall it's a nice hotel. The TV isn't HD, for me I like to watch sports, for someone else it might not matter. The bathrooms were very nice as well, other than the tub looked like it needed to be re-caulked. It's very quiet, I never heard a peep in the entire 2 days we were there. I would recommend this hotel, but try to get a deal via price line or somewhere. We got ours off hotwire.com, paid somewhere around $96 USD. I think if they upgrade the carpets, have free internet and most of all, improve their service a bit they'll be top notch.

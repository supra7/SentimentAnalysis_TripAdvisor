While staying at the El Dorado Royale at during the week of January 28th -Feb 3rd, I had the opportunity to spend a full day at its sister property the Maroma (courtesy vacattion club presentation). We knew that the beach would be much better based upon reviews & discussion with other travelers. This was our experience as well. Shallow calm water going out 500 yards or more. Amarina nearby for watersports which we tried (Jet Skiing). Also nearby were gift shops (palapas) and a bar which provided much needed shade. The resort itself was very laid back with vitually no activities going on. people were content to sit on beach or at the pool. Well kept grounds and a great restaurant (breakfast & lunch) very near beach. My favorite indeed. Rooms appeared very spacious. Staff knew everyone due to small size of hotel. My only major complaint was lack of coordinated activities. If you like extreme quiet and content to do little while on vacation, this is the place for you.

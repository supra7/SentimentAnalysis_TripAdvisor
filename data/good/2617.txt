I stayed at this hotel with my wife back in May 2000. We really enjoyed this hotel. Check in went smoothly and the staff was warm and welcoming, I sure hope all the staff are still working at this hotel. They have changed name from Vance Hotel to Hotel Max. Our room was fantastic with nice view of downtown Seattle and we could see the monorail passing by. We had a corner room. When you are staying at Stewart street, you can walk to almost everything in downtown Seattle. We really recommend Pike Place Market in Seattle with all the fresh seafood. Just a 10 -15 minute walk from the hotel. We are looking forward at staying at this hotel once again on our next visit to Seattle.

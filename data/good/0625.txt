I stayed in the deluxe queen and was surprised at how much living space was included. I had a wetbar area with countertop and storage space underneath for nonperishables, mini fridge and even a small sink. Only thing missing was a microwave which would have been a bonus! My queen bed was extra comfy and I was happy that an extra blanket was included in the closet. The closet was small but I didn't bring much - don't think a couple would have enough clothing space especially since drawer space was limited. Counter space in the bathroom was also limited but I was able to make do with what I had. They installed apple TV (which is a new offering) for me but with the internet connection being sketchy, it never did work for me. Overall, I was happy with my room and I couldn't ask for a better location and the price was RIGHT! I would definitely recommend this hotel.

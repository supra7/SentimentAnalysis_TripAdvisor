My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the Hyatt from July 5th - 12th. Overall it was a very good experience. Pros: - pool was amazing. It was huge and was the best pool I've ever swam in with waterfalls, swim up bar, and water slide. - service was extremely friendly. They treated us as well as can be expected. - grounds were immaculate. Exotic birds and penguins all around. We loved it. - food was amazing. We had the buffet breakfast included in our plan, otherwise it would have been pricey at $60 per couple. - room was great and clean with a terrific ocean view. Cons: - THERE IS NO BEACH. You are on the ocean, but you have to walk 5-10 minutes for the beach to really open up. If you want great snorkeling walk down to the Sheraton and swim there. We saw tons of fish and a few sea turtles. - Pool area is too crowed and you have to fight for a chair everyday unless you get there by 10 am. - There is no adult area to swim. Kids were everywhere and we thought the pool would have a kids section and adult section. The kids have there own section but they also swim over to the adult side and are not talked to by anyone. Parents must forget what its like to be on their honeymoon because they let their kids run wild and don't seem to care. Its unfortunate. But we didn't let that take away from our experience. LASTLY - The highlight had to be our "Dolphin Snorkeling Adventure" with the Pacific Whale Foundation. They promote this thing as a chance to snorkel with the possibility of seeing a dolphin or two. We saw hundreds (probably about 200) of dolphins and they even followed us to our last snorkeling spot and swam around and under us. Unfortunately the pics didn't come out that great with our underwater camera but it was like something out of a movie. The boat's captain called it a miracle to see what we saw.

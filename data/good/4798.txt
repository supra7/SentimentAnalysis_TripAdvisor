We have just stayed here for 5 days and had a really excellent holiday. The reception area and breakfast room are both small and reminiscent of a 3 star hotel but the suite we stayed in was spacious and really excellent. The staff were superb and we could hardly have had a better time. The surrounding area close to the Topkapi Palace is vibrant with many good restaurants. There is a village atmosphere making the area safe, and friendly. Thoroughly recommended.

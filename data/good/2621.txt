My wife and I stayed at the Max on 10/18/07 in Room #1019. This is an 'Artist King Room" on the top floor with a nice Capital Hill view. Entering the hotel, the first things you notice are the funky and cool art work and the soft sounds of reggae music playing in the lobby. The hotel staff from the doormen to the front desk employees were very friendly and helpful. The room which was on the small side(this should be expected for a building built in the early 1900's) had a very comfortable king bed and pillows, hairdryer, coffee maker and a window a/c unit. The hotel location for downtown access is wonderful, just a couple blocks to Pike Place Market, Pacific Place Mall, West Lake Mall, The Seattle Convention Center, Nordstroms and the Monrail Station to the Seattle Center. A pleasent surprise was the Japanese restuarant connected to the hotel called "Red Fin". Very good sushi and a great happy hour 4-6:00pm and 10:00pm-1:00am. We would stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.

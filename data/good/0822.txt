The Moore is an old Hotel, but is is clean, the beds are comfortable, my husband said that the pillows were the most comfortable he has ever slept with. You can stay at any chain hotel and after you check out you can't remember much about it. Not so at the Moore Hotel, first of all the Hotel staff are the friendliest we have ever met, Robert was outstanding. They will go out of their way to help you, in finding a bus, dining spot, events..... When we called to make our reservations we asked about parking our rental car. They told us that we did not need a car in the city, city transportion is free. They saved us over $300, by us not having to pay the airport car rental charge, renting the car for a shorter period of time and no parking charge. We took bus #194 from the airport for $1.50 and walked 2 blocks to the Moore. When we were ready to leave the city we took the free bus to Budget rental and took off to the ferries. If you come into the city by the airport check out the coupon book. The Moore is in the book, which they honored upon check in. We had a room with private bath, which cost us less than $70. The cleaning staff have quite the knack for folding the towels into interesting shapes. While staying at the Moore check into eating at the Farestart Restaurant just a few doors away. It is a food service training facility for the Homeless, every Thursday they have a Guest Chef work with the students making a 3 couse meal, it was fantastic. When we come to Seattle again we will stay at the Moore.

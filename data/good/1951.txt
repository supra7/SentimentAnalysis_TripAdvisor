The Westin Seattle is a great place to stay in the downtown area. It's within easy walking distance to the harbor, Pike's Market, downtown shopping and theaters. I stayed four days and managed to do it all... The beds were very comfortable. The consierge desk in the main lobby was very helpful in getting last-minute theater tickets. Booked (ahead of time via internet) an afternoon "Gourmet Food and Wine" walking tour -- would definitely recommend it. The hotel did not rate five stars because the service was poor in the main lounge area and because of the excessive internet fee charged for internet access ($13/day). Used the complimentary "business center" computers to check-in for flight home and print boarding passes -- which consisted of three computers crammed into a closet with no privacy for entering credit card info, etc. One more recommendation is the Three Sisters Bakery located in the little alley just outside the main entrance to Pike's Market.

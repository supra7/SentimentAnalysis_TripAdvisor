This hotel is small and cute, with only 8 rooms. The rooms are small suites with kitchens and separate bedrooms. Our room was fabulous and clean. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the Place de Arts train station, which was convenient it us getting around Montreal. The staff was helpful it helping us with our bags in and out of the hotel and telling us where the markets and a few restaurants were located close by. The hotel was located a little further away from the things we wanted to do (Old Montreal, the Bell Center, etc), but for the price, staff, size, etc it was worth it. It would have been nice to be in downtown Montreal. Next time, we might consider a hotel closer, but only because we do not know the city that well. However, the Metro is very easy to use. The staff even set up a cab for us the next morning to get us back to Central Station. I'd recommend this hotel!

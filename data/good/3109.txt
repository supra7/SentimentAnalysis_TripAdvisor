My husband and I stayed here on a recent trip to visit family in Seattle. Since we were arriving late in the evening, we opted to spend the first night near the airport and chose to use Hotwire to book a hotel with shuttle service and a pool. Although we arrived to the shuttle terminal after 11 p.m., the shuttle picked us within 10 minutes. We laughed when we exited the airport grounds and saw the Radisson directly across the street. We could have walked it in 10 minutes. We were a bit disappointed to find the bar and room service closed, but the sleep comfort beds soon made our growling tummies a non-issue as we drifted off to sleep. The next morning, we woke very hungry and went down for the buffet breakfast. The woman who seated us suggested we try the buffet, which we did. About 15 minutes later, we heard another waiter mention to the table next to us that the buffet included any of the regular menu items from the kitchen, such as made to order omlettes, pancakes, french toast, waffles, etc. This makes the $13 a much better bargin, although the buffet station included eggs, sausages, bacon, hashbrowns, assorted rolls, cerel, hot oatmeal, fruits, yogurt and more, so we were satisfied. Around mid morning, my sister and her family arrived. The guys headed hiking for the day, but my sister and the 2 kids decided to hang out at the hotel and go swimming. The indoor pool was a decent size and good temperature. It was large enough for an adult to do some lap swimming while the kids played on the other side. Since the kids were really enjoying themselves, I requested a late check-out, which they granted us without a problem. Overall I enjoyed this hotel and would definately stay here again. We were worried about "airplane noise" being so close to the airport, but it was never loud enough to be bothersome.

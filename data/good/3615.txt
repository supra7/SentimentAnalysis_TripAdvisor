My husband and I just returned home from what we thought was a very lovely vacation. The food was excellent and the rooms were beautiful. We did not get sick of the food once, as you do sometimes at all inclusives.. alot of choice. The himitsu was not open yet, but they had some of the food offered in the world buffet. The beach was beautiful except the hurricane had washed some seaweed up to the shore, but we didnt mind. The hobbiecats are a blast, make sure you go. We met some very nice couples there but we mostly enjoyed talking to the entertainment staff. They were a blast. My husband loved to play volleyball with them in the afternoon. A special thanks to Oscar (sexy boy is what he calls himself!), Lenny, a very nice young man from Seattle and Alisha, she came all the way from Canada to work on this beautiful beach. She is going to be an air traffic controller; my husband enjoyed speaking with her as he is an ex pilot and she was a very interesting and well spoken young lady. Everyone else, including the bartenders, waiters, and housekeeping were superbly friendly, always smiling. Im going to make this review a short one, but to conclude: Secrets Maroma is a beautiful resort for those who want to enjoy world class food, beach and relaxation.

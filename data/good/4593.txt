My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon from June 25th to August 7th. This hotel is classified as a 3 star, but should be rated more as a 4 star. Other hotels in this area are of course much more luxurious, but for the price and location you can't match this. The hotel overall is kept quite nice. Has one of the best beaches on Maui. The food is excellent. And the service from hotel staff is amazing. The staff here really care about your stay and you can tell by all the attention to detail, especially the little things they do. They have a free buffet breakfast for you (once per stay ~ the next morning) which is all right, and the good-bye/thank you for staying at our hotel is a nice touch to finish your vacation here. If we come to Maui again, it will definitely be to this hotel. For those coming back ~ remember to bring the lei they gave you!

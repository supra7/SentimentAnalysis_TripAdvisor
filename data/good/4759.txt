Our 1 bed, partial ocean view was very comfortable. We opted for self catering so we could plan our own time. If something was missing we probably didn't need it. Save money and get the cheaper garden view units - you're going to be out all day or down at the beach or beach cabana anyway, and ocean view is somewhat limited. That beach cabana is a WIN! - feels very upmarket to be at "your cabana" while the others sit on the sand! Much more relaxing beach compared to the Sheraton side of "black rock". Everything you need is close by but you MUST have a car. Eldorado grounds are well kept. A most enjoyable 1st trip to Hawaii - take lots of money!

I stayed at The Seattle Sheraton with my teen daughter over the July 4th weekend (4 nights). We chose this hotel due to central location and the pictures we saw online. We were very happy with our choice! The hotel is big, and may feel a bit impersonal to some. Other than that, we really had no complaints at all. I don't know the age of the hotel, but it felt really new and clean throughout. The rooms were basic but nice. Very comfortable beds!! We were on the 31st floor and had really nice views. The gym was very impressive! Top of the line cardio equipment and enought weights to work with. Amazing views while you work out. The pool is next door with equally impressive views through large plate glass windows. The hot tub was on the small side, but we used it every day anyway. Location is perfect. An easy 3-4 blocks to Pike's Market, very close to Monorail Station for Space Needle/Seattle Center, and close to trolley station for Lake Union where we watched fireworks. Will stay here again for sure!

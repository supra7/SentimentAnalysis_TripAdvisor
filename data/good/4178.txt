I traveled with my best friend to Maui. We had been to Kauai twice and wanted to try another island that wasn't "honeymooners" only. Let me start by saying I truly did compare everything here to Kauai.As far as natural scenery and relaxing Kauai definitely beats out Maui. The Hyatt,. the check in was smooth and we had no complaints with that. The front desk was great and answered all of our questions even those that should have gone to the concierge.The concierge was also great, no complaints there.The room was exactly what we booked.However the a/c never worked to capacity, it cooled the room but we both would wake up sweating in the middle of the night. We told housekeeping and they didn't do much with our complaint. Housekeeping was mediocre. I nicked myself shaving my legs and didn't realize until I saw the blood on the bed. I didn't tell housekeeping as I figured they would see the blood. Well either they didn't see or worse they did and didn't care because they did nothing. We came back late afternoon and my bed still had the blood stains . The pool was fantastic, especially if you have kids. They have their own pool with slides and all sorts of things to do. If I had children I would highly recommend. After all is said and done would I go back, yes. The beach was o.k. You had to walk down maybe 50 ft. to find a spot that didn't have rocks . But they say that changes with the storm. Wailea has the best beaches we actually rented a car just to use the beach the last few days. The room we had was definitely spacious. The mattress was horrible. It was just a mattress no box spring. I had a back ache the entire time I was there. Since I've been home my backache is going away. the entire time I was there I was in pain. All said and done .If we went back to Maui which is unlikely would stay at one of the resorts at Wailea. Also Maui is definitely twice the price of Kauai

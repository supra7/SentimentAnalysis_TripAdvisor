I stayed here for one night with my girlfriend in August 2008 after arriving at Seattle Airport after a flight from London Heathrow. This was a great base after a long flight and was only a 5 min drive in the free hotel shuttle from the airport. The hotel is massive and it must have taken us five minutes to walk from the reception to our hotel room! We had a large room with two double beds, desk, dressing table, large TV with a balcony overlooking the car park. Everything in the room and bathroom was clean and modern so inline with what we expected (and the warm cookie was a nice touch!) If we flew to Seattle again, we would stay here for our first night again.

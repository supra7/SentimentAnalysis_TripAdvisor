we had a corner room with two balconies with ocean views. the room was fine, nothing special. the bathrooom was smaller then the bathrooms in military barracks! The grounds are beautiful but they are beautiful at every hotel around that location. The huge slide was closed while we were there. I still can't figure out why there are penguins on site, but poeple love them. The parrots around the hotel are a nice touch. I think "resort fees" suck. Just charge me more for the room. Lots of kids and stuff. Breakfast is GREAT and the view is nice while you are dining.

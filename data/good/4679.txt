My wife and I spent our 15th wedding anniversary in paradise....the 19th through the 22nd. I did a lot of research and I wasn't dissapointed! Even with research, you never know what your going to encounter so in all honesty, we were nervous. KBH is a very well ran facility. The entire staff is very friendly and the farewell ceremony is a sincere thank-you, with a hearfelt personal invitation to return to KBH! It is often the personal touch you remember so much, and KBH tries very hard to do that. We had so many memories and WOW, you have to see it to believe it. While watching the visitor channel, Kaanapali Beach is the number 1 beach in Maui, rated by all visitors to Maui. As I was watching the top 10 list dwindle down, I kept thinking...."wow, Kaanapali Beach didn't even make the list!" and so I was very proud when number one came up and it was the very beach we were sitting on! We were looking for the type of vacation where we could really just relax. There is soooo much to do there, but we chose to sit by the beach and just enjoy the scenery. For the price, the atmosphere and the location, you really can't go wrong! If you are the type of people who really like to be pampered, you are looking for the best quality and are quick to complain, I would look elsewhere. It is Maui, in January! What more could you ask for! We will be returning....

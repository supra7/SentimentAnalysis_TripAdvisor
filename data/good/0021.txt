I must say, the Hotel Monaco struck me as a bit odd. I've never been to a hotel where colorful nature murals adorn vaulted ceilings in the lobby. The whole place feels a bit plastic and out of place. That said, the staff was very helpful and the hotel had some nice amenities that give it a nice touch. If you're looking for a luxury hotel where everything is adorned in gold, this isn't your place. In fact, I'd call it entry-level luxury. Not so much luxury, but comfort, spaciousness, perfect cleanliness, and attentive service. The evening wine tastings are a nice touch. The location is an easy walk to the water, Pike Place, or shopping. The bed was comfortable and the place had all the equipment you'd expect in a hotel like this. Some of the touches, like the alarm clock, felt very chain-like, reminding me of what every Hilton in the world equips it's rooms with. But the Monaco has subtle touches that make it stand out and give you a warm feeling, with a room decor that almost evokes a British tea room. Overall, a nice hotel, nothing outrageous, but the value proposition was very good as my girlfriend and I celebrated our birthdays in Seattle.

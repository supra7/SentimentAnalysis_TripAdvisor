My husband and I stayed at Le Blanc in Cancun 2 years ago and had the best experience ever in Mexico. We wanted to go somewhere new, so I found Secrets in the Riviera Maya. It was very disappointing when compared to our time at Le Blanc. This is not to criticize Secrets Maroma. It is just that there are some key differences we weren't aware of or didn't think of that made the difference. First, Le Blanc is close to other properties/malls and you can easily visit these. Secrets is a resort unto itself, and unless you go somewhere by cab, you are stuck there. 2nd, Le Blanc is a mix of couples, but mostly 30's and up people who have some experience and class. Secrets' crowd was almost 100% newlyweds that have never had any other experience. 3rd, the drinks were excellent at Le Blanc and very watered down/weak at Secrets. 4th, the theme restaurants at Le Blanc are fairly good, and the food at the pool bar ordered off a menu and cooked for you and excellent. The theme restaurants at SM were, in our opinion, pretty terrible, and the food at the pool grill was mostly self-serve and the same stuff. 5th, the rooms at Le Blanc are accessed from inside the hotel, therefore stayed cooler. The rooms at SM are in several buildings on the property and accessed from outside. Both beaches are beautiful but the one in Cancun has more surf. The spa was beautiful and excellent. The buffet restaurant had the best food (and I usually hate buffets). If you have any questions, please feel free to message me.

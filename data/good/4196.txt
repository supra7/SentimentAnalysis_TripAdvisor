The Hyatt is North of Lahaina in Ka'anapali. We have stayed a number of times for conferences. The rooms are well appointed with a large bar fridge. The bathrooms are mid sized and well appointed. Most rooms have a view of either the mountains/gold course or sea. There are extensive shops in the foyer level, wear you can buy clothing, shoes and snacks. The conference area downstairs is large and well set up. Its either side of the walkway down to the sea front walk. The breakfast buffet by the lagoon is excellent and reasonably priced but get there before 9am on weekends because otherwise you queue up the stairs. We don't eat in the hotel for other meals because of expense/value issues. Its expensive especially wine. In the past we have walked the beach front and found places for dinner but some of these have closed with the recession. This last visit we drove to Lahaina or Wailea or Kapalau to eat in the evenings for better variety and value.

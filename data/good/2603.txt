Rooms are nice but small. If you are a couple with a lot of luggage, you will be wondering where to put it with just 2 drawers and a narrow wardrobe in our Queen room. That said the staff were always friendly and helpful. The quirky object in the mini bar cupboard gave me an hilarious taking point at the conference I was attending at the Westin nearby. Easy walk to the shops, Pike Place market etc a real plus.

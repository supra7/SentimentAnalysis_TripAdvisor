I've stayed at the Doubletree several times when I need to fly in and out of Seattle. It's a solid 3* hotel and good value. Pros: - cookies upon check-in - one of my favorite things about the Doubletrees - complimentary airport shuttle every 15 mins - nice pools, rooms are very comfortable with excellent beds and Neutrogena toiletries and Wolfgang Puck coffee - nice food selection in hotel Cons: - parking is expensive - $16/night. If you're just crashing for the night, the hotel has 1 night hotel plus x days parking that's not a bad deal - no breakfast - no free wireless in the room - it's a fee - don't remember what it was since I've never used it - HUGE complex - both a plus and a minus - if you get one of the far wing rooms, you have a long way to walk after check-in Overall, I think it's a great value, especially if you get a Priceline rate. The cons for me aren't a huge issue since I'm just overnighting it, but would be more significant for a prolonged stay.

My husband and I just came from Virginia for our first anniversary this past weekend. It was a lovely hotel with very new and crisp features such as the all-glass shower in our room, flat screen tv, free wi-fi and our favorite, the Garden Sleep System, on which we could adjust the firmness of each side of our mattress! The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Thankfully, we didn't drive to Baltimore - we rode the train - otherwise, we would've been very disappointed to discover that it would have taken us about $75 to park our car in the garage for the weekend. We were glad to travel via mass transit for the weekend as there were plenty of options to get us where we needed: cabs, water taxis and, of course, our feet :) The hotel was within walking distance of the aquarium, harbor place, many restaurants and museums and even the Orioles Ballpark if you're up for a little hike which we enjoyed. The only suggestions I'd have for hotel staff would be to better communicate the way breakfast works and check the lobby restroom more often. My husband and I ate breakfast thinking it was included with our stay which we found to be untrue once a staff member brought a nearly $30 check to our table when we were finished. Personally, I think it's rude not to provide at least a minimal continental breakfast (bagels, muffins, fruit, etc.) to your guests who are paying well to stay at your facility. I mean, even budget hotels provide something besides coffee and water. And as for the lobby restroom, someone really should check it more frequently. It was disgusting when I went in there. There were paper towels all over the floor, no toilet paper left and it smelled like a truckstop bathroom. Probably not the first impression you want to give people coming into your lobby. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would return.

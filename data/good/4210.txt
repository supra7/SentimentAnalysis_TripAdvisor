This was a nice resort. Not too large as some others are, but not too small either. Room was laid-out nicely. Pools were great with lots of areas to swim in, waterfalls and slides. We swam at night and it was great. There was a rope bridge also. Restaurants on-site cost a lot. Breakfast was not included either and it was $60 for the two of us. Try to get it included in your package price if you can. Hammocks by beach were usually open and available at most times. They recognized that we were on our honeymoon and provided a photo book, certificate for free champagne at any on-site restaurant, and two leis. That was nice.

Conveniently located just walking distance to the downtown shopping area. I think the only concern I had was the self-parking fees - too expensive. We managed to find a decent priced for $7/night over the weekend BUT when we left they attendant told us that starting the following week they will be increasing their fees up to $30/night. What a difference!! Anyways, that is downtown parking so unless you want to walk 5 blocks away then you'll be paying $25 and upwards/night.

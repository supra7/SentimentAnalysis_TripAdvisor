I stayed here because the conference was held here & did not want the hassle of getting from one hotel to another for each day's meetings. I made my reservation in late January, asking for an upper floor - I only found out on check-in that double-bedded rooms were all on lower floors, so I got a room on the 8th floor of the South Tower - looking out onto the back roof of some building. For $200/night, there was a small coffee-maker, no microwave; very comfortable beds/bedding, large bathroom with hairdryer & iron provided. It was almost an exercise in futility locating the Gym & pool - no maps or directions provided in the room. All in all, a strange experience

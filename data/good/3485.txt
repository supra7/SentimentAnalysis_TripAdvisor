Everything was just great and like I said we will be back!!! Just one minor issue , we ad a hard time understanding some of the employees when it was time to order at the restaurants Ex: special of the day (Mix of Mexican/English). But not a major problem...Love the beach service. Tank you for the warm welcome in our room that was a nice touch

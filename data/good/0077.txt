Stayed 4 nights at the Kimpton hotel in a Monte Carlo Suite. - Layout of room was nice with sufficient space. - Bathroom was simple and clean. - Staff were hit or miss, with Jessica being friendly, but another being quite short when making requests. - Coffee machine was brought up to the suite after a phone call to guest services which was very welcomed. - The tap water was safe to drink but didn't taste too great, so we requested for pitchers of filtered water which was brought up without charge. - Didn't get any of the goldfish i'd been reading about but that didn't matter. - Free coffee in the morning and wine tastings at night are very nice with lots of people attending. - Great hotel location, within walking distance to anywhere (Seattle is a great walking city). - Didn't use valet parking due to price, opting instead for "around the corner street parking" - Valet did help inquire about town car service to Seattle, but quote came back far too high. - Nearby lots of nice cafes and restaurants (Purple, etc) - Starbucks two doors down (but that is standard anywhere in Seattle) - Quiet hotel - never heard any of our neighbors as some reports had mentioned. - Gym is small but has standard equipment (treadmill was out of order) - Free internet was useful (for Kimpton members) Finally, i would say the value is decent and would probably repeat if in Seattle again. Prior to my trip I considered staying at either the Fairmont or Monaco, and looking back i'm glad i ended up choosing the Monaco. The Fairmont looked old and worn from the inside.

If you enjoy something other then a big box hotel, then Hotel Monaco is for you. We originally booked a reservation through the hotel, but about 1 week before our stay I noticed a better rate on Hotel.com. We called the hotel and they matched that price! Happy Hour wine tasting from 5-6 was fun. One night the entertainment was Guitar Hero and the next a Native American card reader. Unfortunately, there were only about 12 seats in the lobby where they have the Happy Hour and so many guests were forced to stand. Our room was huge, but the furniture placement could have been better. There was a night stand only on one side of the bed which made it hard for my husband to find a place for his glasses and the remote! Location is very good and I'd stay here again.

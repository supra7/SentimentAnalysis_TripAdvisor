We stayed here for one night before our Alaskan cruise. It is within walking distance to the Fish Market and our room had a great view of the Space Needle. The bed was comfortable and the room was quite big. You can tell the building is older...it has a worn feel to it. But it is very clean and modern. The cafe in the lobby serves a good breakfast as well.

All the good reviews are accurate - location, room breakfast etc. The only thing missing is a nice lounge where you can relax with a beer, coffee etc. The is just a small reception area with 2 computer that you can use free for internet. This would not put me off returning as from what I could see many 3 star Rome hotels did not offer this facility. Once again good location, very clean rooms and bathroom, free internet + sky sports etc, lovely continential breakfast and good helpfull staff

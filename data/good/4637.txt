While a little frayed, this little hotel is a nice choice for staying on the west coast of Maui. It's next door to Black Rock with some decent snorkeling and the staff is very friendly (unlike many locals who seem to resent tourists). Nightly free music and an efficient and *thorough* housekeeping staff make this hotel a little gem. It's a short walk to restaurants and shops in Whaler's Village. It may not be the poshest of digs, but it gets the job done nicely and CLEANLY. I would not recommend vacationing here if you plan on staying on-property the majority of the time. The pool is rather small (and plain compared to neighboring hotels), and the dining options limited. However, the included breakfast is a great deal. If you plan on hanging out on the beach or exploring Maui, this is the place to be.

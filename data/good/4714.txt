This hotel is good value in a good location. The room was modern, bright and large (for Venice). The staff were very helpful. The breakfast was lovely. Our room was on the ground floor so we kept the curtains closed so that passers by couldn't see in! We were in a wheelchair accessible room (not requested) so the bathroom was large but it was a wet room and it lived up to it's name! The floor was wet constantly. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for a trip to Venice.

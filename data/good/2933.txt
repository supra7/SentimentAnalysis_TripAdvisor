I stayed at this hotel for a business conference, but the staff and the hotel made it feel like a mini vacation. Great atmosphere, beautiful decor. The food was pretty good for a Marriott and the breakfast buffet is excellent. the staff was helpful and attentive and they have the best shuttle drivers. My only complaint is that we didn't have toilet paper in the bathroom. I called guest services and left for the day. When I returned at midnight I still didn't have toilet paper and had to use my colleagues' bathroom. What I did have was a big bag full of toiletries. They misunderstood. Who can take a huge bag of shampoo and conditioner and lotion on a plane??I called again and this time was given two rolls of toilet paper. It was midnight. I was leaving in the morning. They overcompensated for their mistake. My concern was the fact that housekeeping had cleaned the room and supposedly cleaned the bathroom. They didn't put toilet paper in the bathroom for two days. How'd they miss that? Left a little sore spot for me and I didn't leave them a tip. I bet they didn't miss that!

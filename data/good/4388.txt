We stayed Jan.2012 on the 3rd floor of the maui wing. The room was clean and spacious with a king bed, the view was of the green area and of the pool. The ocean was in partial view around the trees. The bed was on the hard side but was comfortable, the tv was on the small side and the channels were not that clear and sound was not great. Didn't go to watch tv any way.The grounds are very well kept and had one of the largest green areas for sun tanning on the whole beach, pool is nice size and the kids love it as it has an end just the right depth for them. Food is comparable to all resturants in the area, if you want a cheaper breakfest go to whalers village downstairs and there is good food for reasonable prices. Nighty music and dancers were a nice touch and enjoyable, the staff were very helpful and friendly with all tours booked right in the hotel. From what we experenced you can not go wrong with this hotel.

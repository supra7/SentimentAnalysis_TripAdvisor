Hotel Max was a great base from which to explore Seattle, being walking distance from all the main attractions. The staff were friendly and helpful and the decor was cool without being OTT (particularly loved the Nirvana doors!). We'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, convenient, trendy place to stay but not perhaps to anyone wanting a quiet time. The road is a bit noisy and because the hotel seems to attract a youngish crowd (20s - 40s) there can be noise in the corridors until late. But don't let this put you off! Take your ear plugs and enjoy. We'd stay here again.

Had a great stay at the Warwick Hotel, Seattle! Valet parking was a snap, checking in & out a breeze. Room was a comfortable size, room with a space needle view, (which I requested, infact, everything I requested, I got!!) The Marqaux, lounge was very nice & poured a nice Martini.) The bath was nicely appointed, in white marble. The king size bed & linens were very comfortable! Breakfast (room service) was punctual & delicious!! In town for a night out at Jazz Alley, I selected The Warwick, for it's location, (a quick walk from Jazz Alley) even in four inch heels it was no problem!!) It's location in the Belltown area is centrally located to just about everything worth seeing & doing! Plus public transportation is very close, (did not use). Tip: I understand part of the hotel has been refurbished, (the section I stayed in was) while other rooms to date have not, sounds like it's in the plans for the near future though.

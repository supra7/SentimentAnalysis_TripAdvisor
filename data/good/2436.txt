Overall, excellent W hotel. Wonderful location in downtown Seattle. Very close to shopping, and close to many businesses. Rooms are fantastic. Great space, awesome amenities and wonderful atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and service is great. Only thing, don't count on an extensive room service menu. And, on Sunday nights, the restaurant isn't open. As a business traveler, I find this odd. But, breakfast is great.

Traveled to Seattle with my granddaughter and stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for three nights. This hotel is very easy to get to from the airport. We took the light rail from Sea Tac to the furthest point - Westlake Station. Took about a half hour and it made about 10 stops. Very easy! Got off at Westlake Station and you come out on Pine Street. Turn left and walk up 6th and the Sheraton is right there. We were on the 26th floor so fairly quiet - room was on the smaller side with two double beds. We are Starwood Preferred Guests but weren't put on the Starwood Preferred floor - don't know if this is because of the request for double beds? We used the pool and also the business center. The pool was nice - on the highest floor (35th), had bathrooms and a changing room as well as towels. Business center was also nice and they had someone there if you had any computer/printing problems. I've complained before about the charge by high end hotels for internet service in your room and this one is no exception. $10.95/24 hours. Rip off but if you'd like it's free downstairs in the lobby, at one of the godzillion Starbucks or of course McDonalds. So you do have other options. All in all, really enjoyed our stay and the beds were great. Love how convenient it was to Pike Market, the monorail, Westlake station and with a granddaughter - SHOPPING!

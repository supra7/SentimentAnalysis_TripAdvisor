Stayed at the Hilton Bayfront at the urging of one of my colleagues. Was not disappointed. Pricey ($269/night). But everything was very high quality. My king standard was ready prior to 3pm check in time (very nice), had a great view of the bay, and everything was practically brand new. I would stay here again for sure.

First off this place is beautiful and the service was outstanding.The food on the the other hand did not agree with me.I ate something on the third day that made me sick for the rest of the trip.I think they must have this problem often because imodium costs 18$ usd that is like selling a bottle of water to a guy stranded in the desert.On top of having that problem, they use a ton of garlic and other weird spices on everything they cook because it gave me terrible heart burn the rest of the week.Let me add that mexican food is my favorite and we visit the authentic places in the US all the time and i have no problem.As of now it has been 6 days and i am still sick.

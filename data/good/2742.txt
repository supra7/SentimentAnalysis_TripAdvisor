large hotel complex......I stayed in the tower and my room was spacious, loved the large LCD TV but didn't care for the funky carpeting that needs to be replaced. Friendly staff, nice public areas and I like the 3 computers near the bar area that, in addition to the ones in the business office, you can use to access the internet. Buffet Breakfast is average, scrambled eggs not kept warm, choices pretty limited, and it still costs you $18. Parking is very expensive at around $20 a day

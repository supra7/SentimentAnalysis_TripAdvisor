I've stayed at this hotel about 8 times over the past 2 years because my daughter goes to U.W. The rooms are clean, the location is perfect, and the price is somewhat reasonable for this district. I've sometimes come to Seattle without renting a car and this hotel has the free shuttle to all of the right places making it very convenient. We especially enjoy the afternoon snack time to get us through to dinner out later. The breakfasts are also very good for free.

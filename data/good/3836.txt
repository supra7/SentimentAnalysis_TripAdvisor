We have just returned from a three night stay. I agree the rooms are very small but unlike the previous review I have to say that ours was also very clean. Breakfast was fine. Plenty of choice for continental breakfast. Room and crockery etc.clean and coffee machine looked new . Also agree staff are very friendly and helpful.

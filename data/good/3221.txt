Good value, clean rooms, friendly and helpfull staff. Not in the centre of Berlin but about 10 minutes away by S/U Bhan. Taxi return from city centre never cost more than 10 and only a short distance away. Only downside was the Breakfast costing 18 so would advise on holding out and grabbing a bite elsewhere and the church bells at 9am sound like they are next door.

We stayed at the Hotel East Houston over Easter and had a terrific time. The main negative thing, really, is that the rooms are very small (there's not much space to store luggage or clothes.) But as we didn't spend all that much time in the room, this wasn't a huge problem. Oh, the WiFi in the room was a bit patchy, but there were 2 computers for use by guests in the basement so getting online was fairly easy. The good things: the hotel is in a terrific location in the Lower East Side and there are plenty of interesting bars and restaurants nearby. It's also great to be within walking distance of Soho and the East and West Villages and the many shops, restaurants and bars. There's a cinema showing independent films about a minute away, and there's also a branch of Whole Foods a 5-minute walk away. There is a subway station on the corner of the block, which is very handy. The hotel also provides breakfast in the basement, which is a boon. Although the hotel is situated on a busy street, we didn't encounter any problems with noise in our fourth floor room. In short, I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an affordable base in the LES.

The staff at the Hotel Monaco from the front desk, to the waiters in the fabulous restaurant each morning to the housecleaning were incredibly kind and helpful. The hotel is located in a great location close enough to walk along the water and close enough to walk to the convention center. It is also safe at night, which I appreciated. I love all animals and adore the "idea" of having gold fish for guests, but for a slightly extra investment for a larger bowl, two fish could hang together. It is difficult enough for fish without pumped in air supply, but to be completely alone (especially gold fish which can easily live together) at least doesn't make it look so lonely. Two different people I brought to my room commented on how lonely the fish in the hall looked. Otherwise it's a fabulous place!

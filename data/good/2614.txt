The hotel was clean and conveniently located within four or so blocks of the convention center. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows (and pillow choices). As a single woman traveling alone, the hotel felt very safe. The bellmen were helpful with luggage, etc. A Seattle Times was provided every morning at my door. The rooms were small, but I was happy that my window opened to let in the cool, fresh evening air. No vending machines, but a deli a half block away was convenient (snacks provided in the room were a bit pricey for my pocketbook; the other in-room convenience items were, well, facinating). I stayed in the hotel a week. My shampoo and conditioner were not replaced until I asked the cleaning staff to provide more. She provided two shampoo, two conditioner and two lotions.

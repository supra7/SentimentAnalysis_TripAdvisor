We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at Maui. Kay Ryan at MauiKay.com, our travel consultant, made all the arrangemnt at Hyatt. We had a wonderful experience at the pool, walking around the swan court, watching naughty (evil!) Penguins, and the 40 yr old parrot. Great location, very close Lahina (old town) and very courteous staff.

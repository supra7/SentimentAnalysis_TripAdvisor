Everybody complaining about the bath in the room should stay somewhere else. The design and rooms are very nice. The room was not 100% in order, and we had a lot of fruitflies in the room. I missed the contact with the reception, and the 5-star personal service. The location is super, and everything is in walking distance. I see the hotel as a good 4-star hotel with reasonable prices. We paid 153 a night without breakfast, so I think that price and quality fit together. My wife and me enjoyed the stay, allthough maybe the jacuzzi should be opened untill midnight.

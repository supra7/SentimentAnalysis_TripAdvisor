We just returned from a 6 night stay and I would have to say that this is a very beautiful resort. It is almost perfect. I won't go on and on about all the things that are great, because you already know about that. What I will tell you is what could be better. Ok, here goes... the bathrooms in the rooms are very small, there is an outrageously priced minibar in the room that is touch sensitive (not great with kids), the wi-fi is not included in the $15/day resort fee, there is one hot tub that can accommodate about 15 people (not nearly enough for this size resort), there is only 1 spot on all of the resort grounds to recycle anything, the "arcade" consists of 5 games and there is no place to buy ice cream except room service, oh yeah room service, the room service charge is $4.50 + tip. That's it, that's all of my complaints. Everything else was great. If they could fix those things I could give them a 5!

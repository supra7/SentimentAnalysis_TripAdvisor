We spent three nights at the Moore Hotel and for the money it was excellent. The room had a cracking view of the Port and even though it was at the front of the hotel, it wasn't noisy in the slightest. The room itself was big and airey with a large-ish en-suite. Everything was very clean and the bed comfortable. This hotel isn't smart or fancy and there was a small patch of peeling paint on the ceiling in our bedroom but if you're on a budget and looking for somewhere in central Seattle, you could do a lot worse than staying there.

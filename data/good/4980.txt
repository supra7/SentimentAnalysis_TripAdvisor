The location of the hotel was amazing, only a short walk away from Gallota tower and Istikal Street. Small grocery store located next door as well was useful for snacks, water, etc... A lot of nice restaurants within walking distance as well. We also took advantage of the tunel being close by (we would typically walk down to the Golden horn and take the funicular on the way up) We stayed here for 5 days in early December and the free breakfast was a nice surprise! The selection was more or less the same everyday but we felt that it was still good (daily breads, scrambled/hard boiled eggs, cheeses and deli meat, spreads, fruit). Room itself was very modern, clean and of sufficient size (it's not huge by north american standards but decent size). The rating was 4/5 due to a few small concerns: due to the location to the bars, etc.. it was quite noisy some nights as we could hear the rowdy crowds passing by outside. Also, you could hear voices fairly clearly from the hallway inside the rooms. Hopefully they will continue to maintain the quality and cleanliness of this hotel as we would stay here again for sure (you can see a little wear and tear on the shower stall where the grout is starting to stain). Front desk was also helpful with calling a cab to the airport.

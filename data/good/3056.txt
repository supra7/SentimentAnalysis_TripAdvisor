This is the airport we stay at whenever we fly out of SeaTac. It is one of the few airport hotels with extended park and jet rates, so if you are going away for a couple of weeks, for just a few dollars more than you would spend to park your car at an off-airport lot, you can get a room for the night across from the airport and not have to get up quite so early for your morning flight. There is a 24 hour shuttle service to and from the airport, and we have never waited more than 10 minutes for it. On your return to Seattle, when you call the shuttle from the airport you also give your valet number, and your car will be waiting for you at the front of the hotel by the time you get there. The rooms themselves are of average size and clean, with all the usual amenities. The beds are comfortable, and staff are friendly and helpful. The fitness room has lots of treadmills and ellipticals, plus free weights. There is a restaurant on site, though we have not eaten there so cannot comment on it. We have stayed at several hotels near SeaTac in the past, but this is the one we inevitably return to and have the best experiences with.

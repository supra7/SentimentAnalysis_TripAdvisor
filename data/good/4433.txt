4th time there and we can't wait to go back. Great value, good food and entertainment. Hotel does need some updating but you can't beat the price and location! Staff is very friendly and the gardens are very well kept. Vary spacious courtyard never gets crowded like some other hotels in the area do. If you want to be on the beach and not break the bank then this place is for you. They provide discounts to returning guests if you call them directly.

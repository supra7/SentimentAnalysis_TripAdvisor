Stayed here for two nights in February. Was a nice hotel, with great views, but the rooms felt small and older. I'd suggest requesting the newer tower (there are two towers to the hotel) when booking. Overall, a nice property, but not worth more than $160ish per night in my opinion. I'd look around and see what else is out there, if the rate is exceeding $160ish.

We stayed 2 nights here based on reviews on tripadvisor. First of all, this hotel is in an excellent location. For families, it's close to the pike's place market. For hipsters, it's close to Belltown. It's located on the same block as a popular mall and corporate shopping. For those who plan to hit center city, the monorail is conveniently right next door. All staff was helpful, polite, and professional. We were able to check in early with no problems. The bellmen were helpful with city tips and the front desk was always pleasant. Our room was a bit cramped, but the bed was comfortable and the room was very clean and tidy.

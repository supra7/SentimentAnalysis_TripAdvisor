This was an interesting hotel. First, the location was terrific. Lots of good restaurants nearby, Pike Place Market a few blocks downhill, large shopping complex--Pacific Center--also within walking distance. The decor was very European/minimalist. The walls were covered with deep colors , the room and bath were small, but very functional and comfortable. If we had been there more than 2 nights, we would have bought a stronger light bulb so we could read at night. But it was quiet, extremely clean, had lovely linens, internet access, refrigerator, a flat screen HDTV (but with no HD stations), soft terrycloth robes and a safe. The hotel itself was safe--you had to use your room card to access guestroom floors on the amazingly tiny elevator. Door men were johnny-on-the-spot, and very helpful. You could call the front desk to request the type of pillow you wanted, and could also request the religions book (Bible, Book of Mormon, Koran, etc) you prefer. Breakfast was not included, but could be found at many cafes in the neighborhood or at Pike Place Market down the hill. We would definitely stay here again. The price was moderate by Seattle standards, and there was a car rental office a block away, and by renting a car in the city, rather than at the airport, we saved the cost of a night's stay at the hotel.

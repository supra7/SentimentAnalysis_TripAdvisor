We booked a block of rooms for a Labor day weekend wedding with guests staying 2-4 days. This was easy and convenient and ensured an excellent rate for our friends and family. Hotel Andra has beautiful large, quiet rooms. Ours looked over busy 4th avenue, but the large window was framed by trees giving us a treehouse kind of view. We had a "handicapped adapted "room with a roll- in tile shower. The bathroom worked well with nice amenities with a slight caveat that the lighting not quite bright enough for my taste. There was, however, a framed full length mirror in the bed-sitting area that was perfect for dressing and last minute details. The linens and bedding were new and high quality with a great king size bed as standard and our room sported a huge walk in closet.We saw several other rooms in our party and they were similar in quality and style. Service was excellent both courteous and friendly. This is a bustling hotel on a big weekend and our group made frequent extensive use of the lobby seating area and ate at several of the Andra related restaurants including the one in the hotel itself. We were always treated with respect and prompt attention by all employees from the valet parking attendants to the front desk staff. This hotel has a great location within a short walking distance to the best things about downtown Seattle. Our New York family loved this accessibility. Only one small criticism and this came from a number of our group and that was the lobby area euro techno music. Yes , this is a hip hotel with a definite European ambiance but maybe the music could be a bit less shall we say assertive. This is a small thing indeed and generally our experience was quite positive and enjoyable.

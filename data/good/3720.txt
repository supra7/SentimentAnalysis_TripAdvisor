Location was superb, though not quite the W Hotel on the barcelonetta. The service during our whole stay was excellent and when we accidentally walked in on our room being cleaned, we were shocked at how thoroughly the rooms were cleaned. Very nice hotel, very modern / contemporary decor, great for couples. I don't think it is a good option for families or anyone over the age of 40, however. Great patio upstairs with tanning beds and a jacuzzi. Our only complaint is that the hot tub was lukewarm and did not fully work the second time we tried it out.

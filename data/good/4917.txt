a big benefit is free parking, the room we had was very clean, the owner and his siter were very accomodating. the room had a small kitchen, there was a "living room" and bedroom...all similar to a small apartment. the price was right also. there is a very long flight of stairs to reach the reception desk, and then, if you're on the second floor, two other small flights. ...not for elderly/handicapped. also, we were asked to pay in advance (3 days) and they only refund with a day+ notice,. so plan carefully, if you have to leave before your reservation ends you'll be out at least one night's payment. and, yes, we were harassed by the local drunks...they are pushy and obnoxious.

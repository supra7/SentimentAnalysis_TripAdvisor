When we arrived we were greeted with such great & sincere service. The view from our room was of the space needle and the water... amazing. Couldn't believe how fast the elevators were as well. Barely had to wait more than 30 seconds each time. The lobby and lounge area was impressive. I notice many people complaining about the internet rate you have to pay in room if you want to use it. Most of the hotels I have been to (and overseas) always charge internet... so it wasn't a surprise to me. I was happy to use the free wifi in the lobby area! The hotel is PERFECTLY situated. Been to Seattle many times and this is by far one of the best locations we've stayed at. Drug store just down the street, movie theatre, good restaurants, the shopping malls right there. The pool & hot tub area was very nice as well with all the glass windows. Disappointed there wasn't enough time to try the gym. We'll definitely be choosing the Westin again next time we visit Seattle. The little breakfast cafe in the hotel was great too, and nice service!

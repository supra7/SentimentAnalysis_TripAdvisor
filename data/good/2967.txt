This hotel is amazing. I love the rooms, I love the fitness center, and I really love the pool area. It is a huge pool with two hot tubs that are actually, hot. I know this sounds odd but the hotel smells amazing. The staff was helpful and there are some restaurants in the area. One gripe, and it's a big one. The Internet. Will you please explain to me why the more expensive hotel chains charge for wireless but motels like Comfort Inn, and La Quinta, give complimentary internet? It is the number one complaint that I have against the whole Marriott chain. Although I do realize that some of the Marriott brands (Fairfield, Courtyard) offer the complimentary internet, I just believe that for $150 a night you should receive free internet! Overall, a very nice Marriott, with exceptionally clean rooms!

My husband and I stayed at KBH for nine days in mid-May. We chose a room overlooking the ocean. The location was perfect because there's lots of action on the water and on the beach walk, but the hotel itself is on the quiet end of the beach. Our room was quite comfortable, but we were most impressed with the staff and service. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming. All of the housekeepers and groundskeepers in every area of the hotel greeted us with a smile every time we walked by them. Although we didn't take advantage of the free hula dancing or lei-making classes, we saw quite a few people who did. We enjoyed looking at the crafts tables that the various local artisans set up on during the mornings we were there. It was also fun to go over to the little stage by the bar between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m to watch the free hula shows. We didn't bother going over to the free breakfast on the first day because we knew we'd have to listen to an orientation. The breakfast buffet at the restaurant was good, but quite expensive, so we usually went into Lahaina for a cheaper breakfast. We also didn't care much for the one dinner we had at KBH restaurant, so ate elsewhere the rest of the time. We thought the closing ceremony for all the guests who were leaving that day was a lovely touch and now have a beautiful memento of the hotel.

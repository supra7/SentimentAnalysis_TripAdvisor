We just returned on 7/18/08 from 6 nights at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel in Maui. We had a partial ocean view room in the Lanai wing. We were impressed from day one with the beach. It was plenty wide and not rocky at all. The hotel property was never crowded. We felt there was plenty of space to lay out and to wander the property in the evenings at dusk to view the sunset. Our room was kept very clean. The front desk was always helpful, and the employees who provide the welcome breakfast are a riot. We took two of the Hawaiiian culture classes the hotel offers (lei making and hula lesson). Book early as the classes fill up 3 and 4 in advance. There were several other classes we wanted to take and couldn't because they were booked already even though we checked on our second day there. The hotel location was very convenient -- when we felt like driving for supper it was only 5-10 minutes to many good restaurants in Lahaina, and when we wanted to stay near the resort for supper we would just take the boardwalk -- several good restaurants only two or three few hotels away. The Mixed Plate buffet breakfast that comes as part of package is just OK. Same thing nearly every day with only a little variation. We were glad to have it included with our package, but the lack of variety got a bit old by the 6th morning. The bartender at Tiki Bar was rude and very slow. Took him 30 minutes to get one drink and get our receipt to pay the bill. The grounds of the hotel are kept up very well. Beautiful landscaping -- it appeared to us to be much better than the landscaping at neighboring (more expensive) hotels. Overall, we would return to this hotel for its decent price. It is a clean, welcoming hotel.

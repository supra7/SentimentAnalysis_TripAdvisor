Yes, the rooms are small and yes the bathrooms are tiny and yes the flushing toilet sounds like a jet taking off...but for price and convenience it cannot be beat. The staff was friendly and the coffee shop was a great asset. I am planning my next trip to the great Pacific Northwest and will stay again at the Executive Hotel Pacific.

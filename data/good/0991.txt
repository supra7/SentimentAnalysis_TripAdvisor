Stayed here for 4 nights for a conference. Hotel staff was extremely knowledgeable of the area and quite professional. I was upgraded to a 2 room suite on the 25th floor upon arrival with access to the club lounge on the 26th floor. The view I had from the 25th floor was amazing. Could see the water front from one window and the Space Needle from the other and what a spectacular sky line Seattle offers at night. This hotel is located about 1/2 a mile from Pikes Place Market the Water Front and the First Starbucks. The walk down is great and when I say down i mean down. Returning to the hotel was straight up hill but worth the effort in my opinion. Despite having complimentary breakfast in the club lounge I did eat one morning in the restaurant and it was a basic buffet or you could order off the menu if you have the time I would recommend walking to the water front to find breakfast. Did have room service one night. A basic Turkey Club with Fries and water. Was about 20.00 including tip so not so bad for room service. I gave the server a couple of extra bucks but he was not expecting it. My only complaint with this hotel was the Elevators seemed to be running slow. Not sure if they were all working or what but it was a small inconvenience. This will definitely be my hotel for future stays in Seattle.

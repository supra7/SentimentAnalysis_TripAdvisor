nice little hotel 10 mins walk from main train station. checkin was easy and we were given city map and lots of tips. staff helful and friendly for our entire visit. the room itself was rather small and quite dark. cleanliness was an issue - lots of dust and dirt on the floor and behind curtains and under the bed. rest of the room was clean. free internet provided also but only on level 1 in the breakfast room. wifi is valid for 2 hours only then you need another ticket. this breakfast/internet room really needed tea and coffee making facilities or a vending machine. the breakfast itself was simple but of good quality and included everything required. hotel is overall of good quality and i would recommend this hotel to anybody - room size isnt a major issue because venice has so much to offer you spend most of the time outdoors. hotel is close to restaurants and 10 mins walk to rialto and easy 25 mins walk to the main square.

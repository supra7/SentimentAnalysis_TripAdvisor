The place has all of the amenities of a first-class resort. Food is good, but not as great as in other nearby resorts. Only two selections of wine - Merlot and Cabernet of a local label. If you want something of better quality, you need to buy the whole bottle. Among staff members, only the front desk people speak decent English. All others, including shift managers at restaurants, cannot neither understand what you are asking about nor are able to explain their thoughts clearly. The resort operator should have at least an introductory English course for their lower-rank enployees. Service is OK, but some staff members don't follow through. For example, a waiter at the restaurant asks you what you would like to drink, then disappears and never shows again or brings only half of what you requested, such as forgetting a lime. Probably because he didn't understand what you siad in the first place. Spa services are all extra and expensive. Discount cupons are simply rediculous. They inflate the price of service by the value of a cupon, so you still pay the whole retail. If you need unlimited Internet connection in the room, get a Junior Suite or special package. If you are not crazy about services and need just a nice, clean room, beach, and sunshine, Secrets Maroma is a good place to spend your vacation.

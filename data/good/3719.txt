Surely the best of this hotel is its location. The breakfast is good and the staff are very kind. The rooms are comfortable, but it seems like everything, a psychedelic dream of an architect, which gives little practicality. The reception on the first floor. This is another problem. We had trouble when we arrived with the luggage. On arrival, we wanted to eat something around 11 o'clock at night. The bar was open but had nothing to eat. Suggested that we look for a nearby restaurant. I found this a service failure. Another problem was the delay in arranging the room.

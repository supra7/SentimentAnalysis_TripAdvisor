Let's get the bad out of the way...Breakfast may be the worst in Montreal. Below ays Inn quality...We could not even eat it, and this is the third time we tried it. Ended up walking to Chez Cora nearby which is about the best breakfast in town. This is my third stay, and my room was not ready by check in time 2 out of 3 times. Recommend getting there 90 minutes after check in or call ahead on your way in to see if room is ready. WOW is that lame... Otherwise the hotel is very nice. Service is that typical Quebecois trying to be nice but you can tell they are really trying hard. Rooms are clean and spacious, we had an executive suite which was nice. Location could not be better. The new bar in the hotel is very nice, especially the outdoor part in summer. Expect to pay at least 30-40% more in summer than winter. Do not order room service if you can help it. It was very lame. With so many restaurants nearby you should really get out and eat as much as possible. I will stay here again, but I would not recommend bringing any kids under age 16. It is really meant for adults, unlike Loews Vogue which caters to kids and upscale guests as well.

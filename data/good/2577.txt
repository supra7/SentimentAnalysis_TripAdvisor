This was my first time staying at Hotel Max. It was exactly what I expected it to be after reading other reviews prior to my trip. The hotel is full of art and is very "in" and trendy. The room, as well as the lobby, was just like other reviews stated... small, however, I was comfortable. The bed was great. Service was great as well. I decided against renting a car and only used public transportation during my weekend in Seattle and it worked out perfectly, considering I stayed downtown. The people at the front desk were very accommodating in helping me decide what buses to take to such places as Pikes Market Place (which is within walking distance) and the Safeco baseball field. They also informed me of an airport shuttle bus that stopped only a small block away from the hotel. My boyfriend and I were pleased with our stay at Hotel Max.

My husband and I stayed here last weekend for our anniversary and thought it was nice. It's a cool, stylish hotel that's not self-important. Small room and really compact bathroom. My husband said the shower was too small and the shower curtain kept clinging to him. I had a hard time regulating the temperature; it seemed like it was too hot or too cold as you can't set it to maintain a certain temp. Nice bed/bedding and decor. Of course parking was expensive ($30 plus taxes); all city hotels charge crazy parking fees these days. Great location for walking to Pacific Place, shopping and the movie theater at GameWorks. We didn't try the restaurant, but it looked nice. Everyone we came into contact with at the hotel was very friendly. We live locally and were just in the city for an occasion so we'll likely try a different hotel next time, but I'd recommended it to out-of-towners looking for a nice, affordable city stay.

I always stay here when on business travel and I love the location and the view from the room. The Starbucks in the hotel is one of the best things. Hilton Honors members get vouchers to Starbucks, which makes my morning. The rooms are new and clean. It's my favorite Hilton in the States. Wish they had fridges in the rooms and parking was cheaper, but it is downtown San Diego and on the bay.

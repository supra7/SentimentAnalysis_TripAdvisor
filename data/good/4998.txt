We stayed at Pera Tulip at the beginning of our Turkish trip. The hotel wasn't the most easy to find to start with but as soon as you settle in you'll realise that it is actually very close to everything the new town of Istanbul offers. It's only about a 5 minute walk to the main shopping street, or less than 10 mins of walking to the southern tunnel leading to the bridge. Bear in mind that the "Superior" room is actually their standard room and the sizes can be quite small depending on which room you get. We got the room which was literally the size of a double bed plus a table. So we complained and much to our surprise we were upgraded to an Executive Balcony Room, which was very good.

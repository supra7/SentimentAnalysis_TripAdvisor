The Hyatt Regency was absolutely beautiful! It is definately expensive, as are many restaurants/resorts in Hawaii. We had outstanding service upon checking in (after 9 pm even). Our reservations were just as we expected. The rooms were very nice. Yes, there are a few nicks on the furniture where guests have been less than careful. The beds were very comfortable. The sites, with the plants and wild life, were beautiful. Do be cautious of the mini bar and the snack tray. Items are set upon a tray with sensors...if you pick up an item to look at it...you will be billed for it. This was easily taken care of upon check out, however. The beach area was better than we were expecting. My husband and teenage son had a great time snorkeling just off to the side. An Activities Group (ie. pool volleyball, beach volleyball, boche ball, etc) would have been super for our older teens (similar to what the resorts have in Mexico), however, our 18 and 20 year old daughters had a very nice vacation lounging around the pools. Parking spots are tight. We had a rental minivan which was doable in the small spaces. I was thankful we didn't have an SUV. We went thru the Pacific Whale Foundation for our snorkeling trip and had a great time there. We had a bonus to our excursion with a Mommy and baby whale circling our boat! The Old Lahaina Luau was a wonderful experience as well.

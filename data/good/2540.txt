I was called for jury duty and looked for an affordable and nice hotel near the Federal District Court. Hotel Max was perfect. The rooms are small but very clean, fresh and comfortable. The artwork is fascinating. Friendly staff, very flexible and accommodating. (They'll bring you any pillows including specialty pillows --a nice touch.) They're located next door to the Federal Courthouse and are very convenient to good restaurants and interesting attractions. I will stay there again.

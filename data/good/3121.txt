This hotel is located right across the SeaTac airport, about 20 minutes outside of Seattle downtown. It was a pleasant stay, the lobby area is very easy on the eyes, and so is the lounge where you can have drinks and watch a large flat screen TV, which is adjacent to the lobby. They had one terminal for the guests to use and access the internet in the lobby, it was a little slow. Staff was pleasant and helpful, and they put me in a room in the top floor facing away from the airport with a pleasant view of the hill surrounding the area, it was a corner unit far away from the elevators. This hotel had their elevator in a separate hallway than the rooms, which should be the norm for all hotels, so the noise of the beeping elevators is not heard in the rooms. (read my rant about the Hilton in Vancouver). Parking was plentiful and Free, which is important. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that they had free wireless internet access in the rooms, this was very helpful to me. I never did try the restaurant, but did try their work out area, and thought it was adequate with decent equipment, and clean. They also have an indoor, hot tub, and pool that looks more like a lap pool. I believe I got a great deal for what I paid through priceline. It is about 20 to 25 minutes from downtown, and you may encounter some traffic on the way to downtown so be prepared.. There was a safeway and many places to eat, with in a short drive of the hotel. This hotel only needs some minor improvements, like fixing up the elevators, and some other minor blemishes in the room furniture... I would deffinetly stay here again.

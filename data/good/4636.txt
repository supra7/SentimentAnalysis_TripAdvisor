Great hotel, friendly staff, and an excellent location. Our only complaint was that we booked a partial ocean view and good barely see the ocean through the garden trees from our balcony. We stayed in the Kaua'i tower on the 4th floor facing the courtyard. Save your money and just get a garden view room. We've attached pictures from our balcony so that you can judge for yourself.

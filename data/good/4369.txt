We stayed six nights in an oceanfront room. Loved going to sleep with the balcony door open hearing the waves crashing. The hotel charges a daily resort fee which is a little silly. The pool area is awesome. The beach are is poor. Very little sand as compared to other hotels down the block. There is a very convenient beachwalk which connects all the hotels and whaler's village. Great for sunset strolls. The beds are super comfy. The rooms overall are very nice. Make sure to get a package that includes the breakfast buffet. Otherwise you will pay 20/person for the buffet.

When traveling in and out of Seattle for business I always stay at the Doubletree. It offers food, drinks, free internet access (in the common areas), and even has free computer terminals next to the bar. After a long day working it's nice to leasurely check emails while sipping a cocktail. I ususally rent a car from Enterprise which is just a couple of blocks from the hotel - they will pick you up and drop you off which saves paying the hotel's nightly parking fee.

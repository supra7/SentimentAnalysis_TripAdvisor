Great stretch of beach in Riviera Maya. Hotel is beautiful and service is typical Mexico, everyone is always eager to help. The property is clean and well kept and the rooms are very nice. I only have one minor complaint, the restaurants; they don't take reservations and consequently, there was a waiting line most nights. Also, they claim to have premium wines and liquors but they only have mid-range liquor and bargain wines; you have to pay extra for better wines. My girlfriend is in a wheelchair and when we discovered our room had a step down to the patio, they concierge had one of the workmen build a ramp for her; I can't praise this property enough for this level of service. Also, when I left for a few hours to play golf, the concierge looked in on her to make sure she was ok. This is what I mean by typical Mexico, their culture is so compassionate and ready to help. If you want an all inclusive vacation, this is the place!

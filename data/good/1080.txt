We spent three nights at the Renaissance and enjoyed it very much. It was within walking distance of most attractions and the (free zone) bus service. Checked TripAdvisor for places to eat and have to thank you for two great choices - the Oceanaire for seafood and Assaggio for Italian. Great restaurants!

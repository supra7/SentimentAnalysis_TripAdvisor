This is a great hotel on a budget. We Stayed 3 nights and found it to be great. It is not fancy our room did not have air conditioning or a fancy TV but we had a great stay. The location is great and you can get around easy downtown. We took the free tour of the Moore Theather located next to hotel. Our room was clean and we loved the towel animals. The bathroom and shower are very small but nice. We found free parking on the street Sunday. We would stay here again!

My husband and I stayed at the Crown Plaza during spring break. Upon arrival, we were told that we would be given a room with two beds, even though I had booked a king bed. The matter was resolved quickly. The staff was helpful and met our requests. The room was large, clean, quiet and had a great view. The location of the hotel is decent. Overall, it was great experience. I really have no complaints (though, as others have said, the elevators are a bit slow). I would stay there again!

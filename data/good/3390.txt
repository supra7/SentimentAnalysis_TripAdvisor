We booked SMB mainly on the good reviews it received. I can say I was not disappointed. I will not repeat all the good comments that have already been stated on here. They are pretty much "right on". I would like to mention the service and food at the pool was amazing. Someone was always asking if you needed a drink or whatever. Rooms were very nice. We were in an ocean view room - 4th floor.. great view. The only negative comment I have to make - and maybe we were just there at the wrong time- the resort was at full capacity. Allot of company groups. Chairs at the pool were at a premium. Sometimes we could not even find one. We didn't seem to have that problem at the beach. We had no problems with the resturants.. 1/2 hr wait max. The food was okay. You could always find something you liked. Lobby bar is nice to relax and meet people. We were there during the Packer/Bear playoff game and they did a fantastic job for us at the theater. Big screen to watch the game.. bar open.. good servers and plenty of food. The main pool is heated and was enjoyable. I gave this resort a 4 star instead of 5 mainly because they could not handle the full capacity crowd and the food just was not of a 5 star quality for Mexico. We enjoyed ourselves and would return. You are paying for that beautiful beach. If the beach is not that important to you I would recomend EPM which is very similar but a bit less costly - in my opinion the food was better at EPM. If you are going to this resort I am sure you will enjoy it. The grounds are beautiful.

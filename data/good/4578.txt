it's a nice place to stay if ur on a budget. the place just needs a new paint job and it will be a better looking tropical resort..since it already has the "most hawaiian" feel to it compared to the other hotels around. the WELCOME BREAKFAST is the BEST! and they have a "Welcome" and "departure" LEI CEREMONY which is also the BEST. Their swimming pool is small but that shouldn't matter as the whole island is surrounded by "swimming pools". I din't like their Aloha Mixed Plate restaurant.. their selection for breakfast buffet there wasn't vast. but overall it's a nice place to stay.

We stayed at this all-inclusive resort for our anniversary, from 29 June to 5 July '09, and were somewhat disappointed in that there are very few little private, romantic, places to just be with your significant other after dark. We stayed at Excellence Riviera the last two years and must say that they have Secrets beat, where that is concerned. The service and food at Secrets was excellent, as far as we were concerned, however, there were some small ammenities, such as rose petals on the bed, being met with a glass of champaigne and hot, met with a hot, moist towel on arreval we didn't get, although others did. There were other small things that we expected, since it was our anniversary, that was advertised, that we didn't receive. Secrets is a beautiful property with an absolute fantastic beach. When you walk in the water the bottom is perfectly sandy, no rocks, pebbles, sea weed, or turtle grass, and water is crystal clear. One final comment, the pool area is pretty nice, but I defy anyone to find the 6 or 7 pools that's advertised. As I said, it's a beautiful property but I will not return, as I prefer moonlit places to sit and relax and romance my wife, Secrets has none of that.

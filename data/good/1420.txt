We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton 8/16-19. We requested rooms in Union Tower months before we arrived, but were told they were none available when we got there. The rooms we did receive were clean and comfortable. What an excellant location! You could walk to Pike's Market and the waterfront within minutes, the monorail for the Space Needle is right down the street and it's also in the "free zone" for buses. The hotel has a pool , sauna and whirlpool, but beware! If you're looking to relax after a long day in the city, in the whirlpool, count on small children! Even thought the rules posted on the wall prohibit children from using it, there is no enforcement! ( I had the unpleasant experience of a child sneezing while in the whirlpool and using the water as his tissue, right in front of his father!) All in all, the Sheraton is a great hotel to base out of to see such a wonderful city!

We just returned from a 10 day stay in Maui (4 nights at the Marriott in Wailea and 5 nights at the Hyatt). The pools at the Hyatt were fabulous. Warm, and wonderful to swim in. The kids area of the pool was equally as nice. My kids loved it! The beach infront of the hotel was very disappointing, but you could walk just a bit north and use the Marriott beach, you just couldn't use their beach chairs). The food was very disappointing. Unbelievably expensive and BAD. If it were good, I wouldn't have minded paying the prices. I've been to Hawaii before, so I knew to expect the prices at the hotel, I was just hoping for decent food. We ended up walking down to Wailers village everyday for lunch at the Hula Grill. We'd return there again, the staff was very friendly, and helpful. The spa was great as well.

My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Quality Inn. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms were decent; don't expect luxury, but they're clean. The breakfast was waaaaaaaayyyy above average, and the location is great! Despite being close to a busy road, it was pretty quiet. If you want to stay close to Seattle Center, this is a very cost-effective option.

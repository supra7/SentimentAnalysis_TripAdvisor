We booked our one night stay in Seattle through Priceline - $135 for the night plus taxes etc. For that price we were extremely happy with our stay. There were a few issues though . . . Our room was comfy and cozy and a bit small - it was an office that was converted to a guest room. We had a view of an ugly wall. But the beds were comfortable and clean and full of pillows!! My 4 year old son found a pill on the floor of the room and brought it to me. Thank goodness he knew what to do and didnt try to eat it!! We mentioned it to the staff upon check out. The hotel clerk was clearly upset and very apologetic. When I also mentioned that our in room coffee machine didnt work - he bought us coffee and some milk for the kids. They probably should have done more since I think the pill thing was a HUGE problem. We had been traveling all week and gretting ready to catch a flight so I really was half asleep at checkout.

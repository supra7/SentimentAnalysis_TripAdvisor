We enjoyed our stay, but "right across the street from the stadium" is very misleading until the pedestrian footbridge is completed. It's 6-8 block walk to the stadium, which was fine for us but might not have been for others. There is only daily-fee-for-service internet, which seems ridiculous for a hotel this high-end and in a business/convention center location. That's nickle-and-dime behavior. Housekeeping came by before 9:00 on two of our three mornings (including checkout day), and desk staff was polite but unsympathetic about it, and made no effort to own or apologize for the problem. This hotel was a great value for the 3-for-2 night price I found (and we were willing to walk a lot), but I'd have been annoyed if I'd payed full price for the advertised ballpark proximity.

We were on the 29th floor with a great view of the skyline.The beds were extremely comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. The room was nice and quiet. The front desk staff were very helpful with bus routes and other directions.It was very clean. I think free WiFi is a must, and this hotel charges for WiFi. Also, although there was a coffee pot in the room it would be really nice to be able to get a quick cup of (free) coffee to take to the room in the morning.

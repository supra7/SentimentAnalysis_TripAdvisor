I must say that we had a great time at this hotel-spa even though we encountered one major problem: the air conditioning in our suite wasn't working properly. The hotel staff did everything they could to fix the problem and we didn't want to move to another room. Because of this situation, they generously gave me a complimentary massage, which was absolutely amazing. We booked a Garden Suite, and since there was a wedding at the hotel that weekend, they upgraded us to one of the two suites. Beautiful room with a terrace, nice view of the beach, and I loved the high roof. The bathroom is nice and modern, but it could be a little uncomfortable since there is no door in the toilet area and no curtain or shades in the terrace doors, so if you don't take the proper action (like putting a towel on the shower door) everybody in the pool could entertain watching you taking a shower. Besides that, and it wasn't a real concern for us, it is a really nice, ample, simple yet comfortable suite. The hotel staff is very kind and helpful, from the concierge to the really nice restaurant waiters. Overall, the food at the restaurant is fairly good but not vegetarian-friendly. Nice pool and beach area. Took a nice and long walk along the beach and the water was clean and warm. Do not expect big resort amenities. This is a small, cozy, hidden, cabana-like boutique hotel.

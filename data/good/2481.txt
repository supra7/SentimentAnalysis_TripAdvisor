Well, there's not way to beat this location. Minutes to walk most anywhere. A block from Nordstroms and the monorail, and a few more to Pike Place. Very trendy boutique type hotel. Wonderful ambience, amenities and furnishings. Bed was great. This would be 5 stars but the bathrooms are a bit small. OK, they're small. Nice... but small. Aveeno tolitries, but in a small bathroom. So, who's in the bathroom anyway? Get back out on the street. Don't hesitate to stay here. Adjoining restaurant is outstanding.

I'm young and love to be out on the town. Going to Seattle I had planned on visiting all the sites I could manage on a weekend getaway and the W was my choice for a Hotel. I had an upgrade to a Cool Corner room and everything was so modern and clean. I loved the lemon + sage Bliss bath products. Going out at night was great too since all the clubs were within short distance of the W. When I returned from sightseeing or partying there was still a party going on in the lobby at the W! I I would recommend the W for a good time.

The hotel is the bus stop for the Quick Shuttle from Vancouver and is a quick comfy 2 hour ride from South Surrey .. we did the hotel and then did a nice walkabout to the CBD too!! Space Needle is a short walk .. we even did the big trek to Safeco and the ball game and bus back to hotel .. easy access for car and traffic .. have done a few times and would recommend the place as a stay!!

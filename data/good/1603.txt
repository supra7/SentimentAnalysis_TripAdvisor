We stayed in ndra Lux Suite, it was more than suitable to share with out 3 year old twins, it gave us privacy with a t.v. The hotel is a beautiful viewing experience from when you first step in the doors. Whilst I never had the pleasure of the bellhop being able to open a door for me in the 3+ days I was there (whilst I struggled with strollers, children's bags etc - with the exception of when we first arrived), my husband almost always had superb friendly service. I also say the same about the front of house staff. They were very "efficient", not friendly. My husband had the opposite experience. One would think it was me.... The position of this hotel is 2nd to none. Situated in downtown, we walked everywhere. It is positioned in the middle of the space needle and the shops. There is a reason it is one of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World, it is positively beautiful. Plus the restaurant downstairs is a must- it is fabulous. The bellhop recommended the flying fish. This is a must also. Seattle was a fantastic experience (don't forget the boeing factory).

We spent Christmas 2011 with the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. I say with because the staff there do make you feel part of the family. Everyone there is really friendly and are geuinely happy to have you stay at the hotel. Our room, was recently renovated, clean and comfortable. The extra wide sliding door to the lanai made the room feel more spacious. We enjoyed the view of the grounds and Black Rock. Christmas Eve was memorable for a number of reasons. Our son sprained his ankle skim boarding. The staff at the hotel were extraordinarily helpful in making him comfortable until we could get him to urgent care. A special thankyou to the couple who helped get him off the beach. The evening became more memorable with the hotel presenting a very entertaining hula show. They did a great job considering the winds were knocking out the power that night. All in all we would certainly return to the Kaanapali Beach Hotel...we have to. We need to get some white kukuli nuts on our leis.

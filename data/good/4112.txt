We just finished a great family vacation at the resort - 4 rooms including 3 teenagers & a 6 yr old. The resort is very nice - awesome pool area. The breakfast buffet is excellent - a little pricey @ $30pp but it was included in our package. Food in general is high throughout the area.. The only negative about the hotel is the beach area - very narrow & not much beach to be exact. The beach widens a little ways down the boardwalk about a 1/2 mile from the hotel which is not too convenient when you are carrying stuff. The best beach area is closer to the Sheraton but the Hyatt is a much nicer hotel so there are some trade-offs. Parking throughout the area is scarce.

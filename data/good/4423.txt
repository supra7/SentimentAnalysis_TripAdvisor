Just came back from Maui after reading mixed reviews about this hotel. I had hesitations but as soon as I arrived at the hotel those hesitations went away! The best part of this hotel is that it's not like a concrete jungle like some hotels. It has a massive garden setting and you aren't crammed in like sardines. You can peacefully read a book under the frangipani trees, take a dip in the pool or grab a snack at the tiki bar (The calamari is awesome!) The rooms aren't too bad, a little dated, but they are clean and comfortable and house keeping comes religiously everyday. Staff are very friendly, always saying aloha when they walk past and previous comments are correct in saying that some people from the neighbouring hotels pop in because it's so different to any of the hotels on the Ka'anapali strip.

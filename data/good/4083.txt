Great Hotel, but it is Huge!! 4 places to eat 2-3 bars. Location is perfect, located on the beach with the rest of the giant hotels, but close enough to the very cool Lahaina town for dinner and drinks. If you're looking for style and originality in a hotel, this is not the place. If you're looking for a safe, well catered hotel with a great location, pick this one.

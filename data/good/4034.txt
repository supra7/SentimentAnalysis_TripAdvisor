I stay at my Hyatt's, and they recently renovated this one. I got upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean Suite which was absolutely stunning- I never wanted to leave the room. My one complaint about this hotel is the pool situation- for such a huge complex, they only have one hot tub and they do not offer enough shade. Umbrellas is a cheap and easy fix- people were literally putting their towels out at 6am by the pool to get a good spot with some shade. For such a nice hotel, this is ridiculous and guests should not have to play such "pool and towel games."

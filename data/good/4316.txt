We just returned from a first-time trip to Maui. We stayed at the Hyatt Regency on Kaanapali and it was fantastic. We had a golf course/mountain view room and it had a lovely view and was nice and quiet. The room was very comfortable and the bed was spectacular. Possibly the most comfortable hotel bed ever -- with the fluffiest white down comforter and pillows. On a par with the Heavenly Bed at the Westin... They Hyatt grounds are beautiful. We never had any trouble getting a chair around the pool. The service was excellent. The prices for food and drink are HIGH ($9-12 for a tropical drink and ~$6-7 for a beer) but everything on Maui is expensive and you eventually get over the sticker shock and settle in. ;) We walked all along the beach path and think the Hyatt was by far the most beautiful property. We would definitely go back there. (On our last day we drove to South Maui and viewed the Wailea Grand and it was quite incredible!) We drove the Hana Highway (we actually had second thoughts about doing this...) and did not regret it. We saw so many beautiful waterfalls, plants, and birds. I would highly recommend the Garden Of Eden arboretum ($10/pp admission) on your drive to Hana. Great place to stop for a picnic lunch and to view the serene surroundings. Clean restrooms too! Get the Maui Revealed book -- it'll become your bible. Lots of GREAT advice. We enjoyed the food at the Hula Grill very much and had a wonderful anniversary dinner at Gerard's. The service at Gerard's was first class. E-mail me with any questions.

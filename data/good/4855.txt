My mother and I stayed for four nights in the hotel, just a couple of weeks ago. We knew we were staying in this hotel, and not Hotel Sonya, so that eliminated some potential confusion. The outside sign is very very small, so you must look for the hotel based on the address. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. They held our bags and let us check in early. The breakfast (included with our room price) was quite substantial, and laptop use was free. The beds were comfortable and the room a decent size by European standards. Bonus - the hotel isn't far from the train station, and it is right next to the Opera House, perfect for coming home late after an opera or ballet, if it fits into your itinerary! I would definitely recommend the hotel and stay there again.

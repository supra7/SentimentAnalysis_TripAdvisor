For a driver visiting Seattle for the first time the Inn was really convenient , so close to the main interstate highway yet in a quiet location with great parking. While out of town the lake was close by with a pleasant walkway around the campus that was v pleasant. Having laundry facilities, free computer internet access (albeit time limited) and a good complimentary breakfast were additional positives. Reception and staff were very helpful.

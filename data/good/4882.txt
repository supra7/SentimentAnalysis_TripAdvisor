We were supposed to be staying in Hotel Sonya but when were arrived there we were sent to their sister hotel - Hotel Opera which was just across the road. Check in wasn't till 2 but we were there at about 1.30 and given our room. We were upgraded to a suite. There were 2 and a half floors in the suite, the bathroom was downstairs and was huge and included a Jacuzzi. There was a good choice of food at breakfast. The staff at reception were very nice and helpful. The hotel is very central it was only about 3 mins to a metro station. There were plenty of nice restaurants around the area also.

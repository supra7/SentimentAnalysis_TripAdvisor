Very new and modern hotel and up to the usual standard of Hilton. Room was spacious and clean and we had a great view overlooking the harbour (from the 19th floor). The hotel has a deal with the Starbucks on the ground floor. Be warned, in the morning, from about 8-9 am there are very long queues here. It took nearly 30 mins to get coffee and tea. The rest of the hotel facilities (bar's, restaurants, gym etc.) are really nice. The hotel is so close to the Gas Lamp Quarter though, that you shouldn't really need to use these too often. Only real dowenside is that on one of the days we stayed there, only 2 out of 5 elevators were working. This caused real problems getting down to the Lobby in the morning as the elevators were always full!

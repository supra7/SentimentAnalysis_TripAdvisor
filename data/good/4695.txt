My wife and I stayed at the Kaannapali Beach Hotel for the 2nd half of our Honeymoon in July 2003 for 5 nights. I have to say that the hotel is "old fashion" but that is what we loved about it. We wanted to be away from all the other well known hotels where is too much traffic going in and out and also away from the noise. It was very laid back and the atmosphere was great. We really liked the location and the view of the ocean. The staff was very friendly, they even helped me look for something that I thought I had lost on my way out. I do have to say that the two guys at the Towel Hut by the beach were pretty rude, they need to get some people skills or maybe they are just jerks?? Anyway our stay was great, I would stay there again but maybe stay away from the Towel guys.

Just arrived back from our first ever visit to secrets. Like many on here we were a little concerned about the so called "time share attack" however received nothing. All that we did receive was a "welcome home" from the staff and refreshing drink and a cold towel which was very welcome. Particularly as our transfer from the airport had been less than smooth, however that wasn't the hotels fault so will say no more. This excellent overall rating for the hotel is deserved. Service is 1st class. Whether on the beach or by the pool not once did I have to go looking for staff, they were always available or checking if we needed anything else. They work so hard and even look like they enjoy what they do which cannot be easy in the heat they work in. Special mention to Jamie by the pool and Omar the bell boy who were superb. As i'm sure you read below the food is good, the rooms comfortable. We paid a little extra for a preferred club room. This is only as I wanted to be nearer the ocean and have a sea view. We also didn't have any mossie problems being closer to the beach. If you are on your way or thinking about booking you will not be disappointed. I'm quite good at picking at the details however just cant with this hotel. The only thing that was a minor irritancy on this holiday were some of the other guests. Now we met some nice Americans, so I will not tar them all with the same brush. But cmon! it seemed like some of them were having their very first beer. All the whooping and the shouting after a couple of drinks was embarrassing. I'm in my early 30s and can handle my drink and like a good time, however some in their 30s, 40s and 50s seem to have a bit more trouble. Its almost like they had just discovered alcohol. Anyway excellent resort and worthy of its high rating on this site.

My wife and I visited El Dorado Maroma the first part of May. What a nice, small, resort with great up-scale offerings. We enjoyed having a beach butler stop by about every 15 minutes to refresh our drinks, and the restaurants were fantastic. Having the ability to order food from the after-hours menu was a plus when we were out sight-seeing and didn't get back until 11pm. The beach is nice and was never overly crowded, and you can take a walk up north about 500 yards or more and be away from most of the folks and have a slice of beach heaven all to yourself. All the fun activities were right there at the property next door - boat rides, dinner/sunset cruise, water craft, para-sailing - you can walk 50 yards to it all, while others have to be transported in. When you're there, you must take a trip into town (Playa del Carmen) for a day - very fun. I think the resort has a van that takes folks in free of charge every Wednesday - be sure to put that on your schedule. Perfect resort. Now, the information that you will want to know. Like everything nice, small, and quaint in Mexico's Riviera, things are changing... We were there in May of 2011 and El Dorado was partially completed with an expansion that would double the size of the rooms/property, and they were going to remove the less-expensive small two-story rooms from the property - no more small, quaint vacation stay - additionally, they were pushing hard to turn the additional rooms into time-shares. Also, no more open beaches and long walks on deserted beaches - they are building large resorts one after another next to El Dorado Maroma. So, it was one of the best places to stay for a small, secluded getaway, but all that will change probably by the time you read this. You may want to do some research on the area and talk to them if you are still expecting a small, secluded, 70+ people resort - that will not be the case shortly.

This is a great hotel for the price. We stayed in a deluxe room for $165/night which had a queen bed, shower and toilet. The room had one unusual feature - the shower was separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. If you don't want to know your traveling companion that intimately I suggest you ask in advance about the shower design in your room. I gather from the posted pictures that not all rooms share the same design. Things that I particularly loved: self serve breakfast available until noon, coffee and tea avaiable all day, washer/dryer next to the kitchen, and location in a trendy and centrally located neighborhood.

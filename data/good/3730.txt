The hotel is situated in Geylang area. Which is a minus, but also plus for some people. Other than that the hotel is very economical. Rooms are small. But neat and clean. Bathrooms are just ok. If you dont expect much, u'll be very happy. Free internet is there via Wifi. also a desktop at reception with pay per hour charges. Reception is good, and they helped us with discounts, also we kept our luggage at reception on last day morning and picked it up before going to airport thus saved one days charge. All in all Best u can get for such low price

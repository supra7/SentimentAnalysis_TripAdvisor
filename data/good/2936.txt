Located about 5 min from Sea-Tac via free shuttle, the hotel has a very nice tropical indoor pool in a large atrium. The room is nice and typical for standard Marriotr room. Room service was decent. It was delivered a bit later than the promised 30 min and I was automatically called by guest service to have the meal for free ( which I declined since I was not in a rush but it was a very nice gesture by the staff). The room is quiet and the bed is confortable. Overall, it is one of the nicest airport hotels that I have stayed in.

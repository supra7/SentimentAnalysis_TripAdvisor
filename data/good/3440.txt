The staff is very friendly and always at your service. The food was pretty good. Not 5 star good, but def had good meals there. They carried around butlered appetizers during lunch at the pool. Anything from sushi, to poppers, to pork tacos, etc. The pools were very clean and large. The website states like 12 pools, but it's really 2 pools with 10 private pools for the suites. The drinks were plentiful as well. Bars inside, at the pool, at the beach, and in the middle of the complex. Decent drinks, some shots, good "girly" drinks as well. The spa was gorgious. A little expensive, but very worth it. One of the best I've been too. The jr suites are nice. A little too open for our tastes. The cable is a mix of ENG and SPA channels. There were a few things that weren't as great. The nightly shows were hit or miss. The fire show was great, Grease was awful. Grease was a 3rd grade lip sync'd production with some dancing. The room service was ungodly slow. We ordered at all different times in the day. No matter what, at least 45 mins. One time they just forgot about us. Also, do not leave your sunscreen at home. We had to purchase some there, cost us $20 USD for a reg size bottle. Also, the $200 credits they gave us were a waste besides using $80 at the spa. The rest were for $10 individual coupons for bottle service. Unless you really like your wine, it's not a factor. We left the rest of the coupons alone. Make sure to bring many pairs of pants. To eat inside at the restaurants you must wear them. They don't care if they are jeans, khakis, dress pants, etc. Overall, the place is gorgious. I would recommend to anyone.

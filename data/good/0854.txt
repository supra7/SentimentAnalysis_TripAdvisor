We stayed at the Executive Hotel Pacific three days prior and one day post our Alaskan Cruise. The hotel is located about 40 min from the airport ($35.00 shuttle ride) on a steep road in downtown Seattle. We walked to all the major attractions and to Safeco Field for a ball game. Shuttled to the Cruise Ship terminal. The hotel is older, but very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are small so keep stuff organized. Bed super comfy! Bathroom also small but adequate for two people. "Seattles Best" coffee shop is attached and handy for breakfast. The hotel is advertised as "room and wine reception" I never saw any wine, but I didn't really care anyhow. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.

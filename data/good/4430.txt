The hotel is not new, but the ambiance is very Hawaiian. Lots of trees, flowers, serenity. The staff was great, and our room had a great view of the beach. Snorkeling just a ways down the beach was excellent. We saw turtles every day. The sunset from here was lovely. If you stay here you won't be disappointed unless you're expecting a lot of "glitz."

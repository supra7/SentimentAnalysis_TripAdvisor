We stayed for a week in a lovely clean one bedroom condo with two large double beds, two bathrooms and kitchen/living room. Perfect for us. Cleaned each day. Short walk across golf course to wonderful sandy beach with sea turtles. Use of Cabana at the beach (house with beach chairs, towels, kitchen, bathrooms). Very friendly and helpful staff.

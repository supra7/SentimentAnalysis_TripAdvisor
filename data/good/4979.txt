Staff is polite, always at your service. The location of the hotel is ok. Very central for any shopping or touristic visit. The Metro is just a step away. Extremely small rooms. There should be free coffee and tea included in the room. Breakfast is nothing spectacular but really ok. There was also a spa/swimming pool which was a definite plus. They have free wi-fi, working excellent in the room.

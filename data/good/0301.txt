I am a frequent contributor to TripAdvisor, and I often review the hotels where I have stayed. I chose Inn at the Market because of the great reviews on TripAdvisor, and I was very pleased! Staying at Inn at the Market was a great experience. The valet and front-desk staff were extremely friendly, welcoming, punctual, and helpful. My room was comfortable. I often feel in hotels like I don't really want to let my bare feet touch the floor, but my room felt like a comfortable home-away-from-home. I had not slept on a Tempurpedic bed before, and it was very comfortable. The bathrom was spacious, toiletries were lovely, and shower was well-designed. The Seattle Athletic Club down the street was terrific. It is $15/day to use the facilities there, but really worth it if you're someone who needs to work out while you're traveling. It was wonderful to be right in the heart of things in Seattle, too. I enjoyed walking around the fish market, stopping at the original Starbucks for tea in the mornings, and eating at nearby restaurant The Pink Door. The one disappointment for me was the lack of breakfast, not a huge deal since there is a restaurant attached to the inn where you can order breakfast (though it is sit-down, not quick take-out) and many other restaurants nearby, but a slight inconvenience. As long as you're prepared for that, and leave time to find breakfast elsewhere, this won't be an issue. The rooftop deck offered a lovely view of the Puget Sound. Turndown service each night with chocolate was a nice touch. I would definitely stay again for business or pleasure.

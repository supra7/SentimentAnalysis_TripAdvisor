This hotel is located two minutes walk from the space needle and monorail entrance (which takes you close to pike market, Macy's and Nordstrom- $2.50 one way). The hotel is older but the rooms are adequately renovated. The rooms weren't the largest but the water pressure was excellent and the hotel had free breakfast. This hotel was great value and I would stay here again.

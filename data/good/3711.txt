The hotel was nice. It was clean and new. I had two rooms which were both on the small side. The flat rate fee for movies and internet was a plus since I had my two teenagers and two younger children with me. I thought the location was perfect for people who want to experience a the loud night life that tourist bring to Rome. Plenty of gelato,pizza within walking distance. A small convenience shop (for bottled water, snacks etc) is steps away. My only disappointment was the front desk attendant who was thoroughly annoyed that I didn't have all our passports upon check in. I arrived at the hotel an hour before my luggage (a friend brought the luggage) and all the passports were in the luggage. He told me he couldn't believe that in America you can just check into a hotel with a driver's license and credit card. So, don't forget to have all guests passports in hand.

This hotel is actually the same building as the Homewood Suites. I saw a room there as well an they were large and nice. My room in the HGI was nice with floor to cieling windows, nice work area, and all amenities you would expect from an HGI. Although the room is large, the hallway was tight because the closet and bathroom were in the hallway across from each other, and the closet was more of a stand up closet set into a cut out area. Nice breakfast area, business center, and lounge. Hotel is very close to some nice bars and reataurants and also Fells Point area, that offers even more great bars and restaurants. It's a $4 taxi ride to Fells point if you don't want to walk it. Valet Parking at the hotel is very expensive, but I suppose this is on par with parking in downtown Baltimore. As mentioned, I'll stay here again.

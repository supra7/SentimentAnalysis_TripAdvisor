We booked this hotel through Hotels.com as a city view room, but we were pleasantly surprised that we had a partial ocean view. We arrived 3 hours before check-in time, but we were able to get a room immediately through the very friendly reception clerk. All the employees from the valet to the people planting new flowers in the corridor planters gave us a very warm hello as we walked to our room. The room was very clean, homey and spacious. If you are coming for a special occasion, I would highly recommend the ocean view rooms. This hotel is smack dab in the middle of all the action at Pike Place Market, so forget about your car and just walk and take in the atmosphere and the boisterous vendors passing out samples of fresh pears and nuts. (We when arrived at the room, my husband opened the window and soft sounds, including someone playing piano, could be heard from the market below). It is also an easy walk to the Seattle Space Needle and restaurants. This hotel also has a big spacious deck that we took advantage of when the skies cleared and the sun came out for two days! I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Seattle because of the price, location and employees. I'm hoping my husband will take me back again!

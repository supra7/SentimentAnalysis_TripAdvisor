The Hyatt Regency Maui was exactly what we expected. Upon check in, they immediately acknowledged that we were honeymooners, chatted with us about the wedding and our trip, and promptly upgraded our room. The staff was very attentive and seemed to be genuinely interested in fulfilling our needs. The grounds were gorgeous! Penguins, swans, flamingos and birdsit was a tropical paradise. The pool was huge with plenty of lounge chairs. There were lots of chairs that were already claimed, but we never had a problem getting two together. The water slide is awesomedefinitely not just for kids! The grotto was pretty cool with a bar and TVs. The beach at this specific hotel isnt good for swimming or laying out, but walk a little way and youll find what youre looking for. The snorkeling at Black Rock is awesome! The rooms were nice. The beds and pillows were so very comfortable! The bathrooms are very small (standard bathtub and toilet in the same little room), but the vanity area is certainly comfortable for two. If youre looking for a garden tub with a separate shower, this isnt the hotel for you. If you dont mind sacrificing that one little thing (which I did), I think youll be happy! All in all, though, we had no problem with the room. The food was great, but expensive. We had complimentary breakfast, which I would strongly recommend (for two of us, breakfast would have been $60 per day). The breakfast buffet was fantastic! Anything you could think of was available to you and all of it was delicious! Lunch and dinner at Umalu and the other restaurants was pricey, but I would recommend the Furikake Stix as a snack. Theyre awesome! Things you definitely want to try: MauiDownhill bike tour to Haleakala, Cool Cat Caf for some great burgers and the Luau. We went snorkeling on our own and saw great things at Black Rock. Our honeymoon was absolutely perfect and the hotel amenities and staff played a large part in our satisfaction. We would definitely stay here again!

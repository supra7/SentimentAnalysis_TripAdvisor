Wow! Crazy wind, big waves, lots of weddings, then calm, quite, hot, good snorkeling, great people watching, great location and setting. Spent 5 nights at KBH. Would I stay here again? Yes. But do not spend time in rooms. I like to backpack and don't mind pit toilets, so this was comfortable. My wife, not that happy with room. Old, worn beds ok ( remember i'm ok sleeping on the ground). But our room was 1 minute from an amazing beach and pool was fine. So I can overlook rodents in room at night. Once I got rid of any food in room the furry critters left us alone. Staff were great, but food at hotel restaurants...not so much. For cheap, ok food head up the hill a half mile to CJ's. Spend your time on beach or in water and this place is AMAZIING! I'll be back!

No problem checking in or parking as other reviews suggested. All hotels in Seattle charge for parking, so I went there expecting it. At least the parking garage is clean, well lit and equipped with an elevator to the lobby of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and met every request with a smile. The morning beverage option was a nice touch and my kids enjoyed it. Rooms were clean and well maintained. I wish the pool was larger but it was well tended and kept at a comfortable temp. Location is convenient as long as you aren't walking everywhere. We would surely stay again!

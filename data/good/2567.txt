My husband and I stayed at Hotel Max from August 12th to 16th and had a great experience. - The hotel was sleek, hip, and cool... just as I expected from the photos. - Our room was extremely clean with a simple, contemporary style. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the hotel even has a variety of pillows from you to choose from (all you have to do is tell them what you want)! The bathroom setup was unique... the shower was essentially in it's own room (all cool glass tile) and the toilet and sink were separate in another "water closet". It was novel and we enjoyed it. - We didn't agree with the main complaint (small rooms) of past travelers. There is no need for the rooms to be any bigger. You're in Seattle!!!.... you shouldn't be in your room anyway. - There was a nice restaurant connected to the hotel (Red Fin)... Asian Fusion. They had a good happy hour both in the afternoon and late night. The only negative is that parking is $30 plus taxes per night... expensive!!! There is a parking lot across the street that is $17/day on the weekends and can be used on weekdays too at a higher cost. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We had a great experience... give it a try!

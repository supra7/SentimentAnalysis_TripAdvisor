good location, friendly staff, nice breakfast, clean rooms but really tight and small ones. the location of the hotel was very good, only 5 mins walk to the main road 'istiklal road' and 3 mins walk to Sichane Metro. the only thing that i didnt like in the hotel is the bathroom smell, otherwise i do recommend this hotel.

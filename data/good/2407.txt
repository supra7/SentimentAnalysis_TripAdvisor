This hotel is one of those places that makes you feel stylish just by being there. It is very styled, the way that most W Hotels are, but it still has a bit of the Seattle vibe. The location is great, esp. if you are there for business or high-end shopping. The in-house restaurant is pricey and has some weird hours, but the food is pretty good. The rooms were very comfortable and the Bliss products are a nice touch.

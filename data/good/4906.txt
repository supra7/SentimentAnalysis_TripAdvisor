We found this hotel a very pleasant place to stay. We stayed for 5 nights and each time we entered the hotel there was always a smiling face to greet us. The selection at breakfast was fulfilling. There was no traffic noise in the room we were in. The staff were very helpful and friendly and advised us on possible sightseeing locations when asked. The only downside was the bathroom and lift were a bit small. But overall we had a excellent stay and would return again.

New and clean rooms. Nothing to worry about choosing this hotel at all! Only thing is the location, as you'll need to take an 10minutes bus to the closest train station. And when you want to get back to hotel from train station, you'll have to walk 10min to the bus stop across a busy road to catch the bus. Going to the train station is easier, but not going back to the hotel as the walking and the waiting probably gonna take you approx 25min!

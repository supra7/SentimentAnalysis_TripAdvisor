This was our first visit to the Hawaiian Islands and the first hotel we stayed at. As the title stated I have no real complaints...the rooms were clean and the resort common areas were well kept. As another reviewer stated it is undergoing renovation so there was some scaffolding and drop cloths around which of course detracts considerably from the ambience. I did not notice the noise though we weren't there that long. The staff was very gracious and helpful..no problems there. My biggest disappointment was the pool...it was very difficult to get into and out of especially for someone my age. The beach is non-existent which was another huge drawback for us as we expected great beaches in Hawaii...not the hotels fault though. All in all I would recommend it but not highly. There is a golf course on the premises but we did not play so have no comment there.

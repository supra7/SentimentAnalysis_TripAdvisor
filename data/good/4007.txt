I have been coming often to Istanbul for work abd staying in Gezi Bosphorus. It is a nice boutique hotel with comfortable and modern rooms. Views on Bosphorus are great but even views on the Gezi park are quite pleasant. Ideally located, very close to Taksim square, Metro station, Nisantasi. Reasonably priced. The breakfast is not fantastic but acceptable, above average food and clean. Haven't had the chance to use the gym but will hopefully do next time. The lobby is definitely on the smaller side, but it is nice and sleek, and they have business facilities on a separate floor. All in all, great hotel worth checking for both leisure and business travelers

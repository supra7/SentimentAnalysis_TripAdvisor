This was our second trip to the Outrigger Maui Eldorado. We were once again very pleased with our experience. The rooms are well kept, with daily cleaning. The grounds and pools are meticulously cleaned. The full kitchen is nicely equipped. My husband was happy to have free high speed internet. It is a quiet, relaxing atmosphere. We enjoy the location, with a close walk to the beach, as well as the short drive to Lahiana (where there is lots of shopping and restaurants.) The only minor complaint I might have is that the airconditioning system is really not very adequate...but oftentimes you can open your patio door and get a cool breeze and there is a ceiling fan in the room.

I have never stayed at a full service Marriott that hasn't charged for Internet, and maybe only a few suburban ones in the midwest that didn't charge for parking. I have been a Marriott rewards platinum, gold, or silver member for many years depending on how much I traveled for business in a particular year. To complain about this, is like to complain about McDonald's charging for fries and a coke with a burger. If you don't like it, stay in a non-business class hotel. The reason they charge is because these are all reimbursable expenses for most business travelers. The reason Fairfield doesn't charge is because they are an economy hotel geared more toward thrifty travelers. So I have no complaints about the charges for extras because I expected it. I got this room on a Thursday and Friday for 129 which was a good value in my opinion. This is especially true considering I went to the flight museum and to Alki beach one of those days. The location is great if you are not touring the downtown area. The room was totally clean and updated. The outside of the building looks a bit old, but the entire interior has been redone in the past few years. it is actually quite hip. My only complaint is that I swiped a card at check-in and changed payment method upon check out. My initial card got charged, however this was only a minor convenience. This was certainly not the best full service I have ever stayed in, but it was nice.

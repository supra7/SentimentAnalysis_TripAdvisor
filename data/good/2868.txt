My son and I stayed here while attending a youth soccer tournament. (Seatac Cup.) After much research, we chose the Embassy Suites. I was very happy with the choice. The rooms are very clean and spacious with very dark curtains for a good night sleep. A major plus was the actuall bedroom with 2 beds and a seperate TV....nice for my son to unwind before bed while I was using the rest of the suite. AC worked fantastic, luckily for it was a scorcher that weekend. The staff was very friendly and were helful in giving directions to several local hotels. The only downfall was the pool. The pool and hot tub are very small and over chloriinated. Also not too impressed with smoking rooms mixed in with the non-smoking......get an occasional smell of cigs. when walking down open foyer to the elevator. Overall, very nice place.

This hotel is near the end of 192 West so a car is a must. It also lays back from the road and you could miss it. But don't miss this one if you like good service and friendly staff. We had booked a twin double but on booking in we were given the choice of a king size. We chose to stay with the twin and we can't remember haveing such comfortable hotel beds as these. The towels, soap, toiltries and even toothpaste were replenished every day. The continental breakfast was sufficient and the 24hr coffee was always fresh. If there was a downside it could be that there was no bath only a shower. The friendly staff and Chuck the manager were a joy to meet. Would we stay again? OF COURSE if they were not inundated with bookings.

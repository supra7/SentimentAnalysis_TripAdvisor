Check in was quick, easy and enjoyable as the front desk clerk was very amiable. The room was a little small but very clean and included a 1 cup coffee maker. The only minor complaints would be the Wi-Fi was somewhat slow and TV was the old tube style, not a flat panel. The location of the hotel is good as it's close to the Space Needle, downtown and public transportation. The free breakfast is great, as there is a large selection, including hot food (and waffles you can make fresh yourself) and it tasted good. I booked my room at Priceline and one of the freebies (I brought the printout and showed it desk clerk) was free parking so I didn't have to pay the $15 per night. Overall, a comfortable, pleasant experience at a reasonable price and I would stay there again.

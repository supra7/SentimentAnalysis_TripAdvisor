When in Seattle, I always stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel. I like its central location - walking distance to shopping, restaurants, Pike Place, museum, and with the light rail, stadiums. I usually get a deluxe room ... seating area and a little more room. Clean, comfortably furnished. Staff friendly, helpful. The only negative: the bathrooms all seems to be very small.

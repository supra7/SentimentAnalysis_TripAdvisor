My family and I stayed here a few weeks ago when we came up for an M's game and had a great experience. The hotel's location made in easy to get to Seattle Center and downtown quickly. Our room was clean and the hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. A great value for a room in the city that I would recommend to anyone looking for the best bang for your buck.

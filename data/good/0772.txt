Perfect for a night before and a night after our cruise. Family of four, with two teenaged children. We had a suite both times, two rooms with a bathroom in the middle for $121. Can't beat it. We were on the 3rd floor the first time, 6th floor the second time. Both floors were updated. It is an older building, but there was fresh paint, it was clean and we even a a towel elephant in the bathroom! TV and fridge in the room, internet in the lobby. Two blocks from the fish market, about 1/2 mile from Whole Foods. The desk clerks were great, helpful and stored our luggage after we checked out. Buses are free, so we were able to get around easily. Seattle has some interesting characters, I don't think they are limited to the Moore hotel area. There seemed to be a lot of tattoed, body pierced folks and homeless people. We are from the Philadelphia area, so this was not so unusual for us, but I can see how some people might be afraid. We had to go to the drugstore in the evening, and we felt safe. One regret is that we did not have a room away from the street. Apparently, the suites all face the street. I did hear the street noise at night, and that woke me. But, the rest of my family was not bothered by it. Otherwise, it was a nice place to stay on a budget. We don't go for fancy accommodations, we go to see the sights.

my husband and i stayed 2 nights at the W seattle for a weekend getaway. the 'cool' - i mean this both positively and negatively- 'cold' could also be used, receptionist checked us in efficiently. he placed us in a nicer room than i had booked which was very kind and appreciated. we had a corner room with floor to ceiling windows- spectacular view of the city. the 'bliss' shower/bath products were nice. but charge me to use the robe? that's kinda weird for a very upscale hotel? the tub was small, but clean. the BED was the highlight. sooooo comfy, great linens, couldn't have had a better nights sleep. the bar downstairs was good- busy, so we sat at the comfy chairs to order. this was fine, but kindof difficult to eat the hors de vours. (the kobe burger was fabulous) i would stay again if i got a good deal! and of course, parking fees are crazy expensive!!!

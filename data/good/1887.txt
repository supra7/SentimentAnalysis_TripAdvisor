We booked our hotel in Seattle thru Hotwire and were very pleased with the outcome. The room was spacious and comfortable with the ammenities usually offered by a Westin property- the Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Bath. We got this room at a great price and it was more than we expected. The hotel location is convenient to Pike's Market which is just a few blocks away, and to Pioneer Square which we walked to for the tour of Underground Seattle.

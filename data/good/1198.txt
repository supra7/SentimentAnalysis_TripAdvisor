This is my go-to property for a weekend downtown. We live in Everett, only about 25 miles away, but we often stay here for a weekend outing involving baseball, football, or shopping. Our most recent visit was Dec 1 - 4. We arrived at around 3:30 and even though our room was not ready (lots of people checking in at the same time for the Sehawks game, and a high occupancy load due to a bridge tournament being held on-site), the front desk clerk was very helpful and offered to give us a key to the fitness center so we could change into gameday gear. We dropped our bags at the bell stand and headed off to the game. When we returned, we were pleased to find that we had been upgraded to a corner room and given a bonus of 2500 Starpoints, as thanks for our patience. Location is perfect for shopping, dining, theater, or symphony - walking distance to everything. There are tons of excellent dining options within walking distance as well. The lobby bar is comfortable and spacious, with a decent wine selection and some very personable bartenders. Tip: it's worth paying the extra few bucks for a Deluxe room in the newer Union Street Tower. The rooms are larger and beautifully decorated in simple, relaxing neutrals. Plenty of room at the desk to work, and the work area is well-lit. Rooms are always sparkling clean and the staff has always been friendly and helpful.

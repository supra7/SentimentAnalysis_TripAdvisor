We stayed one night in this wonderful and warm hotel and recommend it highly. Our suite was fully equipped with a kitchenette, comfortable bed, and brand-new bathroom. The friendly and helpful owner was in the process of installing new LCD HD tvs in all the rooms and we had the pleasure of enjoying this new feature. The hotel was well located for our purposes, and we enjoyed breakfast in a charming cafe on the corner (Cafe Imagination). The suite was at the back and very quiet. Parking was conveniently provided, although we worried about the safety of the car based on its back-alley location. Overall we would stay at the Parc Suites again!

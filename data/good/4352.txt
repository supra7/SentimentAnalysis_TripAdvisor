We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for ten nights between Nov 25 and Dec 5, 2004. We were fortunate to be there at a time when the occupancy was only about 60%. We therefore had no issues getting a chair at the pool and no problems with service. The staff was extremely friendly, the pool was simply amazing, the food was great, and the grounds were beautiful. Our deluxe ocean front room was clean but we did find broken glass on the carpet from the previous occupants. Also, the refridgerator we had requested for the room never appeared. I thought the price of the room was high for what you get but all the hotels we looked at that offer ocean front rooms fall in the same price range. There were some dings in the woodwork in the room and in the hallway, the carpets in the common areas needed to be cleaned and I got tired at looking at all of the fingerprint smudges on the elevator panels. However, we did look at one of the competing hotels while we were in the area, and the Hyatt did have the better rooms. Overall, we had a wonderful ten nights and we would more than likely stay there again. I would be hesitant to stay there during the busiest periods however. I believe our stay would not have been as enjoyable if we had to be out by the pool at 10:00 am to get a chair or had to deal with many kids running around. I would be happy to respond to any emails if anyone has any questions regarding our stay.

My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Westin from July 11-14 and then the night of July 16. We got a great rate on the Westin by bidding on Priceline, therefore I can not comment on the price of the hotel, because we got it for a steal. Our first stay we stayed in the south tower on the 18th floor. It didn't have much of a view, however, we good see a little bit of the Puget sound from our room. The towers (2) are round, so the rooms are a little odd shaped. However, they were very clean with plenty of room to move around in. Our room had a king size bed and was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. There was a flat-screen television and a couch that pulled out into a double bed. The closet was a decent size. Bathroom was nice but nothing to write home about. Our second room was in the north tower and on the 36 floor. The room had 2 double beds (bummer) but we had a beautiful view of Mt. Rainier. So that made up for the double beds. Positives: Clean, comfortable beds and good showers. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with your needs. I enjoyed the fitness room. All cardio equipment had it's own television. Great location! Easy 5 min. walk to Pike Place, 3 min. walk to monorail that takes you to the space needle. Plenty of great restaurants in easy walking distance. Great shopping, too! Negatives: In-room internet access is expensive ($10 per day) however, you can access their free wireless in the lobby. Just ask the concierge for the username and password. The small in house restaurant for breakfast is expensive! We would definitely stay here again. Please contact me if you any questions.

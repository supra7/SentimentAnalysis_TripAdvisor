Stayed here in August 2011. Hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The best thing about the hotel is the location. Very easy to take the Light Link rail from SeaTac airport to the hotel. It is only a leisurely half mile walk to Pike Street Market. It is also real close to a lot of the bus lines that can get you to other parts of the city. If you are considering staying at the Sheraton Seattle I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find any place better.

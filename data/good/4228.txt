We stayed at the Hyatt while in Maui for our honeymoon. The hotel is huge and beautiful. We picked it based on friend's recommendations. We loved the grounds and the pool. The rooms were clean, but nothing fancy. We didn't like the beach (it's rocky and you can't really swim there), the parking situation and the noise. There were a lot of families and kids. Since it was our first time in Maui, it was good to be close to all the action, but next time around we'll definitely look for some place more low key in the Wailea area. We opted to self park for free which was sometimes a struggle. The smaller of the two lots (which was closest to our room) was often full, which meant we had to park in a far away lot and walk. Normally that wouldn't be a big deal, but after being out and about all day and coming back tired, it was kind of annoying. The Hyatt was close to Lahina Harbor were a lot of activities and restaurants are based, so that was nice. Also our package included the daily breakfast buffet. It really wasn't that good. The food was mediocre and the lines to dine at the buffet were long. We'd recommend grabbing breakfast somewhere away from the resort. Also, the buffet turns into a restaurant called Sonz's at night. It's absolutely terrible. Avoid it at all costs!!

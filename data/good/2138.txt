I was a little hesitant to book the Seattle Westin after reading many of past reviews. But their rates were considerably less than what appeared to be comparable downtown full-service hotels. As it turned out, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious, clean, and nicely furnished and decorated. The bed and bathroom lived up to their heavenly claims. We were in the renovated South Tower with terrific views of the Sound (I only wish the windows would open, if just a crack, to alleviate that sealed-in-a-vault feeling). The staff members were all very friendly and helpful, and the public areas were clean and classy. We had an excellent dinner in the restaurant, where the service couldn't have been better. Yes, there were also minor problems. We couldn't check into one of our rooms until after 6 pm, which was unacceptable given that we were not forewarned or offered any compensation for the inconvenience. We finally got the desk to offer to cover our bar tab while we waited the last half-hour, which they nonetheless charged to our bill (and later removed upon complaint). One of the rooms was missing the Honor Bar price list, which included snacks that are left in a basket and appear to be complimentary (wrong!). The valet parking billing seems haphazard, and we were mistakenly charged on each of our two room accounts when we came in one car. All things considered, I would definitely stay there again. Great accommodations, great location, and great price - can't beat that!

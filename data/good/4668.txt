We stayed 5 nights at the KBH after 3 nights on Oahu. We had a fantastic room on Waikiki so our first impression of the KBH was a little bit of a letdown. But, by the end of the week I don't think we could have picked a better place. The beach, which was the reason we came, was great and we had a blast snorkeling at Black Rock. The Tiki Grill and the Tiki Bar were perfect for lunch and late afternoons at the pool. Also, enjoyed the nightly show in the courtyard. Sure, the room wasn't the most modern, but anybody who does any research on the net should know this beforehand. We had a great time here and would go back.

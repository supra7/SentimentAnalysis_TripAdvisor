This is a great hotel. The rooms are roomy and comfortable. The staff is helpful and the daily activities are included in the price. Other hotels charge extra for lei making and things. The restaurant on the grounds is fabulous and we enjoyed the evening free Hawaiian show. The beach is great and black rock offers some of the best snorkeling on Maui. This is a great hotel on Maui, but wish they were more accomodating for families........on a return visit they would not let us keep a small child in the room on a slider bed, as would any other hotel in AMerican.........they wanted to put us in a very pricey room, so we stayed elsewhere on our next visit. Nice for couples though.

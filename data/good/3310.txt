My husband & I stayed at SMB from Oct. 12-18, 2011. This was our second trip to Mexico and we went back and forth for months trying to decide where to stay. It came down to the Royal in PDC, Iberostar Grand and SMB. Ultimately, we chose Secrets based on the great reviews and the location on Maroma Beach. We definitely loved the beach, the food and the entertainment at Secrets, but my husband complained more on this trip any other trip! First, let me start off by saying that this review may be slightly skewed due to bad weather. The rain we endured for 4 of the 6 days of our stay caused us to spend more time in our room than we otherwise would. I guess due to the rain and time of year, the mosquitoes were a major nuisance. Our building location (Building 20) seemed to have it worse than other spots. They prevented us from really enjoying time in our swim out pool, patio, and even in our room. My husband killed lots of them in our room and complained that Secrets should have mosquito nets available upon request for the beds so he could sleep without getting bit. He also whined that they should screen in the patio so we could sit out there without getting eaten alive. ***Secrets really should do something to address this issue. *** CHECK IN: When we arrived at approximately 1:30 pm, we were greeted warmly by everyone, who had had cold towels and champagne ready for us. Our room wasnt ready so we had lunch and came back. It was a bit hectic probably because we didnt pay for the upgrade to preferred club. They gave us coupons for use during our stay and a chance to get more by listening to their spiel about joining their vacation club. Antonio was nice about it and invited us to have a breakfast meeting the next morning to learn more about their Unlimited Vacation Club. We decided to make the most of the timeshare experience and to learn more about Mexico while going through the motions of the sales meeting. All in all, the timeshare thing wasnt that horrible, but after about 2.5 hours of it, we did have to be finally be firm and just say no. They took it well and gave us $150 worth of coupons for the spa which I used for a Tropical Oasis body scrub. Highly recommend! ROOM: Overall, I was happy with our decision to try a swim up suite. It was gorgeous and it looked exactly like the pictures on the website, maybe even better. Canopy bed was nice with a comfy mattress and soft sheets. Nice Jacuzzi tub and tiled shower. ***Secrets does need to upgrade the hot water system. It was usually luke warm!!!*** BEACH: The great Maroma beach!!! The sand was unbelievably soft and the water was the gorgeous color you see in the photos. We were bummed that the rain only allowed us 2 opportunities to play at the beach. We enjoy sailing on a Hobie Cat, but only had time to go kayaking due to the weather. We did see the little white Angel Fish out there that come up to you for food. ENTERTAINMENT STAFF: Awesome !! They really tried hard to get everyone involved and did a great job of remembering your names and saying Hola whenever they saw you! Big shout outs to: Alfredo, Gerry, Hector & Gabrielle. FOOD: We thought the food was very good. We ate at the World buffet 3 nights in a row. What a fabulous selection they had, plus they always had something cooking outside on the grill. We also ate at the Japanese and Italian restaurants. My favorite definitely was the breakfast buffet. So much food! I loved the crepes and omelets station. We finally got to try the food that the chefs bring around by the pool on our last day there. They had Paella on the beach and a taco cart with pork tacos right there. Excellent! I would also have to say that the food at Secrets was top notch compared to the food that we had at Excellence last year. Not that Excellence food was bad, but it was just okay. NIGHTLY SHOWS: We liked most of the shows they did. As people have said before they arent Broadway productions, but theyre entertaining and the performers really try hard. During our stay we saw: Rock of Ages, International, the Fire Show, the Urban/Hip Hop Show and the American Idol Show. Bob Sheets was a funny magician. The entertainment at Secrets was slightly better than at Excellence. TURN DOWN SERVICE: Lame! This consisted of 2 small chocolates, arranging our pillows in a square and a little tiny piece of paper stating tomorrows weather. We didnt get a cute little towel animal or rose petals on our bed as Ive seen in photos for Secrets Capri. They also usually forgot the next days entertainment schedule, mosquito wipes, and more water bottles. Just a bit of an inconvenience when its raining. SPA: The spa was nice. We had 2 different couples massages while there. Very relaxing. The hydrotherapy area was outside though, so we could not enjoy the Jacuzzi or the hot/cold pools due to the rain. I loved the look and ambiance in the spa. It was expensive though, and they were quite fussy about how the coupons could be used. I almost felt like I dealing with a used car salesman when trying to use them. All in all, Secrets Maroma Beach is a wonderful resort. Some of the things that made our vacation not as good as it should have been were due to Mother Nature and not a reflection of the resort itself. But, there are a few things as Ive stated in the review they could improve on. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have, just email me.

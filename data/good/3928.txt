Stayed for a conference in the convention centre. Location: right beside the convention centre so couldn't be better. Nice view of the downtown bay area from the hotel rooms/bar etc. Across the road from 5th avenue, the main part of the gaslamp quarter. Public areas: efficient and helpful check-in and guest services. Nice bar area with outside overlooking water. Breakfast had many options although was a bit "mass produced" and very busy. Didn't use the gym. Rooms: plenty of space and facilities; overall modern and comfortable Overall I'd recommend, especially for a business trip.

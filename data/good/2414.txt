My boyfriend and I were trying to find a hotel for a long weekend stay in Seattle. We actually used Hotwire to book our hotel and our stay at the hotel was great. I was a little worried before our actual stay because of the over the phone customer service. I had called to request a king bed instead of two beds and also to inquire about parking (which is a whopping $42 a day with in and out privileges). I called a second time to inquire about an early check in. Both times I spoke to someone in customer service who talked extremely rapidly. I had to immediately call back once because I had been hung up on before I could ask my second question. This definately didn't make me feel welcomed and I hadn't even walked through the door yet! All that aside I must say that our actual experience there was pretty good. The hotel is in a great location on 4th street in the Financial District about a block down from the Seattle Public Library. It's easily in walking distance to the shopping areas, Pike's Place, and Pier 52 and the ferry terminals. Our check-in experience was quick and easy and everything I had requested in advance was granted. There are a lot of complaints about the hallways being really dark and they are dark but I didn't mind them. The rooms are a little on the squished side but all the furniture is comfortable and the bathrooms are actually quite large. The W Bar is located downstairs and there are cute comfortable seating areas located around the bar but also between the bar and the front desk. The bartenders are friendly and will offer up lots of travel advice and suggestions if you ask. On the weekends there is a DJ but the music isn't too loud. I couldn't hear anything but my room was on the tenth floor. I would stay here again. I just wish the valet parking wasn't so expensive! We ended up parking up the street on 5th for $26/night. If you can do without a car rental I would recommend it - parking in Seattle can be a nightmare!

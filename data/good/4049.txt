We were worried about the reviews and nearly changed hotels but didn't in the end. The penguins are back, construction wasn't a problem and the hotel is beautiful. Our kids loved the birds and the pools were great for them. Umulu had nice food, pizza particularly good. Rooms were plenty big enough. We had a deluxe ocean view in napilli tower and th view was amazing. Parking is tight but we never had a prob getting a spot. Longboards next door has nice food and kimos in lahaina had the best prime rib we have ever eaten. We loved our trip and would be back again if we didn't live so far away in oz. But has been the perfect start to our dream trip. Laihaina is a cute little town.

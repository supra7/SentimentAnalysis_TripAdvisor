We stayed at the Gezi for 6 days over the New Year holidays . From the moment we arrived to the time we departed ,6 days later , it was the hotel staff who made staying at the Gezi a wonderful experience. The staff at the reception, restaurant , housekeeping were friendly and helpful. The Director of Guest Relations was highly customer focused. She was approachable, caring and knowledgeable. She made good suggestions and arrangements on restaurants to have a dining experience and sightseeing sites that gave an appreciation of the atraction of Istanbul. The location of the hotel was excellent . It was within walking distance to many interesting sites including Taksim Square, Dolmabahce Palace and Galata Towers and Gezi Hotel lived up to its name as Gezi Hotel Bosphorus with an amazing view of the Bosphorus. The room had a fantastic view and clean but we found it rather small ,for the price paid and certain aspects of the modern design impractical The restaurant offered a generous breakfast selection and the quality was good. We dined in twice for dinner and found the staff attentive and courteous and the food quality good. All in all a very pleasant stay and if there is one remark to be made it is that 'noises' from internal and external could be better controlled.

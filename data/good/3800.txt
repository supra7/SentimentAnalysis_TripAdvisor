It was all we asked for, clean, romantic, nice room and comfortable in every way. The service was great, the food was very good ( although I don't know why they try to serve Italian and Japanese food in a Mexican resort?) but it was good all the same. I was a bit put off by the pressuring to listen to their sales pitch on time share but it was fairly easy to say no. Snorkelling here was absolutely a beautiful experience. Warm water, colourful fish and sea life in abundance unbelievable colours, world class for sure. There could be more focus on a friendly gathering place with light snacks for when you want to relax and have a late night drink outside looking over the water, but that is a small detail. If anyone ops to do the lobster dinner on the beach, be warned, there are two or three unnecessary appetizers that you will regret eating once you see the six=]ze of the lobster you are supposed to get through! Very nice regardless. For a week visit to and all inclusive this is well worth the price.

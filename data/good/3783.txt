We celebrated our 20th Anniversary at El Dorado Maroma. It was a fantastic place to relax and enjoy the intimate property and the beautiful beach. We have stayed at one other Karisma property (Azul Fives) and found this much more to our liking. First, it's the best beach awesome. The water is beautiful and the location is secluded (there is a marina next door, but there are not a line of resorts one after the other). We walked to the next resort which is about three miles away. The walk is great along the tropical water. The room was wonderful. Big and very clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. There is a little pressure during your "concierge" visit to do an Exotic Resorts Club meeting. I have heard mixed reviews on the value of joining, but it's not for us. Having stayed with Karisma before we knew what to expect...decent (not great) food...good drinks...and no night life at the resort. After a day at the beach and the pool bar that's o.k. with us. We stayed in Playa the night before El Dorado and got our fill of night life. You can cab there easily or take the hotel bus if you want a fun night out. Overall, this is a great resort. It is not too big and flashy. It's much more what we want in Mexico...palm trees, thatched roofs...great beach...intimate setting...tropical drinks..!

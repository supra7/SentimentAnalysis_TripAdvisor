We were looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay in Seattle, that was centrally located, and that wouldn't break our budget. We were not sure what to expect given the poor (but dated) reviews, but decided to try it. We are glad we did; a clean comfortable room, with an excellent staff to help us navigate mass transit. Be sure to request a refrigerator and microwave when you make your reservation.

Great location near the Market and downtown shopping. No workout facility but passes are provided to Seattle Athletic club two blocks away. Concierge and Front Desk staff very friendly. No problems calling a cab...they come right away. Had a city view, but high up, no problem with noise. A little cold during my stay so did not use the deck, but this amenity looks fabulous!

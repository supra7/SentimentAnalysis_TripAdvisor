My husband and I just returned from our second stay at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel (KBH). We can't ask for more from an affordable hotel. KBH has the most friendly staff that provides excellent service. They treat you as part of the family. The hotel is steps away from the beach. Has a large courtyard with a Tiki Grill and Tiki Bar to enjoy your food and drinks by the whale pool. At night they have a music and dance show...for free! There is no need to pay money to go to a Luau. They also offer free activities during the day, such as lei making and learning to play the ukelele. Lastly, they say goodbye with a lei to bring back with you your next visit. We wouldn't stay at any other hotel on Maui.

This hotel is ideal located for exploring rome. The rooms were clean and of a good size, the bathroom was a little compact but had a large shower cubicle. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel offers the little touches that make the difference - like free Wi-Fi and also the use of a laptop computer for your room. Would definitely use this hotel again if visiting Rome.

I was in San Diego for Memorial Day weekend with my freind for a Girls Weekend. We originally chose this hotel based on the pictures and the deal we got. It turned out to be a fantastic time. The hotel was beautiful and the service was great. The concierge was great and showed us the best places to go. It was convienient to the Gaslamp District and shopping!

My family and I stayed here recently and overall we thought it was fine. If you like smaller, boutique hotels this is clearly not the place for you. That said, the grounds are absolutely lovely, and we all enjoyed seeing the penguins, flamingoes, parrots and other wildlife that live at the hotel. The hotel's beach is not the greatest; it's small and very rocky. But you can walk down towards the Sheraton and the beach opens up quite a bit. The people are very friendly, the rooms are nice and the location was pretty central to all the fabulous restaurants and things to do on Maui. One thing that I think something should be done about: the line for the breakfast buffet is crazy long every morning; so I don't think the breakfast facility is adequate for the number of guest rooms at the hotel. The hotel food is quite good though, we especially enjoyed the Japanese restaurant (Japengo) which had very good sushi.

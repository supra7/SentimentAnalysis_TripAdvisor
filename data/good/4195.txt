Fabulous tennis program--for both myself , 10 year old son and my 16 year old daughter. Frank Salvador does a great job! Hyatt needs to buy more chairs for pool/beach area---ridiculous to have to go and "save" a chair by 745 am or not have one for the rest of the day! Do not get a room near the luau side of the hotel--gets tiresome hearing luau every night. Had suite and adjoining room for kids--good arrangement. Nice staff--very helpful--beatiful grounds, great location.

The free upgrade on first night had awesome views, though had a stale smell of cigarettes. Luckily I was moved to my proper booked room on day 2 so much happier with being higher up with clean smell yet less of a view. Service was outstanding throughout. My only criticism was the there was no iron in the whole hotel! Unbelievable that they expect professionals to run up and not need to iron for a same day or day 1 appointment. On asking I was offered express laundry which did come back to me after one day. Seriously at over 200 euros a night how hard is it to have one shared iron??????? Restaurant was good and breakfast included gave lots of options. Will sty there again but would need to think bout the shirt ironing options in advance!

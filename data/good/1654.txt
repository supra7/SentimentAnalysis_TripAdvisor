This was a really nice hotel. After some mixed reviews on TA I was a little worried when I rolled the dice and booked through priceline at $125. This is a really nice hotel on the water within walking distance to downtown. If you are expecting the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, then you need to change your expectations. It's a little rustic, but that is part of it's charm. The rooms are very nice and clean. They are updated with new tv's, bathrooms and windows that open out onto the city or water, depending on where the room is located. The staff is very friendly in the restaurant and front desk. I would definitely stay here again.

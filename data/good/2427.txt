This was definitely a hip hotel. Even on a school night, as the night went on, the bar got more and more crowded. The bartender was very accomodating. The checkin desk is not at street level (on the main street). The hallways are very dim. The room itself was pretty big, and it had a bench all along the window. The cordless phone was helpful for work I had to do. The bathroom was very nice (Bliss amenities). I was a little annoyed that they charged by the minute to use the internet in the business center. Given their high rates, they could include that. It was an excellent location.

I was very pleased with my stay here....room was huge, bed was comfy and in general the stay was pleasant. Aesthetically, the area around the hotel isn't that nice, but the gas station across the street does provide access to beverages and snacks when needed. As another noted the property is on the "other" side of the stadium and convention center, but it is hardly a strenuous walk to restaurants and such that are downtown (there ain't much in this city, so don't get your hopes up about "downtown."). And yes, there is a very strong "fried" smell when you walk into the lobby...it's like you're at the county fair or something. But I didn't notice this outside of the lobby. Staff was nice, rooms were clean...couldn't have been happier for the price!

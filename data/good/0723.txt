The Moore Hotel is cozy, clean, comfy beds, charming, has very reasonable rates, has a great location (two blocks from Pike Place) and appealing staff. It is a historic hotel but it is well-maintained with nice furniture, good carpets and freshly painted rooms. If you're looking for a luxury hotel this isn't it, however. There's no pool, only one small mirror in the bathroom, you have to park in a parkade across the street, there's no kleenex, hair dryers (maybe if you ask at the desk), wifi in the rooms or alarm clocks. Also, the homeless shelter is on the same block. It's a busy area however, so I never felt unsafe walking around with my two kids. If you value cozy charm, value, and location over luxury, make sure you stay at the Moore!

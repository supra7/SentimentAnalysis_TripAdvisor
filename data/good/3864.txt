As always, Hilton does a good job with clean spacious rooms and this was no exception. The rooms are quiet and have lots of amenities one expects with a room that goes for over $200/night. We were there for a convention; however, we are military and thus could not book at the convention rate which included the free internet. So, we paid the government rate (which would be reimbursed); however, they did not want to give us the internet which was included for all other convention goers because our room was less then theirs. Well, the REASON the military gets a lower rate is because it pays the bills with TAX PAYER dollars, it also means that those SERVING in the military don't make as much as their counterparts making it more difficult to afford $15/day internet fees. Had to go all the way to the manager of the hotel to finally get the internet charge removed. Maybe that is ridiculous to everyone else, but it was a stretch for our budget since the military budget has been cut and so have pay raises, and very limited reimbursement. No more cabs allowed only shuttles, no internet reimbursed, meals are on a per diem basis not a check, so even eating breakfast at the hotel was more than the days per diem. This is not a hotel that supports the troops.

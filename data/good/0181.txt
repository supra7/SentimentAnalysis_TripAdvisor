We stayed in room 1705 for 4 days pre-cruise, it was an excellent room and great views with comfortable bed etc etc. but after the cruise we stayed one night in 1711. The bathroom basin in 1711 had a really old crack and the bath was blocked up, so we had to remove the plug to let the water out! The receptionist said she didnt know the basin was cracked but we think they only let that room for single nights as people will just put up with it for one night. Beware!! otherwise we woud definitely stay here again, great location for all the sights.

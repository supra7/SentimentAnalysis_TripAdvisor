The decor was pretty nice. The bed was really comfortable, it was nice & soft and cushy. Everything was very clean. The staff people we very friendly. The only downside was the heating system which we had to have turned on since it was January in Seattle and very cold. The heater basically sounded like there were a bunch of very loud fans on. Other than that it was a nice place to stay and it is close to a lot of fun places to go and restaurants to eat at.

Centrally located downtown this is a great choice when working in Seattle. Easy to figure out local transportation (airport train and city buses) make it inexpensive to get around the area. Hotel entrance was a little screwy as you have to take the elevator to the 12th floor lobby. Room was spacious and good downtown view. Will definately return given the opportunity.

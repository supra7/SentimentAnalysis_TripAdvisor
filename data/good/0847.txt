Just spent 4 nites at this hotel and loved the location! Across the street from Seattle's beautiful public library and within a 10 min walk of Pike Place Market, this hotel is a great bet for the money. Just be sure to request a room that faces the street. We spent a stuffy first nite in an interior room that faced an algae-ridden AC unit on the back of the property. The room was tiny, hot, and had very little natural light. (No working AC.) l Needless-to-say, that was not okay. The next morning, I nicely asked the front desk folks to move us to a room with better circulation so we could stay cool and they put us in a spacious corner room at no extra cost. Just goes to show...it's always worth nicely asking for what you need.

I went to Seattle for a "girl's weekend" of shopping, eating and FUN. This hotel was included in the package with airfare from travelocity. Everything about this hotel was good. Good service, good location, good room. Ok, I take that back, the view from our room (2454) was EXCELLENT. The girlfriend who was sharing the room with me said that it was the nicest hotel she had stayed in when her parents weren't paying! She's a little cheap, though :) The hotel and rooms were quiet, clean and safe. They were big enough to fit me and my roomie and all of our shopping bags (and there were plenty) comfortably. The maid service was polite and never bothered us - even when we were sleeping in a little late. There were TONS of families with small children staying int his place and I couldn't quite figure out why (I didn't see anything particularly kid friendly) - unless they got a good deal like we did through a website. I love to walk so the location was excellent for me. If you don't like to or unable to walk a distance you may want to find a property a little closer to shopping and the Pike's market. There is NOT 24 hour room service so if you find you need to eat at 4am, I would recomend Milano's Pizza. They deliver. I can't comment on the hotel food. Never ate it. HINT: This is one of the 1st stops for the Bus shuttle service so it is a BARAGIN to pay $17 to take that service from the airport rather than a cab. Hope this helps. Sorry, no photos of this property.

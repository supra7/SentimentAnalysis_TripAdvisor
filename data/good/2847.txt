my wife and I stayed here 2 nights over President's weekend. The property was very nice except from the noise that lots of young kids generated due to the atrium style where every sound gets ecoed thoughout the hotel. We didn't even try to use the pool or spa since it was filled with kids. The room had a large living room and dinning table along with 32 inch flat screen TV, mico, fridge and wet bar. Once you are in the bedroom you can shut out the sound and can keep it dark if you want. Unfortunately, the bed is very soft and so not too comfortable. The manager's reception is just chips and pop corn along with drinks- including alcoholic mixed drinks. The breakfast was good - especially the made to order omlets. I found all levels of staff to be friendly and responsive. It is very close to South Center Mall and dozens of other stores and places to eat. We only heard the train once and parking was okay- although I agree they should not charge $10 a night since it is just an open lot.

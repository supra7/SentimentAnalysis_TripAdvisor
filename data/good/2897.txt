Stayed here just one night after checking out a few other hotel/motels on the International Blvd strip near the SeaTac airport Staff was pleasant, friendly and offered rides to the airport though we did not require one. Very clean, comfortable room with FREE WiFi internet. Also, free parking! There was a pool and workout room (did not use them) but those are nice amenities. Nice hotel, elevator was kind of in an odd place at the end of a long hallway but can't really complain. QUIET hotel, never heard a peep from another guest or the nearby airport. Couldn't tell we were near an airport! Beds were super comfy and loved the fluffy pillows. Front desk/lobby personnel were friendly and professional and stood up and thanked us for our stay when we departed and made sure everything was okay. I'd stay here again!

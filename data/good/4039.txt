Stayed here 2 years ago. Place was really nice and laid back, but had to walk to the beach, Hyatt doesn't have it's own beach. Kaanapali beach is nearby and also nearby shopping area, hotel can shuttle you there. Trips are available for a fee. Their restaurant serves really good, fresh food. Pool is good for kids. There's also a luau, the show was very nice done at sunset.

My husband and I took a much needed vacation without our children..our first real vacation in 4 years. We wanted an all inclusive and just to relax.... our travel agent recommended El Dorado Merona and did advise that there was limited nightlife. The result was beautiful, our room was gorgeous (we got a 2nd floor with a private infinity pool) and the beach and pool was perfect. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly , the drinks did not stop coming and you never had to worry about not getting a chair at the pool or beach. The food was ok... it seams as if they were trying to be very gourmet and some of it was just a little strange but it was fine for the week. The only thing was that there was absolutely no night life...we went to dinner around 7 or 7:30 each night and as you walked to dinner, you could hear your footsteps. Sometimes there would be only 1 other couple in the restaurant... there was one bar open at night plus the pool bars...one night the bar had a good number of couples and we had fun...two other nights we walked in at 8:30 and there was no one else there..... we wondered where everyone disappeared to each evening! Overall, we really did enjoy ourselves and were totally relaxed for the whole week. I do not think we could have stayed longer than a week or would have gotten bored and don't think we will be going back, but only because we would like something a little more lively at night. also, don't count on room service -- we ordered it twice and both times it took over two hours to get to our room.

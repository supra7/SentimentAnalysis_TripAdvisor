We just came back from the Hyatt and the grounds are as beautiful as they claim. The pool was excellent. The bathroom was a little small and the beach left a little to be desired. However, we walked a little way down to a better beach. We never had a problem getting a chair by the pool, might not be up front if we we came later in the day, but could still get a chair. The staff was extremely pleasant and friendly. The few times we made requests, they were handled quickly and efficiently. We had a partial ocean view and had a good view of the ocean and the pool. The Swan court was beautiful for breakfast. All in all the stay was excellent. Would definitely recommend the Hyatt.

This hotel seamlessly blends an historical old building with a modern and tastefully decorated hotel. It channels the spirit of Venice but with a clean, modern twist. It's hard to find but that could be said of most places in Venice! I think it would help if the hotel gave out more in the way of official directions as it's really not that complicated once you've got your bearings. We read reviews on TripAdvisor suggesting the easiest way to reach this hotel is to take the Riverbus 1 to Riva di Biasio from the main train station and turn right. On balance, this is probably true, but it's slightly frustrating to have to work out the water bus ticketing system and the correct pier for a bus going in the right direction to then go one stop (2 mins on board in total). When we were leaving Venice, we walked to the station and it took 10 minutes and cost nothing (although you do need to cross the Grand Canal and that means a bridge, and steps). This technicality aside, we found the hotel welcoming and efficient. Breakfast was an excellent buffet selection. We stayed two nights and on the first day, there was a power cut. Staff did not acknowledge this but could obviously not offer any hot drinks or toast at breakfast as a result. We were left confused by this until the second day when the power was clearly back on and hot drinks/food available again. A sign explaining the issue (and perhaps apologising for the inconvenience) wouldn't have gone amiss. This hotel isn't in central Venice, this is a short trip down the Grand Canal (or you can easily walk back through the maze of canals and passages), but this is a benefit rather than a disadvantage. It means you don't have to do battle with the crowds to get to your hotel and you get a flavour of the "real" Venice - there are local bars and shops. Venice is notoriously busy in summer but this hotel offered a welcome retreat and we would definitely recommend it.

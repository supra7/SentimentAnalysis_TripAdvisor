This hotel offered a Pike Place FIsh Market package that allowed us to go "behind" the scenes at the fish market. My son was able to toss and catch a fish and all of the guys working there were so fun. This was a highlight of our trip. The Inn and the Market is only hotel to offer this special feature and it was definitely worth it. The location is perfect too - near the market shops and restaurants - and near lots of the downtown's fabulous restaurants & other shops - and walking distance to harbor. A great stay!

The place is nice, the rooms are clean and well kept and breakfast is decent - actually pretty decent. Staff are very kind and the lobby is quite nice. There are two things We didn't like: the room we stayed in was particularly small, and the noise in the street (Houston Av) was too loud at night - we had a pretty bad night on our first night. Maybe it would be best to stay in a room looking towards the back.

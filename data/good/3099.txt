We stayed here due to a layover. Got a great deal on Hotwire dot com. So I cant talk to the value of the hotel, as I don't know how much a room goes for. Bed was extremely comfortable, it had a control that allowed us to adjust the softness of the bed.......and it could be different for each side. TV was almost unwatchable due to some purple lines that didn't go away. And Bathroom sink cold water didn't work. Two small things that didn't affect us on our short stay, but we told the front desk upon check out and they said they would look at it ASAP.

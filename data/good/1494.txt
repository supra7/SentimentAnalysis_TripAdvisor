We would defenitely stay there again. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Our room looked like the advertisment. They do need to get hypoallergenic pillows, they have feather pillows which I'm allergic to. The bus stop is a couple blocks away and its also part of the free bus zone meaning: you can ride it for free. For Seattle you won't find a better hotel for the price. For breakfast we went into the Bar and Grill. The staff were very friendly and prompt with service. We had a muffin and cereal so I can't comment on the rest of the menu however, it was busy while we were there, which is usually a good indication that the food is good. The decor was also nice.

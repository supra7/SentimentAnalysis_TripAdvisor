We were extremely pleased with our room selection at the Hotel Andra. It had many design elements that work very well: couch positioned in front of a double window makes for a comfy spot with natural light, walk-in closet almost as big as some hotel rooms, ample drawers and shelves for storage, night-light in the bathroom to guide your path & bags of ice on each floor located in front of the elevator. These are not revolutionary but all make for a stay with advanced comfort (contrast with those beautiful minimalist rooms with absolutely no where to place a toothbrush). The hotel is ideally located for the popular tourist destination of Pike Place Market, downtown shopping & most importantly restaurants and lounges. If you want the fine dining of Dahlia Lounge (across the street), the Mediterranean flavours of Lola (in the hotel) or the dive bar charm of Shorty's Coney Island (2 blocks away) this is the location for you. Finally, we were extremely well treated by the staff. The front desk was warm and accommodating, Alexa at Lola's provided us with her dining and cocktail tips and Mary at the concierge's desk looked after all our bookings with finesse.

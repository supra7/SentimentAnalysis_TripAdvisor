We stayed at the Hampton Inn Seattle Airport on January 21, between returning from British Columbia and a flight out of Seatac the next morning. We had stayed at the hotel before and had a good experience. The hotel has ample free parking and the hotel lot feels safe although it is not gated. We parked very close to the front entrance of the hotel which may have contributed to our feeling of safety! Check in was a breeze. The clerk also offered a list of local dining locations and said that the on demand shuttle was available to take us anywhere on the list. Our room was spacious and clean, and so was the bathroom. the king sized bed was incredibly comfortable with very soft linens and good pillows. We noticed some TV noise from an adjacent room but it didn't disturb us. The hotel offers an outdoor pool, fitness center and continental breakfast. We didn't make use of any of these, but noticed that the breakfast included some hot items (sausage, eggs and biscuits on the day we were there) as well as the usual doughnuts, cereal, yogurt and toast. They also pack items into "breakfast to go" bags that you can grab on your way out. No idea what's in there, but seemed like a great idea for travellers! The on demand shuttle was great. We returned our rental car the night before our flight and the driver came and picked us up at the off-airport rental location within a few minutes of our call. We used the shuttle to get to the airport in the morning and it was prompt and efficient as well. You can't reserve the shuttle, you just go to the lobby about 10 or 15 minutes before you need a ride and it works pretty well. We had to wait 5-10 minutes for the van to return from a trip but since we had allowed for that we were not late. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers!

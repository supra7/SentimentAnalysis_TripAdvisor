Small but beautifully appointed rooms, full of style and quirkiness. The art is excellent, and the service is exceptional. The elevators are tiny and get backed up during busy check-in and check-out times. There was a good selection of Aveda bath amenities, and plenty of outrageously priced "honor bar" items including intimacy kits, but we didn't partake of any. Our Valentine's Day package included unlimited in-and-out valet parking and breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, The Red Fin. Breakfast was creative and unusually tasty (banana-buttermilk pancakes with coconut and macadamia nuts, and a shiitake asparagus frittata with warm goat cheese, both served with fresh fruit), but the restaurant was understaffed for the Sunday morning after Valentine's Day. The servers were gracious and helpful to the best of their abilities, but struggled to keep up with the crowd. My fiance and I are Seattle locals who wanted a special weekend getaway, and the Hotel Max is ideally located in the north end of downtown. Highly recommended.

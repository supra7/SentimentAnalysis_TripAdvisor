The Hyatt is an impressive mega-resort. The entrance is sure to impress with its free-flowing open grand atrium. The pool and surrounding gardens are beautiful and well manicured. . The place blends in with its exotic Hawaiian location. The biggest complaint is the beach, which is very narrow with rough sand and scattered rocks. Because of this very few people are found on the beach which exacerbates the crowding in the pool area. For a big resort, i found the service very good(but not at the level of a Ritz Carlton). The staff is very friendly and courteous. I can not think of any major drawbacks to the service. The food was also very good. The buffet breakfast was excellent. We had a daily buffet breakfast which was included in our nightly rate. Althought the buffet was very good it did become boring over the week. There is very little change in breakfast selections from one day to the next. We also ate at their sushi bar and restaurant which had a great view of the pool and ocean. This restaurant had great food and excellent service. There are two other restaurants which i did not go to. We went to this hotel for our honeymoon. Although we were not dissappointed, this is more of a family oriented megaresort which offers a lot to do. i don't know if it is a great choice for honeymooners because the number of families present and the lack of intimacy. The other major limitation is the narrow beach which tends to make the pool area very crowded.

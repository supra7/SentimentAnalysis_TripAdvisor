My family of four stayed at this lovely location for a week in July. It is one of a number of lovely resorts, all in a long row in Lahaina. The grounds are fabulous, as is the beach. The same can be said of any one of the resorts at this location, so I would definitely find the best deal. It is within walking distance to the Whaler's Village--but it's sort of a long walk--3/4 of a mile?--and there aren't many eateries there. I got a very decent rate online for the room; however, once we got there, we quickly realized that feeding a family of four at the hotel would be ridiculously expensive. The breakfast buffet, for example, was $30 a person, which would have been $120 for all of us. For breakfast. And--there were no low-cost options. We ended up eating in town for every single meal, which was a bit of a hassle, as we would have to wait for our car, tip the valet guy, etc. Then there is about a 20 minute drive to the town. The prices for drinks at the bar were also ridiculous. No big deal--the town was quite charming--but I wanted to mention the price in case a family (like ours) thinks that because they find a good deal on the rooms that this will be an affordable place to stay. It's not--unless you stock up your mini-fridge, which is completely do-able. There were also all sorts of fees added to our bill (ie parking, resort fees, etc.) so count on adding about $60 per night to whatever rate you think you are getting. As others have mentioned, the hotel has this huge contraption with candy bars and snacks in the bathroom that takes up most of your counter space. It is weight controlled, so if you or your kids so much as touch it, you will be charged. This was laughable. It sort of looks like a spring-loaded trap. But hey--it's still paradise! The grounds, the birds, the art in the lobby was all fantastic. Overall, the hotel was a good option for us--just wish there had been better dining options.

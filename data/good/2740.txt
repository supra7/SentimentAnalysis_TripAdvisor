We really won the gamble with this hotel. We booked through a discount website and were completely satisfied with our stay. (For the discounted price) The room was very large, faced the airport, but was still quiet. It even had a balcony! The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. On check in, the warm chocolate chip cookies were a lovely touch. All the staff we interacted with were great. I noticed many airline crews stayed at this hotel also. Our room was in the main tower, and was reached by an external elevator with glass walls. Getting to the room was a fun adventure in itself. We explored the other areas of this large hotel complex and noticed some rooms were actually are on a small lake, and others overlook the attractive outdoor pool. There is an abundance of gardens in between the different buildings and all were very well maintained and tended. I can not say I slept well, but I think that was due to nerves and excitement about our pending vacation. I did find the beds comfortable, but very jiggly. Whenever my husband moved, I felt like we were on a boat in rough water. I was also woken by the cries of a baby in a nearby room. The most disturbing noises came not from the jet planes across the street, but from the hallway. They did a great job soundproofing the external walls, but the hall walls seemed a bit thin. There is a Jack in the Box and Denny's across the street as well as a Subway, Thai restaurant and a BBQ restaurant nearby. The shuttle service to the airport ran frequently and was very convenient. If traveling with children, there is oodles of space to set up a portable crib. The hotel felt nice enough for a romantic getaway and was a nice treat as a stop-over. The room also had Wi-Fi access - we even had Wi-Fi on the pool deck! Overall, a great stay.

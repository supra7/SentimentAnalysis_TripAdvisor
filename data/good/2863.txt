While visiting Seattle to see a Mariners game we needed a comfortable and clean place to stay. Embassy Suites was it! We enjoyed Shirley Temples and chips at the social hour, swam in the pool, and the following morning had a full complimentary breakfast. We especially appreciated the refrigerator and microwave in our suite, as well as the coffee/tea making equipment.

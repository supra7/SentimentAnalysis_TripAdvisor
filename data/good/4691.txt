This is a place for travelers. If you know what to expect at the KBH, you should be extremely happy with your choice (I just booked my thrid trip). There are no shortcuts and no bargains in a place like Maui, there's no way to get a $500 experience on the cheap. But if you are going to Maui to spend the day exploring the island and relaxing on the beach and simply want a decent place to rest your head, at a decent price, with nice staff, then this is it. The KBH is a value price with great staff on one of the best beaches in the world. But a value hotel has trade-offs... the hotel and the grounds are a bit worn and old, it does not come with the amenities that the $500 a nights hotels have like spas, room service, waterfall pools, hot tubs, and four star restaurants. But locals come here for the weekend for a reason- the price is right, the beach is 2nd to none, the rooms are decent (they're average, not spectacular but not terrible either), and they're not spending time hanging out in their room. If you are planning that luxury vacation of a lifetime and want bells, whistles, and pampering, then book another hotel. But if you want to spend your time and money on other things on Maui, then the KBH is a great place to rest your weary and sunburned head.

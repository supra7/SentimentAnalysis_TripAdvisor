The hotel was a bit dated, but not necessarily in a bad way. It had a certain retro charm to it, especielly in the looby. The room was a bit small as others have noted, but not overly so. The bathroom floor creaked when we walked on it as a floor might in an older home. The shower was roomy and the rest of the orom was comfortable. At first I was concerned about the amount of traffic noise from Roosevelt, but it wasn't a problem at night or in the early morning. The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was fairly basic. The one nice surprise was the pineapple cupcakes every night from 3 - 7. The location on Roosevelt was a little tricky depending on where you need to go. Since it is one way, getting back up to the U-District can be a pain, especially in heavy traffic. To get to I-5, cut across Roosevelt to 42nd then turn right on 7th and take it up to 45th. Thankfully its easy enough to get *to* the hotel from anywhere in the U-District or I-5, though its easy to miss the entrance to the parking area. Definitely check out the breakfast at the Portage Bay Cafe (right next door) while staying here. We had a pleasant stay and would stay here again.

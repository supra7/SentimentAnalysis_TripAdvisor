We got a great deal on our room and were really pleased with our stay! We spent the weekend exploring Seattle, and the location was perfect. we also really enjoyed the complimentary wine hour from 5-6 on weekdays. And, there's free tea and coffee in the mornings. Staff was friendly and courteous - even printed our boarding passes for us on super short notice. We could walk everywhere we needed to go - even to Qwest Field for a football game. And, the "guppy love" was a great touch, as were the super cool in-room robes. The hotel seemed to be very pet friendly. Only downside was the very expensive valet parking - $40 per night! if you can get there without a car, do it!

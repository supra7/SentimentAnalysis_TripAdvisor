Don't expect a resort built in 1980 to compare to the newness of a younger property. The Hyatt Regency Maui is a beautiful property that is well cared for. Everything was clean and in good repair. It is quite a large resort with a lot to offer. The pools are great for adults and kids alike. The fitness club has new equipment including free weights. The are plenty of shops, including Macy's. Koi ponds, penguins (yes, there are warm weather penguins), swans, flamingos are seen throughout the resort. The only negative comment I can make is related to the free self-parking being full if you return after 9PM or so.

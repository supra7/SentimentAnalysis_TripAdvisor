Family of 4 stayed here during busy Lions Club Convention week. We were getting a 14 days cruise to Alaska and were a little shocked by the price of hotels in Seattle. Lucky enough, we were able to get a room at the Roosevelt through onepass miles. We were very pleased with hotel. The location is excellent as well as the customer service. The rooms were a little on the small side, especially the bathrooms, but well furnished and clean. We would stay here again if we had to come back to Seattle.

Have just returned from a city break to Berlin. Hotel excellent ,staff helpful and friendly food very good, Rooms clean and comfortable.Would have liked tea and coffee in our room. We were given a kettle on request but no cups or tea and coffee to put in them. My only complaint is that the hotel is supposed to be in Mitte(centre of Berlin) but it is no where near the centre.It is a good 10 minute walk to the underground and a further 15 minutes into the centre of the city!

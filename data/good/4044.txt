This review is for the breakfast buffet. Having been to many at resorts, I have to say this had the poorest selection. This bares no reflection on it being a beautiful hotel, it just wasn't worth the price of the buffet. They did not have any of mynfavorites. I love eggs benedict and they discontinued offering it but did not update their website menu. Also, no waffles or whip cream. No lox that I love to put on my bagel. The Kea Lani resort buffet in Wailea is wonderful which was basically the same price.

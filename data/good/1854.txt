Stayed at the Great Westin for work, the hotel is nice, lobby is a little dated as its all browns etc compared to some of the newer lighter hotels but not to the point where you'd have any concerns. Room was a nice size and clean, bed was super comfy and one of the nicer ones I've slept in. Staff are very friendly and helpful. A half of beer however was near 5 dollars which I thought was very over priced. Location is excellent for Seattle. All in all I'd have no issues coming back.

This is our third time to KBH in the last 35 years -- and the reviews (I read them all) are correct. I would confirm the Pros: the best stretch of beach on Kaanapali; it is just below Black Rock for snorkeling with turtles etc (make sure you have the right KBH hotel because other hotels can fool you and use a similar name) make sure it is right beside BLACK ROCK and WHALERS VILLAGE; you also have Whalers V illage with excellent dining and shops; excellent other dining establishments along the Kaanapali Parkway as well; KBH has great Hawaiian spirit that includes artisans and live Hawaiian music on site; staff certainly have the Hawaiian aloha spirit and virtually all of them greet you everywhere on the resort; I also need to mention the great spirit among the staff at the Tiki Bar and the Tiki Grill just beside the pool -- it is not pretentious and is laid back. The pool was large enough; plenty of beach chairs; towels; I was happy to find significant upgrades to rooms; breakfeast was fine and had variety (it was included in our package); LAHAINA is only 5-10 minutes away with its many shops and dining area (and all the tours you can book - even a ferry boat for a day trip to Lanai !). KBH is only 10 minuites from Kapalua Beach (a must see and great snorkeling), and Honoloa Bay also for snorkeling (but rocky). We recommend the trip up Haleakala but best to call ahead to ensure it is not too cloudy - for good views of the volcano valley). Also I recommend the visit to the Blow Hole just past Kapalua on the West/North area coast. It is not well advertised but ask - wear hiking shores and make your way doen the trail to the ocean - now at the Blow Hole there is also a heart carved right in the rock - great for pictures - ask for directions CONS: no jacuzz- -I'm not sure why KBH after so many years don't at least put in one large jacuzzi. In conclusion when you have the sun and views of lanai and molokai islands in front of you at KBH (in the day or at sunset) , with Hawaiiian music coming from the Tiki Bar area ---- you will have everything (Enjoy !).

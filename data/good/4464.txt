I chose this resort based on the reviews, location, price, and that it is dubbed as the 'most hawaiian resort.' The service and employees are really great. They offer free cultural courses - it was so great to take a hula lesson! They also provide nightly entertainment - song and dance. These were great touches. Location is also fabulous and the price was right when compared to the Sheraton next door. However I will say I was not impressed with the hallway decor - it's very drab and takes away from the Hawaiian resort feel. Our room was fine - stuff was not as 'new' and 'crisp' looking as I would have liked. The room was clean though, which is one of the most important things. It was just disappointing to see it show its age. I also stayed on three other islands during this trip at some really great hotels - with that new/crisp look, so naturally I compare the KBH to these. Good value and location. Clean, but hallway and rooms could use a facelift. Just stuff to be aware of .

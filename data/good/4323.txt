My wife and went for our 10th anniversary. We had a great experience. The Hyatt is by far the nicest resort along Kaanapali Beach. The Weston looked nice, the Marriot looks perfect for a family vacation, the Sheraton has a great location near Black Rock for the snorkeling. But hands down best overall has to be the Hyatt. The service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and laid back. We had drinks at sunset from the lounge outside Cascades on the property, sat at the pool and enjoyed the sun and watching whales breach all day. The rooms were clean and large enough for two, my wife had a spa treatment and loved it, the gym was excellent and clean. There is really nothing to complain about. There are plenty of kids but adults still outnumber them 10 to 1 so you don't feel like your in Disney Land. Besides they have kids section at the pool that has a 150' slide, splash area and waterfall they can swim under. Most kids stayed over there all day. I want to go back asap!

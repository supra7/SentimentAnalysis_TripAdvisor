We stayed at The Max for 3 nights. The locations is great, close to everything. . .shopping, Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square. The bathrooms are very small and not enough storage or counter space to put your things, if you were planning to stay for a longer period. Also the cupboard was extremely small and would not hold a hanger properly. We had a small problem with Housekeeping. We had a couple of unopened bottles of water in the fridge also they provide a couple of wine glasses. The next day when we came back to our hotel room after shopping, they took our water along with the wine glasses. There was also no wash cloths. We went to the front desk to let them know of this problem. It took 24 hours before they replaced the items. They compensated us for this inconvenience by taking $50 off our bill. Would I go back and stay at the Max; definately!

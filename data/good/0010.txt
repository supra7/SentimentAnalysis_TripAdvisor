The Hilton Garden Inn White Marsh offers a good base for your Baltimore trip. It's about a half hour drive from the airport, a half hour drive from downtown Baltimore. A friend and I stayed there for a wedding. Upon arriving the first night, we thought we had gotten in too late to get a bite from the hotel restaurant. Although they were just about to close up, they took our order and kept the kitchen open a little later to accommodate us. My friend forgot her toothbrush, and the front desk supplied her with a new one free of charge. And the next morning, when I asked if there was a dry cleaner nearby (we needed to get our bridesmaids' dresses pressed), they told us to drop them off at the front desk for the hotel's dry cleaning service; they were pressed and hanging in our room closet just a few hours later (and for a very affordable fee). There's also free parking, which was a boon for us. And the rooms were squeaky clean and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the Baltimore area.

I stayed here one night recently as I had a meeting nearby and was so pleased. I was able to get only a traditional room with a shower but it was more than adequate for my purposes. The shower was roomy and the bathroom was so perfectly clean. Actually, the entire room did my obsessive little heart good because everything was clean and crisp. The bed was comfy, the sheets were crisp, and the pillows just right. The room I had was not air conditioned but the windows opened and it was lovely to sleep with the fresh air. There was some traffic noise as I fell asleep but it certainly did not disturb me. The snack in the afternoon is a nice surprise and the breakfast was quite fine - even the coffee was drinkable, often not the case with hotel breakfasts.. I was really pleased to find a reasonably priced hotel that was so appealing and well kept. I will return and would consider staying here even if I need to be downtown.

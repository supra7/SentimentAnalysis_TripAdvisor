We stayed at KBH for a week beginning 6/25/05 in an ocean view room. The room was as expected from my research on this website - older decor, just the basics. But we weren't in Maui to hang out in the hotel room so KBH worked well for us. The biggest positive of KBH is its location - next to Whaler Village shops, Black Rock for snorkeling, and next to other large Kaanapali resorts such as Marriott and Hyatt which also has restaurants and their own luau's available to the public. Other positive features of this hotel is the Hawaaiin activities for the guest only, the large beach area relative to the other hotels, the large lawn area between the pool and the beach with plenty of chairs and shade, and the strongest Mai Tai's in Maui. The biggest negative I see is the older room and limitied room amenities and the small whale shaped pool. Overall, I would stay there again primarily due to its location and reasonable price vs the large resorts next door. Maui is too awesome to hang out in the hotel - get out and tear up the town.

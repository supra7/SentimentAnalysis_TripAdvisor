I stayed doe 4 days at Hotel Andra in Seattle. It is a clean, unpretentious hotel where the food is great and the staff wonderful! The hotel is clean, bright , cheerful and chic, Food at the restaurant -Lola- is magnificent. Points of interest are within walking distance. I certainly will stay at this hotel again!

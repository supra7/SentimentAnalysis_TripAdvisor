After an exhaustive online search, I booked the Moore Hotel from May 22-24, 2005, for my sister and I to take a short shopping/sightseeing trip to Seattle. After a beautiful 3-hour drive from Vancouver, Canada, we arrived (late check-in; no problem) to be greeted by the "cool" front-desk clerk, who was more than accomodating. Our room, on the 6th floor with a lovely view of the Sound, was large and comfortable, with an impeccably clean bathroom complete with creatively-folded towels, just like in the Caribbean! For $69 a night, I couldn't imagine a better value in a major city, especially given the location, within walking distance of Pike Place Market, amazing shopping and great Belltown restaurants. Don't forget to ask the front-desk staff about parking. We were directed to a parkade across the street for $15/24 hours. Every city should have a Moore Hotel!

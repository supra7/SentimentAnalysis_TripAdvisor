Peaceful setting, beautiful room with huge walk-in shower, and an easy walk to the main hub of West Maui (about 5 minutes to a multitude of restaurants and shops). We also loved the beach and the cabana, but there are no umbrellas for rent or for loan (pretty amazing for a beach resort). The cabana was nice and had a refrigerator for drinks and such, but it would have been nice to have a nearby beach-side bar. As it is, you have to walk over to the Whaler's Village side to access cool beach amenities. The snorkeling at Black rock, which begins at the El Dorado beach and wraps around to the other, more populated side was pretty nice (we saw a few turtles)--great to have such good snorkeling right at our beach. Upon arriving, the receptionist was going to give us a room right near the road (furthest from the beach), but I politely asked if there was anything closer to the beach, and she accommodated us. We had a garden view, which we enjoyed every morning while sitting with our coffee on the balcony (and despite the verbal and written reminders about it being a no-smoking facility, we had to endure the occasional smell of smoke wafting from a nearby balcony). Overall, if I were the kind of traveler to return to place I've visited once, then I would definitely stay there again!

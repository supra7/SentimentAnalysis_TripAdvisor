I frequently travel to Seattle for business and opt to stay at this hotel primarily due to the convenience in location. Centrally located, prime attractions are accessible a couple of blocks away, and multiple nearby restaurants to choose from. It is an older hotel, but very charming. Speaking of charm, so are the people who work there. There is never a day where I'm not greeted with a smile, which is nice to see after a day of meetings etc. The minor complaint, AND it is very minor is the slowness of the elevator, so fair warning. BUT, other then that -a hotel that is highly recommended if you find yourself visiting this beautiful city!

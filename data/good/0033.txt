I like staying at Kimpton Hotels, for their coffee/wine service, robes, and free wifi. The location of the Monaco in downtown Seattle is great. I walked to Pike Place Public Market in 10 minutes with the sublime Sweet Iron waffle shop one block away. Also nearby is the swanky Purple Caf and Wine Bar. The light rail is a short few blocks as well. First impressions were a mixed bag. We arrived around 2:00 p.m. and our room was not ready, so the women checking us in told us the bell boy would take our bags, but that didn't happen promptly. We must have stood around for 20 minutes and had to find the bell boy ourselves. Once our room was ready we got keys and access to the express elevator, which only services floors 10-11. The keys did not work on the first try so I had to get another set. Room 1017 was smaller than we expected and the bed a lot firmer, but still comfortable with nice views of downtown. There was an off musty smell in the room, as in the robes, which have seen better days. The bathroom amenities could be nicer. The wine hour was packed with nowhere to sit. Overall, an acceptable stay, but will look elsewhere for my next visit to Seattle.

I must say this is a nice hotel. WE stay here 11/30/2011 just passing through. IT was every $$$$$. But you get what you pay for. Our flight got cancel and we needed something close. The room was small but very cozy. I ask for a crib and it was already there and waiting for our baby. I wish it was a little cheaper but I felt safe and welcomed... GREAT STAFF, CLEAN ROOMS.

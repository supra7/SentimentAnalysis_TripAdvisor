I spent two nights at the Sorrento while in Seattle on business. I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. While not one of Seattle's mainstay luxury hotels, the Sorrento was full of old world charm and a place I would stay again. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the valet and the front desk staff. I was thrilled to learn that my room had been upgraded to a suite on the 6th floor. The room was plenty big with nice ammenities. Staff was super friendly throughout my stay even when I had to leave for the airport at 4:00 AM. I would definitely reccommend staying at the Sorrento.

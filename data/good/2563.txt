We've stayed here many times including when it was still the Vance Hotel. First the good: The place is cool and hip. The clientel are cool and hip. The beds are comfortable, hotel is clean and location can't be beat. Yes the rooms are tiny and bathroom's unfit for anyone over 5'10" but we fitted fine. Our room on this trip was probably the largest in the hotel with actual space around the beds to walk. There's flat-screen tv's, funky lobby with cool books, nice artwork and fairly quiet. Now the not-so-good: I agree the Wi-Fi should be free; although they do offer free computers to use in the business room, I'd like to use my laptop in my room. As usual, I had forgotten a toothbrush; they have one for sale in the room for $15! I think it would be good PR to give toothbrushes away for free. Luckily I remembered my razor....The shaving kit was $20! And finally, not the hotel's fault but their parking is US$30/night. I researched parking in downtown and found similar rates. However, across the street is an open air lot. The ticket machine sells 24 hours for $24 but it's available only in the morning; after 9:30am it think it increases to $17 for ten hours. We'll be back.

This was one of the least expensive, yet still decent hotels I've stayed in in NY. I travel there several times a year and I am usually looking for a good deal, but the hotel has to be decent. I put this on par with the Four Points Sheraton in Soho, but the price there can get pretty high (though not worth it). Pros: Location - very central to east village area Clean accomodation FREE continental breakfast (not worth it if you want a real breakfast...but toast, bagel, fruit or yogurt juice and coffee at no additional cost in NY is unusual Friendly and helpful front desk Free WiFI Cons: Can be noisy..It's right on Houston a main thoroughfare and there was construction down the street which added to the noise Wierd shower. Looks great - clearly new. But in order to turn it on, you have to get wet. Ugh. Someone didn't think that one through all the way. Once it is on (and warm) the shower is quite nice.

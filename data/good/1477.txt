this is not ultramodern but it is lovely. It is our favorite place in seattle so far. Cookies at checkin, awesome staff, great restaurant. the rooms are clean and comfy and they have wall mounted soap and shampoo dispensers.No waste.the rooms are very nice, good gym and computer access. we loved our stay.

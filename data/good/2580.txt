A girl friend and I stayed at Hotel Max April 16 - 18. Our flight arrived at 9 am and we went directly to the hotel. We knew it was far too early to check in, but asked if the hotel would hold our bags for us so that we go could walking around. The concierge on duty was a lovely young woman who gave us excellent walking directions to Pike's Market and a few other points of interest downtown (she also pointed out the vast availability of Starbuck's in the area). Everyone at the front desk throughout our stay was extremely helpful and friendly, and more than willing to share their favorite parts of Seattle and the surrounding area. We had the late night menu at Red Fin...nothing spectacular there but good beer on tap. My only two complaints: the hotel authorizes your credit card for $75 per day, in addition to the regular room charges and taxes. Though I understand that it is the hotel's policy, it really should be posted online when making a reservation or referred to by the fron desk upon check-in. We were unaware of it until after we had checked in, and the additional hold on my credit card was very inconvenient. Secondly, we returned from sightseeing late on Friday afternoon and received a knock on the door from a housekeeper. She had plugged her cell phone into my charger earlier in the day and needed to retrieve her phone. I wasn't upset, but definitely found it odd. Overall, the hotel's location, room rate and staff made our stay very comfortable, and I will certainly stay at Hotel Max on future trips to Seattle.

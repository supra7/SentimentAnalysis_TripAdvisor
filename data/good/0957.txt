Stayed for 2 nights in the Renaissance Seattle in March. Requested for a quiet room and we did not get any disturbance from the traffic noises. We did get disturbed by our neighbours next door blasting loud music during 1 night and i called up the front desk immediately. Very pleased that the music was stopped shortly afterwards. The staff during our check-in and check-out was nice and friendly. This hotel is walkable to Downtown and Pike Place market but beware of steep hills! Rooms were huge and beds were comfortable to sleep in. Overall i would recommend this hotel in Seattle and i will choose to stay here again when i return to Seattle!

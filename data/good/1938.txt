This Westin has a perfect location downtown, where everything is within a 15 minute walk. (Beltown, space needle, pike market, just about everything) The hotel itself is nice and the rooms are spacious and what you expect of a Westin. The rooms are slightly noisier then i want in a hotel, being able to hear my neighbors quite a bit. BUt not horrible. What is horrible about this hotel is it's elevator system. It easily ranks as one of the worst I have ever seen. There are three elevators to service each tower. I was on the 25th floor and on average I always waited a minimum of 5 minutes(seriously no exaggeration at all) upwards of ten. on the 25th floor I always had to stop about 10 times coming down. One of my coworkers was on the 11th floor and his wait was even longer, because almost every time the elevator got to his floor it was full. He actually started using the stairs most of the time because of how horrible they where. Would I stay there again, I love Westins, they are my favorite hotels, but the elevator deal is almost a deal breaker. That inconvenient.. Outside of that, it's a great hotel.

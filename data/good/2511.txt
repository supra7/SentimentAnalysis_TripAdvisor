Hotel Max is located in the heart of downtown Seattle. We searched for hotels for a while before we chose the Max. We ultimately chose it because it was one of the cheapest options, it had the best recommendations and because of its locations. Rooms are not HUGE but certainly the hotel its serve its purpose.

This is overall a very nice hotel. I stayed for 3 nights. The room was clean and comfortable. The workout room was well maintained and big enough for everyone to use. The food at the restaurant was excellent, but the service was spotty. The first night, I was literally ignored for 15 minutes and had to ask someone to take my order. Same thing the next morning. The next night, everyone was spot on since the manager was there. The food was very pricey. I had the cheapest thing on the menu (fish), with a glass of wine, a bottle of water and a dessert, and with tip it came to $75! Next night I drank tap water and passed on the wine and dessert.

This is my third stay in this hotel and I will be comming back.The room and bathroom is spacious and very clean. Staff is very friendly, and when you learn about the 2 tramlines outside the hotel ( 4 min. walk ) which take you to Bornholmer str. or Osloer str. stations in 7 min. then there is acces to Whole Berlin. The breakfast is at bit expensive, but just round the corner there are coffeshops with a very good and cheap breakfast - and then you can pick up your own time for breakfast.

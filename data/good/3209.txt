The Crystal is several months old as of this writing and although there has been some wear and tear (probably due to guests not being too careful), it offers good value for the money and was the cleanest hotel I've found in the city. We had a suite on the top floor which was quite comfortable -- it was probably about 700 square feet. It had a living room with wall mounted flat screen television, sofa, coffee table a couple of chairs, kitchenette with microwave, toaster and Liebherr refrigerator that was amply stocked with all of the necessities (from juice and water to hard liquor). With 1.5 baths, the master suite had a king sized bed, flat screen television, double bowl bath vanity with separate tub and shower. All in all, pretty comfortable. Not top of the line finishes (a lot of ceramic mixed with some crema marfil marble), although I was pleasantly surprised to see the Liebherr refrigerator and Franke undermount sink in the kitchen area . The shower had a rainshower head and separate hand held, so they're definitely trying to make you comfortable. The bed was firm (which I liked) and the room was quiet, so I was pleased. This is a good hotel for business travelers or those who like/need a bit of extra space (for kids). The standard rooms are really quite spacious too, so I'd recommend considering one of those. We opted for the suite only because we were offered a pretty good rate for it, otherwise I would have booked the standard room. I would definitely consider returning. The bar is nice and overall I think the hotel offers good value for the money. Perhaps they'll hike up the prices once they've gotten more established, but in the meantime, I'd give it a try.

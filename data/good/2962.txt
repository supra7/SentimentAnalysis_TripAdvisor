This was a decent hotel for business. It was clean and quite. Not a good location for fun (next to airport) but good for traveling. They will pick you up at the airport if you call. They also have self park (free in and out with key) and valet. Bar was decent (common business travelers). Does have a nice pool, small fitness center and a business center with free printing. Nothing to0 special but a good deal for business travelors.

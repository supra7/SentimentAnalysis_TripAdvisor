Stayed here four nights - checking out tomorrow. This was within walking distance of the office which was great. There's a LOT of great restaurants and shopping right near the hotel. In fact the restaurant in the hotel was pretty good too. It's about a 20 minute by cab to the airport ($35), or you can take a shuttle for about half the price.

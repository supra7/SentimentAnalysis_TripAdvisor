My review is a bit delayed (I just recently found "tripadvisor.com"). My new husband and I stayed at KBH for our honeymoon in July 2004. The rooms were a bit outdated and musty (but clean), but overall it was a GREAT place! The staff is what honestly made the difference. The concierge (sorry I dont remember her name) was WONDERFUL! My husband and I wanted to fly to see Pearl Harbor for the day and she was a big help. She called the airlines and set us all up with a roundtrip flight and rental car on the main island. She even tried a few different airlines to get the best price. We were hoping for a better pool area, but in the end it was adequate. The tikibar (and snack bar) were a wonderful treat while relaxing poolside. The location was wonderful as well. Walking distance to almost everything. I saw a kids club that looked wonderful for a family trip in a few years. In the end it was a very reasonably priced hotel, and if returning to Maui I would definately consider the KBH!! And I definately recommend it to others.

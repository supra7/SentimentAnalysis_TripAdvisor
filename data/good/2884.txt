The Hampton Inn is pretty much my mid-price hotel/motel chain of choice when I'm on the road. The rooms are always lovely and well equipped, the Internet connections usually strong and always free (a huge plus since I travel a lot for business), the breakfast satisfying. But the Hampton Inn inevitably loses a star (for me, at least) due to the lack of glass drinking glasses. I am sure there are many corporate boilerplate reasons for substituting Styrofoam for glass, but none can convince me. Styrofoam cups cheapen the whole Hampton Inn experience...again, for me, at least. That said, the SEA-TAC property is terrific -- friendly service, convenient shuttle to and from the airport itself. The room was well-appointed, the bed comfortable and the front desk staff accommodating. OK, you can hear the jet engines of departing planes in the distance but it's more like "white noise," hardly objectionable. I liked the property a lot and highly recommend it if your travels require a night's sleep near the main Seattle airport. Now if they could just get rid of those Styrofoam cups...

I found the Executive Hotel Pacific on the net; I was looking for a hotel near the SAM (our primary reason for going was to see the Picasso exhibit) at a reasonable price. The EHP exceeded our expectation. it had a very nice urban vibe and was staffed by very friendly, helpful and fun people. The room was clean and well appointed. We appreciated the comfy bed and crisp white linens. The bathroom could have had some supplemental heat- but otherwise it was great. We were able to walk to all of the sites we were interested and had two great dinners near by (Serious Pie and Brooklyn ). There was parking right next door, but we walked everywhere so we weren't going in and out. Must say, I was also pleased to know the chain is Canadian based- happy to support the locals and the good folk back home. Highly recommend this place - can't beat it for the price !

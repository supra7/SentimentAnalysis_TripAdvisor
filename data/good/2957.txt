Like a number of other reviewers, my wife and I stayed at this Marriott on both the front and back ends of an Alaskan cruise. We relied on the cruise line, Lindblad, to do our booking for us and as such found a number of our fellow passengers there. Overall no serious issues. We did have a ground floor room facing the outside, which was quite a little hike from the lobby. Although that got us far away from the pool noise other reviewers have complained about, it exposed us to a whole other set of street noises -- including what sounded like Mariachi music (could never tell where it was coming from) -- at least early in the evening. Our room was fine, but I'm real easy to please as far as that goes. We had drinks and appetiziers in the bar area and breakfast in the restuaruant on both legs. The food was fine, but as is typical of hotel fair a bit overpriced. The airport shuttle was a great convenience, running about every 15-20 minutes, and we used it both times we were there. One caveat -- I gave a five rating for location, but that's because it was convenient for us coming and going to the airport. For someone looking for a more extended Seattle stay, that rating would not hold. Being a totally non-smoking hotel was another plus for us.

This is an interesting property. Great location if you have biz downtown, not quite as good for tourism, but not too bad if you are going to Pike Place, Ivars, museum, or other downtown locations. It is quite obviously an older Westin property that was converted to a W at the start of the W hotel project. It looks about half and half Westin and W. Limited food and beverage, but a creative bar. Almost nothing to do at the hotel itself, surprisingly not even a pool. The redeeming value is a really great and polite staff. They are young, but not afraid to make decisions to help out guests. I was very impressed with their level of service.

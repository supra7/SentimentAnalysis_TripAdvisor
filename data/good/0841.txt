We stayed at this hotel Nov 25-29th, and this is our 3rd time staying here. This is a great hotel because not only does it have an awesome location in the downtown area of Seattle, but it also has a coffee shop basically in the hotel, and the coffee is great. Plus if you don't like that coffee shop...just walk down the street about a block and there is a Starbucks! One thing we love about this hotel is the fact that you can pretty much walk anywhere from this hotel, no need for taxi rides! We had reserved online with the advance purchase and got 20% off plus when we arrived and asked if it was possible to get an upgrade to a king size room, it was free! The bed was very comfy, the tv was good, alittle small, but it had cable tv, the room itself was clean and had everything we needed...one thing that would good in the rooms would be a mini fridge for drinks. The bathroom is nice, it was a little small, but it was clean & have everthing we needed. A couple bonuses that we liked was a safe in the room as well as free wi-fi in our room! One thing to be aware of (we were not) is that you will be charged for all local calls. We did not know this, and when we got a bill at the end of our stay, I did dispute the charges because for one thing we were not told about this and also many of the calls we made had not been answered, so we felt we should not be charged. The Manager was great, and did discount the charge by half, which was good, but just beware...don't make any local calls at the hotel! Our room faced Spring Street and could be alittle noisy at night, but its the city, and most hotel rooms are noisy in the city. Overall this is a great place to stay for comfort, value and location!

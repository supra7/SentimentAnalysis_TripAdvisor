Our family spent New Year's Eve/day in Seattle. The staff at Embassy suites were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and a good size for the family. The beds are double beds not Queen-sized. Was a bit snug for 2 adults sharing. Breakfast was good - lots of selection - would opt for the "Made to Order" line vs the Express Line if possible - the eggs in the warming tray were not the best. Also, bit surprised that there were no muffins/danish available but lots of other items to choose from. Was under the impression from their webpage that Wi-Fi access in the rooms was free. It is available but must pay $10/night for this. My husband had his laptop and the kids had I-pods that they couldn't use in the room without paying the extra fee. The hotel does have a business center with internet/printer which I did use but it's not the same as having the service in your room. I think the way they advertise internet access is a bit deceiving - it should state that there is a fee. Also note that you have to pay extra for parking. Again, most of the other hotels in the area do not charge for this. All in all, it was a pleasant experience and we would stay here again although I think the Residence Inn and Homewoods Suites might be a better deal. (They were both full on the dates we needed)

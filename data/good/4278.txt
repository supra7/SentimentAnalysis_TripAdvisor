I too had low expectations after reading reviews. If we had paid the prices on the hotel website I may have been a bit disappointed. I booked 4 nights through Hotwire for $212 per night, then we paid an additional $50 per night to upgrade to an ocean view when we arrived (I tried to get a free upgrade....but no go). We self-parked, which worked out great and is free! I agree....the rooms, mainly the bathrooms do need updating to Hyatt standards, but were clean. Grounds are beautiful. We never had a problem getting a place by the pool, and compared to the Sheraton the pool was really nice and clean. They also have the cushioned lounge chairs....which is a big deal to me. My husband and I both thought the pool food was really good. All staff we encountered were really nice. Overall a great stay and would stay again, assuming we got a good deal again. For people willing to pay top dollar, your money goes a lot farther at the Four Seasons in Wailea.....which is absolutly fabulous in every way.

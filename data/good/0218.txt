The Warwick was plenty comfortable and nice for us. We had a nice view of the Space Needle from our room. Don't expect a balcony. There is just an 18 inch ledge with ironwork to keep you from falling overboard. But you can open the patio door and partially step out for a view of Lake Union and Elliott Bay. The last morning we were there, the top of the Space Needle was hidden by clouds. It was neat to see it in sunny weather and cloudy. We had everything we needed at the Warwick. No complaints.

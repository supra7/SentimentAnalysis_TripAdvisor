It is an older hotel, but it was well kept. The desk people were very helpful. They arranged transportation from the train station to the hotel. The rooms are a little crowded, but clean. The breakfast was way more than expected. Eggs, sausage, waffles, pasteries, cereal, fruit, and I'm probably leaving out something.

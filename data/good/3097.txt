We stayed at the Radisson Seatac for one night while we were seeing our daughter off on a flight to Europe. It is a great location and a decent Hotel. The price was reasonable (about $110.00 per night for 3 persons.) The hotel is a little tired and could use a renovation, but all and all it was quite nice. You can walk to the airporte from the hotel ( about 5-10 minutes)

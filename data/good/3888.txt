Great hotel, rooms were spacious and clean. Bathrooms actually had drawers so you could keep the counter tops clear. Typical area parking fees, people who complain just plain have never stayed in a resort area with limited parking, deal with it. Fairly new bridge over to the Gaslamp district, beautiful at night. Crosses over right at Petco park. Hotel bar - also typical, expensive drinks. Sports bar downstairs good place to catch a game and bite to eat. Suggest walking over to Seaport villiage and eating breakfast at Buster's Beach House & Longboard Bar. Also a fun place to drink later, great decor and Island drinks. Short walk out the back of the hotel. Gaslamp district, plenty of places to eat - lots of chains, Ruth Chris, McCormick & Schmidts, Hard Rock, House of Blues, Dicks Last Resort, etc. but you can find, and I would suggest trying the locals. Really enjoyed Nickey Rottens burgers - everything is 100% organic, good food and service was great.

We stayed at this hotel for one night. We had an early morning flight and the hotel is literally across the street from the airport. The hotel staff were average, but efficient. They checked us into the hotel quickly but weren't overly welcoming. The next day upon check-out, same thing. She checked us out quickly but didn't ask us how we enjoyed our stay or have a nice day, etc. The room was quite large and comfortable. The sleep number bed is comfortable if you can get it adjusted correctly. It's nice to have the option of being able to adjust it. The bathroom was clean. We have traveled to Seattle several times in the past few months and have stayed at two other nearby airport hotels. This hotel rates better than one by quite a bit and about the same as another one. My chief complaint about this hotel was the noise factor. There were children screaming in the hall and I could still hear them screaming even after they'd gone into their room several doors down. We would probably stay here again if we got a good rate, especially if it's only for one night, because the convenience factor to the airport can't be beat.

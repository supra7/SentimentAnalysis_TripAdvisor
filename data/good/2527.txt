I have stayed at the Hotel Max twice, and had great experiences both times. Parking at the hotel is super easy and all the staff are very friendly and attentive. My only complaints are with the size of the rooms/bathrooms, but that only applies to the most recent stay. The first time I had a pretty big room, but this last time it seemed the room shrunk by half. At the end of the day this is not a huge problem since the room is really only there for me to shower and sleep in, if I were living out of it, that would be a diferent story. Overall great experience and I will defeinitely be going back. Ohh and I forgot to mention the location; it is perfect for the person(s) who want to see all of downtown Seattle (Pikes, Space Needl, shopping) and don't mind walking. One night of parking at the Max is cheaper than a few hours of parking anywhere downtown.

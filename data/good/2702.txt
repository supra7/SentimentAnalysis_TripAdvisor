I stayed at the hotel to attend a conference. Great, great location if you have an event at the conference center. You head out the main entrance and go left. At the end of the block, across the street, was the convention center. It's also only three blocks away from a bus route that takes one to the airport and bypass expensive taxis or shuttles. The lobby is rather small, but nicely appointed. A computer was available for use, but no printer for getting boarding passes ready. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was relatively small, but clean and with up-to-date furniture. Bed and sheets were comfortable. We were on the third floor and could hear some of the noise from outside, but not too bad considering we're in the middle of the city. Bathroom was also small, but clean with good water pressure in the shower. They offered and honored an environmental policy of reusing your bed sheets if you placed a sign on the pillows and by hanging up your towels. However, there were no recycling bins readily available in the rooms or lobby, although I was able to recycle paper by asking at the check-in desk.

We stayed at this hotel during the first week of December and after much hype I was rather disappointed. On arrival it took over 30 minutes to check-in. I understand that it's nice for staff to spend time with each customer but what we experienced was too much. Even when it was our turn it felt like it was taking them forever to get us checked-in. We had an ocean view Regency room which was really nice and very clean. However the toiletries were not replaced for the 3 days we spent there. The biggest disappointment was the virtually inexistent beach, althoughif you walked 5 minutes down the seafront there was a wonderful sandy enormous beach. I'm not much of a pool person which was just as well because there aren't enough loungers and they get mostly taken by people with towels around 7 in the morning. The only ones left were in awful places with no easy access to either the pool or the beach. The alternative was to pay for a cabana which again did not have access to the beach. We didn't eat at the hotel at all except for the Luau (much better than the one at the Hilton in Waikiki) as it was all very expensive for what it looked like, but Lahaina offers a lot of choice so I was happy to be forced out of the hotel grounds. The grounds are really beautiful and well taken care of, as are all the buildings. The housekeeping staff is fantastic and everything is really clean. The cocktail bar next to the penguins pool was always empty but we stopped there one night and they served us amazing cocktails so well worth giving it a go. Overall I would not recommend this hotel because of the beach and the pool. Very good if you just want a nice hotel that you want to use as a base for exploring the island.

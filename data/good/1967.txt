My Wife and I stayed here and we both loved it. The Valet greeted use as we pulled up and took our bags and car away. We then checked-in, which only took a few minutes. Our room was on the 27 floor, we could see the Space Needle and the port. Room was very nice, bed was really soft. The mini bar was unbelievably expensive, $5 for a chocolate bar. The free wifi in the lobby was nice, and the free boarding pass printing. The location was perfect and the staff was friendly and professional. We had a great stay at the Westin and will return.

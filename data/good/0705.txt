We stayed for a week for work in Queen rooms with private bath. It is great location and Robert at the front desk was a brilliant source of local knowledge. Beds were comfortable, rooms nice and clean, loved the tiger strip carpet on our floor. Only negatives would be the shower had really poor pressure and temperature. There was no wi-fi on our floor which was a pain as we were there for work, so we spent a lot of time in the lobby. I would stay again.

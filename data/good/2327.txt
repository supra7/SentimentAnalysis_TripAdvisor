I've stayed here a number of times over the years. Nothing much has changed, it's very comfortable, swish and upmarket but the entire reception and bar area has been demolished removing one of the best things about the hotel (incl. the amazing sexy fries). I'd avoid until the bar is reopened unless your not fussed about that. Customer service as usual is a little transactional, the four seasons Seattle shows how service should be done

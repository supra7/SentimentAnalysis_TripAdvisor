I stayed at Hotel Max for 3 nights on a recent business trip. I normally stay at a Marriott or Hilton, but given the times, I am attempting to be a more responsible employee and watch my travel costs very closely. Hotel Max was one block from all of the other hotels I considered and yet I paid $80-$100 less per night. That rate also included free in and out valet parking and internet - a true value in my book. The hotel is quaint. The rooms are quite small but very clean and well appointed. Amenities were top of the line and the honor bar was well stocked (not that I indulged). The window heater/air conditioner was a little hard to regulate, but it was sufficient. The service and location can't be beat. The attached restaurant (I think it it's Red Fin) was great too - nice happy hour. I would definitely stay again and would absolutely recommend it to others.

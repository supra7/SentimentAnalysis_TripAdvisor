I want to start off with saying how awesome the staff is at this hotel. Due to the horrible weather last winter, I had to reschedule my stay at the last minute and they re-booked it for the same price without any problems. The rooms are on the small side, but super retro and hip. The restaurant is also good and they have ample room service available. The location is great, just blocks from public transportation or you can easily walk to the Pike St Market. I recommend it for a romantic getaway (get a bigger room) or a fun night on the town with friends.

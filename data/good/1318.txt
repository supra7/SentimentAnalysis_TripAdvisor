We stayed here for two nights and booked a room with two queens, but the beds were quiet small, and it was a bit cramped. Great location close to the markets and shopping DT. The pool and spa had fantastic views of the city on the 35th floor. Well worth staying here, id book on hotwire.com, but you have to tip for everything and Valet is $40 a night, self park is about $28.00 more than 2 blocks away so nothing is cheap.

I spent 1 night here in order to clean up from a hiking trip, repack for the trip home and make a very early flight the next morning. I generally like Hampton Inns and have stayed at lots of them around the US. This 1 was no exception. It is located about 6 blocks south of SEA on International Boulevard. They provided a free 24 hour airport shuttle service, which was important to me as I had no car. If you do have a car, parking is free. My short stay was in a King Bed Study with sofa. It was very roomy, clean, quiet and comfortable, and everything in the room looked to be in new condition. See their web site for a complete description of amenities. All 131 rooms in this hotel are nonsmoking. No pets are allowed. The complimentary cold and hot breakfast opens at 5 AM to accommodate guests on early flights. The hotel has no other food service but there are numerous restaurants within a few blocks, plus some that deliver. There is a computer with Internet connection in the lobby for guest use. The hotel has a pool and workout room, neither of which I used. All in all I was very satisfied with my stay here and recommend this Hampton Inn for a short or longer stay.

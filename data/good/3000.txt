We stayed at the Hilton on route to Mexico this March. We checked in late and left early, but our time there was enjoyable. The hotel is huge, and "maze like" - but we didn't mind. Took a peek at the gym/pool and both looked nice. Recommended for a stay when needing the airport as its right across the street. Note: parking is $24/night, too bad! We got this hotel on priceline for a great deal and parking off-site, so it wasn't too bad!

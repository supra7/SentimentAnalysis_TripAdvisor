Nice place, very modern, clean, nice people, the transport are not too far: we can really easily go to the U-Bahn or take a bus (right in front of the hotel). For night owls: it could be a bit long to come back on foot after a night party (depending where the club is)... We didn't take the breakfast or internet-wifi but we could easily find a place to get a coffee and a short wifi-connection to check emails once outside the hotel ;) I would definately come back, it's a good address!! Thanks!!

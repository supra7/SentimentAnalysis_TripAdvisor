The hotel appeared to need an extra person working the front desk, as the one person who was working was swamped. The rooms are quite small, but the amenities weren't bad. Nice selection of coffee and teas, as well as a large flatscreen TV and a computer desk. The wifi worked fine. There were not enough plug ins, which was quite irritating. The bathroom, while iddy biddy, was actually kinda cute. Most importantly, the bed was VERY comfortable and I slept soundly. I also ate in the restaurant, and I thought it was quite good.

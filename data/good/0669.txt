We stayed here as part of a Clipper Vacation package from Victoria. This wasnt the 1st time we had stayed at the hotel but was a good reminder of why we came back. The service was helpful without being overbearing, the rooms were well presented with a very comfortable bed (a bed is a bed to me so the fact I commented on this is a surprise) and wonderful shower. We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast and were pleasantly surprised on both counts with the speed, quality and again friendliness of staff. One of the biggest perks of the hotel is the location, you couldnt be closer to the shops or the monorail, which takes you out to the sites. We requested a late checkout and were accommodated without fuss, which made our long haul flight a little more manageable. Would I stay again? In a heartbeat.

Our plane was delayed a few hours from Honolulu. We were expecting to meet guests coming to our daughter's wedding from Germany. Our daughter met them instead and the U Inn let them in their rooms before check-in time. We stayed at the Inn three years ago and this time we were again satisfied with their service. Breakfast time was like a reunion for our families coming from Germany, Philippines and California, USA. The hotel is centrally located and the proximity to the wedding venue was an ideal choice. The staff was helpful and friendly. The towels were so nice and soft. The only thing that could be improved was the noisy plumbing, but it is understandable. I could live with it. One needs morning showers!

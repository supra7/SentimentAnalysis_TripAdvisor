My first trip to Seattle. I selected the Warwick based on reviews here (and it was a package available from United), and I was not disappointed. I found the staff to be quite friendly and knowledgeable. My room on the sixth floor was clean and comfortable (in fact, the first night there, I fell asleep early, with my clothes on, and stayed that way all night)! I ate in the restaurant, and the waitress nudged me away from my first choice, and gave me a thumbs up on my second choice (I asked for her advice), a delicious rigatoni dish with artichokes and olives. Their bread is especially wonderful! The location is convenient for walking; the hotel provided a very helpful map. I used the Grayline shuttle from the airport and back, which was so easy. I'd certainly stay at the Warwick again.

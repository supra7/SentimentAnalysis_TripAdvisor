My husband and I had a very enjoyable stay at the Boutique Trevi Hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The staff were very friendly and helpful and had ensured that the taxi's we'd pre-booked were at the airport ot meet us and to return us in good time for our flight home. The room we were allocated was really beautiful, pannelled, well furnished. We had a jacuzzi bath with overhead shower and contrary to other reviews we'd read before we travelled, the plumbing was perfect. The level of cleanliness was superb, we noticed that the cleaning was supervised every day. The only poor point of the stay was the breakfast-very poor quality, no fresh breads or rolls and a very limited selection of meats and cheese. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others. S.

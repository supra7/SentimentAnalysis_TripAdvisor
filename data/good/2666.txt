Got a killer mid week price plus free parking, on a whirlpool mini suite via Travelocity/American Express. We regularly stay downtown for events and have stayed at many of the finer hotels in Seattle. Loved the Roosevelt, early check in, friendly front desk. Lovely lobby area, great for watching people walk by on the street or just reading a book. The room was sensational and a great value! Full sized couch with ottoman, desk area with lamp, free wi fi, tons of light, great views of the hustle and bustle of Westlake. Plenty of space if you wanted to have another couple come up to visit before a dinner or show. The bathroom set up was neat, one room had a giant whirlpool and shower, separate room for toilet, sink, vanity, lots of shelf space for products etc. The room was very clean, bed was super comfortable, big flatscreen t.v. you could move and adjust to see from the bed or couch, all the good cable channels, no porn or PPV, no mini bar, but glassware was provided. Also pleasantly surprised to find a very large refrigerator with mini freezer in the bathroom. Kept our bubbly nice and cold! Have a restaurant and bar attached (Von's) we went for a cocktail and food after a soccer match, disappointed to find the kitchen closed for maintenance. Went up the street to The Taproom. Easy walk to all Seattle highlights, Pioneer Square, Pike Place, shopping etc. We bused to CenturyLink Field for free and walked back. My only (minor) complaint was the valet service was very overwhelmed and not very friendly. We will be back to this hotel soon. Very happy with our visit. Especially for the amazing price!

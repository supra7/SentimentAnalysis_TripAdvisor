Stayed there at July 30  Aug 2. The location is great  right downtown, walking distance to the most attractions, monorail was two blocks away and a bus stop was a block away. Our room was very small but clean. Bed was queen size and very comfortable. The interior is a bit outdated but we did not come to Seattle to spend our time in the room anyway. It was very hot in Seattle when we arrived. The very first day and night we had troubles with the air conditioner. The staff was very helpful; they checked our conditioner almost immediately and it was working more or less okay for the rest of our stay. It is a little pricey but we would go back. It is a nice place to stay.

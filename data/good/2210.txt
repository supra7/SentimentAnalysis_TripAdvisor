We had a family function to attend in the University of Washington area. There are not a lot of hotels in this area, but of the ones others in our family/friends group used, we think we had the best! All of the staff were very knowledgeable, friendly and professional. The rooms are not opulent, but have all you need including a mini-fridge. The beds very most comfortable and the rooms quiet. The free breakfast was very good, especially the waffles and coffee. We also went to the Space needle, Ferry boat and Pike's market and were well situated to those points of interest. Best of all--great value for your money--and free parking!

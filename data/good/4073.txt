I am a frequent flyer and business traveller. We were there during the construction. All I have to say is that the hotel did an excellent job of keeping the construction as concealed as possible. The scaffolding, tarps and even the temporary stair case were painted the main color of the hotel. I have NEVER seen a hotel go to that extent to hide the ugliness of construction. I do feel bad for anyone that paid full price with no "bennys". Perhaps if the hotel offered drink specials during the day it would help ease the pain- keep the happy hour all day! Great happy hour btw-the Mai Tai's rocked! The bartenders are awesome. We vacationed with our kids who loved the pool and water slides. My fav was the waterfalls. TIPS- -Order the Italian Pie at Umalu with an order of onion rings for lunch. -Go to Japengo for dinner and sit in the bar's lounge out by the Tiki torches. We ordered the kids meals, some rolls and had four beers. We were happy with the value. The waitress even took the time to explain to our kids what they were eating. -Take time to explore the hotel's landscape and museum artifacts. -Smile, a lot! -Say Aloha and Mahalo to the staff. -Don't swim in front of the hotel without shoes on. -Sit, stay, and watch the sunset from the pool with a Mai Tai. -Go down the water slide at least once. -Get an ocean view room. Hotel Note: please figure out how to keep non-guests from filling up the parking lots. If I'm paying a $25 resort fee, I should have first choice for parking. So for those who are coming to this hotel after the construction, I'm sure your experience will be five star. Would I come back to this hotel? YES!

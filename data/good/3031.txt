I was here only one night during a snow storm in Seattle. The van from the airport to the hotel never arrived. I got on the Marriott's van (the Marriott is next door to the Hilton) and the driver kindly dropped me off. The snow was snarling traffic around the airport so it is somewhat understandable about the Hilton shuttle's delay. The check-in staff were quite friendly. The lobby of the hotel was very cozy with a huge fireplace and comfy chairs. The room was standard Hilton. Nice appointments, clean. I love the Hilton pillows so much I ordered one for my own bed. I ate at the bar. The restaurant had a wait of an hour, although it was only half full. Took a while for the hostess to arrive and assist me. The bar had a good selection of food and it was enjoyable. No free internet - no Hiltons offer this except for higher levels in the Honors program. This is the only thing I hate about Hiltons. Overall, it's a good hotel for comfort and convenience to the airport.

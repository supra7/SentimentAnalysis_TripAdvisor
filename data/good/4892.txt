We like everything about this accomodation and the service was excellent. Just remember when traveling in most European countries - there are no washcloths or bar soap. The rooms in the new part where we stayed were modern and very clean. They also provided a computer with internet service to use in the room at no additional cost. We were within easy walking distance to all the major sites in Rome. We would stay there again.

We stayed here for a family weekend and enjoyed the easy location. We took the link light rail from the airport and it worked great - inexpensive and got to see some of the city and surrounding area. We stayed on the club floor and enjoyed the club lounge for a quick breakfast every day and drinks and munchies when we were around in the evening. The pool is great, even if you are not swimming, the corner views are good to see. Rooms were small but did the trick.

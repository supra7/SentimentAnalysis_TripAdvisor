Had an early morning flight, so I relocated to this unit. It's an 'older' property, rather traditionally laid out and appointed. The rooms are large, clean, and well appointed. Good towels, many pillows, nice bed. Don't bother with room service; the lobby restaurant serves the same food, a WHOLE lot faster, less cost, calls you when ready, and gives you a nice tray to take upstairs. Computers in lobby for printing boarding passes, printers that WORK, reasonable front desk staff. Parking lot is ample, close to car rental returns and gas stations. Nice place.

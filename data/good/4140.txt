If you are the rare beach vacationer who actually likes to sit on the beach, and not near the pool, read on. At first I was horribly disappointed in this hotel. The beach is almost nonexistent in front of the hotel and the shallow waters are entirely lava and hard to walk on. And then, of course, on my last day I figured out how this could be the greatest beach hotel ever. If you walk all the way down to the spa, there is an area of beach connected to the larger, public access beach, where Hyatt has 14 chairs and 5 umbrellas to rent. They are also first come, first serve in the morning. This means that you have a nice, sandy, large, virtually uninhabited beach with the benefits of a chair and an umbrella, all of which you'll probably share with a maximum of 13 people. I never saw any kids here and the noise from the pool area didn't exist. I thought it was as close to a private beach as I'll ever get and I loved it. No bar service but worth a short walk for the peace and quiet. Ask for a room in the Lahaina tower and you'll be closer to your room from this spot too. Hotel itself has a lovely staff and nice facilities. Japengo was awful and I would not eat there but it's a nice location for a drink.

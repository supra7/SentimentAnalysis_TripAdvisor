We stayed at this hotel for a mariners game. At check-in staff was very nice and helpful. We got to our room which was a king room on the 25 th floor. It was clean big and comfy. The only minus was the bathroom door. It wasn't very private. The bed was extremely soft. Also, room service came right on time. Food was pretty good. Pool was small but the water was warm. Overall it was okay but I suggest replacing their bathroom doors.

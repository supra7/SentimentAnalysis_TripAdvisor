I booked this hotel because the website said - 'Most Hawaiian hotel in Hawaii'. When we reached there, my first impression was that i should have booked sheraton (next building) instead. If you are expecting a posh building with luxury rooms with a modern look; this may not be the right place. You get a regular looking comfortable room, with a hawaiian imprint wall paper, and some hawaiian paintings. There is no room service offered.The restaurant,bar and food are ok (had very limited vegetarian options; but they worked out something for us!) There is only 1 pool for the whole resort, which is smallish. However, over the next few days, the place really grew on us. The room and bed were actually very comfortable, the location at the beach was perfect. Every evening was filled with lovely hawaiian songs and hula dance, and it really removed any tiredness we had during the day and was very relaxing. They have lot of hawaiian activities going on everyday, and i learned lei making from a very patient and sweet teacher. The songs and the activities really made it a different experience from a regular resort. The welcome breakfast is not as big a deal as it sounds. On the last day, we were bid farewell from the hotel staff and presented with a handmade lei. It was a touching moment, and really made our last day very fulfilling and pleasant. Pros: - Very homely and comfortable feel - Lovely live hawaiian music and dance every day - Hawaiian activities for both adults and children - Shoreline is beautiful - Very helpful staff Cons: - Doesn't look modern (as people may expect from resorts). - Looks like a very old building, can do with repainting. - Food and restaurant is ok (Based on vegetarian meals only). - Small swimming pool - Spa not very good - Parking was 9$ per day - Had to rent cabana at 21$ for half a day

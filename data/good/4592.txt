We stayed at the KBH for 5 nights in October/November 2007. We booked this hotel for its location and value price. We received what we expectedpremium location with moderate accommodations. The grounds and common areas are neat and well kept, and spacious. However, the pool was small for a facility this size. Our room was in the Kauai wing on the ground floor facing the central gardens. It was clean, but older. The furnishings and decorations were dated, but properly serviced. Construction at the beach end of the building (opposite from ours) indicates this wing is undergoing renovation in stagesours being a room not yet scheduled. We had just a peek of the beach/ocean from our patio, even though we booked a garden view room. We were close enough to hear the ocean at night. The location is great5-minute walk to Whalers Village (south) or Black Rock (north). There is a Trilogy Activities Center in the central area right next to the beach to use for booking activities, tours, etc. All the staff was friendly and efficient. On arrival day, we noticed a bit of water creating a small puddle under the sink. We notified the front desk the next morning, and by that afternoon, the faucet and all under sink plumbing was completely replaced (problem solved). We did not eat at the hotel, so cannot comment on the food. Some very minor negatives: They only give you one packet of coffee per day for the in-room coffee makerwith a sign advising you that you can purchase more. Parking is $9 per day extra (we were aware of this ahead of our stay), use of the in-room safe is $1.50 per day extra, and loungers on the beach are extra ($16 for a  day use of a 2 person unit w/ sunshade). If you are looking for an upscale full service resort with all the latest trimmings, this is NOT it. If you are looking for a clean, value-priced centrally located comfortable place with a few resort type facilities, this IS it.

After a wonderful Alaskan cruise, I stayed on in Seattle at the Hotel Monaco for 3 nights. The hotel is a lovely property and the location is ideally suited for those visitors who enjoy walking around a city to see more than just the tourist attractions. The decor is quite different and colorful as compared to most other chain hotels, but I liked that very much. One can only stand so much beige, blue and green. Some might consider the decor "busy" but I found it quite refreshing. The new Seattle Library, which is a spectacular ultra contemporary building, is directly across the street and one block down. The Seattle Art Museum and the Aquarium are within walking distance and are worth the time and effort. The things I found most disappointing about the property were the housekeeping services and the attached restaurant, Sazarec. Housekeeping service was polite but very slow. Also, the ice machines are located on every other floor starting on the fourth floor. I had a suite on the 3rd floor and although it wasn't a hardship, it wasn't convenient either. The food in the restaurant was excellent quality but overpriced and my waiter seemed tired and/or not interested in making my dining experience a memorable one. After all the really wonderful reviews I read about the Monaco, I found my stay there not as pleasant as I had expected. I do like Kimpton properties and I would stay in one again if I were to go back to Seattle, but I probably choose one of the other two properties there.

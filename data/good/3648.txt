Room was tiny - but we'd got a really cheap rate so were expecting a box - but was stylish and clean and bathroom was good (although had a glass panel to the bedroom so could be embarassing if you weren't travelling with your partner). Location was excellent for the East Village and LES - loads of bars and restaurants nearby plus subway on the corner. Only problem is that it is right on a busy road with lots of late night revellers so it was noisy at night despite the double glazing so not a good choice if you're a light sleeper like me. Staff were fantastic, friendly and efficient and gave us vouchers for free drinks and the cute japanese bar next door. One of the best things about the hotel is the roof terrace which gives great views of Midtown and downtown over the roofs. Breakfast was ok - usual buffet stuff on disposable plates but plenty of it. Free wi-fi and internet downstairs is a definate bonus. Overall defintely worth a stay although no way would I pay the rack rates on the hotel's website - make sure you get a good deal on a discount site.

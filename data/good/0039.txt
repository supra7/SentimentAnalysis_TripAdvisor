We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 nights in August. The location is good. It is walking distance to Pike Place market and the monorail and there are a few good restaurants nearby. It does get a little quiet on the weekends however as it is in the financial district and we found that most places did close early making it a little diffucult to get a snack or coffee outside the hotel in the late evening. The room was very spacious making it great for us: a couple and two young children. That said, the sofa bed would have been extremely uncomfortable for an adult, but the kids did not complain at all. And it was nice to have a heavy curtain separating the space, so we could have a light on while the kids were sleeping. The welcome package for the kids was nice as was the box of toys in the lobby. We did not get a goldfish for the first few days (due to some heat wave... not sure if that was just a cute excuse for the kids or the truth) but did finally get one after a few days of nagging. Not a big deal, but I would rather they didn't advertise it unless it can be guaranteed upon arrival. The restaurant was great: we ate there twice and had two great meals.

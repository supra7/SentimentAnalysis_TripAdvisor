The Moore Hotel is a terrific deal! I have never said at a hotel this nice for much an inexpensive price! The room and bed were perfectly clean, amazing location, super cool staff, fun historic theater next door. The walls are a little thin but the building is hundreds of years old! When I come back to Seattle, I will most definitely stay at the Moore Hotel.

This hotel has a great location downtown. Very easy access to and from I5, if you're driving. The hotel is very clean and our room (single King) was very spacious. Staff was helpful in every instance. The only problem was that the bed was too soft. I have a bad back so soft beds are a problem. We were at the Sheraton for four nights and I had very little unbroken sleep. My wife, who has no health problems, also found the beds uncomfortable. If you don't mind a softer bed, I would highly recommend this hotel. If you are driving, be prepared for expensive valet parking ($43 per night in November of 2011).

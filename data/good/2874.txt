I stayed at the Sea-Tac Embassy Suites (which is actually in Tukwila) for a week between Christmas and New Years (personal business), and would recommend it to any traveler needing a simple, cost efffective and comfortable home base while staying in the Seattle area. This is not the Ritz Carlton, but I really appreciated alot of the little details that abounded the property. The open air atrium and sky light was perfect for Seattle, where the sun rarely shines (actually, the week I was there, it snowed and apparently there are no snow plows in Seattle. Slush city). The rooms were clean (though the cleaning staff seemed to pick and choose what they wanted to clean), free breakfast and a managers happy hour w/snacks were nice touches and well appreciated by the crowd (which included families and business travellers), and the gym had up to date equipment (which is not always the case even in a Ritz Carlton!). The staff was responsive to our needs. There is a gigantic mall about 5 minutes away, and more fast food restaurants than you will ever need. Oh, and the guys and gals who worked at Rings Restaurant deserve a shout out -- they serve good Washington State wine and a damn fine burger.

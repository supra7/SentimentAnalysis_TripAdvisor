Inside it's all straight lines of marble, glass and wood, decorated in vibrant colours, and enhanced by gilted scroll-work on mirrors etc, while the building itself has gently bowed walls and beautiful church windows - all kept immaculately clean. The staff were all friendly and very helpful, and the aminities were certainly as good as you would expect from an hotel of this standard. Breakfast was definitely worth waking up for - the fresh orange juice and Italian coffee started ever y day with a zing.We encountered two small problems - the battery on our television remote control ran out, and was promptly replaced, and then the plug in our en-suite sink stuck. We reported the fault as we left to explore, and a handiman was dispatched at once. On our return the plug again failed, and the receptionist was so apologetic that we forgave him at once! The hotel is a ten minute walk from the bus and railway stations, fifteen minutes through atmospheric alleyways to the Realto, and about the same again to St Mark's. There are a number of restaraunts and cafes within a few minute's walk, and the Riva de Biasio stop on the No 1 vaporetto route is only about 150 metres from the hotel.

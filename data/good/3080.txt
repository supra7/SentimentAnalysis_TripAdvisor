There's a great difference in rooms of the same price. We stayed in one room on a high floor and everything was pristine and comfortable. A few nights later we came back and stayed in a room on the second floor and it was much shabbier. The lay-out was the same but there were fewer pillows, paint was peeling, it felt like a different hotel.

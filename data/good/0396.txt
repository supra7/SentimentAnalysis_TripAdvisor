Really nice staff, clean room, comfy bed, good water pressure. We stayed on the 29th floor and the view was beautiful! Send it to my husband and he said it looked like a post card. Ate dinner here once. Beef stroganoff was just ok. Tried to eat breakfast here but the waiter left us sitting there a long time. Their breakfast is rather overpriced $16 for the buffet and overpriced a la carte items. Wifi is $10 a day, or $40 for the week. Thank goodness for 3G.

We spent one night at the Ace Hotel in July 2009. We booked on expedia for a good rate (for the area) of $99 per night for a room with a double bed. The location was good for our purposes. Just a 10 minute walk from the Victoria Clipper dock and cruise ship terminal and a 15 minute walk from Pike Place Market. The neighborhood (Belltown)was kind of cool with a lot of restaurants and night life. The check in/out procedures were really easy and the hotel staff was very pleasant. The rooms were clean, minimalist, with a bed, sink, Ipod/music player and flat screen TV. There was no air conditioning, but the windows opened, so the room cooled down pretty well. Our room was on the street side. If you do not like street noise, ask for a room in a different part of the hotel. The rooms did not have a toilet or bathing facilities. There were five bathrooms, four with shower facilities down the hallway (for about a total of 30 rooms). They seemed to be cleaned pretty well, although I am sure not perfectly. Although the hotel seemed pretty full, we never had an issue finding one of the bathrooms or showers to use. Not ideal for many people and if we were staying for more than a couple of nights, this would have been an issue. They offer a breakfast in a room at the back of the hotel, downstairs a couple of floors, but we found a small bakery across the street which was pretty good, so we cannot comment on the breakfast. Overall, I could recommend this hotel if you don't mind sharing the bathroom. Otherwise, this is a good place to stay for a couple of nights if you can handle to shared facilities... if not, don't stay here.

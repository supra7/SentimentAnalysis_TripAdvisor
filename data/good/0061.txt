We arrived and found they only had us for one night. No problem, they extended it at the same price as the first night. Lobby, elevators, and hallways are very clean and smelled fresh. Elevators are pretty quick and we did not wait more than a minute for one from the 7th floor. Room appeared clean. Beds were comfortable, but pillows were very fluffy and firm. Kind of odd. They brought up two kids bathrobes, which were such a hit. Bathrooms were clean and tub had no mildew. Good water pressure. Phones are a bit dated. You have to push too many buttons to get a service. Quiet, but plumbing pipes are old and can be noisy in the middle of the night. HVAC system was probably the best and quietest I have every seen. Friday night was their 30th anniversary, as was it our Anniversary. They had a two hour wine fest with cupcakes, free snacks, etc. Not stingy on the wine either! Front desk gave us free DVDs to watch. Oh, kids loved the Guitar Hero during out wine social hour. I recommend they do that again. Valet guys were fast and observant of our needs. Parking is high, but along the rates of local parking fees anyway. We just got over it, but it did add to the cost of our vacation. Fun restaurant adjacent to the hotel. Would have been a 5 star, but no pool.

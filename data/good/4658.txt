I was a little nervious for my stay at KBH after reading some poor reviews days before leaving on my honeymoon. My wife and I spent a week there the end of September. I can honestly say it has been an amazing honeymoon and the stay at KBH was nothing to worry about. The only problems with the whole vacation was with the flight out to Maui. We arrived late in the evening and went to check in to the hotel only to figure out that the room was not what we had reserved; no fault of the hotel. The travel agency never faxed the complete manifest of my vacation deal to the hotel. KBH was extremely helpful and accomidating. They were able to switch our room the next day. The first room was a little dingy, but was in the older wing of the hotel. The next day we moved to a new room which was located in the new wing of the hotel and to our suprise, the room was amazing. It was so much nicer than the previous room. We were not sure what to expect after that first night. The rest of the week was amazing. There are many complimentary activities for hotel guests. The hotel grounds were nice and clean. The beach was great. The food at the mixed plate restraunt was delicious and filling! The KBH is definately the most hawaiian hotel. If you expect riches and luxury, this is not the hotel for you. Spend a little more $$ if you expect luxury and stay in the Sheraton next door. Reviews have stated that this place is not romantic place for honeymooners. I disagree with those reviews. The KBH was a great place for our honeymoon and I would suggest it to all other honeymooners. You can save some $$ and have a wonderful place to stay. The helpful and friendly atmosphere of the KBH will bring me back in the future.

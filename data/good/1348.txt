Definitely take advantage of the concierge! We have never used the concierge desk before, but we asked them to make reservations for us at the Space Needle. We had a great meal at the Needle and to our surprise, the concierge had asked our waitress to bring us their famous "smoking" dessert. It was such a fun surprise. However, the only parking available is valet, which adds up pretty fast.

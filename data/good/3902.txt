The hotel room was spacious and I had a wonderful view of the bay. Services were very good. Restaurants on site were very good. The service level at the Vela Restaurant was a little slow when waiting to be seated but the food was very good. The Sweet Dreams Frozen Yogurt was very good and open late evening.

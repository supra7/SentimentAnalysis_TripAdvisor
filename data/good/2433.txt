We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in January. We received an upgrade to a faboulous corner room (on floor 16). Our room had a somewhat view of the water. Positves: Liked the dimly lit hallways (mood lighting) and elevator music. Walk to shopping and restaurants Very comfy bed, one of the better hotel beds we have slept in. Nice room , great style, very nice bath products (by bliss spa). Dvd player in room. Great water pressure in shower No outside hallway noise could be heard in room. Great bar area downstairs (The W bar). Negatives: Loud outside road noise. But you are in a downtown hotel. We didn't think you would still be able to hear traffic down below, but you definitely could! No room darkening shades (room just had wood venetian blinds - light still came through.) Way to exspensive to rent in room movie &13.99 plus tax, food spendy from in room menu and mini bar way to spendy as well (but again that's would hotels do, they charge an arm and a leg for things!). It would be nice for once if some of these exspensive hotels would not do this.

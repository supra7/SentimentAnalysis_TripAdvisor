We chose this hotel because it met our three requirements: - Four star hotel for around $100/night (as Orbitz add on) - Central location in Seattle (we walk and use public transport when we travel) - Free Internet Vintage Park advertises itself as a boutique hotel, but it feels more like a standard high end property with colorfully decorated rooms. We were in the smallest of those rooms, on the fifth floor, and despite old-fashioned double hung windows (they opened!) street noise was never a problem. Despite other's complaints, Internet access was never a problem (try to open an non-secure webpage and you're taken to a one-click logon) and we had no touble getting around, finding buses, etc. Even at 10:00pm the neighborhood felt safe if quiet. Two big bonuses: a complementary wine tasting every evening between 5 and 6pm (including popular weekly nights featuring Sangria and sparkling wine) and free use of yoga equipment. (As a side note, the restaurant, Tulio, is unusually good for a hotel.)

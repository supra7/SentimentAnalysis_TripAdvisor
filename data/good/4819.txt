My stay in Fragrance Hotel is a brief one but I would surely want to come back to this one. It is very clean and though the space is tight my room was well planned. It did not feel cramped. It has what you need- a clean, comfortable place to lay your tired body after a day of roaming. It is located in a quiet area in Singapore, unlike other hotels that's just several steps away from the busy centers. You'd feel secure in the area. It has a convenient store right downstairs for what ever you might need. The internet connection is somewhat slow and at 1SG$ per 15 minutes. The staff are nice and courteous here.

This is a 'classic' Hampton Inn. Nice but if you've stayed at others you know what you are expecting here. The bathroom was much smaller than others - almost too small. This hotel is about a 10 minute drive to Sea-Tac even though you can hear planes take off and land from the hotel. They do offer a free breakfast earlier and later than other hotels which is nice if you have an early flight.

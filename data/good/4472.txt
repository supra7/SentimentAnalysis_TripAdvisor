Very satisfied with our stay we spent a week there.Have free entertainment nightly outdoor by the Tiki Bar.Hula dancing,singers& dance floor. Tiki bar has daily specials & happy hour. Tiki grill has good selection of quick food from pizzas to burgers at reasonable price for the area.We enjoyed the show Kupana at the hotel it included dinner & drinks, Magician & Hawaiin theme, we thought it was a very good value. Hotel staff was very friendly with a greeting & willing to help & visit. Nice location on the beach & used free trolley for local travel. Whalers shopping center just a few doors down the beach has variety of restaurants & shops with ABC discount store. We didn't use internet as there was a charge for use which we are not used to paying additional fee for also daily fee for parking if you have a rental otherwise we were satisfied with the value.We did purchase buffet breakfast in advance as it was cheaper that way good breakfast. we did do the Sunday Champagne Brunch which was spendy but excellent food with many choices from pork,prime rib,clams,shrimp,crab legs etc. Pool was nice not overly large & water temp was a little cool in Jan assume no heat. We would stay again if we go back to Maui.

I have now stayed at KBH over the Christmas period for the last 4 years and hoping to make it for the fifth visit this year. It's not a flash hotel-but it's all about location and service. Here you have the plainest "home" on the best beach strip- let's face it-how much time do you spend in your room when you have beautiful grounds and a gorgeous beach. Short stroll to Whalers village- no need to have a car. Shuttle buses totake you around-small fee. The place has a beautiful "old world" hawaiian feel to it- the other massive resorts-once inside you wouldn't know whether you're in Vegas, LA or Florida- just big commercial and cold-no atmosphere. If you need a massive pool, waterfalls, slides etc-this is not the place for you. If you want location, atmosphere, service with a smile, manicured tropical gardens and the beach.......this is the place for you. Still can't work out why some people travel all the way to Maui- to sit by a pool. If you're in Kaanapali in Dec- you can actually see the whales swimming through...can't see that at the pool....maybe sometime ; )

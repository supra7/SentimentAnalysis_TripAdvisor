We stayed at the Hyatt last fall and found the resort to be well situated along the walking path on Kanapali to all the other hotels and Whalers Village. It is an older resort but the grounds were very well kept and all the staff very accommodating and friendly. During that period, the hotel was just preparing for renovations in the lobby and main entrance, so there was construction draping present everywhere. We found the food at the hotel on the expensive side, especially the buffet breakfast at the Swan restaurant for what they were serving as compared to many of the all-inclusive resorts we have visited in the Caribbean. Otherwise, the quality of food at the self-serve restaurant by the pool was good. We had a ground floor room which turned out to be convenient when making trips back and forth to the pool. As proof of the superior service we received, my wife accidentally flushed one of her contact lens down the sink. Luckily, she immediately stopped the drain and called concierge, who dispatched a maintenance staff to our room. Within a matter of 15 minutes from the time of her call, my wife's contact lens was retrieved. Now that's service. We also utilized the tennis courts and took a couple of lessons with the resident Pro, whom we found was very knowledgeable in providing pointers to improving our game. Our only minor negative to the property would be parking. Unless you utilize valet parking - which can get expensive if you come and go a number of times throughout the day - there is limited number of free self-parking spots on the grounds. All in all, if you can obtain a reasonable rate for the Hyatt, we highly recommend it.

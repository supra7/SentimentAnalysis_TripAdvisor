Overall, we were very happy with the Bayfront Hilton. We did not choose the hotel; we were there with a convention, but we were very pleased. We enjoyed walking to the Gaslamp District every night for dinner, and enjoyed the convenience of an in house Starbucks for breakfast. We thought the pool and plaza areas were very beautiful, and the large fire pit was very cool too. The decor in the public areas was minimalist and tasteful. On the down side, our room was a little small for the price, and we also were disappointed by the high prices in the business center (computers, printers, copy machines). Most hotels I have stayed in have offered this service for free. We had no problems with cleanliness, nor any problems getting plenty of towels.

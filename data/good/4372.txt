I was surprised by the glowing reviews of the Hyatt. Maybe it was because we had just come from 5 nights at the Halekulani in Honolulu, which was an unbelieveable experience.Pluses: Beautiful landscaping, above average service, nice luau, fun pool, decent to good restaurants, UNBELIEVEABLE beds!!! (I'm seriously considering ordering one.)Minuses: Very small balconies, spacious but dated rooms, small shower and bathroom (we're used to having a big jacuzzi tub and seperate shower at most hotels in a deluxe ocean-front room), no beach to speak of, the pool bar was closed for most of our visit, no fun bars where you can smoke (even the outdoor ones--which should actually be a plus for a lot of people).I think this place is good for families, but wouldn't stay here again personally. We're bummed that we didn't go to the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea. Still enjoyed Maui tremendously--what heaven on earth!!!

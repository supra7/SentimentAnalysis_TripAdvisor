The hotel was very clear, the staff was excellent. The rooms are big enough. The breakfast was very nice. The hotel was outside of the city center but there is a bus stop outside of the hotel and a metro station five minutes walking from the hotel, so there was a way to go without spend a lot of money to the city center

Then don't stay here. People please remember that this is a boutique hotel so the rooms are smaller than "typical" hotel rooms. That being said, we absolutely loved it. The staff were friendly at check in, the location of the hotel is excellent for sightseeing, the room was clean and had modern furniture (well the whole hotel has been modernized) and the amenities were great. They have Aveda bath products in the bathroom, which was a nice touch. The package we booked came with unlimited Valet service and I would recommend that. The Valet workers were friendly, prompt and respectful. The only issue we had with the room was that the toilet ran every 5 minutes or so, which was irritating and needs to be fixed, but we just turned off the angle stop and it stopped the problem. When we needed to flush we just turned the water back on. No big deal. We found it very quiet at night, the other guests were respectful of each other. We used the "pillow menu" and received two pillows that were exactly what we wanted. The rooms have AC which was nice because it was a warm weekend when we were there. When we come back down to Seattle again, we will not hesitate to stay here again.

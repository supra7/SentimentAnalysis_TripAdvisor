This is a great Hotel. Perfect location for a family visit. Right by the water, aquarium, and tourist spots. Highlights are the pools (plural), great gym, 8th floor private park and movies for kids at night. I've also stayed at the convention center Marriott and Hilton and this is better location (unless you're going to a baseball game). Avoid the chains and walk to Little Italy for dinner. Only negative from my stay was weak air conditioning in the room

This hotel was ideally located to a number of prominent local landmarks and the staff were gracious to allow me an early check-in. The room was well appointed with a great view of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. There was a nicely-sized desk and work area. Their green program was nice to see. The discounted cost of internet access for conference attendees was appreciated. The doormen were particularly helpful recommending local restaurants and places to visit. An overall pleasant experience.

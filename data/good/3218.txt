The hotel may be out of the town centre but it is only five stops away from Friedrichstrasse in the city centre (took about ten minutes) by S-Bahn. It's about a five minute walk from the hotel to Bornholmer Strasse S-Bahn station, or you can take the tram two stops if you so wish. The hotel is in a fairly quiet neighbourhood. It's mainly residential so there wasn't much noise at night. That be said, there's not much in the line of activities either. However, Prenzlauer Berg is quite close, ideal for eating, shopping and nightlife, and you can get a tram back afterwards. The room was spacious and cleaned daily, as expected. Staff friendly, happy to talk in English if required.

I stayed in the Wesin Seattle for three nighs in mid-april whil attending an annual meeting in the Washington Convention Center. As a state employee I got a very good rate, much cheaper than the convetion rate at the other hotels. the Westin is well located in downtown Seattle: it is near the monorail station, the the light rail station and it was but a short walk to the convention center. Many restaurants, stores are nearby and the Pike Street Market is about a 15 miniute walk The hotel has two circular towers and I liked being close to the elevator. rooms are well designed but a bit worn in some areas. Hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. The concierge staff is particularly good.. A strange thing about this hotel - a four star residence, are its dining choices. There are two restaurants: one is open for breakfast and lunch and the other for dinnner. However, the breakfast place is a cafeteria (which is not mentioned in the hotel web site). The food is ok - good bakery items, and reasonably priced but the place fills up quickly and sometimes there is no place to sit. The young staff are great but they need more help. I did not eat in the dinner restaurant and it did not seem that busy..

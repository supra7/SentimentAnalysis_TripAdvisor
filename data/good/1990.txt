The westin seattle is in a good location to explore the city. I used priceline to get a good rate and have no complaints. Check in was quick and I had a double room on the 38th floor with amazing views of the bay. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was fine. There is a nice indoor pool as well as a small balcony to sit outside next to the pool area. I would highly recommend the westin to anyone going to seattle, especially if you get a good deal via priceline.

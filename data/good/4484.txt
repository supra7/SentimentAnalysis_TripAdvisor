We stayed here in August 2010 and were very pleased with the location. It's across from the golf course and the view of the mountains was spectacular. The hotel is right on the beach and you can rent cabanas to lie there and enjoy the sound of the waves and even see the divers at sunset from Black Rock. The hotel is a little dated. The first room we had was not very clean and the bathroom fixtures were old and not in good working order. We went down to the front desk and Michelle was very nice and changed our room the next day. The room was upgraded to partial ocean view and was bigger. This one was nicer and we really enjoyed it. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. On site laundry facilities came in handy before our flight home. Kaanapalli Beach Hotel is within walking distance (maybe 5 minutes) from Whalers Village where you can catch "the bus", public transportation to Lahaina where there's lots of good eating places, a Safeway, and souvenir shopping. Recommend Aloha Plate in Lahaina to catch a nice sunset and reasonable portions/prices. We enjoyed Hula Grill and Leilani's in Whaler's Village also. You can get happy hour specials at both for very reasonable prices. Kaanapali Beach Hotel is a good family oriented place to stay with lovely grounds and helpful staff.

We booked an Urban Suite in this hotel apartment for four nights. We were quite satisfied. The hotel is convenient located, one block away from the Crescent street. where there are many restaurants. We did not use the parking service of the hotel, as it was only available for valet parking, and it cost $24 per night. We parked our car at one of the Stationnement EM, which was only about 40 meters away, for $80 for four nights. We found it was easier for us in and out as we wish. The Urban suite we stayed was different from the one showed on the hotel's website; still, the room was clean and spacious. There were a lot of drawers and storage space, pillows, cushions and towels. Also, there are two flat screen tvs, one in the bed room, and one in the living room. In general we were happy with the service of the hotel, however there was some confusion with the bottled water provided on the counter. The first day I checked in, I asked the reception whether the water on the counter was complimentary. I had been told that the one on the counter is free and the ones in the mini bar are not, which I thought it was understandable and it should be. But, we got billed for a couple of times for consumption of the water on the counter. One bottle of water costs $7. After I made a complain, the hotel erased all the charge. Though I did not use the facility, but I had a quick visit of the swimming pool and the gym. It was on the 12th floor. The swimming is indoor with floor to ceiling windows, so it is quite bright, the hot tub is outdoor on the big balcony with a nice view of the skyscrapers and the Mont Royal. We enjoyed our stay at Le Crystal. We would like to stay here next time if we can get a good price again

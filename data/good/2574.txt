I stayed 3 nights at Hotel Max and had a wonderful stay. the room was clean and tastefully decorated. The service is great, from check in to check out we felt like we were in a 5 star hotel. The valet parking was included in our package and very convenient. the hotel is close to good restaurants and cafe's, but a decent walking trip to pikes market/pioneer square.

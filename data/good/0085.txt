Good front desk staff. GREAT housekeeping staff... extremely friendly. I don't necessarily like having the guys at the front entrance though. Good location for business travelers if at a downtown location for work. Fitness center is present but lacking. They offer a deal with a nearby gym, however, it is cheaper to get day passes for $10 at nearby gym, Core fitness. Cool: They have Gold fish in fish bowls with name tags in the hallways! Not so cool: No microwave and no fridge (beside the honor bar one) Tip: Beside a regular location map... be sure to check a topo map as well.

Everything about this hotel was perfect except for one thing: the room smelled a bit strange. It wasn't smoky or musty, but a strange unidentifiable odor. But we quickly adapted and shortly couldn't tell. Other than that, this hotel was exactly what we needed. We used the free shuttle to the airport twice and it was perfect both times. At our request, he dropped us at the light rail station the second time. The beds were comfortable, the shower clean and hot, and the amenities quite excellent for the price. The room included a microwave and a safe for your valuables. The staff was helpful and polite. The included continental breakfast was above average with waffle maker machine, fresh coffee, some fruit, juice, and pastries. I highly recommend this hotel if you're on a budget and all you need is a place to sleep with shuttle and breakfast.

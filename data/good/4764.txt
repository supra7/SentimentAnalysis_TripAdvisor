J207, corner two bedroom condo. Huge view of ocean and golf course. Clean and comfortable. A few things showing wear, sliding door wouldn't lock, and master bath tub. Staff always working on grounds. Clean and well kept. Short walk to our favorite coffee shop, pizza place, and atv tour. Pools clean and uncrowded. Short walk to beach in not bad and good exercize. Covered parking in tight spaces. My new rental van got dented our first night of parking there. Quiet beach, fish out by rocks. Sheraton around the rocks. Major tourist busy with everything you ever, or never wanted. We like quiet, even with our teens. I would go back for two weeks in same unit!

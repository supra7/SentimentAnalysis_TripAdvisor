My Husband and I spent 10 days for our 20th anniversery @ the Ka'anapali beach hotel . It was a once in a lifetime vacation for us . The hotel staff was incredible and very helpful my husband managed to plan our renewal of vows without me knowing with the help of the staff it was unbelieveable. I was suprised to say the least and it was most enjoyable trip ever. We used the hotel to book all our activities. We did everything.. The hotel staff was kind and very helpful. I would recomend this hotel to everyone. If you want a stress free vacation this place is for you.

It was hard to find Hotel Opera Roma but when we did we were welcomed and it was a very comfortable room. Breakfast was very good. We got down there late and they still served us. They stored our luggage for a late dparture and ordered a car to the airport at a very reasonable cost. Hotel Opera Roma is part of Hotel Sonya and if we had known it would have been easier to find. It is walking distance from the station adn all the sights. Highly recommend.

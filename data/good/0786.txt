This is an affordable downtown hotel that has recently been renovated, it appears. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The location is great, but do note that this is right downtown, so there is plenty of noise. I slept just fine with earplugs and the windows closed. If you're there during a heatwave, you may be sorry you chose this hotel. There is no A/C and the portable fans provided in the room are tiny. The hotel has no parking, so expect to pay $15-17 a day in nearby lots.

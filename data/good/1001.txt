We stayed at this hotel on the suggestion of a friend. It was very well located, near to Pikes Market; the staff was very friendly and helpful. If you have Marriot premium status, you get access to the members lounge that has many attractions. The only negtive was the cafe restaurant -- staffing was not responsive and good just mediocre. Eat somewhere else!

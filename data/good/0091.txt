I was with my boyfriend, so we wanted to stay in a nice hotel that was also conveniently located. We were looking for hotels within walking distance to the Public Market (this hotel was just a few blocks away), and also, to other parts of downtown. The room was nice, clean and quiet. However, we thought the hotel staff should have been more up-front about the prices of some of their services. We were given a walk-in rate of $165/night, which was fine. But when we checked out after staying one night, my boyfriend found out the valet parking cost $40. We also had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, which was very good, but it would have been nice if our server had mentioned that the orange juice was not included in the price of the buffet. It was $4/glass! I would recommend this hotel for the location, rooms and ambience. But I would suggest asking about all the extra costs beforehand so that you are not in for any surprises.

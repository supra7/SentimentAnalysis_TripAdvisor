I stayed at this property for a couple days last week for a conference. I was VERY impressed with the staff, very attentive. Buffet food was kept full and was actually quite good, and I have eaten at more conferences than I can count! The lobby was a good distance from the parking & conference area, but they were kind enough to make sure I was on the conference side of the hotel. Room was clean, spacious, and comfortable with lots of pillows and nice beds. Free wifi through the conference. I was able to connect in my room the first night, but not the second. Overall a very good experience!

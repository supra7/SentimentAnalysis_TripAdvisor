Small hotel on a side street next to the drab opera hall. Nothing to look at from the outside but nicely redecorated inside. The room was clean, in good condition, quiet, and had a small balcony which we actually used. The mattresses were foam and super comfortable after long days of walking. Breakfast was very good, and the desk staff very helpful. I would stay here again.

Most areas around US airports have lots of chain motels with little charm or uniqueness. This DoubleTree is almost a resort in its style, and yet right across from the airport. If you want a cut above when staying near Sea-Tac Airport, this is the place. Just be aware that (1) it's not cheap and (2) they charge extra for everything. Our price was $176 per night grand total, about $100 more than nearby chains. The staff was polite and professional. The room was quiet, clean, and fully stocked. It featured full bath, air-conditioning, clock radio, phone, TV (about twenty channels), coffee maker, hair dryer, and in-room clothes iron. Free amenities included airport shuttle, boarding pass print-out kiosk (VERY useful if you have an early flight) wireless internet (barely) in the common areas, and a warm cookie at check-in. Parking is an extra $16, in-room internet an extra $5, and they charge for local calls. On-site was an outdoor pool, spa, restaurant, lounge, laundry room, and gift shop. You can have documents printed on-site via their internet access, but I doubt it's free. The place is quite large, so you'll need a bell hop if you have a lot of luggage. In the morning they had to use the handy-man to perform this task, which doesn't sound right for a large place where people will need to get their luggage to the lobby in a hurry. The staff tried to get me to pay extra for a "balcony view" room, but I can't imagine this is worth anything unless you get a view of Mount Rainier. Note that some "views" are of the airport, and Rainier isn't always visible -- neither of which sounds worth the extra cost. The beds were luxurious and VERY comfy. My spouse and I slept VERY well after we finally decided to go to sleep. You can spend a lot less near Sea-Tac and not get these annoying nickel-and-dime charges. But you won't get anything near as nice so close.

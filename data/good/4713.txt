We booked this hotel having read the reviews on Trip Advisor. The hotel was located to the north of the island, a two minute walk from River de Biaso Water bus stop. The train station is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We recommend coming into Venice by AVTO airport coach to Piazza Roma! You can then take the Water bus and get off after two stops or walk for a further 20 minutes - have you maps ready folks! The Hotel was spotless and the Breakfast buffet was not bad. The air conditioner worked, rooms were beautifully decorated and the bathroom was small but well equipped. High speed internet is available on the first floor only and you must get a password to log in every two hours. This was a little inconvenient The Hotel staff were very helpful, especially Lana who even recommended places to eat and shop!

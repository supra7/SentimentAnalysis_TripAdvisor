Pros: This hotel is very clean, nicely decorated, relatively quiet and the food in the restaurant is delicious. It's also minutes from the airport, yet does not have that "airport hotel" feel. Staff is friendly. Cons: Pricey compared to nearby airport hotels (we paid $200/night). Rooms are small. Indoor pool is nice, but loaded with chlorine (atrium smells like a hot tub). Our daughters' eyes were burning after their swim. Concierge level cocktail hour is just a cash bar on the 8th floor. Food and drinks are not included in the upgrade. Now for the warnings: Do not trust anything the Marriott reservation agent tells you. I made our reservation by calling the hotel directly and being transferred to Marriott's main reservation center. I normally book online, but wanted to know why the rate was so much higher than the last time we stayed at this property. I was told it was because of the holidays (our stay was Jan. 3) and because the hotel was almost completely booked. I was told there were only a few rooms left and I should book immediately. When I told her I am a Marriott Rewards member, the agent very nicely offered to upgrade us to concierge level and she said she'd put us in a corner room since they're larger. Great! But when we arrived, none of that happened. The desk clerk didn't even have any notes in our reservation about that. We asked if the hotel was booked and he said "no" and that it was practically empty!! The reservation agent lied. We asked if he would honor our promise of concierge level and he said he would. We got to our room on the 7th floor, only to find the concierge level is on the 8th floor! The desk clerk lied to our faces. We were not in a corner room and despite the hotel's near emptiness, we were put in a room next to a family with an infant that cried much of the night. We don't chalk this one up to a horrible experience. They were minor problems, but you should be warned that promises made during booking are not taken seriously.

We had a very nice stay at the hotel in early October. We loved the proximity to both Roma Termini and 2 metro stations as well as the easy walking to many of Rome's sights. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was quite nice, having been fairly recently renovated, and was very clean. We liked the breakfast that was offered. There were many choices of things to eat and the coffee was excellent. We would definitely stay here again!

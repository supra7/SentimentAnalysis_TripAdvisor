The lobby looks like something you would find in a Denver Ski Lodge. There are a couple of fireplace's, large bar and a very nice indoor poor area. My only advice is is you are needing to get to sleep early you do not want a room by the pool. The windows are thin and the sound from the pool comes right into your room. Other than that a great place to stay There is a free shuttle to and from the airport. The taxi cost $5 incase you want a taxi instead. There is also a free shuttle to a very large mall about 15 mins away.

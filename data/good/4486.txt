My travel agent highly recommended this hotel for it's value, so after reading tons of reviews I went ahead and booked it. It was as I expected clean and comfortable and a view that is unsurpassed. The ocean view room was as good as some oceanfront rooms I have stayed in before but with the beautiful mountains on the other side and the great courtyard below. You are in the middle of these other higher priced hotels and you get the same views. We loved being able to walk a couple of blocks to Whalers Village for shopping and dinner. Being right next to Black Rock provided lots of snorkeling opportunities. Lots of beautiful fish to see.

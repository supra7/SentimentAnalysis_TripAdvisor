The good: great location, super comfortable beds, wonderful pillows, staff was right there on the spot when I needed something. Downside: maid forgot service items twice out of the six nights I was there(which is why I found out how quick the staff was), and on the last day I could hear the radio in the adjacent room. Also closet/drawer space was minimal, and the bathroom was pretty small. But all in all I was glad I chose it..

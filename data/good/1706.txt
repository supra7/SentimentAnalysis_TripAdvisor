We got a great deal on priceline and were lucky enough to end up at the Edgewater. It's the only hotel on the Seattle waterfront, and about a 10 minute walk to the Space needle, or the other direction to Pike Place Market, and about a 30 minute walk to the ball parks. The room was very large. We didn't get a waterfront view, but had a nice view of the space needle from our room. The workout facility in the hotel is pretty good. Their room amenities guidebook is not very complete, so make sure you ask about charges, and ask about their facility services. Parking was pretty expensive, but probably typical for a large city, and there are 24 hour privileges, which is nice.

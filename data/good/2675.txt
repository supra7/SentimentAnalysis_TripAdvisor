We were 2 couples staying at The Roosevelt Hotel last week. Staff was VERY efficient and friendly. Rooms were spacious with nice sitting area. Could use a little updating (e.g. some stains on bathroom walls, ceiling, etc.) - but overall a nice stay. And the beds were VERY comfortable. Great big screen TV! And the location was fantastic - centrally located in downtown...walking distance from Pike Place Market, Capitol Hill, shopping, restaurants, breweries, etc... And the Link Light Rail (city transit train) stop is merely a block away. It's an "older style" hotel - but it certainly served its purpose - and made for an enjoyable stay in Seattle.

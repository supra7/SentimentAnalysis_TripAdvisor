My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our recent Honeymoon in Istanbul. The hotel is in an excellent location for all the major sights, 5 mins walk from the Topkapi Palace and 10 mins from the Blue Mosque. The street outside is good for bars and restaurants as is the surrounding area. The room was nicely furnished and had a quality feel, the bathroom is great and had a sauna bath and oddly features a window (with blind) between the bathroom and the room. Our room had a balcony but was a bit smaller than the others. The room was generally clean although the hot water had a brownish tinge and my wife claimed there was dust in the corners of the room and under the bed. I didnt notice. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quiet given that it faced onto the street outside which has quite a few late night (but tasteful) bars. The staff were attentive and the service was very good. The breakfast was reasonable and featured a buffet and you could order eggs/omelette. The only downside on the staff was we reserved the turkish bath exclusively apparently but when we went down there were other people about, not sure how they implement this. I would definately recommend the hotel but it is quite pricey. We got a deal online with ~25% off which helped. Probably worth it for the location and quiet rooms as the calls to prayer first thing in the morning can be quite loud. Note that whilst the location (Sultanahmet) is good it is extremely difficult to get there from Sabiha Gokcen airport due to the traffic (budget 2-3 hours drive). If you are flying to attaturk it is probably more convienient.

My wife and I just spent a week at secrets. We had a great time with only a few issues. As a little back ground we travel about four times a year, always warm weather and we stay middle to higher end resorts. First the positives. I had never been to an all inclusive before and was a little concerned about service. I was completely surprized by the service, it was great. From the moment we arrived we were treated well by a very freindly and helpful staff. We had an ocean view room with outdoor tub which was nice. The food was plentiful and good(not great, but good) I though it was great that they would come around the pool during the day with food carts. My only food complaint was I wanted some "traditional" mexican food and I had a hard time finding any. As far as drinks go, you would have to be hiding from staff not to be getting service. The selection was also wide ranging. Again, I cant say enough about the helpful freindly nature of the staff. My only complaints are: You need to get out to the beach by 7:30am or you will be shut out of a beach chair. We found this annoying to say the least. Poeple would put a towel and a book out on a chair at 7:00,not come back until 10:30, leave for a two hour lunch at 12:00 and finally move their stuff at 5:00. There has to be a better way. I dont know if that means cabana boys or each room get their own chairs. Second, Nowhere did I read anything about a dress code at the dinner restaurants. I travel to warm weather climates all the time and I cant remember the last time I needed long pants. I'm not really sure what they were going for, but if you want people to dress up for dinner let them know ahead of time and DONT let men wear jeans. In my opinion jeans and sneaker do not look better than Bermuda short and shoes. All in all it was a very relaxing vacation and we would go back

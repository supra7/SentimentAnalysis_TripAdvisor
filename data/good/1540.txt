The location is great; right behind the Westin & next to a McDonalds, within walking distance to downtown & the monorail. The outside it looks like an older small Motel, but inside it's as good as any mid-level (think Holiday Inn). It has a resturant that's a bit pricy, but the food is good quality and the atmosphere's great with it's wood burning fireplace. Nice place to be during a gray day in Seattle. I booked through my airline so I could get milage points, but I would highly reccommend it to anyone.

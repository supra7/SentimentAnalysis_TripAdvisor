My wife and I stayed over Christmas holiday; the resort wasn't crowded. We stayed in an ocean front room and it was exactly what we wanted; fabulous view and proximity to the ocean/beach. The room automatically came with Preferred Club...the big benefit was free wi-fi. The Club lounge wasn't much to speak of but quite frankly you won't want to take time away from the beautiful pool(s) and beach to go there. The Club's concierge service was absolutely hopeless...everywhere else on the property the service was great. We were really disappointed with the restaurants...most are only open for dinner (not lunch) and they were open on a rotating schedule; therefore, only about three were open each night. We tried the hibachi because of the reviews on this site...the chef's show was great, but unfortunately the food was of poor quality/taste. In general, the food was average; no worse then a Chili's or TGI Fridays, so if you are not fussy about food then you will enjoy. The beach was absolutely beautiful, soft white sand, and clean. Exceptional lounge chairs with shade (if you prefer); you can also rent a cabana (relatively inexpensive). In my view, the pools were heated...somewhere in between warm and chilly; definitely swimmable. The swim out rooms' pools, one felt heated another one didn't...I think it might depend on the sun it gets during the day. The bars were plenty and service was great. I did feel as though I needed to observe them mix the drinks to get the requested top shelf alcohol. The resort Spa was wonderful. Bring $1s and tip a little...if you can afford to stay at a place like this, then you can afford to be generous to those less fortunate!

My husband and I just returned from Maui-we spent 4 nights at Kaanapali. Location is great-beautiful beach, great pool, loved the grounds. Our room was ok-older, could use some re-decorating, but the view was nice. You're really not in the room enough anyhow-- Fun little Tiki Bar, and Tiki Grill for lunch/snacks, etc. Nice jaunt up the beach to many other restaurants, bars, shopping, etc---we enjoyed ourselves immensely-and would go back in a minute! Maui was gorgeous!!

I was very disappointed when I arrived at this hotel to learn there was no beach! The hotel is positioned on the waterfront but there no beach to sit on as it is very eroded. The hotel cannot offer chairs and umbrellas for this setting and we had to go 4 hotels up to the Sheraton and use the public beach. After spending all this money for 6 nights we were extremely disappointed.The rest of the hotel was good except the birds flew in and out of the restaurants while you were eating and would actually land on your table, especially poolside for breakfast. One actually landed on my grandson's plate! I would not go back for these reasons.

Stayed here for one night and it was adequate. I liked that it was across the tracks from the Gaslamp Quarter. Good access with a pedestrian bridge but away from the fray. It was also nice to be on the water and next to an open park. Having a Starbucks and yogurt place on property is a plus. Room was spacious and appointed in the new Hilton fashion. Fantastic view. I can see how this would be the best place to be during a convention. A few disappointments: valet was ridiculously slow, even after calling from the room to bring the car. There were about a dozen valet employees but no sense of urgency to bring my car from the garage which I could have easily walked to and retrieved my car much more quickly. Paid extra to bring a dog and was not provided with the paid-for dog amenities. Had to call housekeeping twice to have them delivered.

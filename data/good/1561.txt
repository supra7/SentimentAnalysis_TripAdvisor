The location was extremely convenient to downtown Seattle with the Washington State Convention Center and Pike Place market both a brief stroll from Hotel Andra. Dining choices seemed abundant and I would note in particular that the Dahlia Lounge is located just across the street (the freshly made donuts for desert are superb). My room was spacious and well furnished and I'd note the internet supported my VPN (which is not always the case). My single complaint with the accomodations was the fitness center, which is tiny (one bike, one treadmill, one eliptical machine, and a few dumbbells). While the hotel also apparently offers access to both a local yoga studio and a gym (at a separate fee) as well as running options, I did not have the time this trip to explore the former two and rainy November weather precluded running (for me at least).

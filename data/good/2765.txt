This fit the bill for the short time we we're using the room. Close to the airport, clean and quiet. It's not fancy or flashy or luxurious, but if you're looking for something convient for catching that early morning flight that isn't going to break your wallet or creep you out, this will be perfect. I could never get internet working, but we we're at room for so little time it didn't really matter.

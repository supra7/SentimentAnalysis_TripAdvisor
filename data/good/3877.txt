Our Gps sent us through some less inviting streets but upon arrival on the Park Boulevard our doubts were swept away. Great entrance on the first floor with very attentive valet and bell staff. Checking in was smooth and the Hilton Honors counter very efficient. Large room with great views. Bathroom a little small but practical. Missing: mini bar and make-up mirror. Breakfast buffet very varied, good service filling up coffee and juice. Gaslamp District and Waterfront Village within walking distance (5 mins). Coronado ferry a few steps from the hotel. Despite a modern, even sterile architecture of the hotel, you still feel at home. Great stay.

The lobby is attractive but a bit small and noisy. The room itself seemed newly redecorated/remodeled. It was not too big but had a very comfortable king bed with lovely duvet and many pillows. The bathroom was luxury level with granite countertops, attractive large framed mirror. There is a free computer off the lobby for printing boarding passes. The Hilton is a block away so you can easily walk over for their restaurant. It is a large steak house type place but there are other choices as well. As noted here, the parking is a ripoff. We dropped off our rental car early to avoid the overnight charge.

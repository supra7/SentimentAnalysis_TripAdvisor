Booked this hotel for the PAX Prime convention. It's just a few blocks from the convention center and the Public Market. The web pics make it look very modern, but it's a big old 60s looking building. The rooms do actually look like the web pics though. Great location, good price. Rooms were clean and fresh. Internet is slow, but it's free! Free morning n ewspaper. Restaurant on site, but we didn't use it. Most of the other guests seemed to be either cruise bound, foreign (including backpackers), or fellow convention attendees. I'd definately stay there again.

We stayed at the Hotel Andra on July 18 to the 22, 2009 for four nights. Great get away for four nights and we were completely satisfied with the Hotel, Staff and the City of Seattle. The room (908) we checked into was bright, comfortable furnishings and size over looking the main street with a view of some of downtown Seattle. The staff at the Hotel Andra were very friendly and accommodating from check in, to advice on sight- seeing attractions, and places to go for meals all within walking distances from the Hotel. Everything that you would want to see is within walking distance from the Hotel Andra such as The Market, different tours and yes (for us Canadians) Macys and Nordstrom. Once again the staff recommended different tours and they made the reservations and just added the cost onto our room, and we certainly could not sign off without mentioning the food. If you stay (or even if you do not stay at the Hotel Andra) you should try the meals and especially the breakfast at Lola's Dinning room in the Hotel Andra. Try the eggs, pork-maple sausage, smashed garlic fried potatoes. I personally found this one of the best. Some of the best meals are all within walking distance from the Hotel Andra. If you have the time try all of Tom Douglass restaurants  we hit most of them and they were great. The only reason I would not give this Hotel a 5 star plus rating is, I found the washroom a little on the small size and the air conditioning made a little noise, we give the Hotel Andra a 4 plus star rating. The Hotel is old but has all been refurbished to a modern decor and the bed was a delight. Would we stay at the Hotel Andra again a big positive yes.

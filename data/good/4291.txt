My wife and I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Hyatt Regency Maui. It is far from the best ever hotel as one reviewer proclaimed. Certain areas of the hotel appear to be getting a bit tired. The rooms are the exception though as they are quite large and look to be recently remodled with updated furniture, bedding, etc. The bathrooms are about as small as any hotel I've ever stayed in. The grounds are very nice- beautiful garden areas, great views throughout the property, huge pool, and very comfy poolside lounge chairs. The issue that keeps me from giving this resort a better review is the parking situation. There is a small lot in the front and a larger lot in the back. After our second day, the front lot became closed off due to what we were told was for some type of large corporate event. So, everyone was fighting for spots in the back, and available space was impossible to find at certain times of the day. The result- you have to use the $12/day valet parking. We were given no alternative so we discussed the matter with the front desk and they eventually wiped the charges from our bill. Another concern we had was that of smoking on the lanai. We were on a non-smoking floor (which means no smoking on the lanai as well) and our "neighbors" seemed to be smoking on their lanai whenever I walked outside and the smell of smoke filled our room. It ruined the lovely floral smells we associate with Hawaii. I highly recommend Swan Court for breakfast with the exception of the very grumpy omelette chef. Seriously- I don't know if I've ever encountered a more unhappy looking person in my life... It was hard for us not to compare this Hyatt to the Grand Hyatt in Poipu Kauai where we stayed a year and a half ago. The Hyatt Regency Maui falls short of the Kauai location in every facet. Overall, it was a good stay and is ideal for all ages.

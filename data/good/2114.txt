I just stayed 2 nights at the Westin Seattle (9/13-15). Had a great room on the 32nd floor, with a nice city view (I'm a Platinum Starwood member). My pet peeve with hotels is noise, so a connecting door to another room or excessive hallway noise is always a big downer for me. This was one of the quietest hotels I've stayed in. Possibly because my room was almost all the way around the tower from the elevator, but the lack of a long linear hallway seemed to make it very quiet. Loved the floor to ceiling windows (you need all the light you can get in Seattle). Bathroom was fairly average, with a pretty shallow tub (another pet peeve). The bed was angled diagonally into the room, and had a nice overbed light incorporated into the headboard with a dimmer switch. Nice touch, as I could actually read my book by this light (as opposed to the usual 40 watt bulb that is too dim to read by). You had to angle the TV over a bit to see it from the bed, which was a bit akward, but OK. The bed did not seem to be the typical Heavenly Bed mattress, it seemed much firmer, without the pillowtop mattress. It did have the Heavenly bedding sheets/comforter though. I was there for a meeting, and I must say the food we received in all the meeting rooms (breakfast, morning and afternoon snacks, and lunch), was terrific. Very healthy fare, and very tasty. I attend LOTS of business meetings in hotels, and the food at this Westin was some of the best I've had. The carpet in the elevator and hallways was a little worn and some stains, but this is a huge property that is obviously quite busy..... Staff were very accomodating....... all in all, a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend this Westin.

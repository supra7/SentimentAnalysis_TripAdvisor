We booked our rooms through Expedia during a "receive a gas card w/ stay" promotion. Rooms were really clean, staff was friendly and professional. Buffet breakfast was in a spacious oceanview diningroom. Swimming pool area was nice, especially since it literally overlooks the bay. Had a nice selection of breakfast items, plus made to order omelets. I just hate having to pay for hotel parking, but that isnt any different with large hotel chains. At $25 per day, it was less than many other hotels. Overall, we a nice experience, and would return again.

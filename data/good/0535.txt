The Marqueen is an excellence accommodation experience in Seattle. The Toulouse Petit Kitchen is across the street and an absolute must for breakfast. We walked to the Seattle Ceter and saw the Needle, experienced the Experience music project and caught a couple of basketball games at the Key Arena. The people at the Marqueen are very good people, helpful, genuine and human. Stay here if you can!

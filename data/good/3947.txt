Stayed five nights for a conference. Paid to upgrade room to 16th floor on opposite side from bridge view so I wouldn't be looking at and listening to the huge Dole container ship being unloaded and loaded - had a view of the Bay and over the roof of the Convention Centre. The hotel still feels new - it's clean and not cruise or convention worn...yet. The bed was very comfortable, somewhat limited tv channels when you're not interested in sports. The bridge over towards the baseball stadium is still not finished so you have to walk alongside the Convention Centre to 5th before you can cross the tracks. As a solo traveller, I didn't really want to be out and walking around after dark as there are a lot of street people hanging around but not as aggressive as the ones in Seattle. I ate in the sports bar twice, first time the food was good, second time so so. You can't access it from the hotel which is very strange, same with the Starbucks. I ate dinner in the Vela and found my food tasteless and expensive - having the discount coupon made it slightly more palatable -- and you can look at the Dole container ship when you're put in a not prime seating area as I was. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. A little too chilly to use the pool and you're staring at and listening to the container ship being loaded/unloaded. Make sure you take all your toiletries with you - I paid $5 for a travel size tube of toothpaste at their Gift Shop. I didn't feel like walking for 15/20 minutes to a drug store. $20/day for the "better" wireless access is downright extortionate - I needed it to access my work VPN. Went to the zoo, took a taxi there and the bus back [$2.25]. Zoo admission is now $40. SuperShuttle was the most efficient I've encountered, $16.00 round trip, they showed up on time, were extremely professional, left a message on my cell to remind me of my return trip.

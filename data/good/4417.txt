We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for two nights during our recent trip to Maui to attend a wedding at the Maui Sheraton next door. The room was nice, but nothing to brag about. The bed was extra soft, not my favorite. After being at the beach for a few days I was impressed with how well the staff manages to suck up the ridiculous amount of sand that you track into your room. The best part of the hotel is the beautiful grounds and the fact that it backs straight up ka'anapali beach which is AWESOME. When you check out they give you a kukui net lei, which was actually pretty cool. Overall, a good experience and we would stay their again.

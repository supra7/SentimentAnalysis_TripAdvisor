I recently attended a conference in Seattle, and was pleasantly surprised with my hotel selection given it was not in the conference's block of preferred hotels. Hotel Vintage Park was very quiet, in an excellent location, and the room was spectacular. However, I am not sure if it is the area or the individuals, but to me if I am paying $800+ I expect the front desk staff to treat me with respect. Unfortunately, with each contact they seemed very snotty and did not go out of their way at all to be helpful.

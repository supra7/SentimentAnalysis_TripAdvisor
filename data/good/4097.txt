Lovely, accommodating, from every step of the way. Gorgeous, distinctive grounds and pet residents - including flamingos, swans and penguins. Who knew??? Japengo restaurant was extraordinary. Poolside grill was okay. Inside "expensive" brunch location - okay, but not really worth the extra time and having to dress for it. Our last night on property we planned on dining at Japengo for a 3rd time, only to find it was closed that evening for a private event. The poolside grill wasn't exactly the "last night ambience" we were looking for, so we went inside to the more formal restaurant where brunch was served, only to find it so understaffed in the bar area while we waited for a table, that we opted to leave the property.

Stayed here with husband and 2 teenaged children for 4 nights in June. This was our third trip to Rome and we choose this hotel for location and also because family rooms were available. Firstly, I really struggle with the concept that this is a hotel - I consider it to be a b&B. What you are buying is a room with breakfast facilities in the basement - there is no bar, seating areas and despite the misleading pictures on the web site, THERE IS NO TERRACE!. The picture shown is a terrace from one of the rooms. Had I known the hotel had no terrace I would not have chosen to stay here. We booked with "Easy to book.com" and they assured me that the room had double bed and queen size sofa bed so could accomodate 4 people. However, this was not the case as the sofa bed was single. The hotel staff provided another single bed but this resulted in really cramped conditions. In addition, room only had one single wardrobe which had a pull out rail, which meant we couldn't unpack for the entire stay. In short, location could not be faulted, but i would not choose to stay here again. Much preferred Colonna Palace. Probably the only hotel I have ever stayed in where I have not been asked on check out how our stay was - yes staff could learn a lot about customer service. When we enquired about transport to airport, they offered us hotel car at a special rate - 15 euros more than we had paid on way there! Book your airport transfers in advance with Rome cabs - they really provide an excellent service.

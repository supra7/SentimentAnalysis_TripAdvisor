I agree with all the good things reported - great location, friendly staff, good-sized room, etc. however I did think the wine hour was a bit on the tacky side. A glass of wine and not a nut, pretzel or piece of cheese to go with it? For a hotel of this caliber, I think that was surprising. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay, took the light rail from the airport, explored the city on foot and had a great time.

The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel has always been a go-to for us when visiting Maui; mostly because of the ocean-front location on the main drag in Kaanapali. Youre short walk from Whalers Village where all the shopping and dining are, and black rock is just in front of the Sheraton, next door with Lahaina just minutes down the road. There are two restaurants on property but we usually ate at our favorite local eatery, Aloha Mixed Plate. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean but definitely dated, and the pool is a joke, but at least youre right on the sand! When in Maui, one should ALWAYS choose the beach over the pool anyways! The outdoor pool/tiki bar makes killer Mai Tais and there were always Hawaiian activities happening on the property. Snorkeling gear, paddle boards, beach loungers, etc can also be rented in front of the hotel. The rooms are nice but again, dated and in need of some renovation. Theyre clean and will do if you spend minimal time in your room. King rooms also have a twin size day bed in them. Just a heads-up, they also do not have room service. We love this hotel and are usually low-maintenance when in Maui so the lack of amenity is not a big deal to us. We always return because the Kaanapali Beach Hotel has great rates for the location.

We just spent 6 days at the KBH. It is, indeed, the "most Hawaiian" of all the hotels on that stretch of beach.... and has the best chunk of that beach as well. It is not a big fancy resort type place, but is quiet, with beautiful grounds, very nice rooms, a good staff, good food, and reasonable (for the location) prices. We would recommend it for anyone looking for something other than the "full resort experience".

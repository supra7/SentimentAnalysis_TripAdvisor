The hotel is situated approximately 10 minutes walk from Stazione Termini (where the bus from the airport terminates). This was my first visit to Rome and I found the hotel difficult to find from the directions given - the hotel is not 'exactly in front of the famous Opera House of Rome' as stated in the hotel literature. It is more like if you are standing looking at the entrance to the Opera House the hotel is located in th street running down the left hand side of the Opera House (look for Hotel Centro sign). However the hotel was in a good location with a selection of restaurants within walking distance and one of the many hop on hop off buses 'bus stop' is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel - it took us approximately 25 minutes to walk to the Colloseum. The hotel staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. The hotel room was very clean with good facilities - (whirlpool) bath/shower, TV, tea/coffee facilities, mini bar and small safe. Breakfast was a selection of cereal, bread, meat, egg, tea/coffee/juice and pastries. I threw my coin in the Trevi Fountain so will hopefully return to Rome one day and I would be more than happy to stay at the Hotel Opera Roma again.

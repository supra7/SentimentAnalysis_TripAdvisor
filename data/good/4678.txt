My husband and I spent our honeymoon at this hotel in August '04. It was a great choice for us because we didn't need something really fancy. We were happy to have a clean, well maintained hotel to come back to at night. Instead of spending the outrageous rates at the larger hotels down the beach we spent our vacation funds on romantic dinners and excursions. The staff at this hotel were always friendly and willing to help out. As far as the food, we bought the breakfast package and were able to find enough choices at the Mixed Plate restaurant for breakfast all week. That's about the only meal I would advise at that restaurant, though. The hotel has great pool-side food (although a little pricey) and I strongly recc. the terriyaki burger. We tried the more formal restaurant once and had average food and similar service. The pool is nice for families but we weren't over-run by children which was nice for us (we were on our honeymoon after all). And there were many lounge chairs around the pool and the surrounding green space. The beach in front of the hotel is the best for miles and the snorkleing right off the beach (black rock) is outstanding. We made the mistake of paying for the $75/person snorkle trip to Molokini and ended up seeing many more fish and 7 giant sea turtles for free at Black Rock. Over all a very memorable trip, helped in part by this nice hotel. One more thing, believe everyone when they say the best show in Hiawaii (and maybe anywhere) is Warren and Annabelles Magic Show.

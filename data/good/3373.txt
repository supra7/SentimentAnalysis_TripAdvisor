We spent 7 days at secrets for our honeymoon, but it stormed for all but two of them. The facilities are kept spotless. Our room was great, but on the edge of the property over looking the beach, and the ugly property line. Hot tub on the balcony was good to look at but not quite as easy to use. Service was excellent. Very friendly bartenders, servers, etc. Food at the restaurants was the best all inclusive food I've ever had. Room service food was exactly the same as any other all inclusive room service. Late night entertainment was Very limited. The spa facility was beautiful, massage was great, but pedicure was below par. Good resort, I would recommend it if you get a very good deal.

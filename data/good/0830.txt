You will not find a better place to stay at comparable prices in Seattle. Staff are very helpful, rooms are very clean and the hotel itself is charming and interesting. Very close to Downtown Seattle, bus lines, the ferries and only a few short blocks north of Pike Place Market. If you are looking for plush towels and jacuzzi's, stay elsewhere. If you are looking for historical ambience, a staff that cares and to save yourself some money, the Moore cannot be beat. You can tell they are really trying to make this a well loved place to stay and at the rates charged, it's hard not to love this old beauty of a hotel.

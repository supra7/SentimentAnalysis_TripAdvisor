I added the $1 breakfast deal. In truth, the breakfast voucher is only worth $11 credit in the restaurant. I had egg whites, tomato, toast, juice, and coffee. The cost was $24! With my breakfast voucher I still owed $14... This was NOT a good deal. (the hotel did remove the full charge for the breakfast after complaining, but I did not use my other two vouchers for my other two nights stay after my first costly experiance). The hotel is great, the restaurant is not.

We stayed here on the way to an Alaska Cruise. They offered a special with a Towncar airport pickup and drop off the next day to the cruise ship. It was on time. If you are going on an Alaska Cruise this is a great place to stay for night before the cruise. Brad was very accommodating in helping get all of our party to the hotel even though we had different flight times. This is a historical hotel built in 1918 so do expect all the modern amenities but the location and the staff make up for any shortcomings. Very convenient to all the main tourist attractions of Seattle and there is a 24 hour grocery store just up the street that has all kinds of healthy organic food and produce. One of the desk clerks Devin is a photographer and he had lots of tips on the best places to take great shots of Seattle. He also had a creative solution for a member of my party that needed to hook up a piece of medical equipment. Remember this is an older building. The rooms were clean and even though there is a busy street outside there was little noise in the rooms even with a window open. I suspect it could get noisy after an event at the sports arena down the street. Lots of nice restaurants in the area within one to two blocks.

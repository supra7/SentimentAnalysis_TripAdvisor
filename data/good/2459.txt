Remember SNL's Dieter (Mike Myers)? That's the character who came to mind when we thought about who designed this place. Contemporary throughout... felt like we should all wear black, even the hallways were barely lit. The value is comparable to every other downtown hotel...pricey. It's in a good location. We walked everywhere from Chinatown to the Space Needle. The piers & Pike Market are easily walkable. Every person from the front desk, concierge, luggage people, housekeepers, etc was friendly & helpful. The beds are incredibly comfortable, & the room was clean. The elevators are turbo-charged... no waiting. Expect to pay a lot if you want to use the services from local dialing, in-room movies, breakfast, parking, etc. If you can afford it, it's a nice comfortable, helpful, friendly, trendy stay.

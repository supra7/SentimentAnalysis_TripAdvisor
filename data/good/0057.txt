LOVED this hotel. Staff - amazing. Room - amazing. Location - perfect. Paid completely up front for four nights at this hotel over New Years. Came home to find a mystery charge from the hotel. When I called the hotel, not even they could explain it, could not FIND it, and told me to DISPUTE it. Several months later, I was told this was a room no show charge. Hard to believe we'd no show for ONE night during our prepaid FOUR night stay. We are still fighting with the hotel. This has really left a bad taste in our mouths for this place which we were dying to get back to. Our credit card had to be closed out, and we are still fighting this charge which no one at the hotel can explain other than saying it was for a now show (did I mention we were there in another room at the time). Just plain frustrated and worn out....

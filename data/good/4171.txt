hyatt has done a terrific job making family friendly (i.e. kid friendly) resorts. I've written nice reviews about their resort in San Antonio and Albuquerque. Their hotel on kaanapali beach on maui is no different: plenty of activities, geared to keeping your children engaged and entertained. Fishing, hair braiding, belly flop contests, gratis popsicles, simon says, hula lessons...all free for the kids. The staff folks are terrific. The hotel itself is nice enough so that you're comfortable, but not so nice that you feel like you're in a very rich person's home and you're afraid to touch anything (or let your kids touch anything!). The open air atrium features exotic birds, penguins, and koi. The pools are nicely designed: a smaller pool with slides, fountains, and adjacent "sandbox" and a bigger pool (connected through a tunnel with waterfalls) which is less kid oriented. The beach is very limited- not much sand to speak of, mostly a shore break (not very body or boogie board friendly). If you're looking for a nice, wide, calm beach to hang out on, I would not stay here. Given the overall atmosphere, I don't think I'd recommend this hotel to honeymooners or couples looking to get away. You might want to try a quieter, less crowded, more low key venue. My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that the hyatt is pretty crowded. There are a lot of people around all the time. It can get a little bit hectic (pool chairs get reserved, no parking spots, lines for towels, etc). But all in all, this is an excellent place to take a fun, family activity- oriented vacation.

We just relocated back to Seattle and needed affordable accomadations for a few days. We read the reviews and were scared. It was the best value in the area we needed to be, so we booked. The young lady on the phone was very professional. She even helped us with an apartment locator service. We checked in and found the hotel to be under new management. They are currently renovating and getting rid of the ridiculous color it was before (pink,teal and burgandy) The staff was wonderful. The rooms need some minor work but nothing big. They were clean and that was most important. The hotel is 2 blocks from the space needle. We could see it from our room. All and all we had a good experience and would stay there again. I believe the new management really cares about the property and and believe things will only get better.

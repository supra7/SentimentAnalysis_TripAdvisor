Stayed here for 7 days in early September on business, stayed previously about 6 years ago so it was interesting to return and see if the W flag still flys proudly here. Had a wow room on 15th floor facing the sea (well sort of through some buildings) but it was a good south facing view. However room was looking tired, furniture was edgy, worn, aircon noisy. Generally though the W was pretty good, Fire & Earth restaurant still first class. The one thing though I must speak about is the truly awful, surly, attitude ridden bar staff. its not exactly the biggest bar in the world but I sat here with friends and it would have been easier to get arrested than get an attentive bar service.

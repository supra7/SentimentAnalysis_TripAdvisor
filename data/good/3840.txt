The rooms were small but very modern, clean and neat. The location was perfect, near bus, metro and train, all 500 meters away and very quite place, we didn't have any problems sleeping at night. The service was excellent, everything we asked we had it with no complaints. The breakfast was excellent, every morning it had a buffet with lots of goodies. The hotel wasn't expensive at all. I totally recomend it and I would stay there again.

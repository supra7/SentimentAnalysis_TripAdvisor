We stayed for 3 nights at the Crowne Plaza in February 2009. We were upgraded on arrival and the room we were given was lovely. It was nice, clean and spacious. The location of the hotel was great. It was a short walk to downtown seatlle, pike market and the space needle monorail station. There are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. We would reccommend the Brooklyn (great steak) and Wild Ginger restaurants which are both just a short walk.

This resorts has such beautiful grounds, typical of Hyatt Resorts, one of our favorite hotel choice and this is no exception. Interesting flowers and animals completed the grounds along with pineapples in the open lobby. We spent three nights at the Hyatt. Service was just ok, nothing special, which is not typical Hyatt. They did however send up a bottle of wine for our 25th. The room was clean. We upgraded to the Regency Club and the service in there was much better. We did not eat at the hotel other than breakfast and the luau. Breakfast in the Club Level was good. The Luau, was just ok. The food not great and not alot of choices. I have been to better. We went in to Lahaina twice to eat. Lots of restaurant choices. The first time, we drove and and the second time took the bus from Whales Village, only a dollar each way. It is expensive to park in town. We took the Road to Hana, I agree, Garden of Eden is a rip off, dont bother stopping, save the 10.00 per person. The pools were great, but crowded and lots of kids. However, it is a family resort. Hyatt does not have much of a beach, most has been washed away. But just walk up the beach a little towards the Westin and the beach is better. It was great sitting on the beach during sunsets. Take the stroll up to Black Rock for the sunset. It's only about a 15 minute walk. Stop at Whalers Village along the way, they have all kinds of upscale shop and places to eat, get coffee or ice cream. They also have an ABC store. This hotel is a good all around resort for everyone, honeymooners, singles, families, and seniors. Would love to bring the kids here. Our stay at the Hyatt was fabulous, as Hyatt's usually are. We would come again back for sure.

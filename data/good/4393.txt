We stayed for 3 nights in the ocean front suite with our 3 kids, ages, 10, 19, and 21. The room was very spacious we had a comfortable queen bed and also a twin /day bed. The back room had a double as well as the brought in a roll away bed since my boys, on of them 6'3 didn't want to share a double bed. There was lots of closet space, though the shower was on the small side it sved it's purpose. There was a coffe pot and a mini refrigerator that came in handing for morning breakfast items on our Lanai. We had a ground floor unit that I loved since we could walk righ out to the Lanai as well as a grassy area where we could lounge in the Lounges chairs right outside our room. This is an older hotel without all the Resort amities so don't come expecting a fancy resort. The room did have a little of the older island hotel smell but overall the room was very clean. This is a hotel with a great location, rooms where you don't have to hike a mile to get to the beach. We loved sitting outside in the mornings and evenings watching the sun rise and set with views of Black Rock and of the island of Lanai. Staff was very helpful and friendly. We have stayed at 3 other resorts on this stretch of beach and this is now are favorite Ka'anapali beach hotel. Cose to Black Rock and Whalers Village, with a great view from our room.

This hotel is in a great location and comes with free WIFI. The rooms are clean and rather modern. although the rooms are small, the bathroom is unbearably small, roughly 6ft by 4ft. lets just say when you need to use the toilet, you may need to move your legs around the sink. the only other issue is the aircon - heating unit. We went in April and the room did not require any heating but the ventilation (through the window) will hit your face as you lay in bed, making it quite chilly in the middle of the night. I would stay at this hotel again, but I dont think I would stay here longer than a few days. Overall a good hotel and obviously recently refurbished.

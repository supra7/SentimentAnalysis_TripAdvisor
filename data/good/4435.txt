No wonder this hotel has so many great reviews and so many repeat customers. Of the three places we stayed on Ka'anapali Beach, hands-down this was my favorite. It's not the fanciest for sure. But in terms of cleanliness, value, and comfort, this is a winner. Our family reserved two ocean front rooms, adjoining. Our balcony was SO CLOSE to the water. Unbelievable! The staff at this hotel could definitely teach hospitality lessons to some 4 and 5 star hotels we've visited. Wonderful staff! Loved them! We ate at the restaurant once for breakfast and it was alright but not great. The little grill there, though was a great place to find reasonably priced, decent food--especially for my kiddos. The beach outside the hotel is the BEST of all the beaches we tried. We played in the surf for hours and it never got old. Also, we loved that we could get free beach towels from the little kiosk. No hassle, either. So nice to be able to trade in towels and not track a bunch of sand into our hotel room. We will definitely be back!

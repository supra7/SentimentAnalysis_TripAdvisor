Stayed in London for 3 days during roundtrip through GB, it's on picadilly line, so we've reach it easily from airport. 70 min by underground, plus 7-10 min walk. Finsbury park nearby (wasn't there, but take a look - can be fun to bikers or family with children). Breakfast fairy good - everything you expect is in quantity. Ham, cheese, 3 toast machine, juice from packs, milk from cans, cornflakes and musli (right?), tea, jam of 4 kind and something i forget about :) And good view through full height windows and plenty of space in dinning room. Living room quite big, we've live on 2nd floor with WC upstairs - maybe not suitable for someone. WC not big, but ok. Traditional UK sink with 2 faucets, shower has one arm, though. Receptionist give us EURO-UK adaptor, fan - many thank to him. Our window was look at street, we've keep 'em opened and it was quiet. More noise come from door.

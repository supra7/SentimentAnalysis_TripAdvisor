I stayed here for a couple of days during CTIA in October. The hotel is at an awesome location. It's right by the water, convention center, and a short walk to the gas lamp district. The bar and lounge is very nice. Staff was really friendly and helpful - I forgot to bring toothpaste and they brought one up for me right away. The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds were also super comfy. It's also about a 10 minute drive to the airport. This is a good hotel to stay at whether you are in San Diego for business or for fun!

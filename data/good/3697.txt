The hotel is on a pedestrian only street just yards from the Trevi Fountain. We found the room big enough for two ladies with a terrace that looked out on the street and one window that opened onto the rooftops. The bath was spotless but no place to put your "stuff". The breakfast was your usual hotel fare , eggs, cheese, meat, pastry, cereal etc. I must say that everyone in the hotel was always very corteous to us , answered all our requests, called taxis and made reservations. This was our most expensive hotel on our trip and I think the room could use some sprucing up( the two lights on the wall on either side of our headboard were loose and we had to prop them on the headboard so they wouldn't fall over and the bracket that held the hairdryer was loose. We would stay there again if we could book it for less.

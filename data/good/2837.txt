I stayed at this hotel for two nights to attend a conference. The room was very comfortable and the hotel layout and conference space was convenient. I ate several times at the hotel, for breakfast and for a late dinner at the lobby bar, and all the meals were fine. This was a very pleasant hotel to stay at and I would recommend it to my friends.

i stayed in this hotel for 7 nights Aug 2009, the rooms were spacious bath was fine very very quite in corridors, breakfast was just great i love sausages. i asked the guys to fix som leak in the bathroom (i needed to talk to three of them then they fixed it, internet was not free at all looks like Dubai is far behind in free high speed wireless internet services in hotels. I called and went to the reception for a wake up call at 6 am (departure to the airport) thank god i used my cell phone alarm, no one even bothered. All in all it was great stay if i would be back i would love to try another one

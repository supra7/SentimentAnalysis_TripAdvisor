We stayed at the Hyatt in February 2008 and liked it so much we came back for my birthday in October of the same year. The staff bent over backwards to give us a room in the location we wanted. Brunch was included in our package and while pretty similar each day, it was always good. The service in the restaurants on site was prompt and the food delicious. The grounds are well maintained and we never had any problems finding a lounge chair at the pool. The location is perfect for walking to Whaler's Village or just down the beachwalk. Lots of choices of restaurants along the way. I am looking forward to my next visit to the Hyatt, hopefully in early 2009!

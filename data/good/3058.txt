I stayed at this Hilton because I had to catch a 7:00 AM flight from Seattle to Los Angeles the next morning. I was able to turn in my rental car the night before, because this Hilton runs a shuttle to the airport 24/7. The hotel is a four story building on a main road very close to the airport... not your usual high rise. When I arrived at the hotel, I found the staff at the front door and front desk to be exceptionally helpful and friendly. Before going up to my room, I used the complimentary business center (two computers and a working printer) to check-in to my flight the next day. Room service for dinner was expensive and mediocre in quality. Suggest you go elsewhere. I did have a couple of maintenance issues... a broken, hanging fluorescent bulb in the bedside lamp (possible fire hazard?), and a loose faucet handle in the bathroom. I reported the bulb, of course. Otherwise the room was nice enough. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

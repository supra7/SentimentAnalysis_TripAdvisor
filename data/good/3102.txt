The room was on the second floor with a view of the trees showing the Pacific Northwest fall colors. It had a comfortable Sleep number King sized bed. Room had a desk and the free Internet service worked fine. Bathroom had a great shower with tremendous water pressure. I really like it. Room was clean, and good. Hotel gave free USA Today on the weekday and a Sunday Seattle Times. Location is very near SEA airport but heard no aircraft noise. Noise form other rooms was limited. Overall, a good weekend stay. Price was very inexpensive using AAA discount.

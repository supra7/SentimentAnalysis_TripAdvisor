I didn't expect much with the price being so reasonable. But this is what I got. QUALITY service, quality friendly people, clean room, close to the airport BUT quiet. Great breakfast. Would I recommend this to my best friend? YES in fact she was with me and would come as well, I would recommend this to my child as well. Good job. I must remember this. Wi-fi, cleanness, reasonable, great breakfast, service. Nice work.

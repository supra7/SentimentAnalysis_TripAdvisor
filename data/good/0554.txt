A friend of ours from Seattle found this hotel for us. It is located on Queen Anne neighborhood and within walking distance of Space Needle and some of the museums nearby as well as the "Ride the Ducks". You can also take the monorail from there to downtown for $2. There is a bus that stops near the hotel. There were several good restaurants within a block or two, including a great bakery and a block away was a24 hour grocery market and a drugstore. The hotel is in an older rennovated building. The room had 2 queen beds, a kitchen with bench, a sitting area with internet connection, and a bathroom. The beds were fairly comfortable but they squeaked whenever you moved. The wooden floor also squeaked when you walked on them. It was hard for the doors not to slam shut, so you could hear other doors slam, just the way they were built. It was not a problem for us, but there is no elevator. If you have any problems with older stairs, you want to be sure to get a room on the first floor. Do not count on the continental breakfast. It was only tea and coffee with croissants and oatmeal/breakfast bars. I wouldn't even have minded having croissants, except these were not very good ones. There wasn't anything to my son's liking for breakfast, so we ended up buying cereal and milk at the market. This is a boutique motel, so there is no swimming pool, hot tub, etc. There is a nice coffee shop attached to the building. There is only valet parking, which will add to your hotel bill. I believe there is room service from nearby restaurants, but we didn't use it. If you want to stay in this location, this is a good choice. I believe there is only one other hotel in this area.

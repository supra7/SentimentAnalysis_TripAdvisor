We stayed at the Hyatt from 12/10-12/16, on the Regency Club level in Atrium Towers. The service was really great, starting with our bellman Russell, and ending with Keith in the Regency Club. Any requests we had during our stay were granted & facilitated quickly. Everyone seemed to use our names when greeting us which was really impressive considering this is a huge hotel. So you know the perspective I am writing from, we are a couple in our late 40's & travel for business & pleasure a lot, so our expectations are high. We also stayed in Wailea for 4 days before coming to the Hyatt. I have to say we really preferred the Wailea area over this area, & a smaller resort, but that being said the Hyatt was a very enjoyable place to stay if this is the area you want to be in. It seems to be very family oriented & much more commercial than Wailea though. Things to do & things we didn't think were worth it: Mama's Fish House is one of the finest dining experiences we have ever had. The setting & the food were just wonderful! You need to go! It is expensive but worth it! Nick's Fishmarket's food was good, but the service was not. It seemed like the management lacked caring and experience. Pacifico was just wonderful too! If you plan to snorkel the crater, we had a blast with The Four Winds crew & Capt. John! They are so much fun & really seem to enjoy what they do! Snorkel Black Rock & go to the Sheraton for the torch lighting & dive. Kapalua Plantation course & restaurant were just awesome! Be sure you take the drive past Kapalua on the 2 lane road & see some of the incredible beaches. I have never seen water that color & they are some of the prettiest wildest waves I've ever seen in my 4 trips to the Hawaiian islands.

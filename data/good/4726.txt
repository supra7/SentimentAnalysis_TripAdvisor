While it doesn't have the flash of a fancy resort, the Eldorado features clean and spacious condos with well equipped kitchens if you want to avoid having to eat out every night. Since the units are owned by private parties and rented out by Outrigger Hotels, the quality of the rooms does vary. However, I've been staying at the Eldorado for thirty years now off and on and rarely have had reason to complain. If you want umbrella drinks by a pool with waterfalls, or valet parking and concierge service - this is not your place (The Sheraton just down the street should suit you just fine). These are 35 year old two story condo 'blocks' that look pretty much the same on the outside as they did the first time I stayed there, but have been updated time and again on the inside - don't let the external appearance fool you. The studios are perfect for couples, and even the ones up next to the lobby (just off the main road) are quiet. The rooms are a short 5 minute walk from what amounts to a private beach with cabana facilities (showers, bathrooms, etc...), and you can order food and drinks to be delivered from the mini-mart in the hotel lobby. I considered staying in a hotel again this time, but switched back to the Eldorado which proved to be the right choice. FYI - Put those kitchen facilities to good use. 'Foodland Farms' in the newer strip mall across from the older Lahaina Cannery Mall, is West Maui's answer to Whole Foods. Great selection of specialty foods (wines, chocolates, cheeses), steaks, seafood, and several kinds of poke made fresh daily!

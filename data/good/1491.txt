Because there wasso much to see and do in Seattle, this place really was just a great place to park our car. Convenient to Pike's Place and restaurants, this hotel is a little expensive to use only for sleeping! The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was clean, if tiny! McDonald's is right next door for a quick breakfast.

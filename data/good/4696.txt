We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for six nights, Oct 20, 2003 - Oct. 26, 03. We had a great experience there. The people were very friendly at this resort and the rooms were clean and well kept-up. The grounds were very attractive too.The only negative is the mixed plate restaurant attached to the hotel. We had breakfast there a couple of mornings, (it was included in our package) and the buffet was not very good, in fact the cheese on the eggs tasted moldy.All in all I would recommend this hotel, my husband and I stayed at the Westin Maui last March and although it is beautiful, we found the Ka'anapali Hotel much friendlier and intimate.

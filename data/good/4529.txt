We just got back and wanted to tell you about it. It was a 3 star hotel so I had reservations about it. Due to many family members going for a wedding we had to watch the prices. We felt like one of the family...everywhere you went on the grounds, you were greated with a hearty hello...something you don't always see. The food was great...no matter what we ate...presented beautifully. The only real complaint we had was that the air conditioner wasn't on when we came into the room so it kind of smelled like mildew. Once you opened the sliding door or put ac it was okay. The other guests in our party complained of the samething too. I did address this issue when we left. The grounds are kept clean and the activities were plenty. We were there for Thanksgiving so we made reservations for there feast and what a feast it was...variety of foods. We also had the Deluxe Buffet Breakfast with our daily room rate and it was unbelieveable. The location was great but I do have to say that everything closes up at 10:00. We were on vacation and would like to hear music or have a drink by the bar after 10:00. It was like this at other hotels too. There was also a day they had to worn us about the ocean. They left us a personal message on the phone to all there guests about the under tow...not to go in the ocean for 24 hours ...sorry none of the guests listen and they were quite right. I would go back to this hotel in a minute but I don't know if I would go tback to Maui again. ..being from the east coast it was a long ride and we have several beautiful areas down in the caribbean.

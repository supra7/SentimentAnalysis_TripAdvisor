Just finished 3 nights here for a conference & overall it was very nice. Lobby is lovely, guest room spacious, & bathroom, although smaller than expected, had very nice fixtures. For some reason they choose to use flat bottom sheets on the bed, vs. expected fitted, which means a knot in the middle of your back once you turn over. Desk in the guest room is very large, as is the knee cut-out; so large, in fact, that 2 of us were able to sit side-by-side quite comfortably. My aircard didn't work as well as it should have & I expect the hotel has some kind of blocking system to encourage guests to use, & pay for, their own internet access. The hotel's restaurant is a Daily Grill, which is actually a chain, however, the breakfast we had there was wonderful! Skip the high-priced buffet & order off the menu; set breakfasts are much more reasonable & the portion I rec'd was so big I couldn't finish it. Also be sure to try Palomino, across the street, for lunch or dinner at least once; very nice. The hotel is a quick, level (both ways!), 5-block walk to Pike's Market & worth the trip just to see all the variety of tulips at the different flower stands.

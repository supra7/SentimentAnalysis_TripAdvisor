I had a short stay getting in late and leaving early for a morning flight. This property is quite large and could result in a pretty substantial walk to your room. We were in building 1 which is allegedly closest with building 2 being nearer to the large conference center. The fitness center was VERY large filled with the standard PRECOR equipment. I believe I counted 6 treadmills, several ellipticals, bikes, machines and free weights. I dropped my visa card on the shuttle from the airport after dropping off my rental car and it was promptly turned in by the driver which was a huge relief to find honesty! The room was everything I expect in a Hilton from the dreamy, clean bed to the bathroom amenities. You just cannot go wrong with Hiltons including this property. The shuttle runs every 20 minutes and was punctual. The trip to the airport is fast.My sister stayed and used my free breakfast coupons and said it was fantastic...no shock there from me.

We stayed here for one night following an Alaska cruise and found the hotel to be a pretty easy going airport hotel, with reasonably good access to the airport as well as good access to the monorail. Like most airport hotels, the hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere. However, they are pretty generous with their courtesy shuttle and will take you, with the free shuttle, to the monorail station from which you can get very easily to downtown Seattle. We also used the courtesy shuttle to go to a shopping area that had several decent chain restaurants (e.g., Cheesecake factory) as well as a pretty good Thai restaurant. Another pleasant surprise: our room had an exercise bike right in the room and the room itself was larger than typical Embassy suites rooms.

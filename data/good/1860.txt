I stay here with a friend coming from Boston on the night before Xmas eve. 1. Location: The location is pretty good. Shopping plazas, Macy's, Nordstrom, and restaurants are within walking distance. 2. Parking: There are many one-ways in downtown Seattle, so it may be a little bit confusing for visitors to get the direction to drive to this hotel and to find its self-parking garage. However, as long as you are able to find the entrance of this hotel, the very nice valet people will either help you to do the parking or direct you to the garage. The valet person we met is very friendly and helpful! Very good service! 3. Check-in: Painless and funny check-in. The check-in gentleman asked us whether we are "Star War" member (Yes, I am, since childhood! I think he must be in a very good mood because it's holiday season!) Right away, he noticed what he said and asked again whether we are "Starwood" member (Bingo this time!) Because of the Starwood member status, we got free upgrade to the 46th floor (they have 47 floors), where one of the rooms with best views is located! Their elevator is very fast, so it doesn't take much time to arrive the 46th floor. 4. Room: Thanks to "Mr. Star War", our room has very fantastic views! We can see mountains, part of the Ellioit Bay, and the Space Needle is just shinning in front of us! My Boston friend fell asleep while watching the Space Needle because the beds are toward it. Although the room may not be very modern, but has very nice and elegant combination of colors. The bed is terrific comfortable! It's the best bed I have ever slept in hotels! Overall, the experience this time is unforgettable and worth the value!

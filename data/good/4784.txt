We just spent 8 nights at the Eldorado in a private condo (not booked with the resort), so I can't speak about their value / service. The resort though is still a good place. The resort is showing its age, but you still have nice facilities, a short walk to the beach and/or Whalers Village. The grounds are well maintained and there's a choice of 3 different pools. Parking is adequate and you're a short drive to Lahaina or Kaanapali. This is our second stay there and we still love it.

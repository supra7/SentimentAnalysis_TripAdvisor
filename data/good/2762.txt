After reading the reviews of hotels near the Sea-Tec Airport I was loooking for the best out of what looked like a choice of disappointing hotels. We decided to gamble on this Doubletree. We stayed for three nights before sailing to Alaska out of Vancouver BC. The froint desk staff was great and the bellman was friendly and helpful. I had asked for a room near the lobby and extra pillows. Both were fulfilled. We arrived late morning and expected to check our bags until our room was ready with a 3 pm chek in time. We were shown to our room unpon our arrival (the hotel did not appear very busy). Their shuttle took us to the airport where we used the new light rail to go into town each day. I am glad I did not rent a car for our visit. We stayed one night following our two week crusie-tour to Alaska before flying home to Maryland. This say was fine as well. We only had one lunch and two coffee shop meals there which were very good.

Spent a week at Secrets new resort Oct 22-29th. Everything was first rate with the exception of the road....thought people were kidding, but it is absolutely ridiculous. The food and staff were first rate. Not a place to go if you want non stop action or any nightlife. Went with college friend and probably 4-5 other non couples there and not much going on at night and the road was so bad no one wanted to leave the resort. Have been to sister resort in Dominican and the pool. nightlife, and activities were better, but beach, food, and staff better here. As with every resort need more floaties and if resort was super busy a bigger pool....no one used the swim up rooms so wouldn't spend more for that.

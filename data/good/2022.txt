This hotel is on the north west side of town. It used to be closer to the center and then the city moved. So if you are going to meet with companies or see the sites at this end of town it is a good location. The towers are 40 and 50 years old roughly. I stayed in the north tower which was nice. The idea of the rooms is they radiate out from a point thus the outside of the room is larger than the inside since the towers are roundish. The big negative I had was the lack of view. I paid for a view high floor room which was 3432. There are quite a few towers surrounding parts of the hotel so I had a great view of the space needle to the left and the office building to the right. IF YOU STAY HERE AND WANT A VIEW, GO OUTSIDE FIRST AND LOOK AT WHICH ARE HAS A CLEAR VIEW OF THE CITY OR THE WATER. Then go back inside and ask which way the rooms face. You could paye extra for a high floor like 3436 and be looking at an office building. The service is good, the rooms are nicely appointed in the north tower and I got the higher floor for $142 - the lower ones werw $112. These rates are very reasonable. I liked the hotel is is not one of the newer or well remodeled but at this rate it was very nice. Oh by the way if you are on the upper floors and it is winter or spring be prepared for the building to creak and torque from the wind effect. It can be unnerving at first but after the first night not an issue.

I was responsible for picking the place that we were to be staying at and I felt like I did a darn good job. The rooms were clean. Daily maid service meant that the vacuum was used, the dishwasher got run, bathrooms cleaned, fresh towels brought in and the rooms got cleaned as soon as we left; be it morning or afternoon. Kitchens were fully equipped. Barbecues around the pool were gas and cleaned daily. We had private patios with chairs/tables/chaise lounges and ate breakfast outside. It was quiet at night, no loud noises, no partying crowds...but the best of all was the beach and the cabana! The beach was the best. Mostly sand but with1 area of lava rock (Black Rock - a well known snorkel spot) which made for great snorkeling--even saw a turtle. Little waves, easy to get in and out of the water. I don't like laying in the sand so the cabana was wonderful. Chaise lounges that we could move under the overhang so that we didn't have to be in the sun, full kitchen with all the blenders, appliances, dishes that you could possibly need. We lounged down there all day AND the beach was less crowded than if you stayed at the Whaler's Village hotels/resorts! We ranged in age from 19 to 71 and we all thought it was a great spot.

This is a new Hilton, so the scars from the conventioneers and screaming kids have yet to materialize - It's still in resort shape. If you care about the view, then it's worth the extra script to upgrade to the bay views, which are impressive. The view of the railroad yard from the other side of the hotel is considerably less inspiring, unless you really like railroad track. The photos are an accurate depiction of the hotel. It's sleek, with contemporary modern public spaces. The location is not as central as the Marriott, but not by much. The hotel is located on the other side of the convention center, so it's right on the water but a bit outside of reasonable walking distance to the Gaslamp district or Petco. Valet is 30 bucks a day, but there is also public parking. It might be wise to check to see if there is a convention in town during the dates of your stay, as the experience can vary depending upon occupancy levels. The room is well done. Hilton has great beds in their newer hotels and this is no exception. The service is nothing exceptional, but the hotel is a good value - A bit newer and more contemporary than The Grand Hyatt or Marriott.

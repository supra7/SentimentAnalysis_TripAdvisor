I had read many reviews on the Kaanapali beach hotel, and tripadvisor did not let me down. No, this is not the newest or greatest hotel in the Kaanapali area, but it was clean, quiet, and comfortable. If you are looking for luxury, go elsewhere, but if older elevators and carpet aren't a problem for you, the Kaanapali beach hotel is a great place to spend some time. The hotel is easy to navigate, parking is affordable (and fairly close to the rooms), and the grounds are beautiful as well. Everyone we encountered, from the housekeeping to the check-in desk, made us feel very welcome and were very friendly. This is definately a family oriented hotel, but I never encountered an overly crowded pool, or hoards of wild screaming children...(if that is a concern for you). Our room was slightly bigger than we had thought it would be and we ended up with a partial ocean view, even though our reservation was for a garden view. This hotel definately gives off a mellow 'classic hawaiiana' vibe, and Whalers village is only a five minute walk away with great dining and shopping. I was originally planning on staying at the Royal Lahaina, but due to a mix up with expedia, I ended up booking KBH, and I'm so glad I did. It is affordable and you can't beat the location. Any imperfections of this hotel (mostly it's age) are more than made up for by the friendly staff, great location and the 'aloha spirit' offered by this hotel.

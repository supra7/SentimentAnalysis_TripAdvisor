I must say the staff really have improved since the last time we stayed at this hotel. Now all of them were cheerful, most friendly and polite- not only Theo :) We needed to change our room and there were no probs, they gladly helped us and with no extra charge. The room was big and clean, but the toilet was pretty small. Everytime weve been out and came back, we really felt welcomed by the staff. I cant complain about breakfast since I normally dont eat so early, so I think it was OK. The hotel is very good located in my mind. Easy getting there straight from Heathrow, a bit away from the most noisy parts, the lovely Finsbury Park across the road. Its easy getting around with the tube only a few minutes walk away. Its a little pity though that the hotel doesnt have a restaurant for meals and afternoon tea. I can only say I enjoyed this stay even more than last time and thats because the staff had improved themselves so much. I gladly recommend a stay here :)

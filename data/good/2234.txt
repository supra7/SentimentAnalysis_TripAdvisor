I, like other people, read the reviews and was dreading the experience, however, we had no choice as the hotel was pre-paid via Expedia. To my surprise, the room was large, clean, and comfortable, albeit dated. The hallways and staircase smelled but this was not a major issue since they are used only as thoroughfares. The front staff gentleman was helpful as the card-key did not work on the first try - extra pillows were requested and delivered promptly. This is not a luxury hotel but it was better than expected for the price we paid and although there was a fee for parking, it was well worth it given the cost of parking in Seattle.

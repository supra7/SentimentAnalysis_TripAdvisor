Our view of the city and the water made the experience well worth the stay. The higher you get, the better the view. The room was not cheap but the hotel was convenient to everything we wanted to do. We had good hotel personnel advice on finding "out of the way" places to eat (great little hole in the wall pizza place down by the bus station). Not our best traveling experience but certainly not the worst. We would return.

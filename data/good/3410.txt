I must say that overall, we had a great time BUT if you want to use a gym during your stay, I can't recommend this resort. The gym was tiny and there was not enough equipment. What made it worse was that the brochure boasted of cardio equipment that they didn't have and the gym was so small that if there were a dozen people in it, it was over crowded and uncomfortable to work out. We've stayed at other resorts where the gyms were fantastic, but this was not one of them.

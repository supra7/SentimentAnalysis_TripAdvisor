The room, though small, met all our needs. It was clean and crisp and our corner room was nice with two sets of windows. Being from the country we enjoyed the hustle and bustle out the windows. Our room, 210, was quiet and the bed and pillows were awesome. We both slept well and enjoyed our time with pleasant, efficient staff and the Seattle's Best on the corner. The valet parking was well worth the extra bucks and was so convenient. Don't miss the Seattle Library next door. Take a tour! This hotel was only one block from the office where my meeting was, so that was very nice. I would certainly stay here again. Seattle has many hotels, most of which are high in price. This hotel offers a reasonable alternative. Don't underestimate it.

I spent two nights at this hotel while on business. It is extremely convenient to the airport. They run continuous shuttles. The room was fine, perhaps a little dated but very clean. The beds were comfy. It is a very large hotel so be prepared to walk to your room. I ate at the bar and the restaurant. Both were good. This is a safe selection and you will not be unhappy.

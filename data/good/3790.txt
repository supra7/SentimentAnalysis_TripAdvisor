My husband and I attended a wedding at El Dorado maroma. Upon arrival we were greeted with champagne and give a private tour of the grounds. We were then told we were upgraded to a swim up suite! The room was gorgeous and the beach was the prettiest I have seen. Some notes: Room: Our outdoor shower had hot water but our indoor one did not. We didnt mind showering outdoors so we never complained. Our room was so clan and absolutely gorgeous. We loved it. The bed was luxiurious. Food: We thought the Japenese restaurant was not very good. However, we loved, LOVED, our Mexican restaurant dinner. (the lunch was just ok). We never made it to the Italian restaurant, although we were told it was good. Breakfast was delish too! I would give the food over all 3 1/2 stars. we are somewhat "foodies" though and this food was MUCH better than ANY other all inclusive we have been to. So if you look it in comparison to typical all inclusives, Id say 4-4 1/2 stars Massage: The best I have had ever! I loved it and the setting could not be beat. Staff: extremely accomadating and friendly. Not too much in your business, but more than happy to whatever it takes. We really loved the staff there. The resort was very clean and and a lot of fun. I would definitely stay there again

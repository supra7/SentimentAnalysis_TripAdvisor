It may not be the most posh hotel, but for the money you cannot beat this hotel! This is my fifth time in Maui and this was by far my favorite place. I stayed here for 10 days and the only thing it was lacking was a gym, but there is one right up the street. Was upgraded to a nice pool/ocean view room with a large Lanai'. I will definitely stay here again.

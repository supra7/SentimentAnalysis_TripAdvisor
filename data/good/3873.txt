I'm a Hilton Diamond Member so I usually get amenties that are not available to the general public... with that in mind.... I really enjoyed this hotel. Has some great Bay Views and it's overall a very upscale property. Nice waterfront walking/running area. If you're there for a convention or baseball game you're in the perfect place. Otherwise it's a bit of a walk to downtown but not that far... and certainly a short cab ride. I DO hate parking fees which were kind of high. Their elite member breakfast amenity was unique: certificates for the adjacent Starbucks. I thought that was great!

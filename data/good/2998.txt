We could stay at the hotel after an emergency at the airport and treatment at the hospital. The room was clean and had everything we needed, great shower and nice smelling bathsoaps. Breakfast was good. Most of all, the people working at the hotel were very friendly. We had stayed at the Holiday Inn in Renton one night before, which was 150% more expensive and only half as nice. So thank you, quality inn, for living up to your name!

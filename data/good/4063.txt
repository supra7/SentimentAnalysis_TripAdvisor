This hotel is beautiful and the service we received at the front desk from Jen was outstanding. My aunt and uncle stayed there and told me about the great wildlife they had around the resort and I under estimated the effect it had on the beauty and experience. I would recommend this resort to anybody traveling to Maui We just returned from our trip from Maui and we stayed at the Hyatt for two days/one night towards the end. Although finding the front desk was a bit of a challenge once we were there we received exceptional service from Jen and the rest of the staff who were very attentive and willing to assist at the drop of a hat. The rooms were clean and well put together. My aunt and uncle stayed there and told me about the great wildlife they had around the resort and I under estimated the effect it had on the beauty and experience. Also the pool was huge, clean and a lot of fun. With the tunnels and water slide it made me feel like a little kid again. I would recommend this resort to anybody traveling to Maui

We stayed at the KBH Maui in Apr 05 for our honeymoon, and loved every minute of it. We had an ocean front room and it was worth it. The sunsets are incredible, and we could see whales from our balcony. The KBH is not quite "luxury" quality, but the rooms are clean & well kept, and the staff is very nice. The whole place has a very laid back feel, which is a good thing. The beach there is beyond beautiful, the beachwalk is cool, and for snorkeling, Black Rock right there and it's even better than Molokini Crater. We would definitely recommend the KBH!

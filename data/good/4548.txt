Others say this hotel is a plain jane, I thought it very charming. The staff is incredible, they go way out of their way to be helpful and generous. When I asked questions about places to eat and things to do I felt like I got a "local" perspective and not just a sales pitch for a tourist. The room was nice and comfortable.

Great location, 2 mins to Istikal ave, you must go there for a walk. 5-10 mins from Galata, walking distance to pretty much anywhere you wanna go if you like to walk. The hotel looks posh. This is a four star hotel. If it was a bit bigger and some surfaces a little better it would make it a 5 star. We stayed here with a kid for 5 nights and she loved swimming in the pool and playing in the jacuzzi. We loved the breakfast, I guess you need to be a bit picky not to like it. Great variety of cheeses, two fountain drinks, tea, coffee, omelette, boiled eggs, etc. enough to get you ready for the day. The staff was nice. The rooms have a nice sized tv, probably 37in. We were facing the front of the hotel and the view of the other buildings on the street made us feel like we're in Italy. Free wi-fi. Don't forget to go shopping on Istikal, we found the prices to be great. The turkish bath and the sauna were great too, don't underestimate the size of the sauna, it gets the job done.

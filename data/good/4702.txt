We stayed there for three nights in October 2011. The hotel location is very convenient as its close to the vaporetto's first stop on Line1. You can also walk from the train or bus station. From the hotel, walking to Rialto is confusing at first but once you get your bearings, you should be able to go around the sestiere (district) easily. Most of Venice's sights can be accesssed from there (30mins walk max) and you can always go for the vaporetto when tired. The hotel is very, very clean. Everything feels brand new without altering the charm of the old building it occupies. The bathroom was well-equipped and tidy. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Because of the way the lobby is designed, you can't always see that there's actually someone there but even when we had to ring, the person in charge was always there to help us out. The breakfasts were good which is a big plus compared to the usual Italian fare. The other comments are right about the awkward table design in the breakfast room but it did not prevent us from enjoying our meals every morning. The downside: our room was on the ground floor and hence a little dark (but we didn't stay there during the day..obviously). We could hear people talking loudly and drinking on Saturday night but they were probably lost tourists as this area is really quiet at night (by the way, the whole of Venice is rather quiet at night.... but this area is dead calm so sleep is usually undisturbed). In short: it's beautiful, it's clean, it's lovely. Highly recommended.

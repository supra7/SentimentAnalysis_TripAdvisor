We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for our Honeymoon, and like the other reviewer, were not given any special treatment at reception on checking in, and our champagne too was late .... by two days, but they did put it in the fridge so ours was chilled, when we eventually got it! I also agree with the other reviewer about the pool area - you really were all boxed in around the pool, there wasnt any room to put your bag or drink at the side of your sunbed and the waitresses working around the pool area somedays didnt even come round to our sunbeds. The hotel itself was fantastic, I have never stayed in such a beautiful hotel with the wildlife and fantastic views (you can tell we live in the UK). We ate at Sonz at Swan Court on of the night's which we loved, and we usually went to the Cascade Bar for a cocktail before venturing out of the hotel on an evening for something to eat. We also indulged in the Oceanside Dining which sounded so romantic and cost around $450. It was really nice, but I don't think it was worth $450, and we really did struggle to eat all SIX courses. We also loved the walk along the Kanapali Beach Resort to Whalers Village where we spent some evenings. We also went into Lahaina some evenings which was also great! We actually didnt realise how poor the service was at the Hyatt until we went on to stay in Waikiki the second week and stayed at the Royal Hawiian where the service is first class! All in all - I would stay at the Hyatt Regency again.

I've stayed here 3 times, and you just can't beat the price or the location - just a couple blocks from Pike Place Market. The first two times we got a room with a shared bathroom ($55 for two people/one bed). However, the last time we stayed, we'd forgotten to book ahead and all hotel rooms downtown were booked up. The Moore had one room left, which was a suite for $120. It was like staying in a large one bedroom apartment, and we thought the king(?) size bed/bedding was of better quality than the less expensive rooms. The furniture was nice, the kitchen and bath seemed newly renovated, and overall it was a terrific value for the space. The suite would probably be good for families, or people who need a hotel room with a kitchen.

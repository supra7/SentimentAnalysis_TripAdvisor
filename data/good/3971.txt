Stayed here a few nights for a conference. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was roomy and clean. I had a nice water view overlooking the convention center. There was a wedding on the grass below on one day. The pool looked pretty nice but I didn't partake. They don't have a breakfast so instead they offer coupons to Starbucks for HHonors members. The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk to the main part of the convention center. It is probably a little further than the Hilton Gaslamp. A friend of mine stayed there and I saw his room - the Bay Front rooms were larger than those of the Gas Lamp. He told me the train was pretty loud at his room. I didn't notice the train at all during my stay. One thing that seemed confusing was where to go for parking. I could see the garage but it wasn't obvious to me how to get in. It didn't matter to me since I was dropped off. Walking to the convention center seemed easiest when walking out from the very bottom floor rather than from the main lobby.

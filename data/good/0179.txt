We booked our room via Warwick's website. It was the lowest price in this location...and the location is wonderful! Walking distance to absolutely everything you could possibly want to do - or if not, you could catch public transportation to get wherever you want to go! We arrived very early in the AM - post-cruise. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. She went the extra mile to get us a room and allowed an early check in! Fantastic, as we certainly didn't expect it! The hotel has an historic elegance, our bed was very comfortable, room was clean and quiet - in-room mini-bar fridge didn't work. They offered free internet access in their business center - so, we were able to check in and print our boarding passes for our flight home. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with any and all questions that we asked. Concierge assisted beautifully in booking a town car to the airport for us. I would highly suggest using the town car service. It's not much more than the shuttle service - and you don't have to lug your own suitcases. The driver was extremely punctual, professional and courteous. I have read on TripAdvisor of other people encountering difficulties with shuttle service, etc not being on time and such - so, definitely need to do the town car via the concierge! All in all - a very nice stay, though I would say we usually do not stay in hotels that are in this price range...but, it is just the price of staying in this area of Seattle. It's very close to Pike Place Market and lots of great shopping - and that is definitely worth something!

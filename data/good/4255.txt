We stayed at the Hyatt in Maui for 4 days and loved every minute of it. We had a great room w/ a great view. The pool was great and the water slide was awsome. The staff of the Hyatt were wonderful, friendly and helpful. Only down side was the $20.00 a day valet parking fee. Should have been included in the $15.00 "resort fee" you get charged every day you stay, like it was at the Kauai Hyatt. Do your self a favor and park your self in the lot, and save the money for the expensive drinks by the pool. Food in the restraunt's were great. All in all a great place to honeymoon and relax

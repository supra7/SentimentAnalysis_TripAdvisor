Great affordable overnighter stay, due to its central location It's a great hotel for people driving down for the weekend, as there is great parking and efficient check-in service, If you like somewhere in a prime location so, you can walk everywhere - the location is excellent, right next to the Convention Center and within walking distance of everything. The only thing that was not perfect was that the gym on the 35th floor, was just adequate.

A group of us stayed at the Hyatt July 20-23th. The decor absoutely gorgeous! The rooms are not the largest I've stayed in but for (6) girls (2 - rooms) we were comfortable (we added a roll away bed in each room). I felt that the front desk staff and hostesses at the Restaurants could benefit from a refresher "hospitality" course. I have only positive comments regarding the valet staff and their service - EXCELLENT! Our waiter "JJ" and the cuisine at Son'z - AWESOME! The mango martini - excellent recommendation by our waiter. The other staff at Son'z professional, friendly and helpful. Again, the hostesses would never work for me. The beach is small but very nice. The pool and grounds are beautiful and well maintained. We found a couple bugs in our bathrooms. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt. We visited Maui the last 3 days of our trip as we'd stayed on Oahu and the Big Island pior to Maui. The Royal Lahaina Luau - very good! The coastal drive - gorgeous! When renting your vehilcle get the GPS system - it is helpful and saves time. The Maui sunsets "amazing". Enjoy!

There are many Hilton branded hotels close to Sea-Tac and even more within a short driving distance. Having stayed at one time or another at pretty much all of them, the Hilton Sea-Tac is probably the best of the lot if for no other reason than it is located literally across the street from the airport. Access is fairly easy although parking can be a chore unless you're willing to pay for valet parking (and even if you "self park" in the garage behind the hotel, you will pay a stiff daily charge). The lobby is large with a Starbucks and the Spencers steakhouse in the area. Check-in took just a minute and the desk staff were professional yet personable. While some rooms are a fair walk from the lobby area, my room was close to the elevators located just across from the check-in desk. The room itself was average size and was in all respects updated and very clean from the bedding (duvet) to the bath and shower. Surprisingly for being so near the airport there was virtually no noise (from the airport) and little noise from the hallway. The one surprise was the so-called "business center" which is essentially a closet with two internet equipped PC's located at the far end of the lobby near the large meeting rooms. To sum up, this Hilton has been updated and is well-maintained. Rooms are a reasonable value given the convenience of the hotel's location (the hotel offers both a shuttle bus as well as "park and fly" packages). Rooms are of an average size but nicely furnished and kept clean - particularly the bedding. Having stayed at this Hilton a number of times I can recommend it to you, especially if you are transiting through Sea-Tac before or after an international flight - the hotel offers reasonable "day use" rates.

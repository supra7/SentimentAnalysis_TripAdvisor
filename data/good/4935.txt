Very centrally located near the Plateau neighborhood, downtown Montreal and Old Montreal. Clean and extremely quiet considering how close it is to all the entertainment, shopping, and activity of Montreal. Friendly management and a beautiful building. When we return to Montreal, we will definitely book with this hotel again.

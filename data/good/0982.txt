I stayed at the Renaissance Seattle for a long weekend with my mom and sister. The hotel is a classy property that appears geared toward the business traveler. The hotel was clean with nice amenities, including Aveda products. We enjoyed a visit to the lounge one evening. The hotel's location made it an easy walk to many popular downtown venues. The big downside: the beds. We had a room with 2 double beds, beds that should not be shared. The mattresses in our room were certainly in need of replacing. But overall, and certainly considering the excellent rate we had received, it was a good downtown hotel choice.

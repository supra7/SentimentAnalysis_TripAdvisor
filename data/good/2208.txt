The staff was very helpful and nice. When I checked in I was given a room upgrade to what they called a "suite" (see pictures that I've posted). Paid $140/night including tax and free parking. Clean room, spacious, comfortable bed. My room had a view of the parking lot, but since you're in a city I'm guessing that none of the rooms had much of a view besides the buildings across the street. The room had a microwave & a refrigerator (and a safe, I think). The TV was not a flat screen, but had a decent selection of channels, ESPN, showtime, etc. I saw no sign of communal bathrooms mentioned in other reviews. My room had a private bath (#322) and I saw no communal bathrooms in the entire 3rd floor hall (at least on my side of the building).

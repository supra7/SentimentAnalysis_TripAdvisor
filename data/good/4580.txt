Last week, my husband and I along with 2 other couples returned from staying at Kaanapali Beach Hotel (KBH) for 5 nights. We had a great stay there. Through our travel agent, we had requested staying in one of the remodeling wings (based on what I had read) and we did stay in the Maui wing. We were on ground level which was nice because our 3 rooms were next to each other and we were able to walk out to the garden/pool area. One of the couples had an odor in their room and after they complained it was immediately looked at. Through our travel agent, we had a buffet breakfast each morning which we thought was good. It was similar foods each day, but a good variety and a good way to start the day. It was nice having a refrigerator in the room. We loved the beach! Snorkeling was great by the Black Rock! We rented a van for the 6 of us and went to LaHaina a few times which was fun. We went to the entertainment at KBH a couple of nights. One night the band asked if there was anyone with talent. One of our friends went on stage to sing (she performs with a band back home). Though KBH, we booked a helicopter tour, whale watching (which was awesome), and a snorkeling tour. Before leaving home, I had booked a luau in LaHaina, the Feast of LeLe, which was the BEST! All 6 of us would highly recommend staying at the KBH.

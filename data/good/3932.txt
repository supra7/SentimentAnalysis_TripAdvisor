I stayed at this Hilton for 6 nights on a business trip and feel very comfortable recommending it to anyone travelling to San Diego. It was located right on the boardwalk and across the street from Gaslamp District and Petco Park. Room was very clean. I ate the breakfast buffet every morning at Vela (compliments of my employer) and it was very good, but also very expensive at $21...luckily I didn't have to pay. If I have any complaints at all it was because of the housekeeping not replenishing the bathroom soaps and towels. 6 nights and only 1 small bar of soap? Also internet/wifi & parking was very expensive.

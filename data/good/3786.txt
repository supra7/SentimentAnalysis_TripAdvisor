We just returned from our trip to El Dorado Maroma and overall it was a great trip! This resort does a fantastic job of providing outstanding service all the time and creating just a serene, enjoyable environment. The staff is as good as I've experienced at any hotel or resort...they're very pleasant and always wanting to assist you/take care of you. I'd say the food is pretty good but not amazing, that being said we never had a bad meal. If you're looking for an all-inclusive that's secluded, quiet, and relaxing with good food and great service this is definitely the place for you! Pros -Great service -Gorgeous beach (especially when the sun's out) -Quiet & secluded -Fantastic pools -Good food -Great drinks (I'd recommend the Dorado Maroma) -Beautiful rooms (excluding Mi Hotelito suites) Cons -Beach "whales" (somewhat unsightly but you get used them...there is some great snorkeling that can be had around them though) -No outdoor hot tub on resort property -Mi Hotelito Suites (these are older rooms and not nearly as good as the other suites on the property. We're upgraded to the newer suites and we're glad we did!)

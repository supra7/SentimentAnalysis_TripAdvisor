We had a late flight into Seattle, so I picked the Radisson Hotel at the airport based on it's location. When we first arrived, we called the courtesy pick up service. The shuttle came after 10 min or so, and it wasn't a long wait. I didn't realized how close the hotel was. It's literally right outside of the airport, and you can walked there if you don't have too much luggage to carry. (To walk there, exit the airport on baggage claim level. Do not use the sky walk to get to the parking lot side. Once outside the airport, make a right, and walk out to International Blvd. The hotel is right across the street.) We also rented a car. Parking is free, and we didn't have issue with finding a spot at night. The room is clean and decent size, standard hotel amenities. The shower head was new and water pressure was good. We actually used the pool and the hot tub. Both are clean, and the pool is big enough for lap swim. The hotel bar/kitchen/room service closes at 11pm. If you are looking for food late at night (as we landed around midnight), 13 Coins, which is a 24 hour restaurant, is right next door that you can walk to. Food is actually pretty good there! Overall, we had a pleasant stay at the Radisson. I'll definitely consider this hotel again.

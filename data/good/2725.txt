This hotel embraces its role as an airport hotel and fufils its purpose very well. Staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are decent, and it's very close to the airport. The airport shuttle runs round the clock (every twenty minutes) and is very efficient. The hotel's extended parking option provides great value.

Maybe this hotel would have bothered me if we had paid full price or if we had stayed for very long, but as a last-night-of-vacation Priceline bargain, it was perfect. Our room was extremely comfortable with a large bathroom and almost comically cushy bed. The walls are thick and very soundproof, so we didn't hear any hallway or neighbor noise and we had a great view of the courtyard. It was like being in our own little luxury world, with lots of nice extras like high thread-count sheets, great toiletries and soft towels. Ours was a handicapped room, and although I'm not in a wheelchair, I think that someone who is would have an easy time navigating the room and bathroom/walk-in shower. The downside of this place is that they gouge you for parking, meals, internet, bottled water -- anything they can charge you for, they do. (Honestly, if they could install an oxygen meter and charge you for breathing, I'll bet they would!) But, if you've got a sense of humor about paying too much for some things, or if you find it a fun challenge to keep out of the tourist traps, of if you're just here for a brief stay, you'll have a great time at this nice hotel.

We were very pleased with our stay at this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were not fantastic, but were very clean and the view from our's was beautiful. The outdoor spaces were very nice and much more open and less crowded than other places down the beach. The KBH was very relaxing and it was nice to have a free show every night in the courtyard. The little extras like the welcome breakfast, Hawaiian classes, and excedllent beach location, would bring us back to this location again and again!!

We're a couple from Montreal in our late twenties... we went down to New York for a weekend of sightseeing. Found this hotel through Expedia, but ended up booking directly through the hotel (since it was the same price - $129 USD / night - and allowed us to cancel right up to 48 hours before our stay - unlike Expedia). Hotel has a true boutique vibe... nicely designed, clean, modern. Terrace on the 7th floor as a great view towards uptown (be sure to check it out at night). Location is great - right in SoHo, close to some cool shops & restaurants and 4 blocks from Broadway. A 15-20 minute walk to Greenwich, Tribeca, Lower East Side, ChinaTown, etc... even the Financial District is walkable. Half a block from the F & V subway lines to take you uptown. Like some of the other reviews mention, the rooms are a bit small, but after a day in Manhattan, you don't need much more... just a comfortable bed (which they do have). Only concern for some may be the semi-transparent wall between bathroom and bedroom - not a problem if you're close with the person you're staying with. The free breakfast should not be overlooked - much more than just a coffee and croissant. They had cereal, fresh fruit, pastries & bagels, yogurt, cheese plate, fruit juices, coffee - more than enough to get you started for a day of sightseeing. Parking can be a challenge in New York - there are parking garages available for about $30/day... we were lucky enough to find a spot on a side street about 2 blocks away from the hotel that let us leave our car from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon. Didn't cost a thing, and we didn't have to move it once. So if you drive, spend a bit of time searching before giving into the pay garages. Staff was very friendly and check-in/out was hassle free. We'll definitely stay here again if we go back to NYC.

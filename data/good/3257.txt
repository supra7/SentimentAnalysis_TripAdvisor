Stayed at Casitas and Excellence and overall the Secrets probably ticks most boxes! I will try not to repeat what others have previously stated! I am a beach person, the pool area at Secrets was PACKED every day - there were pool concierge who did help you get set up but it was crowded in places by the main pools. The beach was fantastic! Just normal sunlongers but they do the job. Would be nice to see some bed loungers on the beach too. The beach was gorgeous as was the sea and great walks either way. Could get beach service (like room service) great when you have had too many coronas and fancy a BLT! You can just order it with your beer! Restaurants here exceed all other hotels I have stayed in previously. The theme nights were a nice touch but the food was not as superior as that in the restaurants. All these hotels are strict with men's trousers but the good thing about Secrets is that for the italian, french, mexican, seafood and steakhouse there are outside seating where men can wear shorts! The only let down at this hotel was a bad experience in the spa - this was addressed with the spa manager who dealt with the situation well. I would recommend secrets for foodies, people who appreciate a REAL drink, good nightly shows and great beach!

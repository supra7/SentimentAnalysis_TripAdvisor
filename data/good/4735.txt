Stayed for 2 weeks with my wife and 2 teenage daughters. We all loved the relaxed atmosphere of the Eldorado. The Beach cabana was just such an awesome thing to have availible to us. We used it for storing cold drinks, prepping lunchs and get our towels. During our stay we saw turtles, whales and a Monk seal. All at the Eldora section of the beach. Amazing. We stayed in 2 rooms during our vacation as our first room had a clothes washing machine malfunction and a bathroom light that really liked to burn out. The second room was by far the nicer of the 2. Upgranded kitchen, bath and seriosly comfortable newer beds. The service provided by the front desk was prompt and friendly. An Aloha to Tamara for the great level of service she provided to us. This was our first time at the Eldorado but not our last.

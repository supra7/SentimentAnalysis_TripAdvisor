We stayed here Feb 2006 for one night. Beware that you have to pay 16 self park or 20 full service. However, if you plan to park your car there after 8 and not move it, you can actually pay a one time overnight fee that is 8 dollars instead of 16. The concierge service amazing. They directed us to one of the best seafood restaurants in town (Saltys) and even gave us $20 off coupon PLUS two free dessert coupons. I found them very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful time. And for a price of $63USD for a room with two double beds on the 2nd floor, I'd say it was most definitely worth it.

The location is good in the middle of downtown Seattle and the lobby is large and clean. We stayed in a club floor room, which included e.g. a room on the 32nd floor, internet in the room and continental breakfast in the club room lounge. It cost about $15 more than a standard room. The views from the room were great, but the window was really dirty. The club floor lounge was crowded in the morning and people ended up eating breakfast on the tables outside the lounge. Overall, these were only minor issues, and as a whole the hotel was a positive experience.

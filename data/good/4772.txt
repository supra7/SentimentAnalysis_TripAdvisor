The condo is ideal for a family. We had a nice room overlooking the pool. Saucy and Wayne arranged several tours for us and we enjoyed each one. We saw dolphins, sea turtles, coral and fish when we went snorkeling(Gemini). The luau had lots of traditional island food and lots of it (Feast of Lele) as well as overlooking the water with a sunset. A helicopter tour was my husband's favourite-I was a little green (Sunshine ). We could walk to the beach and cabana-the best part was it was not overly crowded. Whaler's Village is within walking distance and can be reached on a trolley ride. We had an amazing lunch and dinner at Ma'alaea Grill (outside the aquarium). The condo was quiet and it was clean. Thanks, hope to be back. Brenda and Dave

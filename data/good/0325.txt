We spent the weekend at ACE and it was a positive stay overall but go in with your eyes open because it wont be to everyone's taste. The older building is renovated and has a friendly staff with a great location close to all the major attractions. Rooms are small and clean, Our room had a large 6 foot high orange and red Obey Andre the giant art mural covering an entire wall that dominated everything. Our corner room bordered two busy streets and was above a bar so lots of noise pretty much all night. I would request a back or interior room with less noise next time. The rooms have only a small metal sink and shared bathrooms. I was OK with the bathrooms but my boyfriend felt they lacked privacy and made the whole thing feel like a youth hostel or dorm.

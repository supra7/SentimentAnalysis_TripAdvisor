My husband and I stayed here because the price, based on what you get at the Fairmont, Queen Elizabeth, was hard to beat AND because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and the pics (on the hotel's site). We were glad we did! The hotel is only a couple of years old and the rooms and decor were very modern. More importantly, the bed was great!! We also loved the location and the pool. I would have given it a 5 except that I am a bit of a neat freak and did not feel the bathroom was quite clean enough. Also, the coffee in our room was not replenished without us asking on our third day there, and we had to ask for a second pair of slippers (only one was provided). Other than that, a beautiful place to stay, especially if you want a nice room for a very good price; we had a deluxe room which was a suite and the price was only $200 per night. Hard to beat!

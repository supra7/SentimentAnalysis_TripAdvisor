The Outrigger Maui Eldorado is located about 150 yards away from the Kaanapali beach. The hotel itself, is older, though the room we had was newly renovated which was great. The room also had a full kitchen. The place was surrounded with different types of people, from young and older couples to families with their children. The service was good--one night our TV remote stopped working so we made a call to the front desk. Less than 5 minutes later, we heard a knock and an attendant was there to drop off some new batteries! The area was very quiet at night which we quite enjoyed! There was not much of a night life in the Outrigger but then again, there's not much night life in Maui period! We enjoyed our stay stay and may consider the Outrigger again for the next time we visit.

Good place in Schneberg. Not very central though as you have to take a long way by metro to get to TXL airport. As for SXF there is a bus service from Skreuz which is not too far away. The rooms are small but nice and there is free WiFi which is also very helpful. I did not have breakfast. Good rates are availble on some online booking sites such as hrs.de. I would recommend the hotel if you are happy to be just about outside the buzz

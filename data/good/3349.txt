We stayed at Secrets for 5 days. The swim out room was beautiful.The pool off the room was very nice but only as big as the building we were in, so you can't go very far. It's very pretty to look out of your room and see the pool but I'm not sure if it is worth the extra money. The main pool is very large with lots of lounge chairs and swim up bar. The grounds are nicely kept and beach is gorgeous, one of the nicest in the area. The buffet for breakfast and lunch is very good, with tons of food to choose from. The other restaurants are also nice. The italian restaurant is not the italian most people are used to, spaghetti sauce is not on most of the dishes. The staff are the best, very accommodating and sincerely nice. The problem was the air conditioning. The room was cool enough but the lobby and the indoor restaurants were almost unbearable hot. We sat at the lobby bar having to fan ourselves. We asked about the problem and was told that it's been a problem for a long time, so we really didn't get an answer.

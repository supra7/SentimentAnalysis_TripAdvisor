The hotel and staff were excellent for a Quality Inn although the location and view was lacking. The Hotel was clean, and very well maintained. The internet worked fine in the room, beds comfortable. Our room was very clean and the bathroom spotless. We stayed only one night on a trip to Canada. The desk clerk was extremenly helpful in telling us the sights to see in Seattle and providing directions. The hotel is just south of Sea=Tac airport althought there was no plane noise in the rooms at all. They have a park and fly service as well as airport shuttle. Good value for the money here.

I recently returned home after spending 5 pleasant nights at the Seattle Westin for a business related Convention. First off the staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. The hotel itself has a very nice lobby that always has folks in it due to the free wifi there. My room was on the 14th floor near the elevators. I was concerned about the noise level because of that but it was never a factor. The bathroom was nice with good water pressure in the shower. I had a king size bed in the room which was very comfortable. Nice work area and a couch that had seen better days but was certainly serviceable. Wasn't able to get a fridge because they were out of them but it wasn't a hassle without one. Room was cleaned very well each day. There are a lot of restaurants & shopping within a few blocks so walking to food or entertainment wasn't a problem. If needed taxis were plentiful. The only problem our party had was with long waits for elevators. there are 4 in each tower and if there is a meeting there that lets out it's going to take awhile to get upstairs. I consider it a very good hotel if that's the worst problem I had. As others have noted parking at the hotel is VERY pricey so either plan ahead or turn in your rental car before you check in.

The Hilton is a good choice for business travellers that are having meetings at the conference center nearby. Very nice breakfast buffet at the Top of the Hilton with breathtaking view over to the city and the harbour. The only downside is that my room was not really well insulated and was getting quite cold as soon as heating was off, forcing me to keep this noisy heating on all night long...

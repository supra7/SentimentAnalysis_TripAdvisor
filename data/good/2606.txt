I like this hotel, it's right near the shopping and where I need to be for work. This is my second stay here. Staff is friendly. Elevators and rooms are small, art deco. The only bummer was our room, although great view of Space needle, we could hear the pedestrian crossing buzzer every few minutes. It was a total bummer! However, I'll go back, and make sure to ask for a quiet room. Very Close to the Jazz Alley, walking distance. attaching a view from our room.

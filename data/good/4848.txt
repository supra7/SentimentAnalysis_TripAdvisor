hi, I was in this hotel for 2 nights and I really loved the hotel for its big and spacious rooms. The view from the hotel window was breath taking. I guess I was on 15 floor and the window opened on the busy highway, behind the highway was the creek. in the night time I loved the view of tall well light buildings sparkling in the sky. before reaching Dubai I was in Germany for almost a month and was tired of eating the European cuisine, so when I got some spicy Asian food at the hotel I was more than thrilled. The food was good, they took great care in understanding how would I like my food to be. Overall a good experience. dislike: I was asked to pay a hefty amount for the internet usage. While most of the good hotels give some limited usage free I had to pay for internet use. Another dislike: The TV channels were limited to regional channels and it got boring.

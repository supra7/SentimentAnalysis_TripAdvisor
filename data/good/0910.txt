My wife and I only stayed one night en-route from London to Vancouver. Found hotel very close to Link light rail system from SeaTac, and pleasant walk down Spring Street to the waterside. Unfortunately it's a steep walk back up to the hotel. Room and staff very welcoming, only drawback was the view of the lightwell from our window.

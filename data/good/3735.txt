I stayed here in December 2010 while I was taking scuba lessons in Playa. Alux was a great little hotel off the main strip, so it's very quiet at night but close enough to the town center that I felt very safe walking back and forth by myself every night. The accommodations were simple and very clean, and a great price! A nice range of restaurants nearby, including a really good hole-in-the-wall steak place around the corner.

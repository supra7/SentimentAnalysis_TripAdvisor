This hotel is nice enough, but due to some major access issues, it is not nice enough for me to stay here again upon my return. The hotel is somewhat new and it is a lovely hotel. Positive: The elevators are quick. The beds are comfortable. The staff was friendly. Vela serves WONDERFUL food. The rooms were clean. There is a gym on site and a nice pool. Negative: Location, the hotel is all alone on one side of the convention center. While "close" to the convention center, it is still a bit far away. It was raining when I was in San Diego and the hotel ran out of umbrellas and the LONG walk without a covered walkway was not fun. This is the main reason I will not stay at this hotel again, distance to the rest of the city/convention center. Its a good 10 minute walk to the start of the gas lamp district from the hotel elevator. Upon check-in, If you can, ask for a city view. The view of the bay is quite ugly... I was on the 22nd floor and had a view of the rail yard and the bay in the distance. Its not pretty.... ask for a city view. The gym is too small for the size of the hotel. All the cardio machines were occupied when I was trying to work out. One machine was already broken. While there are a few machines and free weights, its a pathetic excuse for a gym in a hotel for its size. If you are going to attend a one day meeting at this hotel, I would recommend staying at this hotel. Do eat at Vela! If you plan on being in San Diego for more than one day, do not stay at this hotel... you will feel trapped away from it all.

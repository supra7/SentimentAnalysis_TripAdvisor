We didn't expect much from the hotel, as our main criteria for selecting it was the location. Our first room was very small and very dark (despite 2 windows). We could barely walk around the bed. The front desk manager was professional and friendly, and moved us to another room, larger in size. It was cozy, with good bed, flat screen TV on the wall and good size bathroom. We really liked the wood paneling on the walls, it brought the sense of old world charm. Our window was facing the street that was leading to the Fontana de Trevi. With windows open, we could hear the water, it was great. On the down-side: 2 times the room wasn't cleaned by 3:00 PM and we had to complain to the front desk. We travel a lot, and know our way around, so we didn't seek any advise from the concierge. Speed of the internet was pretty good (we had our laptop). One afternoon they had problem with a provider, but it was quickly fixed. There was something wrong with the heating system in the room, as it was always hot, despite our effort to adjust the thermostat. After talking to the front desk, they have adjusted the temperature from the main computer, so our room was comfortable. Overall, we had a good experience, considering that this is a 4 star hotel. I would probably stay there again and recommend it to my friends.

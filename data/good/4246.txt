I went here with my family and chose to visit Maui at last min. On ariving the lobby was bare but clean and I was given a lei on arrival (very nice). The first room we were put in was very nice, great very but the wrong room, we were changed quickly but were put then on the bottom floor where there was work being done our whole stay near the elevator. The hotel was great with exotic animals throughout the hotel and jungle like lobby. The pools were great and not too busy for April! The only problem was the beach was not swimable in this area but if you have a relaxing walk down the beach you can swim..

My husband and I stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel for a week prior to cruising the islands. I loved the hotel. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Our room was very nice and spacious. We had everything that we needed. The hawaiian cookies on our pillows at night was a very nice touch. The hotel had great free activities planned. We did some weaving with palms, a cute quick craft. We also enjoyed the nightly music and hula show. The dancers were fun to watch and the musicians very entertaining. We really felt the location of the hotel was perfect. Down by the beach there was a sidewalk path that took you to all the other hotels at Kaanapali beach. We often walked the path to shop or dine at other restaurants. We had a rental car as well and also drove to places such as Lahaina, The road to Hana and Haleakala. It really was a great place to stay. Family oriented, friendly helpful staff. It was not a fancy, ritzy place but it had everything we needed. If I were to return to Maui I would stay at The Kaanapali Beach Hotel again.

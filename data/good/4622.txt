We had a great stay from 12/21/-12/28/06 at the KBH. Check in was a breeze. Parking was easy and convenient. We had two rooms on the ground floor, ocean front. The rooms were clean, spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The staff was wonderful, everyone was so pleasant. We enjoyed the welcome breakfast. The early risers took advantage of the free breakfast every morning, without much complaint. We liked the Champagne brunch on Christmas eve day. We enjoyed making leis in the lobby. There were a lot of whales we could see from our rooms and it was fun to take the nearby Trilogy catamaran out there to see them up close. One day a seal came up on the beach. We were a couple minutes walk to Black Rock for snorkeling and when we went out around the point a turtle swam up to us. Whalers Village was a short walk in the other direction and we had plenty of restaurants and stores right there, including the Maui Dive Shop. The beach sidewalk was perfect for early morning and late night strolls. For supplies we drove a short distance to the Cannery Mall, where there is a Longs drug store which sells practically anything, and a big grocery store. There was a nice crowd every evening to enjoy good music and dance. I was told this is where Hawaiians stay when they come to Maui, and I know why, it is a relaxing place in a perfect location.

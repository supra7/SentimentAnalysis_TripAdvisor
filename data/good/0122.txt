Spent 4 nights here in late August 2006 to celebrate our anniversary. Would definitely stay here again. Service was efficient and friendly. We had a little glitch on check in (needed a roll in shower for spouse who uses wheelchair, and front desk person didn't realize that the accessible rooms had different features) but it was rectified quickly. Our room was lovely and sparkling clean. Valet parking guys were friendly and pretty quick. Evening wine hour was nice and well attended. Loved seeing the board with the names of the "dogs in residence." Since we didn't have ours, we asked for a fish, and we named him/her after our dog Buster. Nice touch. Adjacent restaurant Sazerac was great for breakfast, dinner, and cocktails. Location is good - a little tricky for the wheelchair as it is downtown and its hard to get down to the water due to the grades. No outdoor space to speak of, which usually wouldn't matter but since we had great weather it would have been nice to have a patio somewhere. Still, highly recommend for business or pleasure travelers.

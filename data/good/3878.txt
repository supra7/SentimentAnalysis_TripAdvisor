Our family recently stayed at the Hilton for several days. The hotel is very clean and seems new. The only issue we had is the sloooow elevators. A few tips--you can easily walk to Gaslamp or the waterfront attractions. You can always take a cab or pedicab back to the hotel.. Easy access to the trolley if you want to visit other attractions. The lounge is good with a nice selection of hand made cocktails. Pool areas and outdoor fire pits are very nice.

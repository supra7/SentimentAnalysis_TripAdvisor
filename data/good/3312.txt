Overall, this resort was amazing. We did have to wait around (about 2 hours) when we first arrived because they didn't have a room ready for us. The room, however, was fantastic (Building 15) and had a very pretty view from the balcony. The room service menu/food wasn't great but the restaurants made up for that!! The staff was very friendly and attentive at all times. We enjoyed the music show on the beach and sailing the catamarans on the absolutely beautiful crystal clear water. The time share people did pester us quite a bit but once we were assertive with our "no, thank you" they didn't ask us about it again. We are already talking about going back for our first anniversary!

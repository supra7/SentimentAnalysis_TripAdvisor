This hotel really exceeded my expectations; the value was excellent for a high rise hotel in a major US city. The room was large and well designed. The staff were particularly friendly and accommodating. The valet parking is expensive  we opted to use a self park garage behind the hotel that is a bit less pricey. There were a few unsavory characters outside of the side entrances of the hotel and on the sidewalk below the main entrance. Some repeatedly ask for money; either ignore them or be prepared with a little extra change in your pocket.

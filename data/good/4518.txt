As a couple in their early 30's, we paid for our wedding. We chose the KBH for it's reputation of being the "most Hawaiian hotel" and the value. The grounds were groomed every morning. The staff were VERY helpful. Our partial view room was clean & had a great view (we sat on the lani every night listening to the band). It's very close to Whaler village shopping, dining, and can easily catch a bus to Lahaina. While at the Old Lahaina luau, an newlywed couple (2nd marriage) voiced the numerous problems they experienced at the more expensive Hyatt. As a very particular traveler that expects the best for the value....the KBH did exceeded all expectations!.

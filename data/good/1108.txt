This Hilton property did not disappoint. The room was updated, clean and soothing. The breakfast, served at the top of the hotel, was amazing. The view was the best we had while in Seattle. The breakfast itself was a buffet and the staff and table settings were amazing. The best part is the location. You are right in the middle of the city, close to most everything. Very safe area as well.

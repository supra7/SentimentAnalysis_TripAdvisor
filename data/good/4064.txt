We just spent 4 nights relaxing at the Hyatt in Maui. They have a great pool area and great pool service. The staff were not only friendly but extremely helpful....they helped us with planning our day trips and tours. The boardwalk is a lovely walk down to Whalers village where you can find great shops and restaurant. If you continue along further on the boardwalk you will find Black Rock with a great beach and snorkeling. The hyatt rooms were clean and comfortable and perfect for two people. There was a small fridge to store some snacks and waters in the room. The town of Lahaina is a five minute drive from the hotel where you can spend a great day shopping and seeing the sites of the town. If you like to golf like we do the Hyatt is across the street from the Kaanapali Golf resort that has two fabulous courses to choose from. The construction at the hotel was not a bother. Yes the lobby was located upstairs and there was parts of the main walk through that were roped off, but it was really not a bother. The work did not start early in the morning and stopped prior to you being back in your room to get changed for dinner. It was our honeymoon and they provided some nice gifts including a bottle of champagne with one of our dinners (we enjoyed it at Japengo restaurant). We had a great stay at the Hyatt.

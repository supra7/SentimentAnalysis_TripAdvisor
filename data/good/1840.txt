We stayed here for almost a week. It is right in the centre of the city, with many convenient stores/transport/restaurants nearby. The hotel also has great views of the city skyline, and for me would be very hard to beat in downtown Seattle. Many rooms feature wonderful views. Westin features a 'pillow menu' where you can order your own type of pillow - but the standard one supplied was great for us. The bed was extremely comfortable. We were on the 17th floor and didn't find the street noise too obtrusive. The monorail down to the Space Needle leaves from just a block away. Probably a four or five block walk to Pike Place Market - takes maybe 10 - 15 mins tops. Well worth the visit! Also, must take a picture at the Gum Wall down there! Check it out :) The hotel is also undergoing renovation work. With this in mind, request a renovated room. These have been nicely updated, with plenty of space and a work desk positioned in front of the huge windows looking out over the city. I understand the older rooms are quite tired and our rating would not have been anywhere near as high if we had stayed in an older room - so our homework paid off! There is a small cafe off the lobby, plus a restaurant - The Coldwater Bar & Grill. In the middle of our stay, the Coldwater Bar opened for breakfast and this was welcomed. Apparently it had been closed for breakfast for three years, but recently someone saw the light and decided to reopen it - a wise decision! Although the little cafe did quite well for what it was, the restaurant breakfast was very good and reasonably priced. We also ate at the restaurant one evening and the food was excellent - we would highly recommend it. The service was also excellent. We were also there for a conference and their conference facilities were good and well organised. Downside: No free internet - I think we all agree this should be a standard offering in this day and age. Not all rooms renovated.

Our room was clean and very comfortable. The beds were extremely comfortable and the decor was fantastic. I really liked the wooden blinds and built-in window seat. I didn't want to leave the W Seattle!! My only negative thing to say about this hotel is that the shower curtain seemed a little too big for the shower - it kept getting in the way. Other than that, our stay was perfect.

We stayed at the laleli gonen for 3 nights in Sept 2011 and enjoyed it. Paid about 65 to 70 for a double room which seemed good value compared to other hotels in the area. Room and pool were clean (pool was a bit chilly), breakfast was typical continental with some protein. Staff were fine. Hotel is in the middle of the shopping area for clothes, a bit like being just off oxford street, in walking times its 5 mins north of the tram stop (2 lira ticket machine near platform), 15 mins from the underground to the airport (2 lira again), 10 mins to the grandbazaar, 20 mins to the famous mosques. Locate it on a good map before you go as finding it for the first time needed a bit of seaching around. Ferries were good fun. Tip for a day out is to go to the new aquarium, one of the best we've been to, take the coastal train to Florya (2 lira) which is a mile past it (and where there's a good beach) and walk back to it.

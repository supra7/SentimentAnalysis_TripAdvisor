Great hotel, I would definitely recommend to my colleagues. I arrived late night after a long flight from Doha, Qatar. The check-in experience was swift and delightful and the front desk staff were friendly. The room was spacious and was perfect for all I cared. The location is great and its just a few minutes walk into downtown Seattle, the convention center and the shopping areas. There are a lot of dining options available in the close vicinity of the hotel. Soundproofing is poor and I could distinctly hear voices in the corridoor and from other rooms. Bottled water was complimentary for the first few days, but the night before I checked out, I asked for some water and this rude person answered my call. He said it would cost me money and charged the two bottles of water to my bill. Kind of strange, because I always got it for free during the same stay. Apart from that, I enjoyed my stay in this hotel and in Seattle!

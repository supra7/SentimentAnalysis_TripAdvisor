this unique circular shaped hotel is located in the heart of downtown Seattle. close to Pike Place Market, Macy's, theatres and a wonderful selection of restaurants, we got an incredible rate of $199 per night which included a $100 shopping card per night for a near by mall, making this four star hotel a steal at a hundred bucks per night. In the middle of renovations, it is a good idea to ask for a renovated room. While not spacious, the unique rooms have gorgeous views and are wll appointed.The standard is one king size, one king size with a sofabed or two doubles.

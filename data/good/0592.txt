The Mayflower is a great hotel, and I'd definitely stay there again. Very clean, nice staff, very low key. The location could not have been better, close to great restaurants, shopping, two movie theatres and the station for the train to the airport. The bed was comfy. My only minor complaint was the walls in my room were a little thin, so I could hear conversations next door pretty well. Luckily I had quiet and considerate neighbors for every night, except one.

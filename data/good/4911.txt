This was a great hotel. The hotel was kind of us to let us check in early when we arrived in Montreal sooner than we had expected. The young Parisian women who greeted us was very friendly and accomodating with the helping us with our luggage and locating the free parking in back of the hotel. The room was very clean and comfortable. I recommend the king-sized suite. Pluses: full working kitchen, an amazing grocery store located nearby, friendly service, you pay when you get there in full- and free unlimited wi-fi and phone calls to the US and Canada at no extra charge. Free parking. A metro is also located nearby if you need it. Cons: Free parking is located in a small area in back of the hotel out in the open which can be a bit troublesome in winter- summer should be no issue. Location of the hotel could be a bother for those who want to be a bit closer to Rue Catherine. Again summer time this should be no big deal, but winter is a different story. Although I didn't find it a big deal, if you want an elevator, this is not the hotel for you. Tips: Run the water in the shower or bath for at least two minutes otherwise you will think there is no hot water. Ask for extra soaps or shampoos- some of ours were 1/2 full- but that could be due to the fact they let us check in early. The staff again is wonderful! Thanks for everything. Because of the full kitchen and grocery store nearby, this would be great if you have kids.

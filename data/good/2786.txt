Good location. Right near airport. Had shuttles running constantly between airport and hotel. Staff is friendly, though they can be a bit rushed when lots of people are checking in. Beds are comfy. Room was large, but appears somewhat dated. Hotel is HUGE (800+ rooms)... so some rooms are fairly out of the way and a hike from the front desk. I was traveling with my sister and her family, so we got a family room. Very nice layout that I haven't seen elsewhere. Basically, 2 rooms connected with 1 bathroom. Had King in one bedroom and 2 queens in the other bedroom. Gave us all the space we needed. No executive lounge here for HHonors members, but I am a Diamond member, so they sent a small fruit and cheese plate to my room. Nice touch. Also had $10 vouchers for breakfast at the restaurant or coffee stand (had breakfast sandwiches, yogurt, etc.) for diamond members.

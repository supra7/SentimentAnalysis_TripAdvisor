I recently stayed here at the end of a journey from the UK that was in it's 26th hour by the time I arrived, staying only 1 night before travelling on to Canada the following day. I used the airport shuttle which was convenient although I had to wait about half an hour, I think I'd probably just missed the previous one though. Check-in was very quick, I had my Expedia email with me so just handed it over and received my key and chocolate-chip cookie - yum ! The room itself was very comfortable, although - and prior to arrivng I couldn't quite believe the previous reviews that said they had got lost trying to find the room, how hard could it be ? - I DID get lost trying to find my room, this is a huge hotel so if you have mobility problems or just don't want to walk for 10 minutes to try and find your room then I'd specifically request a room nearer the reception. As this was just an overnight stay in transit I didn't take advantage of any of the amenities but the pool looked very inviting and perhaps I'll be able to take advantage of it if I stay again. I'd recommend this hotel especially because of it's location to the airport.

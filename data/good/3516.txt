I recently statyed at this resort from 11/4-11/13. I found the service of the bartenders, waitstaff, and housekeepers to be like no other place I have ever stayed. I beach was beautiful, clean and safe. The pool was another beautiful spot. I liked that they had daily activities such as wine and tequila tasting, salsa lessons. However, I would not have my wedding here again! I found communication among staff at the resort to be very poor. We had paid for our entire weding previous to arriving. 3 times previous to our arrival we had to fax, and refax copies of our checks. We had finally hoped everything had been straingtened out. Keep in mind all of the money had been withdrawn from our account. Then on our wedding day they said that we owed another $2000.00, after much explaining and 3 tries that night we thought that everything had been setled. Then at check out they charged us again for the extras, such as the violinisht, DJ and expected us to pay. When we tried to explain then for yet another time. It was very stressful! Their were lots of errors as well. They had the wrong menu at our reception. We were supposed to have a wine tasting for a rehearsal dinner. We did not, but the expectaiion was that we would still pay for it. The photographer asked my husband were the judge was right before the ceremony was supposed to start. Before arriving they had wanted a list of guests, then our wedding corrdinator e-mails us that 2 couples were not on the reservation lists. So we spent hours asking for confirmation #'s worring our friends and family, then ohyeah we found them. They had confirmed everyone else. Then when my parents arrived, they told that they did not have a reservation. It took hours to figure out! Thanks Secrets! We did have fun there, but anything to do with the wedding was such a headache. I wish that we had got married at home!!!!!

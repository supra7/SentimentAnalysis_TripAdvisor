Our family stayed here the night before an early overseas flight and we were extremely happy with the SeaTac Hilton. Our primary reason for choosing this property was the close proximity to the airport & frequent shuttle bus service, which saved us a lot of time the next morning. As per typical Hilton standards, the accommodations and room cleanliness were excellent. Throw in the fact that we were able to book our room via Priceline for $53 (including tax) and it becomes a perfect experience. There were only a few minor issues, neither of which would prevent us from choosing this hotel again in the future. The first thing is that the hotel is undergoing some flooring/carpeting upgrades in some common areas and hallways. The second is that non-valet parking is $20 a night, which is a bit higher than other hotels in the area, but is still within reason (especially considering the parking garage is a secure facility, unlike at some other hotels). If you find the parking fee too high for you liking, there is a "WallyPark" right next door where you could probably find a better rate (and with only a slightly longer walk). All-in-all though, a great stay!

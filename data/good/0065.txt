...is how we would describe Hotel Monaco. We booked rooms for ourselves and 3 other couples for our annual after Thanksgiving/before Christmas treat in Seattle. We loved the parking, just pull up in front and they whisk your car away, no self parking here, it was great. The hotel is perfectly situated to wonderful restaurants (though the hotel's Sazerac was quite tasty) shopping and the theater. Monacos staff was terrific as usual even sending a bottle of champagne to one of our group that was celebrating her 50th birthday. The hosted wine hour had some delicious selections in addition to spiced cider, soda and a tasty fruit tray. The rooms are large though worn and a bit dated. We did have the annoyance of a dog barking in the wee hours of the morning, I guess that is to be expected in a hotel that accomodates dogs but it is still annoying to be jarred out of sleep in the middle of the night. For the record, each of the four couples that stayed at Hotel Monaco have dogs, we just had the luxury of leaving them at home. Is this a hotel that we would return to? Yes, though next time we'd request a floor well above canine level, hoping there is such a thing.

Had a great one night stay at the Andra as we were stuck in Seattle during the recent snowstorm. I called from the airport and got a great rate over the phone. We'd eaten at the restaurant off the lobby before and thought it looked like a cool hotel. We had a room on the 7th floor which matched the vibe of the lobby - Scandinavian chic without becoming too ikea. Nice view over 4th Ave. Bathroom had a large shower instead of a tub. Plus: Bed was very comfy, Frette towels, no hallway noise Minus: heating fan kept cycling on and off all night. We could sleep, but it was a bit loud. No free wifi, but if you check in on 4Square and show the front desk they will give you a code. Otherwise a great stay in my favorite part of town: close to downtown shopping, the market, light rail to the airport, and Belltown.

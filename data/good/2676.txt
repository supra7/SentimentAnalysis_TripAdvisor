Best location in downtown Seattle. It is two blocks from the Link which gets you to the airport for $2.75. Also only 2 blocks from the Monorail. Got us to our play at Seattle Center in 5 minutes. Felt safe getting from the monorail to the hotel at 10:30 pm. Great shopping all around as well as restaurants. Cheescake Factory directly across the street as well as a Barnes & Noble Bookstore. The room was immaculate and we felt like we'd been upgraded or given the best room in the hotel although we had not paid extra. Hotel has high security elevator (room key operated) Signs advise you to keep your door dead bolted as well as the security bar in place. Probably a reason for this.... I though I heard a small knock at our door. I didn't answer the door or peer out. Just ignored it since we were in for the night. Probably should have called the desk about it....

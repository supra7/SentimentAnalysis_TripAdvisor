The resort was very well kept, service was great, rooms nice(although wish we would not have had to be in it so much because of rain). Tried to make the most of our vacation but after 5 days of rain and basically no sun, it kind of got to you! Tropical storm "Ida" was on top of us the whole trip. We spend time in lobby a lot. We prefer the open lobby more than the enclosed. We were in the Preferred club area and it was well worth the extra money. Acess to private bar area with continental breakfast, appetizers etc. and computers. We went for an anniversary. The staff was exceptional!! It was not the fault of the resort we had bad luck on the weather.

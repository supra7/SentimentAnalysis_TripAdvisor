Being very new everything worked and was presented in first class order. Room would be a bit tight for two people. Shower had plenty of hot water that sprayed over the toilet, mirror basin etc. Leave your towel & cloths outside. My room had a nice outlook to the pool of a modern block of 3 apartments. Bus Stop to CBD handy & food avalable next door.

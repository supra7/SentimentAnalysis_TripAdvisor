The hotel looks exactly like the pictures on the web...stylish, modern decor. I didn't find the halls as dark as other reviewers seemed to think...I did find the bed VERY comfortable, and the room clean & modern. It did seem to be a hangout spot for the 25-35 crowd for drinks. The front desk staff was knowledgeable and efficient. Our remote control was broken, but replaced quickly. I would go back again & stay again at the W.

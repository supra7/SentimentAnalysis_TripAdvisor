I have stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks with my family. A very good hotel located between marker 3&4 on 192 that takes only 15 minutes to reach most attractions in Orlando. Connections to other roads are easy. Wallmart, Publix and Target are nearby. A Gas station (7-Eleven) and Mc Donalds very close make it convinient. The management is very helpful for hints and advice that you don't always get from many places. Small but a clean pool is useful when you need a dip in after a day out and we have found it satisfied as it was not crowded at times when we used it. Breakfast is basis, but this is not a big thing when you are out n about most part of the day. Overall, value for $ that you pay and I would strongly recommend it. If you make it there and in need of any help, ask for the Property Manager Chuck. I felt, he will never let us down. Enjoy the stay and god bless.

Arrived at Secrets on the 22nd of September and was greeted as soon as we walked in. With it being our anniversary i asked for a free upgrade a few weeks prior and they gave us one with no issues. We were upgraded to buidling 25 which is preferred. Our room was available as soon as we got there at 11am. Rooms are very nice and spacious and had a decent view for being on the second floor. the tubs are somewhat private that are located on the balcony which was nice. We had some issues the first day and second with our safe not working but they eventually got that fixed. The second day we had no hot water. Our concierge tried to down play it that since it was hot outside that we did not need hot water and that the water here was hoter than he uses. Totally not acceptable. So after 4 hrs of messing with the water they could not get it fixed. So we demanded a new room, they had plenty of rooms available but they were all in our building and had the same issues with water. So they ended up moving us to building 16 which had plenty of hot water. The food at the resort it good, not great but pretty good. the japanese restaurant was better than the places we have back home and was by far our favorite restaurant. Breakfast was like any other all inclusive and was good. The staff at the resort were great accept for our concierge who was trying to down play the situation. The pools are very clean along with the beach. Overall it was a great vacation and could have been better if the hot water didnt go out. I would recommend this resort and will come back most likely.

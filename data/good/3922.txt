We generally prefer small boutique hotels over big corporate chain hotels, since you don't get much service from corporate chain like Hilton. We set our expectation quite low and the property fared better than what we expected. We went down to San Diego for July 4th, Hilton Bayfront was offering a competitive rate at the time. We booked a city view room since we want to be able to see fireworks and I know bridgeview/bayview rooms are facing the opposite direction. The property is obvious target corporate people, or nightlife. It's not a hotel I'll recommended for beach goers. The hotel is very modern and beautiful, though the layout is a bit unusual if not weird. Location is great though, except if you want to go to the beach. but its close proximity to the convention center downtown and Gaslamp district as well as marina promenade. It does have easy access to Coronado bridge. The room amenities are standard decent quality, bed is comfortable, clean. Room service is good. And the location is excellent for fireworks viewing, in face, the local TV station set up the broadcast booth right on the front lawn of the hotel. Parking is expensive though and like a typical Hilton, don't expect much service. It was extremely crowded at the pool area because its July 4th weekend.

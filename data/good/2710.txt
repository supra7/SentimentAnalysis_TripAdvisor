A charming hotel and a good value compared to others in the neighborhood. I chose the Roosevelt primarily due to price and proximity to the convention center (1 block away). Having read previous reviews, I knew it was an older hotel and was prepared for some quirks. I was pleasantly surprised by the cozy, well-appointed lobby and my comfortable corner room. The size of the room was more than adequate for a single person. The bathroom only had a shower but that didn't bother me. The room was very quiet, perhaps because it was in the back of the hotel away from the street. The staff were courteous and helpful. Several friends who attended the same conference stayed at the Sheraton several blocks away and did not think it was nearly as nice as the Roosevelt. I'd definitely stay there again if I needed to be close to the Convention Center.

Nice hotel close to the airport. Our room was on the top floor and was a non-smoking room that was still a little stuffy (smokey?). I stayed at this location about 8 years ago for the first time. Overall, this hotel has been well managed/maintained over the past years. I would recommend it if you have a late arrival or early departure. It also has a nice breakfast

When we got to Seattle and the Hotel Andra we were treated in a first-class manner. The staff was very courteous and professional. Even the operations manager came out to greet us! The location is within four easy blocks from Pike Place and shopping and we didn't need to use a car to go anywhere. They gave us tips to all the best restaurant locations and helped us with all our needs. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

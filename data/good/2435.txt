Back to the Seattle W, by choice based on our first visit. Nothing on the second stay disappointed us. We requested early check-in (1pm), late check-out (2pm) and a "cool corner room". Accomodating on every count without hesitation. The only complaint would be at check-in the desk clerk was really loud...wonder if that bluetooth in her ear was speaking to her at same time she processed our check-in? :] Only suggestion is for a hotel in this caliber in a city known for high tech, why not offer iPod docks? High design makes it hard to leave the room; wish we could plug in our music...

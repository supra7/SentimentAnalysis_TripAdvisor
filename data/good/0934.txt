Got a very reasonable price...at least $50 less per night than the best deal I could find on Expedia. It's an older, refurbished hotel so, yes, the rooms are small, but they're livable. Plus there's an open "living room" area on the Mezzine that has free wi-fi, so if you do need room to stretch you can do it there. The bed was very comfortable and I found the rooms and hallways to be very quiet. I think the older construction actually helps in this case. Unlike the newer hotels that are basically metal and cinder block, the Hotel Pacific actually seems to have thick insulated walls. It's also within good walking distance of shopping and Pike's Market. I was in town for a conference and it was about a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center. The drawbacks? A crotchety elevator that stopped working once or twice and the hotel could use a good scrubbing from top to bottom. While the rooms were generally clean (the curtain sheers could use a washing) I'm currently looking at a visible layer of dust on the light fixtures in the hotel lobby. Not a deal breaker but they should break out a ladder and take care of details like that.

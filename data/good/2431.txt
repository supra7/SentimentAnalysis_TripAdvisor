The decor and cleanliness was super. I have never been in such a posh hotel. Location was excellent, you could walk everywhere downtown. I must say though, parking is very expensive. $33 USD dollars a night. You might not need to bring/rent a car because everything is at your doorstep. The service was wonderful. The bellman and valet were quick to bring my luggage up and I didn't even have to wait 5 minutes for my car. The lady at check-in, Nohan (front desk manager) was so friendly. The mini bar is stocked, so not much room to store personal items. There is also no microwave. I was a bit disappointed with the room service menu, there weren't many things to order from! The washroom decor is very designer like. They carried Bliss products, and I must say, they are the best! I didn't even use my own shampoo/soap/conditioner/facial wash, it was all provided and top quality (not harsh and grainy like other hotel products!!) The products were so good I took a trip down to Nordstrom and purchased a few items. Beaware, local calls are $1.50 each and if you have a pre-paid calling card with a toll free number, it still cost's more than a local call, $2 to use a phone card from you room!! The gym is tidy and lots of workout equipment to chose from. The room also provides bathrobes, in room safe and umbrellas (considering it's raining all the time in Seattle) Overall, a great stay with impeccable service. Expect to pay more though!

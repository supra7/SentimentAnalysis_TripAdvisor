This is Karisma's smaller hotel on the Riviera Maya. The entrance to the property, by the standards of the region, is very low key and that just about sums up the whole hotel. Good roomy bedrooms, beautiful beds with ample balconies - this is designed as a hideaway for those looking for a quieter holiday and it carries it off. Great restaurants , Paella on the beach, attentive personal staff. The beach itself is good for swimming but do bear in mind that this is great watersport centre so there is a deal that sort of activity going on. Night life is very restricted - Rick's Bar is a cavernous and I am afraid a fairly dull music "spot" and that's about it - but horses for courses as they say and all in all this hotel works and works well.

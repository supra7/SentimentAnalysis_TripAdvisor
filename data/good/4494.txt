We stayed at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel as part of a package and were generally pleased with it. Pros: * It's right on Ka'anapali Beach, which is really nice. * Kiheli Beach is a short walk away, just around Black Rock. * Honolua Bay (which has great snorkeling) is about 20 min by car. * Lahaina is about 10 min by car. * The grounds are filled with shade trees and sitting in a lawn chair listening to the surf is really nice. * The pool is nice. * The staff is really nice and the maid service was great -- in a world of sand, they manage to keep the rooms spotless. * Breakfast was copious and fairly good, but after a few days you get tired of it. Cons: * If you think you'll be spending a lot of time in East Maui/Upcountry -- this is not the location for you. * It's pretty loud and there are people around all the time. We tend to prefer smaller B&B's, so the abundance of people got to be a drag. If you're used to bigger, resort-like hotels, this won't be an issue for you. * They sort of nickel-and-dime you: for $20 a night, breakfast is "included," but "included" doesn't include the tip which ends up being another $5/day. Parking is an extra $9/day. Wifi is also extra. * You have to drive everywhere (true most places in Maui). * There are no cooking facilities, so you have to eat all your meals out and the restaurant offerings aren't great (food courts or really expensive places -- expensive even by Maui standards). * There's a band playing Hawaiian music and covers every night. And after a couple of nights, you've really had enough. Even as a fan of Brother Iz, it'll probably be another 3 years before I will willingly choose to listen to Hawaiian music.

Moore Hotel has an excellent location, really close to Pike Place Market, SAM, the Aquarium and more... service is good, guys at the front desk are really service-oriented. Rooms and bathrooms are clean, so if you are not planning to stay at the hotel is a great place to stay. The down side: check-in is at 4 p.m. and check-out at 11 a.m.

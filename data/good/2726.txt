Over the past month Ive stayed twice at the Doubletree Seattle Airport and was happy with both stays. The hotel seemed large for a Doubletree, but not overwhelmingly so. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Its certainly a step above other Doubletrees Ive stayed at recently. The rooms are sufficiently roomy and were clean and well-kept. This is the first hotel Ive stayed at for a long while where there was actually a light over the bathtub/shower: its a nice touch, since so often the curtain blocks the light and makes it dark in the shower. The convenience to the airport cannot be overstated: if the weather is nice and youre up for it, its just a quick ten-minute walk from door-to-door. Of course theres a shuttle that runs regularly but being able to walk to the airport is nice if you dont want to walk or would like some fresh air before your flight. You can see the hotel from the tarmac and, if you get a room facing in that direction, you can see the tarmac and terminal from the hotel. As Hilton Diamond I wasnt upgraded either time, but, then again, I never am at any Hilton Family property. This is a good place to stay if convenience to Sea-Tac is important to you and also if you need to be in that part of the Seattle area.

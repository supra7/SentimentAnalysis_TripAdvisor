In general, I've found that hotels which house airline crews are comfortable and reasonably priced. So, when i saw a Japanese airline crew at the check in desk, I was set for a comfortable room and a great meal. But my personal opinion of this property is somewhat mixed. As others have commented, Spencers, the hotel's restaurant, is more a big, noisy community tavern than a place to have a quiet meal. Whether it is expensive or not is beside the point. I find the place offputting. And from from the number of room service trays in the hallways, I'd say others probably agreed with me. Another issue I had was the walk to the parking garage. Okay, I'll be 66 next birthday, but I'm in pretty good shape. I found that once on the main floor, the walk to the garage was at least a city-block. Picture the hotel as the shape of a shoe box. My room was at the front of the box. The parking structure was out the back of the box and in another buildng that faces a street a block away. Granted they do valet parking. But if what you remember about the property is the long, long walk to the parking garage, then the property can't possibly be five star. I will say I had a comfortable room. And in response to the reviewer who complained about the housekeeping, I find that hard to believe. I got two to three knocks on my door in the morning with offers to clean my room. This is *with* my 'Do Not Disturb' sign posted on my doorknob. Perhaps the maids can't read? No matter -- better clean than dirty. As I say, my room was comfortable and at night I slept like a baby. There was a strong Wifi signal and I moved some gigantic graphics files -- whatever the cost -- so I feel I got my money's worth from the hotel's Internet. I also met some really nice people here who I exchanged business cards with. I guess that's what you *really* expect from a hotel.

We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach hotel in June of 2006. Since the reviews of this hotel were mixed, we were not sure what to expect. The room that we had was excellent. It was quiet, clean and had a partial view of the ocean. The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is once of the few hotels left that view themselves "as truly Hawaiian". There were a number of crafts to do (uke lessons and lei making, etc.) and the entire atmosphere was very laid back. The property grounds are beautifully kept. I was not impressed with the desk staff. I felt they were aloof and indifferent when asking for help or general information. It seemed the friendliest people on the property were the other hotel guests that we met and the housekeeping staff. The section of beach is one of the best locations on the strip. We walked to the other hotels and were more impressed with our location. They have wonderful nightly entertainment, which again, is mostly the true Hawaiian music that you'd see and hear if you watched the old movies that Elvis filmed in the islands. I would definitely recommend this hotel. For the price, you won't find anything better.

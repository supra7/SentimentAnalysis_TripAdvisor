We had earned a free night with our reward points and stayed 1 night before our check into our timeshare property. As usual, the room and service was top notch. Only down side is the hotel is going through a major remodel/refurbishing. We did not have any heads up about the work being done and it would have been a disappointing stay if that was our actual destination. The hotel gave us a nice upgrade and free valet for the inconvenience. I love this hotel and will stay there again. I would just check before going that the work had been completed.

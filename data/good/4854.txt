We stay at this hotel for 5 nights before our cruise leaving Livorno. We picked this hotel because it is very close to the central train station. We have read most of the reviews and saw most of the pictures but we were still not too sure. The driver had a difficult time to find this hotel because it has no sign in the front to indicate there is hotel in the building. We were given room 103 which faces the front, Via Firenze. The room is a nice size for European standard. Nice size bathroom but the shower is a little tight. Staff are super friendly and speak perfect English. They give very good recommendations for local restaurants around the neighbourhood. The breakfast was very good. There is always meat, eggs, cereals, yogurts, baked goods, breads and nice strong coffee! The hotel provides free WiFi which we find very helpful. The only complain we have is that Via Firenze was noisey during the weekend and we got woken up late Sat. or early Sun morning. Other than that. The place is a great place to stay at and well worth the money we paid.

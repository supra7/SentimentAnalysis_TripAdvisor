My wife & I spent an evening recently at this hotel. The Belltown location affords you the opportunity to visit Pike Place, the waterfront district, numerous top-notch restaurants, and lots of shops. The austere decor, limited room furnishings, and cozy room measurements might be a potential put-off, but the helpful staff, great location, can't go wrong room pricing, and full Continental breakfast might win you over; it did us! Worth a try next time you visit Seattle.

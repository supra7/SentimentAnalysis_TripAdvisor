Warwick Seattle it is one of old hotels in downtown. People in the reception are very nice and friendly. The lobby has a charm of the old woods floor and heavy,dark, wooded furniture..The place remind me the hotels from Agatha Christi stories. Rooms are medium size,clean and they have balcony. The balconies are very tiny - you cant even to step on it but I like big windows. Most rooms have views for downtown. The location is good - just few blocks from market,niddel etc..It is not luxury hotel but excellent choice for city break or pre-cruise accomodation in Seattle.

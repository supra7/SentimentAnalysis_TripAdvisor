We spent 4 nights at Secrets Maroma and had a great time. I saw a lot of other posts complaining about food but the Italian restaurant was very good, the rest I would say were average. The have a very big spread for breakfast at the buffet too. The room was lovely as was the beach and pool. They even came around with sushi while we were sitting by the pool! The only complaint I would have was the birds are really loud in the morning but can't blame the hotel for that!

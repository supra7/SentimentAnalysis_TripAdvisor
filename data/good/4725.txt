The room was a little dated but very spacious - a very comfortable couch to sleep on even without pulling it out. Nice lanai to sit outside and eat breakfast on. It had a ktichen and a washing machine that definitely came in handy. There is a deli that is right next to the hotel where you can get a cheap breakfast and a box lunch (with a cooler) to take on the road to Hana (one meal is good enough for 2 people btw). This hotel is on Ka'anapali beach but about a mile in walking distance from the Whalers Village. It is great for people who have families because it has a nice beach house right on the water that has towels, an outdoor shower, and a kitchen (for families that would like to cook while on the beach instead of having to leave and spend $$$). You can't walk to the Whaler's Village along the beach - there is a river/creek and a jetty that prevents this. However, you can walk about 0.5 miles down the street to get there - which isn't a big deal (or a bad walk). Overall this hotel was great for the price - it was a nice location in reference to Napili/Kapalua and the Lahaina area. I stayed at the Outrigger in Lahaina last time and it seems that Outrigger always has reliable service and a great quality of rooms. Great choice.

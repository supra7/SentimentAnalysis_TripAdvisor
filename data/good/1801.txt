I stayed at The Sorrento for one night and I was very pleased with my experience. The room was fresh, clean and well appointed (the closet was huge!). I loved that the windows in the room and bathroom opened for me to get some fresh air. The staff was very accommodating and I had no problem getting the things I requested taken care of quickly and easily (early check in/late check out). I even got my dinner for the happy hour price even though I arrived right when HH ended, which was greatly appreciated. My only complaint is that my room's blackout curtains didn't close all the way, and it was quite bright in the room at night. (Also, and this is because I live in the 'burbs, there was a lot of street noise, even at night.)

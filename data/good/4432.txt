This was our kids first time to Hawaii and we wanted to be sure that they learned about island culture and tradition. We picked Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for their kids passport program and we were not disappointed. The girls loved getting their 'Hawaiian' names, making leis, and learning to hula. The resort is very welcoming and warm. The rooms were very nice, we had a king bed and the kids slept on a single daybed. Our room was downstairs facing the outside rim of the property with a small patio and was private. There is another resort next door but there are trees and plantings separating the properties. We could simply walk out the back patio and then down several rooms to the beach. Like most resorts in Maui, you have to pay for beach lounges, which was somewhat annoying. But, no other fees around the resort. The pool area was nice for small kids but it was a simple, shallow pool. Bigger kids would probably want water slides and more exciting water activities. But there is the beach! The food at the restaurants was good and the magic show was very nicely done. We loved hanging out in the evening with live music and the kids danced their hearts out. We only stayed four night but we wished we had seven!

This was the first part of our West Coast trip and what a great hotel. Beds were great, nice staff, and a brilliant start to a lot of sightseeing. The rooms are not huge but big enough, but overall the location makes this place and its worth the extra sterling for access to the market, ferries, and walking into the shopping areas. With little onsite, the hotel makes use of surrounding facilities which is nice if, like us, you like to get out of the hotel - the surrounding bistro, cafe etc can bill to your room, even though it feels like you have got out and about already (as opposed to the welcome but generic 'Marrisson' scrambled egg fare. Parking is not cheap, but then when is it in central US cities - there are plenty nearby that are cheaper if you don't need the car much. Overall, would definitely go again.

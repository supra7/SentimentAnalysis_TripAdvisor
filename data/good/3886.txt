The location is ideal, right on the bay and within walking distance of Seaport, Gaslamp district and right across from the Convention Center. Although, the lobby and restaurant areas seem to be really hopping in the evening, the rest of the hotel is remarkably sound insulated. The room was comfortable and the bed was too. Great bay view from the window! (I am not a Hilton member and was not even asked if I wanted a bay view, so that was a nice surprise.) Staff were all pleasant and helpful. I was not crazy about having to pay for time in the business center to use the computer, but no charge for printing boarding passes. I would probably stay here again.

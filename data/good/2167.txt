We stayed here on our return from a friends 50th birthday in mexico. We arrived late but had a wonderfull view of the space needle all lit up at night. The room was nicer then I expected and the beds we're super soft.They were much appreciated after 10 days of hard beds in Mexico. As for food we were told of a place to get pizza from and it was the best any of the 4 of us can recall....and was hot when we got it. The room also comes with continental breakfast which was great while we waited for our taxi to catch the clipper home at the end of our vacation.

We were only here for one night but thought the location and the bedroom were both great. We were on a high floor and had a great view. There was a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee and the bed was tops in comfort. The location was great, walking distance to many sites. Would definitely stay there again. Liked Seattle a lot and the hotel as well.

I stayed here in December 2006 whilst on a business trip from the UK. We had a corporate rate for the hotel, so I'd like to say before I start that I thought the room was good value for money. We arrived late after a hellish internal flight to find the hotel in party mode. There was obviously a fancy Christmas ball gown party happening. First initial thoughts were wow - this is dark and surreal! Checked in with no problems although it was hard to hear the receptionist because of the loud music! Chucked the bags in the room and grabbed a quick drink. Took ages to get served because of the party... but hey. We soon went back to the room and it was clean, fresh and comfortable. I had a sofa along my main window so I could peer out into Seattle's great views. The bed, like others have said, is really comfortable and the TV impressive. The bathroom was well equipped and the toiletries were very nice too. We ate every morning in the hotel for breakfast. This was a hit and miss affair as sometimes it would be perfect and other times the service would let it down. I had lunch one day (Corn Tortillas) and it was probably the worse tasting meal I had all week - never mind! Drinks were steep as were food prices for dinner etc. We used the wireless internet access (which is free on floors 1 > 3) and it was quick and easy. The hotel was overpriced for water and the mini bar. You even had a menu in your room to purchase bits like bath robes, towels etc, all which were stupidly expensive. Overall I really liked it here - the only thing that let it down for me was the price for necessities such as water and the parties were a bit too much sometimes  it was nice to have some different people in the hotel ( but some were just plain rude!) Would be back if we get a good room rate again...

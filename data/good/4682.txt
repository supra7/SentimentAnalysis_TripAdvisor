I am giving KBH 4 stars for the exceptional value of the hotel given it's fantastic location and the price of our stay there. We spent 4 nights there over Thanksgiving, and really had our anxious moments considering we had just left the Princeville Hotel on Kauai. This was definitely our "budget" hotel for the trip (11 days, 3 islands), and the $250/nt price included a rental car and breakfast. When we pulled up, I was thrilled with the location, which, as many here have previously mentioned, is on a beautiful beach with relatively calm waters and always warm waters year-round. In the winter months, you can see whales right from the beach, and there is wonderful snorkling (sea turtles abound) and scuba diving at Black Rock right down the beach, a couple hundred yards away. In the other direction, again, about 100 yards, is the fabulous Whaler's Village, with the usual upscale shops, but also some unique Hawaiian craft stores and some good restaurants. KBH prides itself on being "Hawaii's Most Hawaiian Hotel," and they really are. They tell you all kinds of folk stories at the first day "orientation breakfast." They also give you a kukui nut lei when you depart. They are friendly, and go out of their way to help, and I have to admit, I would be very likely to stay there again, despite my inital concerns when I read some of the comments here about the wicker furniture and the like. The rooms are average hotel rooms, but have room to stretch out, and you cannot hear anything through the walls or from the floors above you, which was a relief. The turn-down service each night is a nice touch, and the cookies and orchids they leave are very nice. They even left a little bottle of champagne for my parents who were celebrating their 40th anniversary, and gave them memorial luggage tags the night before they left. The hotel also has convenient laundry facilities, which we desperately needed and appreciated.

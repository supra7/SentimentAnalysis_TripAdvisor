It was my first time staying at the W Seattle. Normally, we would stay at the Westin or Sheraton (we're SPG members), when we're in Seattle, but decided to try somewhere different. Imagine my surprise when we got there. Though the hotel is undergoing some renovations till the end of February, it still made for a nice weekend stay. They relocated the restaurant and lounge to the 2nd floor, but a very small area was set aside for them. We chose to eat out instead for the time we were there. The hotel is located in the financial district, but you are close enough other restaurants by a block or 2, that you can walk. We were there for an anniversary and they upgraded us to a corner suite which was wonderful! The room was more than enough for the 2 of us. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. I would definitely be back to stay here, once the renovations are done. And did I mention they are close to Pike Place Market?

We stayed at the Foro Romano for four nights. There was a mix up upon arrival--don't know if it was false advertizing on the part of the owner or just a mistake. We were told we were at the Colosseo B & B (apparently same owner). It wasn't looking very promising. The young man there was very friendly and helpful and we did get to this hotel. The desk attendant was very friendly and helpful. We had trouble with the TV and he spent some time and effort fixing it. while the breakfast wasn't expansive it was good. The room itself was clean and of adequate size, good air conditioning (not used to 30+ temps). The biggest issue was the lack of a lift. At the end of a day of touring we took to calling the steps "Mt. Everest." there was a mix up with the taxi on our day of departure (there being two instead of one). The location was fantastic--just a short distance from the Roman Forum. We would probably stay here again just because of the location and the helpful staff (a contrast to our stay in Florence).

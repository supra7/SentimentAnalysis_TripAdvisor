it was our first time to barcelona, and we're all very satisfied with the service/environment of this hotel. The staffs are very helpful and nice, they all speak fluent English. what's more,...the hotel location is brilliant, it's actually located on the main street, just few minutes walk to all the international labels/boutiques/restaurants. and the room rate is very reasonable. oh they provide free wifi too!

Like some other reviewers on the site, my boyfriend and I ended up at the Edgewater after bidding for a 4-star hotel in Seattle. We both really enjoyed our stay. The room, although on the small side, was well-appointed, with comfortable linen, a cozy fireplace, a cute teddy-bear on the bed, and a wonderful bathroom with spa toiletries and a rainfall shower-head. If possible, get a room overlooking the harbor since the view is breathtaking and the best part of the hotel. The location was great since many of the famous landmarks in Seattle are within walking distance. The one thing I would watch out for is the cosly parking fee, which comes out to almost $32/night for overnight parking plus tip. That said, I would definelty stay here again, sans the rental car.

I previously had a problem with Hilton Hotels but I gave this one a try on my last trip and was presently surprised. The best part was that there was free wireless internet in the lobby which was also the lounge so you could drink wine and cruise the internet at the same time. Also the rooms were first rate accommodations and I would have given this hotel the highest rating but I had a small problem with one of the night desk managers which I was able to correct in the morning before check-out.

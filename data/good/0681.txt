It was my first trip to Seattle, a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. He booked our reservations at the Mayflower Park because of its amazing location (it was within walking distance of nearly everything we wanted to see during our trip). We also both enjoyed the fact that it was an historic hotel. While the bathroom was small and the showerhead was so low on the wall that showering was an adventure, that is to be expected of an older hotel and it was neither inconvenient nor overly unpleasant. The customer service was fantastic. Our flight was incredibly late, and they accomodated our 2 am check-in. The valet service was also very nice. The bed, pillows, and sheets were very comfortable. I'm a light sleeper and I slept wonderfully, even with a room directly next to the elevators. The best part, however, was the amazing view of downtown Seattle. We even saw a Martin Luther King Jr. parade pass right under our window the morning we left! My only complaint was the expense of the parking ($28/day), something of which we were not made aware until we checked out. Next time we won't bring a rental car, or we will park it somewhere else ourselves. Other than that, the experience was incredible.

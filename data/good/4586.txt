We stayed here for the last part of our honeymoon. The previous two places we had stayed were fabulous, and having seen several negative reviews here, I was a little nervous about what to expect. Overall, we were pretty pleased with the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. I believe our room was one of the renovated ones (first floor in the Maui wing), and while it was not the height of luxury, it was clean and well kept and really BIG! We had all of our breakfasts at the Tiki Terrace, and the food was pretty good. We only ate dinner there one night, and it was also okay. The Kaanapali Beach Hotel has a great location - right on the beach, right next to the Sheraton at Black Rock, which cost twice as much. (The snorkeling at Black Rock is awesome!) If you are expecting luxury accommodations, you might be disappointed. But KBH is a really good value - MUCH cheaper than the hotels that surround it. I would definitely recommend this place.

This place has cool art all around the walls and on our floors each door had a massive black and white photo on it. Great colour scheme. The rooms are pretty small. From memory there is about 2-3 feet on each of the three sides of the bed. The bathroom is really small, and you better hope you don't flail about too much when you shower or you'll end up with bruises in strange places. I travel most weeks for work and this was the smallest bathroom I've ever had. It has the feel of an old hotel that has been laminated with style but there were somethings that couldn't be upgraded ie. the dimensions of the rooms and bathrooms. The attached restaurant 'Red Fin' was really lovely , we had a great continental breakfast there - Delicious!

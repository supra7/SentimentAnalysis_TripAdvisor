This resort has so much potential, it just doesn't always live up to it. It's a beautiful spot with a fantastic beach and it's all very clean and well presented. If you are going to sit on the beach or by the pool for your trip you will not be disappointed here...although the "beach chair" game is very annoying, we went to get two chairs by the pool at 8:00a.m. and they were all taken even though most of them were still unoccupied at 10:00a.m. My wife and I would agree with some of the other reviews that the food is well presented but it does not meet the standard of what you would expect or what other resorts at this price range offer. We also had problems with our hot water, we stayed in an Oceanfront Suite on the third floor (which is a spectaculer room) and we had tremendous issues getting consistant hot water, in fact one of our shower heads never had hot water but we did eventually figure out how to get hot water in the others. Having said all that, the resort is very beautiful and the staff is extremely accommidating when they can be (but it does usually cost more) and the beach is really spectacular. One of the highlights of our trip was was the Tequila tasting put on by the resort, it was very enjoyable and Fernando was a great teacher. Overall we did really like the resort and under the right circumstance we could possibly recommend it to someone, but it is virtually impossible in our opinion to justify the price.

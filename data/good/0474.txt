I admit, when we pulled up and saw the seven homeless men outside asking for money, I thought about going to a nicer part of town. However we stayed and it was great. The rooms are small but comfy, the bathrooms and linens clean. The water didn't taste bad. There are some great restaurants in the area, thought the breakfast place the front desk recommended was overpriced and just so-so. Excellent thai and greek within walking distance. We were attending a convention at the Seattle center, and the hotel gave us a nice discount. It was a two minute walk from all the events. We paid 15 dollars a day for parking in their tiny lot. there is construction going on though so we were blocked in a few times by a tractor thingy. wouldn't try getting in and out in anything bigger than a station wagon or mini-van.

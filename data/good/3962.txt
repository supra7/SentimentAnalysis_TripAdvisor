I would stay here again just based on location and price. Got a decent rate for two nights over July 4th weekend. Parking is extra. Facilities are nice and clean. Walking distance to Petco Park which was great for us since we went to a game. Concierge and other staff seemed apathetic...almost annoyed with simple requests such as where to find pizza, or how to get certain places using the trolley.

This Sheraton is on par with other 4-star hotel experiences: clean and well-appointed rooms, and an extra charge for Internet and parking. Fantastic location for downtown Seattle. I originally was given in a room in the Pike Tower, after asking for an updated room with a king bed. When I got to the room, it was clearly an older room and had two queen beds. Huh? I went back to the front desk and spoke with someone else, and she told me that floor hadn't been updated, and that she preferred the Union Tower. So - different staff, new room, new tower...and it was a vast improvement! I also appreciated the "green" program, where you can opt out of housekeeping and get a voucher (either $5 or $10, I forget) to use towards purchases in the hotel's restaurants or cafes. Parking is expensive. Valet was about $40/night, and self-parking with in-and-out privileges was ~$30/night and a block away.

I loved the Kaanapali location. It is right on the beach and the hotel sits on a nice sandy beach close to Black Rock. The snorkeling at Black Rock is good, I saw a ray and my husband saw a sea turtle. There is a cement path along the beach and Whalers Village and excellent restaurants are close by. Lahaina is close and we enjoyed driving there. The staff is very friendly and helpful and always smiling. They seem like they are happy to be working there and really want you to have a good vacation. We liked the orientation breakfast and the free luau show in the evening. The hotel does seem a little dated from the exterior but it is nice place to stay for the price. We stayed in the Kauai wing and our room was spacious with a large lanai. We did not have an ocean view but we didn't spend to much time in our room. We also had a small fridge in the room. The Kauai room has been recently updated and the rooms have nice bedding and furniture. I would definitely stay here again. We had a great time and loved the room.

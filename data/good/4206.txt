We only stayed at this resort for five days and wish it had been longer. The staff was really friendly, the food and service was great, and the grounds are kept clean and well maintained. It is walking distance to Whaler's Village and other local attractions. The rooms are a little dated but are clean and comfy, other than the bathroom that can be a little crowded. Kids can find lots to do and so can adults, and you don't feel you need to keep them within arms reach for them to be safe! Overall we had a great stay and will come back again...

Hotel Max was everything that I thought it would be: fun, hip, sassy, and most importantly, convenient. The hotel was in walking distance of the office where I was working, and a quick trip to the waterfront, as well. While my room was small, it was nicely appointed, and the bed was quite comfortable. The bathroom, however, was almost impossibly tiny; I could barely turn around in the shower. I understand that not all rooms have tiny bathrooms, so be sure to ask for a room with a larger bathroom. It was everything I wanted in a boutique hotel in Seattle. The restaurant, Red Fin, was a also a nice surprise for a hotel restaurant. The food was excellent, and the bar a nice gathering place. I would stay here again without hesitation.

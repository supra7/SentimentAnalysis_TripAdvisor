I have stayed at the W in Seattle several times over the past several years. The rooms are great, the beds "heavenly" and the bathrooms are well stocked, clean and well lit. The problem with the hotel is the lobby. The reception desk is in a very tight area, if there are more than 10 people checking in or waiting for some help at the desk the area becomes very crowded and unpleasant. Down a steep set of stairs is a bar/lounge/restaurant area which is also awkward.

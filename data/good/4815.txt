The Windsor for me is a budget/2 star hotel with facilities slightly more than that of a budget hotel only, provided in a rather clumsy fashion. It's a fair distance from the centre city but there is an easy bus connection. We book a Singapore Package from www.antilogvacations.com , quite known for budget friendly Singapore tours in India.They gave us this hotel matching our price range and I must say it was a decent job.They offered us at the lowest rates and we were happy bout it The interiors of the hotel are not extraordinary but they are not bad either. The carpets and the furniture looked decent. The location is not very central but the connectivity is nice, its near an MRT station by walking distance or by taxi. There is petrol station next door so easy to get stuff. The room was clean, with nice, comfortable linen though I feel the size could have been slightly larger. Each room has a refrigerator stocked with drinks and tea & coffee maker. There are other amenities like phone, TV , all what you need genrally. What was not good though was that the housekeeping made a lot of noise while doing their job. And the major drawback is that the AC is centrally controlled and I found at times the room was very cold ( though u can ad just). Even opening up the windows did not help much. I felt like needing a couple of more blankets. There aren't many restaurants in the area. There is a large restaurant in the hotel itself but it focuses on a buffet and one can order from the menu only during certain, fairly limited, hours. Also little options in the breakfast items if you are a vegetarian. But the Price was cheap for the package . Also internet at business center for Sg $4/30 minutes. It was fast. As I said the facilities are there but the working is a little clumsy, I hope they rectify these small problems. Very nice Singapore tour in the end...m all happy with the trip

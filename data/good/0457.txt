Stayed the weekend of 4/27 - 4/29. We got a good rate of $89 per night. The room was clean, comfortable, very comfy bed and nice linens. The bathroom was a good size. Our room was on the 25th floor (the quiet zone) and had a large window facing the freeway with a surprisingly nice view of the Cascades. The front desk folks were pleasant, friendly and knowledgable. They let us check in early, at 1:00, with no problem. The location is great - easy walking to everything downtown and Pioneer Square. For breakfast we found a nice bakery a couple of blocks away, Specialties, for a cheap meal. I did notice that they charge for local calls, internet service, & parking. But we didn't use any of these (took the train to Seattle) so didn't have any of these extra fees. I recommend the Crowne Plaza especiallly if you can get this good rate!

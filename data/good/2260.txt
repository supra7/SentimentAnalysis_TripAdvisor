Great location; easy walking to shopping and restaurants. The staff was extremely friendly and the nightly wine/social hour was a lot of fun. It was a great way to meet other guests. Being an InTouch member with Kimpton allowed $10 worth of mini-bar items for free; nice surprise. Animal print bathrobes were provided; nice not having to bring one along. Not enough drawer space would be my only complaint and the bathroom was a bit small for the King Premium room. Great rate for the room; would definitely recommend this hotel and would be my first choice to return the next time I'm in Seattle.

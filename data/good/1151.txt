We were happy with our recent stay here. Yes, the rooms are small. Yes, the bathrooms are even smaller. But the shower was great, hot water, nice and clean. Everything was clean. The elevators are slow, and old, but there are stairs...and the parking is FREE!! We walked everywhere we needed to go, the location was great. Cant complain for the price we paid. Pillows are tiny though--I mean 2 together are the size of a standard pillow. Take your own. Breakfast was impressive, there were many choices and it was great (and also FREE!) Swimming pool was great, a few broken tiles here and there, but nothing horrible. We enjoyed it. All in all, well worth it. We would stay there again-- I would rather stay here for a reasonable rate, and be able to walk everywhere then have to drive into the city and park downtown everyday! PS-my recommendation would depend who I was referring, if you want a 4 or 5 star hotel this is not for you. If you want a budget hotel that is affordable, clean and in a good location then this is the hotel for you!

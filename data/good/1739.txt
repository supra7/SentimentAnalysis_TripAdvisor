I stayed at the Edgewater during a 5 days business trip. All staff were very friendly and prompt in addressing all my needs. I organized a meeting for about 20 people using two different conference rooms over the course of three days and that included catering lunch. The event manager, a technician and those in charge for catering met with me every morning to make sure that everything was in order. Wi-Fi is provided in the rooms at a cost (they have 1, 3 or weekly packages) and signal strength was adequate. Wi-Fi access is also available in the conference rooms that, by the way, have striking views on the water and provide a very soothing meeting environment. I had a room with "city view". Very clean with sufficient room for clothes and a good size desk with extra outlets for computer and other electrical devices (rare to find these days!). Bathroom was practical. No tub, but good size shower. Wall and floor tiled with stone. Water pressure was not a problem. The decor in the rooms is mainly "northwestern" with carved wood, stones, heavy solid wood furniture and lamp shades depicting mooses, bears and fish...Not exactly my style but....hey, everything else was perfect, including the amazing restaurant and bar ("six seven")!. The little boutique run by the hotel has some cute stuff but pricewise is unapproachable. Some of my colleagues complained about the noise from the nearby railroad tracks, but I did not hear anything. I would definitely recommend this hotel for meetings and conferences.

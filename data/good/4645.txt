My husband and I, along with our 2 children (ages 13 and 18)stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel March 24-April 2, 2006. We enjoyed the hotel very much. We had 2 connecting ground floor rooms in the Maui wing. (We met people who asked to be moved out of the Molokai wing because they thought the room was in bad shape. We didn't actully see any rooms in that wing, but be forewarned - it is the older part of the hotel.) The rooms were nice size, and it was nice to be able to just walk out onto the grounds without having to wait for an elevator. The carpet was showing a little wear, but after we had gone in and out a few times, I could see why! I was amazaed at how quiet the room was; I know the hotel was full, but we never heard noise from any other room. The staff, except for one snippy guy at the beach hut, was great! They were all really friendly, helpful, and willing to go out of their way to get you what you needed. I appreciated the little extras like turn-down service (complete with cookies and orchids on the pillows), free use of beach towels, and free classes every day (we took lei-making class and ukelele lessons.) I also appreciated the bigger extras like the Welcome Breakfast during which you are given a lot of infomation about the island and how the staff can help you arrange activities, the free nightly music and hula show, and the ceremony on the day you leave in which members of the staff sing to you and give you a kukui (sp?) nut lei. You also can't beat their location. We spent time at some other beaches on the island during our stay, but were always happy to get back to Ka'anapli Beach. The sand is soft, the surf is managable, and the water is beautiful. We recommend it!

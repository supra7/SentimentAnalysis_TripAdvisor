Got this twice on hotwire for the 4 star hotel. parking is expensive. but overall the average 4 star hotel. nice pool on the top floor with a little hottub. and a nice work out room. a restarurant all on the top floor. the interenet is pricy but if u go downstairs its free. just a bit of a hassle. concierge is great there. free bus right outside the hotel.

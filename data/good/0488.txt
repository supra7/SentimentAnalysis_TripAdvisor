I stayed at the Inn at Queen Anne for 2 nights in December 2009. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back. I was delighted with the charming ambiance, numerous free amenities and friendly service of this small European-type hotel. This is a cozy low-key hotel in a decent area within walking distance of the Space Needle and Seattle Center. The many free amenities include: Seattle-roasted coffee and assorted teas in the lobby 24/7, continental breakfast, wireless connection, shuttle service to and from downtownand a kitchenette in each room. Additionally, the staff was very helpful and pleasant. Some rooms are renovated and others arentwhich doesnt detract from the over-all benefits, as the un-renovated rooms basically have old-fashioned stuccoed instead of modern smooth walls. A small welcoming lobby and sweet courtyard (though it was too cold in December to enjoy sitting in) add to its charm. The price makes it even more attractive. Unlike other hotels I came across while researching Seattle hotels on-line, IQAs advertised low price is real; plus, IQA gave me an additional AAA discount. The Inn at Queen Anne is my idea of great value and a delightful, cozy place to stay!

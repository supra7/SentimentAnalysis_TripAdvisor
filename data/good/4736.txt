Short walk to Black Rock beach to snorkel or swim or the beach with the hotel's cabana. Free trolley to shopping a Whaler. Nice condos, good pools. Parking is $7.00 extra per day. We were told that condos had Internet but not wireless. I was able to pickup a free wireless network from my condo. With a car you can easily do many snorkel beaches and shop in Lahania. Would return to this location again.

Our room balcony was level with the large roof structure over the meeting hall. At first I was a bit miffed about that but after laying in bed looking out the window to the mountains I forgot about the roof structure. The room itself is modern and large. For the price ($159 on Priceline) I can't complain about much except for the beach. Seeing a nice sandy beach right in front of the hotel, I ran into the water and started to make my way out. About 3 feet from the shore it turns into nothing but huge submerged rocks 2 feet below the water that really hurt and you bash your knees and feet into. I think this is why the beach is empty, it's not that great to swim at.

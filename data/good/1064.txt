My family (husband, toddler and myself) stayed here for a week while we were house hunting in Seattle. The room was located on the 23rd floor, view of the Space Needle (not facing I-5 or the water). We felt we were lucky to be in an already renovated room. My sister and her family spent one night on the 18th floor in a half-way renovated room. The bathroom still needed updating so it was very very old. So make sure you ask for a renovated room. I-5 was still a little noisy but we could sleep through it. Heating/cooling system was loud, so we kept it off during the night. Hotel staff was very helpful and pleasant, no matter what the hour. Hotel food was good. The hotel is located a bit away from Westlake, Pike's Place, waterfront. But we got use to walking up and down the hills, wasn't that bad for us. And yes, there's a Starbucks on every corner. A nice local market was located up the steet two blocks, quick walk. They have a Bank of America ATM inside. Overall, we were pretty happy with the hotel.

Had a short in-and-out stay in Seattle, and just happened to book a night at Westin. A huge place but it doesn't feel overcrowded. The room was neat, nice panoramic window. Check-in and check-out were okay, but it felt like they would be better off having a couple of extra staff on duty. The location is as central as it gets, everything you can see in Seatlle (which is not a lot, frankly), is within a leisurely walk reach. Beware of quite a hefly parking charge - it costs $41 per day. WiFi is free in the lobby area and approx. $10 per day in the room - which is okay. All in all, a positive experience.

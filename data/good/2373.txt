Writing this review a little late but figured I should send a shout out where it is deserved. My new husband and I stayed at the W Seattle for our post wedding getaway...honeymoon is coming to a tropical location! This was the perfect getaway to Seattle topped off with a great hotel. Staff at the W were fabulous and always knew how to direct our questions about the city. Super friendly staff all around who really help to set the W standard of Whatever, Whenever. Perfect location in what looked to be the business end of town, awesome restaurants all around, making for hard decision making for meals. A Starbucks directly across the street!! (It is Seattle afterall) Within walking distance of local market and sites. Monorail easy to access by foot and of course the Macy's and Nordstroms so close. Loved our corner suite room and the generous bottle of wine gifted for our recent wedding. Would have loved to have had a refrigerator in room so we could have snacks and cold beverages, without breaking into the $$$ W snack/bev fridge. One must try the sexy fries and cocktails at the lounge bar! Oh and the bacon in the restaurant for breakfast, the best I have ever had! The W Seattle had set the bar with service, decor, comfort and style. Love it!

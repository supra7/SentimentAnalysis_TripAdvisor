I stayed at Roosevelt for 3 nights, specifically for a convention. The location is great as it is less than a block away and like other reviewers stated already, it's close to a bunch of shopping, food and pike market. I paid about ~$110 a night in a small Queen room, which is a great price consider a few flaws. I just can't justify if it's sub-$200 a night. Some of the *small* things to consider: not quite sound-proof, you can hear the dryers, the plumbings and your neighbors. Wireless is extra charge, though for some reason it has a strange way of counting what's considered one day (you get much less than 24 hours for $10 daily fee). Air conditioning/heat strong but a little loud. Overall it's a great place to stay for ~$110, but I wouldn't stay if it's close to ~$200 since there's many hotels in downtown Seattle and you can travel by bus (for free) or walk just about anywhere.

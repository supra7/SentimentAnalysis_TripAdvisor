I have to say we were all pleasantly pleased the more we discovered about this resort. The Hyatt and its' staff are a very first class operation and very accomodating. The facility was a mix of cultures and types, but every one of the guests were made to feel special and important, from the restaurant to the frontdesk, bellmen and housekeeping, if only for a few days. The staff was very well trained. And you could tell that training was continuous. Even the maintenance people that we encountered greeted us with a smile on their face and in their voice, and loved to use WE when describig their efforts to make the Hyatt the very best of an experience; this shows ownership. Hats off to management and all of the staff. The only downbside was the much hyped Luau at the Hyatt. It fell far short of the build up and was more of a buffet dinner with a show then a 'pricey' 'Experience'.

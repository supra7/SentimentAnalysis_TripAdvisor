This hotel was situated not even 50m from the Trevi Fountain and was easily accessible using public transport from the airport, if you don't have too much luggage. I had a single room, it was tiny, I had a family member assist me to get to the hotel, and when we were both in the room with my luggage, there wasn't too much room to move, but it was all part of the charm. My only qualm was that the bathroom and some of the corridors throughout the hotel had a mildew smell which my cousin said was what you find in old buildings in Rome. Apart from the bathroom (I learned to keep the door closed at night) I could not find fault with this hotel. The room was beautiful, albeit small. As it was an internal room it was very quiet and I enjoyed that I was able to open the doors, and not rely on airconditioning. I found the reception staff to be efficient and friendly. The staff at breakfast didn't really converse with anyone I recall being greeted only on one of the 3 days I had breakfast in the breakfast room.

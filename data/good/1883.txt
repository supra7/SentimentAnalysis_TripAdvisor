This was our second trip to a Westin property, and we our expectations were more than met. The best thing about this particular property was the view of the Seattle skyline. We were able to get upgraded to a corner room on one of the upper floors. At night, we were able to set up a tripod and take breath-taking photos of the Seattle skyline. The rest of the room was pretty standard, with a white, clean decor. Nothing spectacular there, but the location and the view made up for it. Would definitely recommend this property in its prefect location in downtown Seattle.

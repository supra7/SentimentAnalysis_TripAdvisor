- The hotel is located a few minutes from the inner harbor, the building is split between a HGI and a Homewood, same staff. -Check in was easy, the gentlemen at the front desk was allowed us to check in both our rooms earlier which doesn't always happen on a Sunday. Very friendly. -Rooms were clean and modern, on the 8th floor is a nice garden that overlooks the city. -Didn't spend much time at the hotel, so can't comment on it too much. -Check out was okay the girls were not very approachable. -Paying $24 to park was a little bit of a pain.

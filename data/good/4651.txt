I have stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel twice. I have had good experiences both times. I have read reviews complaining about the quality of the hotel for the price. They invariably say that they stayed at better hotels in Waikiki for less money. That is probably true, but these are two different islands with two different price structures. They are comparing apples to oranges. If you want to compare, compare to the Sheraton or Westin in Ka'anapali. You will find that the KBH is much cheaper than other Maui hotels. It is a good value for the price and a very friendly hotel. Steven

The hotel itself was fine. Clean, well laid out, nice employees etc. The pub on the second floor was another matter. Very slow service and the Texas Chilly on the menu comes right out of a can and you don't even get a roll or piece of bread. The draft costs a dollar more per glass (Pint?) than it should and the waiter tried to stiff me for one he forgot to deliver. I would stay here again only I would go 2 blocks down the road for draft at $4.50 a pint as well as better food.....

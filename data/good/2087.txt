We booked a Fri/Sat stay through Priceline and got a wonderful deal. After driving from San Francisco up the coast, we were hoping to find comfortable accommodations to relax in....we were taken aback by the Wonderful Heavenly Beds....the most comfortable thing I have ever laid on! We booked a room with a King bed and a sofa bed, and after a night on the town were disappointed to find the sofa bed was not made up. Rather than call downstairs and wait for someone to come up, the 3 of us slept in the King size bed and were pretty comfortable considering (the next day we had the sofa bed made up). Other than that, the room had a nice swivel tv, beautiful view of the city, nice furniture and bathroom, and we ended up on a "Preferred Guest Level" (we stopped off the elevator on other levels to see if each level was preferred, but we seemed to be one of the only ones!). I don't know exactly what benefits that gives you, but they did have fresh Washington apples on the table in the hallway each morning is almost next door). Parking was about $35 at the hotel, which is a little silly considering that there is a building next door that offers parking for $18, but it was nice to call down and have the car ready and waiting, although we really didn't use it once we checked in. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that they catered to a lot of bus tours, and there was almost always a wait to catch an elevator to get to your room. We tried to be evasive and go up or down a floor to pick it up without the traffic, but it never worked. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel.

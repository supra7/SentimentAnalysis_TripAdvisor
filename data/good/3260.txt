Beautiful ground but I did not like the food that much. Although it was a gormet food they did not give you very much. It was always like you are sampling food. I am not a big eater but I alwasy left not full. I guess it is good to lose waight but I do not go on vacation to do this. I would like to have had better portion sizes. I am not a big person so I think if you are you probably would not like this. Anyway it was a good experience and a very clean place with wonderful staff.

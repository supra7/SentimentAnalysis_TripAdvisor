We have just returned from a trip to Seattle and decided to try the Sheraton vs the older Westin. We stayed in the newer Union Tower. Our room was right off the elevator, however, there was very little noise that affected us. The room was bright and well appointed with modern decor. It was a little over 250 sq. (not very spacious, but adequate) The bathroom was excellent, and modern. The room was spotless. We used the pool facility which is modern and although, quite small, we enjoyed our time. Housekeeping was poor. on the first night, they cleaned the bathroom and emptied the garbage in the room. They just pulled covers over the beds and did nothing else. We had requested late checkout and they came into the room to do a partial clean while we were out. When we arrived to pack and clean up, she asked me not to use the bathroom as she had already cleaned it and reminded me that we needed to hurry as she was about to go off shift in half an hour. We did out thing and ignored her. The hotel is excellent value, but parking is a bit steep. (about $40 for a night). We did not eat at the hotel or use room service. we would definitely visit this hotel again when in Seattle.

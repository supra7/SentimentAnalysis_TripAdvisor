As I live on Maui's North shore and rarely stay on the west side its was very nice hotel. Large lawns and new pool area are great to chill out on or just head out to the beach for a swim, all very easy. Must hit the Tiki Bar and see Dale the longest running bartender in Ka'anapali,he has served over 400,000 Mai Tai's it's worth a stop. Located in the middle of Ka'anapali just steps from Whalers Village with its many shops and restaurants. Easy to walk right to Black Rock for some killer snorkeling and swimming, great for the kids and family.

We were on the 24th floor in a suite with an amazing view of the Space Needle and skyline. Both rooms had this amazing view through big windows. It was also very clean.The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful. Had great sushi at Japonessa, recommended by front desk. Downhill walk to Pike's Market, the walk back to the hotel is a great leg workout. We tool the new rail in from the airport. Super easy, clean and a great way to go green. We exited at the University station and walked a few blocks to hotel with rolling bags, easy to do. Coffee place every block. Easy walk to downtown shopping.

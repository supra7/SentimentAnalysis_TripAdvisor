We stayed at this property last Saturday night. Check in was efficient, although the front desk clerk seemed to have an attitude - couldn't have been colder. The room was on the sixth floor and was very clean with all the amenities. That night there was a lot of noise in the building which is a result of the atrium architecture; however, the bedroom part of the suite was very quiet. The manager's reception and the cooked to order breakfast were both crowded, but the service and seating were ample. The $10.00 charge for car parking is a bit off putting. The lots are next to the hotel, but the spaces are quite small. Considering the prices of hotels in downtown, this hotel is a good bargain and within thirty minutes of downstown Seattle and downtown Bellevue. Would stay there again.

We just returned from a wonderful vacation in Maui and stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, largely because of reviews on Trip Advisor. We had a beautiful ocean front room for a very affordable price.The hotel is located on the widest, most beautiful stretch of Kaanapali Beach. The ocean is also the best for swimming -- free of rocks and coral. That cannot be said for other area hotels. Check out the satellite views before booking. The hotel markets itself as the "most Hawaiian" and I really liked the low-key atmosphere. There is a welcome breakfast ( not a timeshare promo) with a buffet, entertainment and info about Maui, and activities each day. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. That said, the hotel is not the fanciest. It was very clean, but a bit dated. If you are looking for multiple pools, a luxury lobby etc. this is not the place. Also, the Whalers next door is undergoing renovation and we could hear the construction during the day from our room, but we were never there anyway. Might be a factor if you have little kids napping. I would definitely stay there again.

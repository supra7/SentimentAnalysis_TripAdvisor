Reception was perfect service and polite. Resort grounds are very appropriate to Maui's west coast - open air and tropical. For off-season stay (11/9-11/13), not too crowded and not too quiet. Pool is nice with a relatively full deck. Lots of family activities and variety of age group guests. Beach area is relatively narrow but a short walk north leads to wider beach. Accommodations were a litte more than above average and very clean. Beds are super comfy. Didn't book a room with view but only stayed in room to sleep. Nice athletic club which is part of the $15 resort fee. Hawaii just passed smoking law which may impact smoking around resort. 5 mins. to Lahaina to shop, dine, buy water/drinks/snacks at Safeway. 15 mins. to Kapalua, 45 mins. to main airport and start of Hana hwy. Passed on dining at resort to take advantage of dining at many different restaurants around Maui (local fast food and fine dining). You can always spend to do more things at resort (e.g., spa, cabanas, covered chairs on sand, snorkeling/diving, ...). Many options for activities or not doing anything at all. No charge for self-park. Would come back in a heartbeat.

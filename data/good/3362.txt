I think this hotel is located on one of the nicest beaches I have ever seen. From an all inclusive standpoint, we've visited 1 other Secrets and 2 Excellence Resorts. If we had not been to those we would probably have felt this place was perfect. The resort is clean, well maintained and very pretty. The food was pretty good in the places we ate. The staff is excellent. If you are celebrating a special occasion I would sign up for the dinner in the wine cellar. It was outstanding and you are the only couple in the room. The drawbacks were: 1) availability of beach palapas (we rented one for 3 days so we could be sure we had a place out of the sun.) The pool areas are smaller than some of the other resorts. There's a lot of basically useless pool space with water that's 6 inches deep. 2) reluctance or refusal to provide you with top shelf liquor in drinkds. the only place you were sure to get this was in the Preferred Club. We had one bartender tell us they didn't have Grand Marnier after the manager had previously offered it to us in a margarita. Of course that was after we bought an $85. bottle of tequila so we would have a good one for our drinks. The free wines are not very good and the ones you have to purchase are expensive. 3) not as much privacy as some of the other resorts We enjoyed our time at this resort but if we return to the area we will probably go back to Excellence Playa Muheres and stay in one of the top floor rooms with a private pool again.

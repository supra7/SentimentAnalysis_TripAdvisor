When we first arrived to the hotel we got a room that was normal sized with two beds and some furniture. The toilet roof had quite a lot of mold... But the room had no refridgerator and we asked if we could get a room with one. A member of the staff gave us another room that was HUGE! We asked how much we'd have to pay for this big room but he said we didn't need to pay more than for the other room, so we took it. This room was in better shape than the other, it didn't have visible mold but the toilet was still a bit moist and frowsy. The room had beds for 4 people and a cot for a baby but we really just used two of the beds since we were only two. It was divided in two rooms - a double bed in one room and two single beds in the other. There were also a TV (5 channels), cabinet, bureau, refridgerator, bureau with tea / coffee making things. The staff were great and very friendly. Even better than the last time we stayed here! They always asked how we were doing and had some casual small talk when we passed by. Overall the hotel is a little worn and scuffed but ok. Breakfast was good and there were quite a lot to choose from. Cereal, bread, cheese, selection of jams, juice, tea, coffee, milk. The breakfast ladies came and asked if we were done when we had finished and took our plates, mugs etc. The location of this hotel is great. The area might be a bit scruffy but it has everything you need - shops, food, pubs. And Finsbury Park is really nice! The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from the Underground, Railway and Bus station. Altogether I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and the staff were great.

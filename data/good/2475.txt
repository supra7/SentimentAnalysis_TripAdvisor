This funky old hotel is well located downtown for walking and for riding the light rail. We took the light rail from the airport to the end of the line (Westlake) and then walked 3 blocks to the hotel. Our room was a bit cut up with the tub in one room and the toilet and sink in another tiny room. I think there are other rooms with a standard layout, and I would ask for that. The price of $120 was good, and I would stay here again.

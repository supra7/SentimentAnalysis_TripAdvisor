We stayed for 2 nights in September and really enjoyed the hotel. The front desk people were friendly and ready to answer questions. The doors were always opened for us and staff were ready to help with luggage. The hotel has some beautiful features and it is charming. The rooms are small but quite comfortable. The location to everything was great - easy to walk to the market and shops.

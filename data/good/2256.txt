We stayed 2 nights in Seattle and chose this hotel after careful consideration. We were not disappointed - the service was friendly, the room was clean and the location was good. One minor drawback would be that the room felt a bit dark - I suppose it was 'mood lighting' but it was a bit too dark for us. The room was a good size and we enjoyed our stay there. The free internet is a massive bonus and the bathroom was lovely and big. (July 2011)

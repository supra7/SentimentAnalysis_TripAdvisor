The Westin location is perfect for exploring the city. Several blocks from Pikes Market and a short walk to the monorail (takes you to Space Needle) makes the location very good. Seattle is very hilly, but the blocks are relatively small so walking around is not too bad. It's interesting to see all the shops and buildings, that you can keep walking and then realize you're 15 blocks away from the Westin! Better to catch a taxi for longer distances. We got to the hotel early and were given keys immediately, much to my surprise and happiness. We were on the SPG floor, which really doesn't mean much except that they leave a bowl of apples near the elevator for guest to take. Linens and bath accessories are all great, what you've come to expect from the Westin. However, I stayed in this hotel twice within a 2 week period and both times they didn't leave enough towels in the room. I had to call housekeeping to have them deliver. Parking is VERY expensive in the city and in this hotel. I don't know why they have to charge so much, but what else can a guest do? On my second visit, I took the Greyhound Bus to the airport (Sea-Tac) which, for the price, it is a steal compared to a taxi ride. I would recommend it highly. It picks you up right outside the hotel. We ate at the top of the Space Needle. The food was not that outstanding for the price, but it does include a free trip up to the observation deck with the meal. Plus, you don't have to wait in line to go up with everyone else. For this reason, I think it was worth it. The best meal we had in Seattle was at the Canlis restaurant. The food and service were outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant for a nice night out (coats highly recommended). Ask for a seat next to the window for the view.

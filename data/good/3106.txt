The suite from Expedia was super cheap, nice and roomy with lots of amenities. The sitting balcony is a great bonus. The rooms needed a little attention to detail as far as repairs; the AC left a large puddle on the floor, furniture was a bit worn, but the room was very clean. Easy parking, walking or shuttle. Quiet rooms. Attentive staff. Good value.

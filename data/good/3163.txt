This hotel really impressed me in many ways. Very friendly & helpful staff. The bathroom was bright and roomy, 2 sinks, stand up shower and a large square tub. Lots of closet space, great little kitchen area supplied with good quality coffee (nespresso) & teas. The bedroom was comfortable but a little cramped.

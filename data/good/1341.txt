Great location, upscale romm and amenities, and a reasonable $130 night price through Priceline. The concierge was very nice and helpful to find a good restaurant on the harbor. The Space Needle was not the thing to do the day of boarding the cruise though; we were just a bit dizzy from the ride up & down.

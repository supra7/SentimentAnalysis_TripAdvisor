Pluses - rooms are very nice and clean, we were in an upgraded room and it is superb. Pool is wonderful and never a reason to save a chair because they are always available, you can even get a bed without a charge by the pool. Pool Staff is very friendly and accommodating, if you want top shelf liquor you can ask for it and they will gladly give you a pour. Also, go to the coffee bar - one of the best cappuccino I have ever had. Minuses - Food in the restaurants are fair. I asked for two different salads and they only brought one. They seem to limit you to one entre, the waiters don't speak great English and they really don't understand you. The Internet in the room didn't work well and was a huge pain. I had to relog into the service on a constant basis. if you have big parties of people it is very hard to get a reservation. We were at the resort with only 60 % occupancy and sometimes had to wait 30 minutes from a table. Overall I enjoyed my stay, but don't expect great food or good Internet service.

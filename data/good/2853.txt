We love the one bedroom suite. It is spacious and clean. The swimming pool is open 24 hours and we can swim late. The complimentary breakfast is great, although I can foresee problems when there are more people. We park on the side street which divides this hotel from the previous one. So we did not pay $10 a night. There are about 10 spots available. We also borrow Wifi on the side closest to Marriott's free wireless, which are at the swimming pool and the business centre. We will visit again!

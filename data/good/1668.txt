My husband and I stayed at the Edgewater because it was on his bucket list. Why? Well the views are unforgettable, it's within walking distance of Belltown, Downtown (a bit of a hoof but worth it) and Pike Market. He told me later that the Beatles and Led Zepplin stayed there as well. The good things about this hotel are the views, the helpful staff and the location. It was also one of the best night's sleep I've ever had. On the downside, wi-fi wasn't free, the hotel is starting to look a bit tatty and one small niggle about the service. When we arrived, our room wasn't ready. This didn't bother me. What did bother me is they said they would call when it was. They never did. We waited until after dinner before going back and asking. Yes, it's pricey. You're paying for the location and view.

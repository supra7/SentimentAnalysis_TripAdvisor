My daughter and I stayed at the Central Park Hotel for 3 nights at the start of February. After a late night flight we were very pleased that the Picaddily tube line went from the airport to Finsbury Park. Upon arrival chek in was smooth, was told the lift was broken but were on the first floor so wasnt too far to drag the suitcases up. Room was quite large, one double bed and one single. Plenty of towels and extra blankets and pillows in the wardrobe. One set of drawers and a tv, along with kettle, mugs and coffee/tea. Bathroom was a little gross, we put a plastic bag on the floor of the shower and there was almost no water pressure however water was hot and did the job. Breakfast composed of toast, spreads, ham and cheese, cereal and juice/coffee/tea. The staff were pleasant if not a little short however you get what you pay for, and considering what we paid I think this hotel is well worth it. Definately would stay there again..

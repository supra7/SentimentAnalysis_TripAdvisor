This hotel was a nice surprise. It was very charming with a very authentically Hawaiian feel. The staff is very friendly, the bar and restuarant is a nice place to spend your evening with a free live show every night. They turn down your bed and leave very tasty cookies, and their restuarant has the best Maui Onion soup in the world. Before you leave you must be part of there goodbye ceremony where they sing a song and place kukuis lays on you. Definitely a great stay.

It was our wedding anniversary vacation and our first trip to Hawaii. The room we got was perfect in every sense! It was spacious, tastefully decorated, romantic, very close to the beach, calm and relaxing (no ocean view for most of the rooms but that was not an issue for us). The interior looked and felt like that of a much more expensive hotel for the money we paid for. The kitchen was well equipped and helped us save some time and money. Although, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room, when we did, we felt very relaxed, and comfortable. Since the rooms are owned by individual owners and the one we got was recently renovated, there is no guarantee that the rest of the rooms are equally good. However, of the rooms that we accidentally got a peek at from the approach way to the beach, we did find most of them to be similarly equipped. The hotel is conveniently accessible (although a bit far from the airport) and close to the beach. The room service was excellent and the hotel staff were very courteous and helpful. Being located in the Kanaapali resort area, it is only a 10 min walk to the shopping mall and the Kanaapali beach access (with excellent views of the sunset). The only downside being, it takes a bit of a drive to reach to most of the other attractions on the island. But that was no issue for me as I totally enjoyed the curvey, beach side drive every time I took the route. Just make sure you don't get caught in the rush hr traffic in Lahaina in the morning and evening hrs. We finished our vacation with some great memories and would definitely stay again in this hotel if we happen to be here next time.

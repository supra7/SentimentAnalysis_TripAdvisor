My husband gave it a B+....cuz nothing gets an A with him. But I'll just say that everything was so lovely, easy, pleasant, yummy, service oriented...just great. For personal attention..ask for Gael at the concierge desk...she was incredible! The spa was so relaxing...great staff and incredible body workers...they really know what their doing and it makes such a huge difference when you're on the table. the hotel restaurant Umalu was super yummy. The only ick was that they served Starbucks coffee...ick (but if that's the only drawback I guess all's well, huh?)

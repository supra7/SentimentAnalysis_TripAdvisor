I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past. This was my first stay in the new tower. The rooms in the new tower are definitely nicer than the original tower. They are brighter with a fresher look. The original tower rooms are fine as well, they just aren't as nice. The pool area offers a great view of the city. Also, the location of the hotel is perfect - although parking is too expensive - more than any other hotel I've stayed at in Seattle. My only complaints, and they are minor, are that there is still some construction going on in the lobby area, so it has a slight feel of a construction zone with many areas hidden behind black curtains. It is minor though, my guess is they will be finished by the end of September. Also, the restaurant and lounge area is a bit disconnected from the hotel. I tend to prefer hotels with lobby bars, and this one does not.

If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel right in the middle of everything, then this hotel is for you. The first thing that I have to say about this hotel is that it isn't overly fancy, but the important things are there. The rooms are simple but very clean, beds are comfortable, and all the basic ammenities that you would need are available. For me, the best part about the hotel is where it is situated. There are restaurants and shopping galore right outside your doorstep. Pike Place Market is about a ten minute walk and for those of you that have never been there, I highly recommend you reserve some of your time to check it out. There are so many cool little shops with things that you probably wouldn't find anywhere else and the prices are pretty reasonable as well. Also, if you are wondering about where to go for a fantastic meal, I recommend going to The Cheesecake Factory which is basically right across the street from The Sheraton. Not only do they have about twenty different kinds of mouth-watering cheesecake to choose from, but they also have regular food as well with a fifteen page menu to choose from. We had the best waiter that I have ever had and he was completely honest with us about what was good on the menu and what was not so good and he made us feel like we had known him for years!If you decide to eat here I suggest that you either come early or eat late otherwise you will probably have at least an hour wait to get a table. One last thing I have to mention about the hotel is that they are undergoing construction until spring of 2007 so the outside is not that attractive right now and if you are going to book a room there I would maybe suggest that you ask for a room on another side. They automatically put us on another side and we did not hear a thing. There isn't anything that stood out about this hotel that was fantastic but there wasn't anything that was bad either so I would definately suggest a stay here.

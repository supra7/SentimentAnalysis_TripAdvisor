We booked a courtyard room on expedia but end up with an fantastic ocean view room. Not ocean front, but I can see the ocean and the beach from our bed. We also have mountain view on the other side which is very nice as well. The beach is literally 20-30 steps away from our room. We stayed in the Lanai wing. We were on the 6th floor and can see whales blowing and breeching from the balcony. It was terrific. The only real issue I have with the room is that even though the building itself is non-smoking; you can smoke in the lanai. Being on the top floor, sometimes we can smell smoke inside the room if we leave the balcony door open. The staff is friendly but really not any friendlier than other hotel staff I've encountered outside of Hawaii. I didn't really get any of the Aloha warm fuzzies from them. Maybe because I was expecting more. But as I said, they are friendly and helpful. The Friday night Hula dance show is wonderful. My kids went to all the hula shows and really enjoyed them. They also went to the lei making and hula classes. Great place for a family. The pool is okay but again the beach is only steps away. Snorkeling is also great at Black Rock (especially for beginners) and it's less than a quarter mile from the hotel. The other hotels in the area are definitely a lot fancier than KPH. We plan to come back to Maui soon (2011 I hope) and would definitely consider the KPH again.

We stayed at the Hyatt Regency for one week on our honeymoon and were very impressed. Not the Hyatt's fault but our neighbours on the first night were a very noisy family with screaming kids that started to crash around at 6.30am. When we reported this to the front desk they responded instantly so that 20 mins later we were in another (better) room in a quieter part of the hotel - they couldn't have been more responsive or helpful. The rest of our stay was perfect, the large pool was busy but peaceful with a kids area located the other side of a large rock/water feature. Food in all the restaurants was first class and staff were always very cheerful and ready to help. Whaler's village was a pleasant 20 min stroll along the beach path that was illuminated at night and the Hyatt is the closest Ka'anapali resort to Lahaina - where there are many good value bars and restaurants that offer an alternative to the hotel's (which would be expensive to eat in all week). We took a walk along all the other hotels on the strip and the Hyatt was clearly the peach. The Marriott next door was too big, with guests lined up on sun loungers over the lawns miles from the pool and bars and the beach at that point is very windy. The Sheraton has a great location but is just a bland concrete building with very little to offer around the beach & pool. Here comes the only negative: Hyatt run a series of room packages the include free breakfast and as a result guest had to queue for 20-45 mins every morning. I passed the restaurant at 6.30am on the way to a dive trip and there was already a queue! So this gives you 3 options: 1) Wait in line 2) Skip breakfast 3) Buy breakfast from the coffee bar in the lobby for $40.

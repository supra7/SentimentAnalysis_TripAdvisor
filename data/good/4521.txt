Overall we had a very good experience at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. They offer several different package deals and ours was called Leap into 2010. It included a partial ocean view room and the breakfast buffet each day. Partial ocean view is a little subjective as the ocean could only be seen from the balcony. I don't know if the package limited us to the Molokai wing but this is the oldest portion of the motel and it shows. There are no elevators in this wing but the building is only 3 stories tall. The shower and toilet were in a very confined portion of the bathroom. The grounds of the hotel are very nicely maintained and the hotel is located close the Black Rock to the north and Whalers Village to the south. The hotel is much more affordable than the other big name motels on this section of the beach. The staff was very friendly and and mostly local Hawaiians. There was hula and music each night near the Tiki Bar. They offer daily Hawaiian activities and a very good magic show in the showroom.

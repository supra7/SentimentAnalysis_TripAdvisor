Why an hotel when a condominium give you more space ? specialy that the Eldorado has a daily complementary room service. Do not have direct view to the Beach but quiet, and clean. 10 minute walking from the Wahlers villages for restorant and bars. Would have loved to have a Bar closer for romantic evening. The atttraction agency is expensive. you can find cheaper activity in Lanai. You need a car to go everywhere!

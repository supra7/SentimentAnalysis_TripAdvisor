The valet & Front Desk (evening and morning shifts) staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The location is convienent for both driving and walking around. The location of the TV in the room was about 15' from the bed and either I needed binoculars to watch or they need bigger TVs. Overall, I would stay again.

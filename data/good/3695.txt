Stayed here for our last night in the city. Location is fantastic, literally one minute down the street from the Trevi fountain and well within walking distance for everything else. The staff are fantastic, can't praise them enough. Very helpful and friendly and no request was any trouble for them. The only criticism we had was the damp problem in the breakfast room in the basement, the smell is overwhelming. Didn't notice this anywhere else though. Room was very clean and comfortable, the terrace had a great view of the city. Worth doing as other reviews here suggest and sneak out at 6am to have your own personal view of the Trevi fountain - rather than with the thousands of others there almost every other hour of the day! Would defintely stay again.

This hotel is within easy walking distance to Pike Market, the waterfront, shopping and numerous restaurants. We arrived Monday at about 11 AM and was upgraded to a room with a wet bar (no booze), fridge and jacuzzi. The room also had a safe which could be operated by choosing combination or a credit card. Read the directions first. The room was clean and fresh. There were plenty of towels and closet space and also a bathrobe for each of us. The staff was friendly and helpful. There was no ice machine on our floor but the maid brought ice each morning and afternoon. The lobby is stately and quiet as well as the bar and restaurantThe hotel is connected by walkway to the Westlake Center (shopping mall) which is the downtown stop for the monorail. We would definitely stay here again.

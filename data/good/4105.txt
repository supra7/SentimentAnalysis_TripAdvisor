We actually went March '08 on a great package. This hotel is in a good location and helped make Maui what we expected. A lot of scenic drives and a good quality hotel to return to each evening. One of our best dinners ever was at this hotel in the fine dining restaurant with the sunset...the wine, food and company made it non stop smiles on our faces. Definitely plan to eat at least one night at the nice restaurant arriving well before sunset and staying well after.

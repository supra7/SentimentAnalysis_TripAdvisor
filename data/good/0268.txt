This hotel has a perfect location - right next to Pike Place. The rooms are tastefully decorated, spacious and very comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the heating system in our room was quite noisy when it cycled on and off. Cafe Campagne is an amazingly good restaurant adjacent to the hotel with five-star food. Overall, a lovely boutique hotel well worth the expense.

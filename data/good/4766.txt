We've stayed at several condo's over the years, some nicer, some with better beach access, but we've decided that the Maui Eldorado offers the best combination for the cost. We love the Cabana and not having to drag towels, chairs, etc. is great. Its a short walk to the Whaler's Village Complex and there's a free shuttle we used everyday to haul our "gifts" back to our unit. I had no problem with parking and asked for the local papers delivered each morning. No problem. House keeping did a fine job and very friendly. As for the BBQ's, our unit, J210 (studio) had its own and we used it every other night. Check in/out was quick and painless. There is a small convience store next to the lobby which we found priced a little more than the Safeway (5 minutes away) but great for the forgotten bottle of wine or sixpack or whatever. Our unit, J210 was great! Really nice walk-in shower with optional overhead shower head. Free wireless. comfy bed. A/C which we didn't need. All-in-all. Great time was had. Highly recommend the morning whale watch with the Gemini outfit.

My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon. We had never been to Hawaii before and we really enjoyed this hotel. The atmosphere was amazing. We were right on the beach, the view from our hotel room was great, there was entertainment every day and great shopping along the ocean front. We had the chance to explore and eat some wonderful cuisine and take in some of the local shows as well. For being our first time in Hawaii and the first island we stopped at...we truly had a great first impression and will be back.

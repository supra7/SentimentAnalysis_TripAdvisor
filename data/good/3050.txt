I stayed here because my husband and son and I were going to be flying out at the airports but at different times. Thus a hotel with a shuttle. The shuttle is every 15 Minutes, I think. My husband flew out early but since my son and I didn't, we went to the gym and the outdoor heated pool. It was a great way to burn off energy before a flight. The food there is a little pricey though, but there is a Denney's a couple of blocks down and the hotel has an a la cart and a restaurant.

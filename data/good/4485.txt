This hotel lives up to its tag of being the most Hawaiian Hotel in Maui. It was amazing, although not as slick and polished as other hotels in the area it definitely makes up for it in character. The room was a great size and was clean and comfortable. The greatest thing about our experience here was the fact that from day one we were sent little gift and made to feel special. On arrival we had a bottle of champaign in our room waiting and every few days little cards and treat were left in our room. The hotel activities were based on Hawaiian culture which was amazing and although you are slap bang in the middle of corporate Ka'anapali beach area it was nice to still feel the traditions of Hawaii were being demonstrated. We tried Lei making, ukulele playing and saw reed making and wood carving demonstrations. The evening entertainment was brilliant and the ranges of bands playing were very talented. The tiki bar and restaurant were well worth being around and after some of the disappointing food and drinks we had in the whalers village it was nice to know we had good places to eat in our own hotel. With the Famous Ka'anaplai beach and point at the end of the hotels luscious gardens there was plenty to do and hire from the hotel. The staff were lovely and made us all feel so welcome especially Malihini Keahi who felt like our adoptive mum, always greeting us with smiles and warm hellos. Thank you for a great honeymoon and holiday.

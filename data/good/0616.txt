Nice hotel in good location in Downtown Seattle. Close to shoppipng and about 4 blocks to waterfront. Also close to light rail to airport. Hotel staff was quick and couteous on arrival. Room was nice but not large. Still very comfortablle for 2 and very clean. Small lobby but nice. Would stay again.

Stayed there last week end very nice friendly hotel rooms were a good size, comfortable beds, bathrooms very small and its really dark with the shower curtain closed. BUT there is always one I will never stay again because we were unable to park our car Yukon XL we were told it would not fit in their car park. We would have to park 3 blocks away they would not Valet it they were not helpful I tried we had 5 children with us they were not going to help. I really think they should explain when you book that you cannot get a large car into their car park other members of our party had smaller cars and were unable to park either .------but funny when we booked they said they had on site parking

The good: Wine hour - 5-6pm was nice Service - Very good - friendly & helpful Location - Excellent within walking distance of shopping, wonderful restaurants, Pike's Market etc. L'Occitane shampoo/conditioner/lotion and bar soap Nice robes - ask for slippers at the front desk Nice chocolates at turn down service :) Excellent price on HOTWIRE! Although they didn't specify this hotel (4 star) we were pleasantly surprised at 109.99 per night! A great value! The bad: Parking - 30.00 - street parking available after 6pm through 8am *The linen on one of the beds was not as clean as expected upon check in - but a call to housekeeping cleared it right up.

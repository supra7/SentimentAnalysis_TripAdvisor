Stayed here in May. Grounds are beautiful, rooms were updated,but not as nice as they could be.Balcony had a really bad paint job. Was a ocean view room, had to look between the trees and around the other buildings. Pool was small, but you are right on Kaanapali Beach so you could go there. They have a Beach walk that connects all the resorts in the area. It ran along the beach and had the Whalers Village on it. This is a little shopping center. Great places to eat in the Whalers Village also.

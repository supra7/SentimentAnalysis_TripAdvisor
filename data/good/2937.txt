I thought I'd try this instead of my normal hotel in Federal Way so that I wouldn't have to drive in inclement weather late at night. Seemed nice enough, sort of like an Embassy Suites with a covered atrium and large pool. Nicely appointed rooms. That's all I know since I was only there for about 8 hours!

We came to Venice for a short break and it couldn't have been better. Flew into Treviso with Ryan Air and took a short 40 minute bus journey (5 euro payable at the airport desk) into Venice. The hotel is then a 10 minute walk from the station. It is reasonably easy to find if you locate it on a map before you arrive and remeber what it looks like from the outside! We were checked in by very friendly staff, nothing is too much hassle and they recommend good places to see and eat and directions to the tourist spots. The rooms were clean and comfortable, complimentary toiletries, slippers, flat screen TV's and an Ipod dock. Breakfast was simple but just what you need, juices, tea, coffee, breads, pastries, meat, cheese, cerial, yoghurts and fresh fruit. It is only a 10-15 minute stroll to the rialto and a further 5 minutes to st marks square. The vaparetto (water bus) is just at the end of the street. We only used it once for the experience as everything is in walking distance of the hotel. Only negative point - The wireless internet doesn't work on the 2nd floor. We were offered an ethernet cable for a laptop but only needed it for our phone, the internet does work in the communal seatig area on the first floor though. Would definately go back!

I stay at this hotel once a year for a dance convention for my daughter. The indoor atrium style pool is awesome and the kids look so forward to it every year. In the area where you get rain 9 months out of the year, you have an indoor pool with an outdoor feel. We love staying there. The restaurant is pricey but pretty good. Customer service is average. The facililty has been recently updated though and the beds are very comfy and the rooms very clean. You have airport noise of course but it doesn't bother us much. We do love it here.

The hotel was a bit far from the central areas in Rome. It was a 30 minute Speed walk from the hotel to the Collesium. But wonderful area with plenty of shops and places to eat in the area. Plus there are a few subway stops right around the corner and you can be to many places within 5 to 10 minutes. I am a pretty light sleeper and did well during my stay here. The beds were ok but the comforters were very fluffy. They were doing a lot of renavating during mine and my friends stay so there was a lot of construction equipment around and people working. Not all areas were open. But it served our purpose of a nice, safe place to rest at the end of a long day. I would recommend this hotel to friends.

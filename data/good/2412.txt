Friends in American book this hotel and was really looking forward to staying at the W, as had heard about this chain. The hotel is situated within the financial district, however is only a 10 mins walk to Pike Place Market and the Monorail to the Space Needle. Our friends advised they had booked 2 spectacular rooms, but were not available on check in. (We had got a really good price on the room) Our room was not made up, but as only dropping things off and then out to explore the city was not too concerned. On return found an apology card and chocs! Beds were really comfortable and had good nights sleep. However on the 2nd night we spilt water on bed and turned the bottom quilted mattress around to find a huge stain ! We were leaving the next day, and as friends had paid for 1 night as a gift to my fiance and I, did not want to say anything in front of them. On return to hotel on 2nd night found a DJ in reception and a party going on. Luckily neither of us on the 4th and 12th floor, did not hear anything. Our friends were travelling with their 15 month old son and had called to ask about a cot and were told to bring their travel cot. When looking through the hotel information pack it clearly stated that cots were available and to call to request one. Overall the hotel rooms were spacious and found them very comfortable. The reception staff friendly. If you are looking for a good nights sleep and like a boutique style hotel this is ideal. Hotel parking very expensive around $44 a day !!! Found one around the corner for $52 for the 2 days !

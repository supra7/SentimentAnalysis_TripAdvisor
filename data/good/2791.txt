Very nice hotel, very close to the airport, walkable in fact to the terminals in less than 10 minutes or one can take a free shuttle bus. Check-in was friendly and quick, and one receives a nice warm chocolate chip cookie along with the room key. Large spacious lobby, clean comfortable rooms. Flat screen TV with many stations available. Internet available in the room for a fee or free wifi in lobby. There are also complimentary computers to use also. There is a stand alone kiosk which one may use to check in for flights. All major airlines are represented. Can not speak to the dining aspect of the hotel as I did not eat there. All in all, a nice place to stay before or after the flight.

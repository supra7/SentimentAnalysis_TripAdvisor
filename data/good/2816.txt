Stayed for one night before catching a flight out of Sea-tac Airport. Booked thru hotwire and got such a great price ($69) we were worried what we'd be getting.... We were very pleasantly suprised!! We were greeted by very nice front desk staff and were given the Doubletree warm welcome cookies...what a nice touch! The room was very clean, cozy and very quiet even though it was so close to the airport. The hotel it's self was huge, but yet it still felt very comfortable. It has that "west-coast" feel to it with lots of wood and glimpses of green forrest outside. The beds were amazing. The restaurant was quite good considering it's not "downtown". The food was decent as was the wine selection. We will definately stay here again.

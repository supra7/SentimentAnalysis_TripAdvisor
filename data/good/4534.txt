My wife and I have vacationed in Hawaii long enough to see a transformation from a cultural community to a capitalistic economy. If you don't understand what I mean, then by all means, have a stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for a taste of old style. From the beach, you can turn right and walk down to Black Rock and get some snorkling in. Turn left and you make your way to Whalers Village where you can find everything from Gucci bags to shave ice. Pay a little extra for the breakfast buffet when you book your room....mmmm...good. Along with all the usual breakfast foods, the fresh fruit, miso soup and portuguese sausage is outstanding! There are plenty of activities through out the day and hula shows every night. Enjoy!

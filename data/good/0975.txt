I like staying in a highrise hotel at night, looking out the windows, and think about life. I find the Renaissance is a good place to do so. I stay in the suites, which are a good size and nicely decorated. The views are good, but mostly of other buildings rather than the Sound or the Space Needle. I bring my dog who likes to look out the window and watch the cats in the highrise condos nearby. The staff is very helpful. This may be due in part because I have Marriott Rewards status. I recommend this hotel, though it is far from the best hotel I've stayed in. As I write this review, I see a number of other reviews of guests who stayed New Year's weekend. My room on the 19th floor was quiet and I had a good weekend at the hotel. I could see the top of the Space Needle and watched the fireworks.

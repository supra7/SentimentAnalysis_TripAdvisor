Stayed at this property for one night prior to an early AM flight with my wife and two small children. Used the park and fly package. Valet parking was effortless as was the check in. By being a Hilton honors member, received complimentary wi-fi as a special they were promoting in the month of February. Had bellmen escort us to our double King room on the ground level facing the courtyard and pool area. Room was spacious and very well appointed. Beds were typical Hilton beds with nice furniture and an old school 32 inch tube tv. Pretty sure those will get upgraded soon! Bathroom was pretty darn small but sufficient for what we needed. No tub in this room just a walk in shower. Room thermostat control worked great and our room was incredibly quiet. It was located towards the conference center, so I imagine during a conference could be a loud, but on this night not a sound. We used the outdoor hot tub. It was a moderate 45 degrees outside, so the hot tub felt good. Fun for my son to watch the planes take off while sitting in the hot tub. no cover on the hot tub so if it rains., you get the cold drops. Could have been a bit warmer, but it was nice to jump into. Complimentary airport shuttle goes every 20 minutes so plan accordingly. Shuttle departs at 5, 25 and 45 past each hour. The property is directly across the street from seatac so this is a quick trip to and from the airport. Return shuttle again comes every 20 minutes. They called for our car on the return shuttle trip and it was waiting when we got out of the car. They have a great steakhouse in Spencers on site at the property. Did not eat there but am sure the meals are excellent as Spencers usually are. This was a clean property that folks here actually care about what they are doing. Every person working said hello and was professional. Outstanding Hilton Property. I will for sure want to stay here again. Thank you to the management and the team at this Hilton for a great stay.

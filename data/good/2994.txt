Having read the reviews I was dubious about booking this hotel. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. For the money it was excellent. I stayed here on 2 seperate nights (1 in June and 1 in July) before and after a trip to Alaska. On both occasions I arrived late and the staff were excellent checking me in. They were freindly and efficient. I had a lot of heavy kit with me and they assisted with my bags. As I left before breakfast on the first occasion they offered me a picnic which was ready as promised. On the second occasion the breakfast was adequate to set me up for a day's sightseeing in Seattle. There is a reasonably priced hotel bus which will pick up and take you into the city dropping near the Pike Place Market. (I paid just $14 for a return trip). The room was clean and I found the hotel very quiet. That may be becuase I always travel with and use earplugs. As a single female traveller I would definetly recommend this hotel and would happily stay there again.

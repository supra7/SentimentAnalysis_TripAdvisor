This hotel is in the perfect location while staying in Seattle. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with in room coffee, plenty of fresh clean towels and a very nice breakfast with waffles, sausages and the usual continental spread. you can aslo get water and coffee in the lobby 24 hours. The pool area looked very nie with a nice view but we were there in late October so it was closed but the hot tub was open. There is free wifi. and two computers in the lobby and printers. You can walk to the needle and Monorail. Try Seeks Pizza and Sports Bar and Grill just around the corner. Pikes Market Place, Olympic Sculpture Park and the water front is also walkable if you are up to it. It is a pretty walk. But if not, take the monorail to West lake Center. I hope to return to Seattle and I will stay here.

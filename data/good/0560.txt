We've previously stayed at "historic boutique" hotels before and have been disappointed. However, the MarQueen definitely exceeded our highest expectations! The history behind the hotel is very interesting, and photos with detailed captions describing the history are located throughout the hotel. The staff was helpful, friendly, and attentive. The newly added continental breakfast was delicious, especially the coffee! And the rooms were the best!!! Loved the decor, large comfy bed, full kitchen (with dishes and utensils), and lots of room! Also enjoyed the hotel-provided shampoo, conditioner, lotion, oatmeal soap, and aromotherapy patches to assist in a restful night's sleep. The location was great, too! Within blocks of the Space Needle and a short drive to downtown Seattle. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again!

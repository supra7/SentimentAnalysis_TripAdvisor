We stayed here recently for a week. It was lovely...the room is a touch dated but everything was clean and worked perfectly. the real selling point of this hotel is the immaculate gardens and grounds. We had a pool view room so our lanai looked out onto the most gorgeous greenery, trees, flowers and manicured lawns. People were just chilling under the shade or by the pool...very relaxed. Another great feature is the Hawaiian activities they offer...for kids and adults and also the passport system for kids. Worked really well... I will agree with others that the food wasn't fantastic - we only ate at the Tiki Grill and it was heavily reliant on deep fried food. But it's not a restaurant per se, so I guess is geared at offering bar snacks only. The Hula shows and live music every night are fantastic. The hotel is in a great spot, walking distance to Whalers Village and with a beautiful beach right out the front close to Black Rock. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend. Staff were great too

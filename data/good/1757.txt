would never stay anywhere else in seattle. last trip, with 120 lb, chesapeake bay retriever, was a joy. very dog friendly. view from room of ferry traffic on elliot bay enchanting. you are actually over the water. room service excellent. free valet parking with some online offers. easy walk to the new sculpture park. nice in-house restaurant. room adequate, but not spectacular. go for the view, location, and ambience. take your dog.

This is probably the best Hilton properties in the states. Located right on the bay, you get amazing views of the city and Coronado Island. The hotel is clean, crisp and the staff from the valet to the front desk were accommodating. We were given a room in the 19th floor overlooking the city/bay area. The hotel loses points for having a giant ad on the north facing side of the hotel. It made our room darker as it prevented sunlight from coming in. HH rejoice! Free appetizers in the Vela bar for each night stay. You also get the standard continental breakfast from the Starbucks on the ground level, however for $10 you can upgrade to the Buffet. Overall, a very good experience and I would stay here in a heartbeat. The hotel is situated next to the convention center and across the street from the Stadium. Easy to walk in Downtown or a short cab ride.

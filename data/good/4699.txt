We only stayed for one night and enjoyed every minute of it here. The hotel was a bit tricky to find, as other reviewers have stated. The decor is modern and colorful, full of character. The employees were very kind and welcoming. The only complaint is in the bathroom. The glass shower door would leak water and leave the floor wet. Not a big deal, but it did cause it to be slippery. Wish all our hotels that we stayed in during the trip were this beautiful!

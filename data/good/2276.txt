Headed up to Seattle to go to Woodinville wine country, so it was great that Priceline gave us a hotel whose decor and activities revolve around Washington wines. Each room is named after a Washington winery, and one of the hotel's TV channels broadcasts a WA wine country documentary 24/7. Cool stuff. Service is VERY friendly, and the small-ish lobby is like going back in time a century or so. And although we didn't take advantage, a different winery does a tasting in the lobby for guests every afternoon. Location was terrific (7 short blocks from Pike Place Market, and a similar distance to Westlake Center, gateway to the Seattle Center monorail). The rooms were clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. Two negatives keep it from being a 5-star on TripAdvisor for me. First, our 2nd floor room was at street level (Downtown Seattle is very hilly). Street noise was minimal to nonexistent, but more of a view would have been nice. One of the hazards of Priceline, I suppose. Second, overnight parking was $30. Steep. That said, I can definitely recommend the hotel and would stay here again without hesitation.

We stayed 5 nights at this hotel. It was roughly half the price of the Westin, located down the beach, where we had reservations for the other 4 nights of our vacation. I have to say that in terms of relaxation, this hotel was tops! There was no competition for pool chairs, and the staff was wonderful There are numerous hawaiian cultural classes for free, such as hula dancing, lei making or even pineapple cutting. The sunday brunch is amazing. Our rooms were very comfortable and well appointed. The lawn area in front of the hotel was huge with ample shade trees and lounge chairs. We will definitely return here in the future!!

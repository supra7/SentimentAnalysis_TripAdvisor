Arrived about 10pm on Saturday 9-20-09. Nice place close to airport that provides a free shuttle. Went to check in desk and was surprised to find several people waiting to check in. Three people were working the counter, but about 9 couples were waiting to check in. I waited for my turn and was put off by hotel staff taking flight crew that arrived well after us ahead of everyone else waiting to check in. Situation got a little heated when a lady asked why they were being taken before her and a flight attendant stated (not very smart) they were tired from flying all day, had to fly out in the morning and didn't have time to waste in line. The lady answered they had been travelling all day from east coast and were tired, too. I lay responsibility for the exchange on the hotel not stepping in. The hotel does have a sign for a separate check in and should have taken them to that counter for the flight crews. I personally would rather wait a few minutes and have a rested flight crew to take me home. Also, I don't want to be involved in someone's argument at 10pm. Anyway, we checked in to a room (they give you each a hot chocolate chip cookie at check in) on the first floor of Building 5 which is a bit of a hike from check in. Put stuff in the room and went back to hotel bar. Ordered some food and drinks, watched sports highlights on big screens and went back to room. Decent food at good prices. The best was the clam chowder and Alaskan Amber Ale. Room was a comfortable king bed with a nice small patio. Room had coffee maker, big screen tv, desk and 2 chairs and a nice bathroom. Hotel has a big pool that has lots of sitting and is open late/early. Had a nice breakfast in front area called Coffee Garden. Very good food at good prices. I would recommend a stop here anytime.

Just returned from a brief stay at EDM.The service was wonderful, and the staff went out of its way to please - at times it was too much as we were offered drinks, waters, activities, etc 4x within an hour while laying on the beach. The palapas all over the property are wonderful, with plenty available for everyone. I was not thrilled with our room - we stayed in the older part of the hotel. We were first offered a room on the ground floor but when I stepped onto the balcony for the famous ocean front I could literally touch the ladies selling souvenirs as well as people sitting around the pool bar. No privacy! We moved to the second floor but you are really getting a pool way with the ocean behind the bushes. I guess I should have splurged for the newer rooms. the reason I did not rate this a 5 is the food. I guess after visiting the Royal Hideaway last year I was expecting same caliber food. Breakfast and lunch were very nice but dinners were somewhat disappointing. The Japanese restaurant was mediocre if you ever had real Japanese food in a big city like NY. Again, I was not expecting MASA or anything but the summer rolls were not edible and sushi was barely OK. The Italian dinner at Sabores did have a lovely opera singer but the pasta was mushy and overcooked. Sabores on another night was inconsistent with some dishes better than others although presentation was perfect. Overall, it is a lovely quiet romantic place. If the food were raised a notch it would be true paradise.

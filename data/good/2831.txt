First I'll say that we got a great rate at Priceline, far below the travel websites prices for this stay, so we are all-in-all very pleased with our stay. The room's carpet had a lot of black stains - far more than I'd consider acceptable. But everything else was very nice and clean. The parking is outrageous at $17+tax per day, but it's not a hidden fee so you can make up your own mind. They do have a free 24-hour airport shuttle that we used to get a rental car at the airport daily and it was very convenient. What wasn't convenient is the business center. It's a 3 minute walk from the front desk, and they require that you get a new access card each time you visit it from the front desk. But 80% of the time, it won' work. We had to go back REPEATEDLY throughout our stay to get new cards. Others we encountered had the exact same problem. It will work once, then stop working 10 minutes later. It's a terrible system - just let my room key access the business center (which consists of nothing but three computers and a printer anyhow!) But we do recommend the hotel. Just bring your own laptop and pay for the internet I guess.

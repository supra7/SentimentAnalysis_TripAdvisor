The hotel is close to a main road but we slept just great , it did not bother us at all ...I personally did not hear any noise that would keep me up. The staff were very friendly , they helped us with maps , information ...etc The room was confortable and clean with a nice bed. Breakfast was sufficient but nothing fancy , however , the coffee was dissapointing ...I expected nicer coffee in seattle.

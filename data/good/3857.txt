Hotel was in a great location. Could walk to Seaport Village, and Gaslamp district which are full of shops and restaurants (and great night life). Hotel is on the bay which provided terrific view of boats, yachts etc. The hotel was clean, had bar and restaurant, but the best feature is the outdoor seating, fire bowl and heaters. We sat outside every night and enjoyed drinks by the fire.

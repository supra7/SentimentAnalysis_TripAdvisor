For purposes of convenience of its location being adjacent to the convention center, I give it an A rating. It's clean and the towels are plush, but in this day and age, why charge $15 a day for Internet? I don't get it at all. there's no ref in the room. Altogether, stay was fine but I don't think I will be going back. There are other nicer hotels in the area which offer more convenience without extra charges. Parking is even steep!

We visited Seattle last year and stayed a few days the Renaissance. It was a nice hotel. Great rooms, good size but always my all time pet peeve, two full beds in stead of one and when theres only the two of us, the extra bed is wasted space! Great overpriced mom and pops convenience store down stairs. BAR closed too early. Staff was accommodating and pleasurable. Room service was quick! Food was decent. I had clam chowder. We mostly ate out because thats why one visits Seattle right? We had great sushi at a spot down the hill and over tone to two blocks to the right (not left) but cant remember the name with great ambiance. (The only thing that sucked was that we came in at happy hour, but they charged us full price. We were so happy when the bill came since we were eating sushi and drinking on an empty stomach that we didnt check the prices before paying). Parking was affordable and convenient for when we wanted to venture out far at night Overall, if youre in Seattle to view the city, its a great hotel.

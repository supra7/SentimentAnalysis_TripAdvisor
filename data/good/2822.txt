My husband and I stayed here for one night prior to our Alaskan cruise. Although we arrived after midnight, the free shuttle was there to pick us up within a few minutes. Check in was smooth, and the warm cookies were a very nice touch. The room was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. We had booked a package that included the room + shuttle to the pier. I was contacted by the hotel a couple of weeks before our trip to reconfirm our reservation, and to find out what ship we were sailing on so they could schedule the shuttle to fit our needs. The shuttle got us to the ship in plenty of time, and with no hassles at all. Overall, I would highly recommend the Seattle Airport Doubletree if you are arriving before a cruise. Very friendly staff, and lovely rooms.

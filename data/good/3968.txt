This hotel has got a great location and the quality of this new hotel is impecable. The hotel is sited right on the bayside, and if you get a room on the right side you get great views over both downtown, bay, petco park, and gaslamp quarter. The quality of the room are as mentioned excellent but the room are small compared to the price you pay. The pool area is an excellent place for relaxing and the restaurants connected to the hotel has both great service and great taste. What i found a bit negative is that they charge extra for several cost, like using the internet and breakfast. They offer different internet connection varying from normal speed to high speed connections. I don't understand how a accknowledge hotel as hilton don't offter the normal speed line free of use. Not sure I would choose this hotel again.

Stayed at the KBH near Black Rock for a week...kids loved it. It isn't glamorous, glitzy or hip...not techno savy either, but hey, on vacation I am NOT answering a cell, going online or doing business. Rooms are ok...not the ritz, but good for a beach trip. Location is fantastic. Tiki Terrace is good, Tiki grill is standard. bar is good. Mixed Plate breakfast place should be skipped. Staff is the most friendly Hawaiian staff that I have ever encountered. Makes up for all the other items of the hotel. May even get me to return to Hawaii.

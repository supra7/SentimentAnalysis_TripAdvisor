I had a late flight from East Coast that meant I would arrive at SEATAC at what would be "my 1 a.m." so I chose to stay at this hotel. I am very glad that I did. The airport shuttle arrived soon after I had claimed luggage and made my way to the pick-up point. The driver was friendly and helpfu. Upon arrival I was greeted warmly by the front desk and had no problems checking in. The room was on the main floor and I had requested a higher floor, but it was not a problem. The room was very quiet and looked onto the interior atrium. The room was nicely appointed and the bed very comfortable. There was good water pressure but the towels did have a sour smell. Once when walking down the hallway I stopped at a maid's cart to sniff the towels on it -- same not so pleasant odor. I had breakfast in the concierge room and it was very busy and a bit cramped, but the staff was doing a good job clearing tables, apologizing, and trying to make it work. Since I was up early I took a walk down to the light rail station which is right down the hill. It was very convenient and I was pleased to use it to get downtown to the hotel I stayed in for the next night. The light rail takes about as long as a taxi into Seattle, but it is clean and pleasant. SEATAC is about a half hour from downtown so I did not want to make this my destination hotel. It was great for my purposes and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place near SEATAC.

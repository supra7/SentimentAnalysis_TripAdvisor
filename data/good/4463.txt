The hotel was different from the others in the area - definitely Hawaiian, not the run-of-the-mill chain. While our room was billed as partial ocean view and had a nice balcony/lanai, it overlooked a tennis court that was being used for construction storage. The buffet breakfast was very good, but we were disappointed in dinner so usually ate elsewhere. Most of the staff were very friendly and were committed to the Hawaiian experience. The farewell ceremony and daily activities were nice and in the spirit of the hotel.

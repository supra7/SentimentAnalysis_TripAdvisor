We stayed here for a friend's wedding because it was one of the hotels that had the wedding discount rate. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the valet parking is a great value ($20/day). Super convenient location to Pike Place Market and surrounding shops/restaurants. We had a car but the light rail is right downstairs if you're coming from the airport and the monorail (also right there) takes you to the Space Needle. Our room on a high floor was a bit on the small side but it was very clean and had ample electrical outlets (I find that older buildings usually don't have enough outlets). The bathroom was nice but the showerhead was really low so not very good for tall people. My partner is 6 feet tall so he had to stoop a little. The water pressure sucked so it was more like a sprinkle than a shower. We didn't ask to change rooms since it was only for 2 nights. There is a small gym that's decent and we made use of it but unfortunately, it is not open 24 hrs. Cocktails and appetizers at Oliver's were quite enjoyable although overall, I'd say hotel and bar guests are on the other side of 50 (read: Gramps would love it). In hindsight, I could probably have found a less expensive room in the same area and one where there was a hotel loyalty program but we were content staying here and it's especially great for the proximity to the wedding venue.

Nicely renovated hip boutique hotel in Seattle. Near Belltown restaurants and shops. Great location. You can walk to Space Needle (or take monorail), downtown shops and Pike Place Market where the original Starbucks is. We had a huge suite with plasma tv and Frette linens. We paid $229 which was a very good rate for a room that size. Lola, a modern Greek restaurant is in the hotel. The breakfast was outstanding. We did not make advance reservations so we could not get in there for dinner but other restaurants owned by the same chef, Seattle legend Tom Douglas, are very closeby. Service was friendly and extremely helpful. I wouldn't stay anwhere else in Seattle

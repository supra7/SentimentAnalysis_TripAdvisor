We stayed at the Sheraton Seattle over Labor Day weekend and had a pretty decent stay. There was a video game convention in town (PAX) and it was nice to see that the convention-goers were allowed to set up all their games and hang out in the Sheraton lobby. This lent a bit of personality to an otherwise corporate chain hotel. Our stay was without incident, but it was nothing special, either. The service was pretty impersonal. The fees at this particular hotel were much higher than what I've seen at other Sheratons and hotel chains--I tried to get a spoon in the room (to eat my home-brought oatmeal with), but I was told there would be a charge of $3.00. I've gotten silverware from similar-class Marriotts for free. If you can take a walk over to the Specialty cafe near 5th street, snacks will be a lot cheaper than hitting up the cafe in the lobby of the hotel. And I really wish internet fees would be included in room rates, or at least not be per device... The gym and pool were some of the best I've seen at a hotel, with an awesome view of the city. I'd recommend stopping by even if you don't plan to swim or workout. Another plus is that this hotel is just about a 10 minute walk from Pike Place Market. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, though I know there are some more boutique and personal hotels I might stay in next time.

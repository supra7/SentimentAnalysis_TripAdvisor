We stayed here for an extended weekend in October 2009. We got a great deal on a suite which was perfect for giving our 2 kids, age 2 and 4, enough space to run around and stay separated if they wished. My kids slept on the pull-out couch in the large living area and we slept in the attached bedroom. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the aquarium and the wharf area, as well as a nice shopping mall down the street where we had our meals (we didn't eat in the attached restaurant although several Seattle natives recommended it to us). Overall the hotel is clean and cozy with a modern and tasteful decor. With a great deal like this I would definitely stay here again.

We stayed at this hotel twice in April for one night each one week apart. We chose this hotel because we've stayed at Hamptons in other locations and know they offer a quality stay for a reasonable price including a nice breakfast. We were also wanting to acquire Hilton Honors points. This was a typical Hampton, and we really had no complaints. In fact, the service was excellent: They even allowed us to store a medium size duffel bag in their lock-up between stays at no fee. Also, our airport shuttle drivers were very nice, and in the evenings upon arrival made restaurant recommendations and provided free transportation to and from. But, that being said, the location is a bit removed from some of the local restaurants, although we like to walk so this was not a major problem. The only other comment is that the physical layout of the hotel is somewhat strange - the elevator being at the far end of the hall from the lobby. Also, if you are fussy about bathrooms, there is very little counter space around the sink. But all this being said, this Hampton Inn certainly met our needs for a place to sleep near the airport between flights.

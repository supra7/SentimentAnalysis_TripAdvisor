I have been staying at Madras Hotel in Singapore regularly since 2000. Good location in Little India close to vegetarian restaurants. Rooms are clean but spartan. Bathrooms have great hot water with excellent pressure. For clean cheap accommodation with great location cannot be beaten. Don't eat breakfast at hotel. Go to Komala Vilas for dosai or idly. Avoid ground floor rooms as these tend to be used on an hourly basis by local working girls.

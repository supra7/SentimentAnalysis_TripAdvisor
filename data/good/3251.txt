We stayed at this hotel for ten nights while on a disney holiday. The hotel was great, beds were comfy and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The continental breakfast was fairly good in general / excellent for the price. The only issues we had were the lack of a shuttle bus to the parks and difficulty with the public transport as a result. If you were to stay here we would suggest you take a car or use the taxi service recommended by the hotel (Julia's Transportation) they were fabulous. We would recommend this hotel as a cheap alternative to staying in the resorts. Reeny.

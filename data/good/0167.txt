We stayed at the Warwick for two nights after an Alaskan cruise. We stayed there basically because we could get a smoking room. The hotel was only a $15 cab ride from Pier 91 and we arrived at 10.00 am so we went for a walk to the Space Needle which took about 15 minutes slowly. Our room was ready by 12.30 and was great. Naturally there was some smoke smell but we have had worse in supposed non smoking hotels. We were on the ninth floor looking toward the needle. The beds were 5 star standard and we had a bath as well. There is a free computer room downstairs so I din not check out the wifi. There were lots of places to eat nearby and a subway 50 yards away. The staff were very friendly and competent and the concierge Joe knew everything about Seattle. We paid about $150 per night which we thought was very good value. We will be back. We should have stayed three nights as one day was not enough at The Museum of Flight which would be of interest to everybody not just flying enthusiasts.

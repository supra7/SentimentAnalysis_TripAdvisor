Booked a weekend through Luxury Link, which included gift cards for food at the restaurant downstairs, champagne, and chocolate strawberries. The rooms were nice. Quite spacious with beautiful linens. Frette towels and Face Stockholm toiletries. I only gave it 4* because I thought the service was OK, but not spectacular. There was nothing wrong, but they were not particularly friendly or helpful for a hotel that costs over $200 a night. The restaurant downstairs is good - very busy with locals. The Tom Douglas pizza restaurant is fabulous. It's only a block or 2 away. I"m not sure it was open when I stayed at the Andra, but I subsequently visited the restaurant and it was great! It was easy to walk to the central shopping area (less than 5 blocks) or down to Pike Place Market. We also walked to the Seahawks game. There is a block or 2 where I felt a bit uneasy (it's dark and there are homeless people in the doorways), but there were two of us so it was fine. I probably wouldn't walk as a female on my own. All in all, a nice weekend and a lovely intimate hotel.

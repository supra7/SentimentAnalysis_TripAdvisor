The Renaissance Hotel in Seattle, WA is an excellent place to stay on business. The rooms are large and comfortable and the hotel is equipped with all of the usual amenitites--fitness center, restaurant, lounge, etc. What makes this hotel particularly outstanding, however, is the concierge. He made restaurant reservations for me on multiple nights and all of recommendations were superb. The hotel is within easy walking distance of nearly everything in downtown Seattle. If I had one complaint about this hotel, it's that it charges for internet access in the rooms.

I stayed at this hotel in July 2009. My room was pretty small and it was hard for both my husband and I to try to move around at the same time. That being said, the bed was comfortable, the television was nice, and we had a good location and could walk to most everything. This hotel seems like it's trying to be a W, but on the cheaper side. It is not a luxury hotel - but a somewhat trendy and cute place to stay without breaking the bank. The bathroom was a little stark, but, again, it was not a very expensive place. For the money, this place was quite nice.

First let me say that we like old hotels. If you are the Holiday Inn Express type, this is not for you. The Inn at Virginia Mason was built in the late 20's, and has been well restored and maintained. Carpet, furnishings and decor were good quality, in good condition and stylistically appropriate for the era. The bathroom was small but all the plumbing was modern and functional. The hot water room heating system was unusual: like a giant valence hung from the ceiling across the tops of the windows. It kept the room at a comfortable 72-76 deg F (no matter where the wall thermostat was set). The restaurant menu was small but the food and service excellent. The location is exceptionally convenient if you have business at Virgina Mason Clinic or Hospital. The Inn is connected to the clinic, so you can get to any department without going outside (or climbing any hills). It's about a 15-20 minute walk to downtown and Pike Place Market (double that back up the hill). Bus service on routes 10/12 will get you there quickly and cheaply. While you are at the Inn, cross the street to the Baroness Hotel and check out its beautiful Art Deco lobby.

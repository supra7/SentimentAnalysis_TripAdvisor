Our Travel Agent booked this Hotel as part of a Cruise and stay holiday. Before we left, we read with dismay the majority of the reviews on the Crowne Plaza Hotel Seattle. On arrival we were surprised to find that our room (on the 19th floor) was much better than average - large, well equipped and very clean with two Queen size beds. We thought that the decor was nice, a little Art Deco but we liked that. We also found that the lifts were no problem at all and we used them several times during our two night stay. All in all we were extremely satisfied with the Hotel. We have to agree with the comments about the noisy Air Conditioning units but although the weather was beautiful during our stay, we had no need to use it at night so it wasn't a problem to us. I have stayed in several Hotels worldwide both for business and pleasure and this is certainly one of the better ones I have stayed at.

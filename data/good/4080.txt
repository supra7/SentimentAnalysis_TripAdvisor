My husband and I just came back from a week stay at the Hyatt and we can't say enough good things about it! The hotel is very nice and the room we stayed in was terrific. The service was great as well. We ate at the 2 restaurants at the Hyatt and were impressed with both. Service at the restaurants and by the pool were top notch! Whatever we asked for or needed always came quickly and everyone was so friendly. The only negative encounter we had was with the concierge desk. The few times we went down to speak with someone they either seemed to rush us along or they were taking personal calls. Luckily I did some homework in advance and was able to set up reservations on our own. All in all though we had a great time at the Hyatt and would definitely recommend it to others and hopefully be back there someday ourselves!

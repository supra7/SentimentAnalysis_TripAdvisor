We enjoyed the package that included the Paul Gauguin exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum. We have stayed in this general area of Seattle before, but never before at this hotel. First impression was very friendly and helpful staff from the moment we pulled up to the entrance. We spoke to staff throughout our stay and found them always to be cheery and helpful. The hotel has an old elegance which we enjoyed. The room more than met our needs, was very clean and bright, very quiet, and supplied all we wanted. We find this location to be the best in terms of what we like to do in Seattle (ie. restaurants, shopping, concert hall, art museum, Pike Place Market, waterfront, and easy access to other downtown locations. We would certainly return.

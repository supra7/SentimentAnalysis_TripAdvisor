This place is very nice and I would recommend it. The food was better than average for an all inclusive style vacation. Service was slightly lacking but still very good. My only negative thing to say is that they gave us $200 worth or coupons that they did not honor. When I questioned it, they just gave me a look and did not answer me?? P.S. 24 hr free room service and free mini bar.

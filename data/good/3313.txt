Firstly I'd have to echo many of the positive reviews on here regarding this resort, it was fantastic. The beach, pools, drinks, service, and overall experience were outstanding. The property is very nice, clean, and laid out perfectly, and all amenities are top notch. One thing I notice there are not too many reviews on is the entertainment staff, and the job that they do on a daily basis. They are the most friendly, outgoing, fun people, and always have events going if you are so inclined to get involved. If you're not interested, they don't bother you at all, and remember you by name whether you participate or not. My wife and I went for 4 nights, and the only thing that we thought was really disappointing was the dinner's. Breakfast at the World Cafe was exceptional, don't miss the crepes and omelettes, and lunch either by the pool/beach or in the restaurants was good. But out of 4 nights, we had 2 dinners which were at best ok, and 2 other's that were borderline inedible. We are not food snobs at all, and I was not expecting 5 star food, but the Italian and Mexican (yes they did not prepare even a decent Mexican dinner) were extremely lacking. The dinner at the Steakhouse and World Cafe were decent. I just wanted to add this so people expecting great food are not disappointed, as we were. But overall this was a very pleasurable experience, and I would definitely recommend this resort.

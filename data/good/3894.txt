We stayed at the Hilton Inn on the San Diego Bay waterfront for our anniversary and had a room vith a view of both Coronado and the downtown skyline, as well as the San Diego Harbor. I asked for a low level floor but wished we had requested a higher floor for the added view. The room was a bit pricey plus they charged $27 or one night of parking so our stay for one night cost $342 which included a buffet breakfast for two. The location was close enough to walk to restaurants near Seaport Village (about a 20 minute walk) and right next to a new pedestrian bridge that was built for the Padres Petco Ballpark access and access to the Gaslamp District (about a 15 minute walk). The pool was really nice (billed as the largest saltwater pool in San Diego). The bar was OK and had outdoor seating. The two restaurants at the hotel looked comfortable but we only had breakfast at the one with the buffet. The buffet was OK but the hot food was cold by the time I got to the table. The service was not great (the waitress was nowhere to be found). This hotel is perfect for the San Diego Convention Center meetings because it is right nextdoor. We went to Joe's Crab Shack for dinner as it was only a 10 minute walk along the bayfront where they are just completing construction of the waterfront "boardwalk" that connects the hotel to the bay.

Hotel Max was such a charming little hotel right in the heart of downtown Seattle. Within walking distance of everything you want to see in town. The rooms are a decent size and the beds are so comfortable! The nicest beds I've ever slept in in a hotel! Other reviews stated the bathrooms were small but ours was just fine. I stayed in room 420 which was a corner room with a good view of the city. It was creative and fun without being over the top. Great value for what it is and I will certainly be back.

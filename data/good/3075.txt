We arrived after 9:00 p.m. and left, less than 12 hours later, at 8:00 a.m. This was the perfect layover hotel. Located at the entrance to the airport, if they were any closer, they'd be on the tarmac. Van service still takes you door-to-door. I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews here on TripAdvisor, but, happily, found nothing that agreed with some of the negative comments. The staff was friendly and helpful, the room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, and room service was prompt and satisfactory. We weren't looking for five star service in a "layover hotel", but feel we truly got good value and four star service. We'd stay here again. P.S. We ended up with a "numbers bed" despite asking not to have one, but we found it perfectly comfortable (and I have a bad back). Go figure.

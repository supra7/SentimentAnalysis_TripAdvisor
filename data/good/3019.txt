The room itself was good. Nothing different from any other hotel room. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was a bit tight, with the door opening into the toilet. There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room either. The National American Miss competition was held the weekend of September 2-4. We were given the rate that everyone that was staying got. We were put in the farthest room away from the convention center which made it a very long walk to and from for events that we had to get to. We ate dinner in the hotel resturant one night. The prices were crazy. I was extremely shocked when the bill came and my lemon drop was $13, (my meal was $26). No salad provided with dinner either. The place was not busy, but the service was very slow for some reason. I would recommend not eating in the hotel.

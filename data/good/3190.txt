I initially picked Le Crystal because it had separate sleeping / living quarters but it impressed us in so many other ways, as well. The room also had a great balcony with a view of downtown and the room had great boutique perks. My favourite was the espresso machine for easy delicious coffee any time of day. Also, the room service was amazing and I'd highly recommend the continental breakfast for the fresh french pastries. The pool was fun for our daughter and they even had some pool toys and lifejackets for kids of all sizes. All in all, we'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

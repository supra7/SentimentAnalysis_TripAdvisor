We had two nights at the Warwick hotel before boarding our cruise. The Hotel was old but really nice, spacious room, very comfortable king size bed, very nice bathroom. We ate at the hotel restaurant on both nights and the meals were excellent, comparible with any better class restaurant we have dined at. We highly recommend this hotel for comfort cleanliness and value for money.

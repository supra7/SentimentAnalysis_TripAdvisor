We vacationed two years ago at Secrets Capri so we knew that an even newer Secrets would be equally lovely. It most certainly was. For us, a beach vacation requires a view of the ocean from the bed, so we upgraded to an ocean front room. It is pricey to do so, but seeing the beautiful beach and listening to the sounds of the ocean at night make it worthwhile. The property is very nice and the pools are delicious. There are two main pools and both are quite large and never overwhelmed with people. The beach itself is terrific. If you enjoy walking on the shore, you can do so for quite a long way in either direction from the hotel. Many reviews here talk about the restaurants and the quality of the food. Regarding the restaurants, it seems to me that Secrets has made an odd choice to have no real outdoor seating (thought some of the restaurants do have a few tables outside) Not a single one overlooks the ocean. Having stayed at a number of upscale all-inclusives over the years, my opinion is, you don't vacation at them for the food. The meals here were fine. The staff is absolutely outstanding. We did not encounter a single person who wasn't cheerful and helpful. We wanted to bring our concierge Vianney home with us! The Spa is expansive and serene. I had two wonderful massages there. If you are a tennis player, there are two very nice courts and a very accommodating Pro by the name of Oscar. Secrets doesn't seem to promote the tennis, but it should! There were many guests that seemed quite content to never leave the property, but the location lends itself to easy access to other points of interest in the area. Do visit Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Puerto Aventuras, etc. Taxis aren't inexpensive. Look into renting a car for a day or two. We didn't participate in any organized tours, so I cannot comment on them. All in all, Secrets Maroma is a sure thing. You won't be disappointed.

While the room was nice and seemed newer, the property lacked certain common amenities that many other less expensive hotels offer, such as free wifi or some design and layout issues in the hotel itself. If you want to eat at the Fox Sports Grill, you must go outside and walk around the exterior of the hotel. To exit the hotel at ground level, you cannot take the elevator, you have to take the elevator to the lobby and then go down an escalator to get to the ground level, which is very inconvenient. The hotel did offer a nice package where you can buy 2 passes for their lavish breakfast buffet for only $25, a $45 value. The passes are for their Vela restaurant, which offered a nice selection that varied day to day. The food was definitely above average and well worth the $25 for both of us to eat breakfast without having to walk into the Gaslamp quarter early each morning. The location of the hotel is very convenient to the convention center as well as the Gaslamp quarter. We walked through the Gaslamp each night and even to the local outdoor mall. There is no need to drive here, since everything is within a short walk.

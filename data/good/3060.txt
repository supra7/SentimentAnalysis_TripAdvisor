This was a great building; quiet ,roomy and nicely designed. Easy access and very close to terminal. Beds were great. Great lobby lounge; open where you can see all that is going on. Got in late so just had a glass of wine, I will have dinner next trip. Staff told us a bit more than necessary; people did not show up for work and did not call. I had a problem getting change on Sunday morning all cashiers were out , where is the mgmt or supervisors for cash? Staff was friendly and accommodating to our requests. This is my new location for SeaTac stays.

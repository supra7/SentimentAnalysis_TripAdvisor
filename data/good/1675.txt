We stayed just one night at the Edgwater, we were in Seattle for a wedding. Chose Edgewater because of it's "historic" past and location on water. Loved it. Northwest cozy lodge decor in a progressive way. We chose a city view since we had an evening wedding to attend and didnt' figure we'd spend a lot of time in room. The view was parking lot, train tracks, buildings across the street and some skyline which inlcuded the space needle. We didn't hear the train or any other noises to bother our sleep. The room was small but adequate and nicely furnished - the bed was very comfortable. Looked just like the photo on line. Loved the fireplace in room. My biggest complaint with room is the bathroom, although upscale with a slate walk in shower and flooring, bowl sink, granite counter, etc, it was so dimly lit it was hard to see, let alone apply makeup. The light in the shower went on and off at will and the light switch for the vanity lights was outside the bathroom and it took us awhile to figure that out! We had a late night drink in the lounge where they had live music, which was really good. Nice atmosphere. Breakfast in the restaurant was fantastic, maybe a little slow but worth the wait. At least the window table gave us a good view while we waited. Overall our experience was a very good one. We would stay there again. Next time I will leave more time to sit in the great hall and read a book by the windows. Lots of cozy options to sit and read and sip your drink of choice. Valet parking seems silly since they have a large lot right there and not a parking garage 3 blocks away. Oh well, it's a nice hotel and I guess it adds to the experience and who else to tip.

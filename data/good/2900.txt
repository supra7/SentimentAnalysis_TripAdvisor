My wife and I spent one night at the inn prior to our flight out the next morning. This is the best Hampton Inn I have ever stayed out. The rooms were perfect. The breakfast in the morning was just great. Free wireless Internet to boot. There was free shuttle to and from the airport every 10-15 minutes. Give this hotel a chance.

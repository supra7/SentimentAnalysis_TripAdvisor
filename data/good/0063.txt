This hotel is one of the best places I have stayed at in all my years of travel! Anytime I am in Seattle, I stay here. The staff is amazing and very helpful! At my last stay, as I was waiting for the valet to bring my car around, a man (I'm assuming homeless) tried to walk in the doors and the doorman/valet very calmly and quietly informed him that they did not have a public bathroom and to move along. I was so impressed with his profesionalism and attention to this. I once stayed in a Hilton Hotel in Washington DC and you had to dodge and miss the "bums" who stood inside the lobby of the hotel asking for money. I had my young daughter with me and it was a bit scary for her. So big kuddos to the Hotel Monaco for paying attention to this small but important detail. If I had to say one non positive thing about the hotel is the parking. They do have valets, how are wonderful, but sometimes if I want to get my car and just run somewhere quick, I always feel kinda guilty having to get my car out for a short trip. Never have they complained or made any kind of fuss about it, just me feeling bad for it. HOWEVER, not having to find parking in downtown Seattle is a HUGE plus!!

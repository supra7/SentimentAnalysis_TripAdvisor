I stayed at a standard room alone. Even though there was no view from a small window in my room, the room was very clean and cozy. I think it's enough for a single traveler to stay the standard room. The location is very nice. It's close to sea and market. I recommend that you should take a walk to market, and have a breakfast there. When i visit to Seattle again, I will book this hotel. For this time I booked this hotel at pacificplazahotel.com because they offer cheaper price than expedia.

Nice hotel close to SeaTac. The staff was helpful and the room was clean. Nice sheets and towels but bathroom was a little dated and small. We did not eat at the restaurant, but it looks like a good place for breakfast or a quick cup of coffee. The room was quiet. I would recommend this hotel if you need to be close to the airport.

We stayed here for a small conference. Everyone really enjoyed this hotel. The location is great and we got a good rate. The lobby is very small, but that made it fun because you saw everyone coming and going. The rooms were large. I liked the big desk and loved the super long window sofa. They also use Bliss products so we teased each other about smelling lemony fresh! I would stay here for work or leisure again. Pike's Place is about a 10 min walk away. Our favorite restaurant was Elliott's Oyster House, which was straight down the hill by the water. Warning if you go there the climb back is like hiking 10 flights of stairs if you take the direct route!

I stayed there with 3 other friends, in one of the suites (I think the hotl only has suites... but I might be wrong). After my friend's prom, her father got us a room so we could have a good time the 4 of us together. The hotel was built in the last years and it shows. It's simplicity adds to it. The outdoor spa on the 12th floor offers a great view of the city.

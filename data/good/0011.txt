This is a hotel, not an inn, and a fine modern one, at that. Upon entering you find yourself in a huge vaulted club house with two living room areas separated by a see through fireplace. Beautiful furniture, soaring cielings, and glass everywhere. However, the night I arrived it was empty probably because it was exceedingly hot. On the other side is what looks like a modern diner, with booths and tables. In the back is a small bar (which seemed to be full of the waitstaff's friends), the breakfast buffet area, a mini convenience store, and the front desk. Front desk staff were below average, a kind of fake friendly I would gladly exchange for quick, efficient, good customer service. They were quite slow, and even made customers wait while they took phone calls, etc. Three types of coffee and fruit are available gratis. Rooms are beautiful, full of lots of small touches: a microwave and fridge in a kitchen cabinet setup, comfy armchair with ottoman, huge window, huge desk with super comfy chair, and a curved shower curtain. The business center was small and in use during my stay, even at 10 pm. The pool was decent sized, but closed at 9:30, not the posted 10 pm. There was a staffer watching tv in the workout room, but it was adequate. Parking was ample and close. I did not hear my neighbors, although I did hear the traffic from I-95. Take earplugs if you are sensitive. Excellent view. Room service was superb and some items reasonable. There are many stores and restaurants very close by. It is a beautiful, but very crowded area. This hotel is beautiful, new, full of classy touches that make its pricetag and lack of a free breakfast worth while. With better staff and management, this place would be superb. Staying here is a real treat!

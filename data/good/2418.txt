We (my husband, teenage son and myself) stayed at the W hotel July 2009. We got a great price through travelzoo and it was centerally located for our purpose. Qwest field and Paramount Theatre. We had a king room with a daybed which worked out well for the three of us. Our view was of the top of the roof but it was a very quiet room. Everyone was friendly and the room was clean and the bath products were nice. All in all a nice hotel. Parking is very expensive (about $35) and there is not self parking.

I stayed at the Crown Plaza over Easter weekend. I needed a somewhat larger room since I was traveling with a companion or two and needed some extra space between myself and them. I was upgrade complimentary to a suite, which was very nice. The staff obviously knew of my needs and were happy to accommodate them. The room itself was lovely with a plush bed. I liked the lavender linen spray. We took advantage of the hot breakfast in the morning, which was really great and convenient.

My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt on our wedding night and found the pool and surrounding grounds to be amazing. The pool has waterfalls, a slide, the Grotto Bar (in the pool), and a waterfall in the spa that you can sit under. The bed was very, very comfortable in the room. It felt like a big pillow. We also enjoyed breakfast in the main restaurant and the french toast with coconut syrup was excellent. We wish we could have stayed at the Hyatt the entire week.

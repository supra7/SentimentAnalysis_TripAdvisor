Loved it! Great location, quick 5 minute walk to beach or 10 minute walk to Whalers Village. We stayed in a 1 bd/2bath partial ocean view unit booked thru Outrigger. It was beautifully updated and huge. It was just myself and husband but we could have easily fit the kids in there too. Daily housekeeping was a huge bonus along with the beach cabana that is reserved for El Dorado guests only. It was so convenient to be able to walk to shopping, restaurants, and the beach!!

Very much enjoyed our 3 day stay on room 903 at Hotel Max. Conveniently located between downtown and Belltown, with the Westlake Specialty market and Uptown Espresso around the corner. The rooms are small with decent size bathrooms; very comfortable bed, flat screen tv, small refrigerator, coffee pot iron, hairdryer, and small safe. We had a great wide view towards the Space Needle and away from street noise. Other than the small room, the coffee at Red Fin is a poor pick. Mistral Kitchen for dinner is 3 blocks away and be sure to check out the remodeled Cinerama at 4th Ave/Lenora. Probably the classiest theater you've ever stepped in to watch a movie. The velvet seats, terrific surround sound, huge screen, friendly staff and great choice of snacks for your viewing pleasure.

We have stayed at the Maui El Dorado every year since 1989 - we spent 6 1/2 weeks there is 1998. Just got back in July from another trip there. It's NOT the Westin (Thankfully). So if you are expecting a resort with $20 glasses of wine - it's not your place. It's comfortable and quiet. Easy walk to the cabana and Whaler's Village and Kaanapali Beach. We've always had wonderful serivce and great rooms! I spent last weekend in Waikiki and it really made me miss the Maui El Dorado!!

Stayed three days. Room was clean and quiet. Old hotel but well maintained. Our reserved double wasn't ready when we arrived so staff upgraded us to a suite at no extra cost. Downtown location was great for our purpose - tourism. Near transportation, restaurants, waterfront, etc. Will definitely stay again

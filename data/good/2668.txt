Everything is spotlessly clean, the staff are friendly and efficient, and the beds are comfy as anything. My only tip would be to skip breakfast at the hotel as it is really bad, and go to one of the many restaurants around the hotel. Great location, close to shops, a few blocks from Pike Place Market. Definitely reccommend.

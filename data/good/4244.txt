First of all, NEVER EVER BOOK WITH EXPEDIA! Gah! The headaches! The Hyatt was amazing! From arrival to departure, we felt pampered and taken care of. The grounds are amazing and so well kept! I never got a chance to enjoy the pools but they looked divine. I also absolutely LOVED the wildlife in the resort. The food was pricey but was always good - the pizza from room service is amazing! The breakfast buffet wasn't free for us - and boy was that price steep ($35/pp). Not worth it unless you eat a lot or have the voucher IMHO. The rooms were nice and roomy - we had the Deluxe Ocean View which had a couch, coffee table, chairs and dining table, large king bed and a bathroom area with mini bar, fridge and coffee maker. Although a bit tired, it was still a nice room and the balcony couldn't be any better!!! We would absolutely return here again in a heartbeat!

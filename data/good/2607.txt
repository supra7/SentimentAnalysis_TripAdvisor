The decor was nice, but there was not much space in the room or bathroom. Overall though, I liked the place. The staff was really polite and helpful. The location was really nice if you were in Seattle to shop. It's right in the middle of it all and only a 10 minute walk to Pikes. Even though it was a little small, I would stay there again.

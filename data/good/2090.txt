My brother & I booked through American Airlines' site for a concert at Key Arena and we loved this hotel. The location is fabulous - a block from the south monorail terminal (which takes you to the Space Needle/Key Arena at the other end) and within walking distance of Pike Place Market. It's smack in the middle of the high-end shopping district (Nordstrom, etc.), but we weren't there for the shopping. (It's also a block from Cinemarama - DEFINITELY check out what's playing in this restored retro cinema. We caught Tron!) We didn't use the health club, restaurants or concierge services, but the free WiFi in the lobby was a big plus. (Would've been nice if we could have gotten signal in our room). Speaking of room, we asked for a view of the Space Needle and our view from room 4233 was incredible (see photos). The bathroom was a little outdated (water stains on ceiling, 1980's doorknob) but it didn't ruin our stay. For $220/night, we were very pleased.

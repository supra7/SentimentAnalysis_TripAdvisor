Location is great, staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was very nice. They do seem to like to keep everything very dimly lit. I get that everyone wants to discourage horrible cars from coming downtown, so the additional parking charge is just something to live with. But why oh why does a high-priced hotel still feel the need to rip me off for a bottle of water or wireless internet service? That just seems so cheap. And I do agree with one previous reviewer, the linens were not really outstanding and had that old-laundry smell. On the whole, I would recommend this hotel to friends but with warnings about the negatives.

The rooms appear to have had a recent makeover but they appear to have neglected changing out the windows, which are still single-pane! The hotel was very comfortable and well-located (opposite the Westin) but the single-pane windows made it very noisy. I guess this is why the rates are low for this area. The wifi did not always work in the rooms but there were two computers in the lobby for guest use. Tip: Don't forget your earplugs and forget the hotel overnight parking since it's free on the street after 6pm (?) until 8am the next morning.

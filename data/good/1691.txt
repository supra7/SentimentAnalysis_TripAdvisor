After traveling a lot in the past year or so I've learned that many (not all) hotels are basically the same in that they have thin walls! The Edgewater is no exception to this but it has many things going for it that allow you to look past its construction. First, it has an amazing view. The Edgewater has rooms facing the water and it is worth paying the extra dough to reserve these units. Second, it has a great location. It is just a stroll from great things to visit like Pike's Market, numerous pubs, and the Seattle Aquarium (be warned though, there are many hills if you do not stay ocean-side). Third, it has a nice restaurant in "Six Seven". The menu was limited but what they offer is prepared well. The service was wonderful!

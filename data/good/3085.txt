The reason we booked here was because the hotel offered a free shuttle to the start line of the Seattle Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, which had 26,000 runners trying to make a 7 a.m race gun time - there were no good transportation options coming from Tacoma, and we didn't want to pay Seattle prices for a hotel room. It's no luxury hotel, but our experience was overall very good. The staff was very friendly and the room was immaculate. The fact that it was right across from the light rail made it super easy to get back and forth to Seattle. For $12 extra, we upgraded to a suite which was well worth it. The Sleep Number bed was super comfy and I slept like a log before 4:45 a.m. wake-up. Transportation to the race went off without a hitch and it was especially nice they had coffee and snacks to go. My biggest beefs, which weren't a big deal, is that the room had a noisy HVAC system. Also, we arranged to get late check out and got locked out of the room when we tried to return a few minutes after noon - it happened to some other people as well. But our stay was very pleasant and I would have no hesitation staying here again or recommending it to an out-of-town friend.

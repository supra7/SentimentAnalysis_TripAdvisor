Went to Secrets Maroma Sept 17 thru Sept 24. This was our first time to this resort.We stayed in the preferred section building 26 with an ocean view.This was worth it the view in the morning was awesome. Our building Concierge (Carlos) was very helpful. When I first arrived I made arrangements for a continental breakfast to be delivered daily and it was always on time and started the day off perferctly. It only rained once early morning.My wife loved the beach I am a pool guy. Both had plenty of seats available all the time no need to get out early and reserve your seat. The breakfast buffet was very good the only thing missing was roast beef and ham slices. This resort does not offer a dinner buffet which I missed. We are not big foodies but like to try different things. We liked the italian and Seaside Restaurant the food was very good. The portions were very good too. You have to go to the Coco cafe the cappucino was good as well as their chocolate chip cookies. We went to the movies twice it was very nice and not too crowded.The preferred bar was always a good place to hangout for a nice drink and appetizers all day.The grill by the pool was great for lunch. We will definitely be returning in the future. I would stay away from the vacation club presentation.

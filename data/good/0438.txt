I only stayed here for one night. The view from my cavernous room on the 28th floor was nearly breathtaking. The beds were very comfortable and I slept very well. This is what you expect when you book a 4 star hotel! Not much more to say since I was only there for one night ........the location was good for Seattle as long as you don't mind walking up the very steep hill from the water. I'm posting some photos.

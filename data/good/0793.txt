My husband & I stayed at The Moore 6/9/07 & 6/17/07 (before & after a cruise). On our first stay we arrived before check in, but when the desk clerk heard our story about being stranded by the airport shuttle in the rain without our suitcases & not knowing where we were, he volunteered to find us a room we could check into early. The room was VERY clean & I thought it was alot larger than some newer hotel rooms. The tub is old, so it was huge! You can lay down in it. The bed was comfortable.Our rooms had recently been redone. In the morning we asked the desk clerk were we could catch a cab to the terminal, she said have a seat and I'll call you one. Did'nt expect this much service for the price. On our second stay we arrived very early, 8:30(cruise ships are in at 6AM). The clerk stored our bags for us & told us that check in wasn't until 3PM but that we would probably be tired by than & to come back around noon & she would have a room for us. She did! Both rooms we had were near the elevator, it didn't bother us at all. We delt with 3-4 different front desk employees, all were more than friendly and very helpful. We did see some homeless in the area, but no one bothered us. TWO blocks from Pike's Market & walking distance to the water, Seattle Center, the monorail & more! This was a bargin of a lifetime. About a block away is the Virginia Inn. We had a great dinner there on our first night. Lowell's in the market is really good for breakfast (ate there both mornings). Met friends there our first day for lunch, the clam chowder is horrible. Ivars on the water has the best clam chowder I have ever had.(Had this the second time thru Seattle) Another great bargin. The double decker (narrated) bus tour.. $18. per person, good for 2 days. Ride it all around, get off when you want ,sightsee, walk around..get back on when the next bus comes thru..do it again,all over town. Stops about 3 blks. from the Moore. You can buy yor tickets from the driver.

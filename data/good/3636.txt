This hotel is very modern and stylish. Great shower but small rooms. Great view of the empire state building from our room! The rooftop terrace was also fab, but breakfast was basic continental, the bagels were good though. It's easy to get a cab from the hotel and it's right opposite a subway station. If you use the greyline tourist bus it stops right around the corner from the hotel. In the immediate vicinity there is a nice Irish pub over the road which does amazing buckets of chicken wings - cheap too! There is a nice pizza place around the corner as well. The hotel is right near katz' deli but I wouldn't recommend it, it was a real disappointment with poor service and bland food. Does not live up to its reputation. The hotel is also a couple of doors away from an independent cinema which is really cool and shows some great independent films.

The location of this hotel is a bit off the beaten track, but if you have business with one of the companies nearby, it is a good choice. And there is a Metro station within a 5-10 minute walk, so trips to the city center are easy. The ride takes about 30 minutes. The hotel itself is good - clean, reasonably comfortable, excellent staff, and a decent restaurant. The decor is a little too spartan for my taste - very white, almost anticeptic.

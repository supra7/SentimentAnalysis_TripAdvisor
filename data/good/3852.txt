We stayed at the Hilton Bay-front San Diego for two days. As we were there for a celebration they upgraded us to an bay facing room which was great except it did not have a bathtub in the bathroom. The hotel is beautiful and large with conference levels and a running/walking path that goes all along the bay. As Hitlon honors Gold we were provided with free access to the spa facilities and a 25 dollar credit to a treatment. The spa has a lounge area with refreshments and an eucalyptus steam room . We spent quite some time enjoying the facilities every day. We also got free appetizers at the Hotel bar which consisted of a handful of chips and some olives. Don't bother using these, you end up paying too much for a drink that you of course need to wash away the salty olives! Service was okay, the staff were helpful and gave us directions whenever we needed it. In fact the doormen and maids were the nicest, the girls are the desk not so much. Parking is extremely expensive at 25 dollars per day but we were okay with that as we got our room for $120 per night. Usually with Hilton gold breakfast is included but instead they give you a voucher for a drink and food item at the starbucks which is attached. You could trade the voucher in and pay an extra $10 for the breakfast buffet which is no way was worth the $35 they were charging. It had a sad looking omelet bar and not enough variety. In addition service was slow. The key advantage of the Hotel is its location to the Gaslamp district which was a half a mile away as well as the stadium. It is also less than 15 minutes from the airport. Overall a good experience. I would stay there but not at the regular price.

This is big hotel but you don't feel it when you are on the edge of the bay, in the pool, or in the spa. My hubby is 6'6" and solid -- he loved the massage from Stephan and reported that Stephan reached all of his knots. My massage was also fabulous from a lovely Russian lady. Fantastic. We will stay there again happily. My only complaint is that one cannot access Starbucks from the lobby but must walk around the outside of the hotel to find the Starbucks opening. Silly.

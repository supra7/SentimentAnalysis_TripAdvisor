Hotel was beautiful, our room was very nice, the grounds were well kept, staff was very friendly and helpful. The spa was wonderful IF they have room for improvement it would be the nightlife. The "disco" played club music. The hotel had middle aged people staying there. The music should have went with the people that staying there. The music by the pool was literally spa music. So if your ideal vacation is to lay around read a book, eat good food and go to bed early every night....this is your place!

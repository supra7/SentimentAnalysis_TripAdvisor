They claim to be the most "Hawaiian" hotel. I paid around 170-190 a night. No other larger hotel in Maui could even come close to that price. Even when it was sold out through online companies if you go to their homepage directly you can still book a room and it was actually even cheaper from their home page. I didn't have any major complaints. It's a not a lavish, high end, resort style hotel. It's more of a homey feeling. Average rooms, average pool-all a little out dated (no flat screen tv, etc). But the staff was great. I did have an issue with luke warm shower water during the day time. They offer multiple classes a day on different cultural aspects (lei making, dancing, etc). The bar was fair, but their prices for drinks were great. Their restaurant was also a pleasant surprise. The best thing about the hotel though is their prime beach location. If I had money to spare yeah I would probably stay at the Hyatt or Sheraton or in Wailea at the Four Seasons next time. But if I had the chance to choose all over again, I would still choose the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel-primarily because of the price value.

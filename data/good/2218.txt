We needed a place that was affordable, quiet and easy to get to as we were going to Jazz Alley that evening. This fit the bill just fine. The staff were easy going and extremely helpful. The room was big, the king sized bed was very comfortable. Lots of pillows! A window that opened! Had a fridge and a microwave. Free wifi. Free parking. Free breakfast that includes eggs, waffles, juice.. We got it delivered as well for nothing. It was close to our venue. I cannot say a negative thing about! Great place!

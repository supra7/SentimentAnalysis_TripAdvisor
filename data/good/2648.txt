My wife and I stayed here recently for our first time. Check-in was easy, and its location is the best. Right in the middle of downtown Seattle's business, shopping and dining area. You can walk to most attractions from here. Great little bar attatched to the premises also. We got a very nice corner room on the 8th floor. It appeared to be one of the larger rooms, according to the floor diagram. The bed itself was very comfortable. If your a light sleeper, request a higher floor due to the early morning street activity. I had ear plugs, and my wife sleeps soundly, so it wasn't much of an issue for us.

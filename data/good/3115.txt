After coming in from Florida and calling 3 times for a shuttle pick-up, it arrived 45 minutes later. It would have been much easier just to drag the luggage down across the street to the hotel in about 5 minutes. Room on the 7th floor was smokey, night manager very helpful and changed our room immediately to a nonsmoking floor. Housekeeping did a good job, front desk helpful, halls showing definite signs of wear. Room itself was quite nice (king), sleep number beds overrated, but for $45 on Priceline, can't complain!

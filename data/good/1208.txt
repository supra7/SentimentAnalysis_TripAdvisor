We stayed there for 13 nights--part holiday,part Lions International convention.Very helpful attentive staff,Bed VERY comfortable,so you always get a good nights sleep.Starbucks coffee machine in all rooms,Only complaint that there is not much wardrobe space,and as we had to take a lot of clothes,it was quite a squash! .Reasonable priced meals and drinks in the bar,but restaurant quite pricey.There is a "food to go" shop on the ground floor-hot and cold food,and coffee,very reasonable prices.. In the parallel street to the left is the"Red Lion pub.We ate there nearly every evening as great food,good atmosphere--so well recommended. Hotel is well situated to walk to the shops and Pike Place Market.and to the monorail to get to other attractions,like the Space Needle.Great views of totally white,snow covered Mount Rainier from the Needle.

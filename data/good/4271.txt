Just wanted to say we had a great time at the Hyatt Regency Maui. Some of the reviews had almost scared me off. The room was fantastic, the grounds beautiful, the pools were great in that they had a kids area with a hydro tunnel for the kids to use all day long. I hurt myself in a fall and the staff were there immediately to help and got me to the onsite clinic. There I received professional care and was on my way after x-rays, a minor surgery, and bandages. I cannot think of one thing we did not enjoy with the exception of the prices of the restaurants... But, you sort of expect that in Hawaii. Don't get me wrong, the food was fantastic. On some of the negative comments posted here. I am not sure if they had stayed at the same hotel as I. Maybe they were looking for something that was more like Las Vegas? "Hey Braw, you in Hawaii and need to do as the locals do!". Mahalo!

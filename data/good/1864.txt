This was my first trip to Seattle. I loved the views from the room and the bed was SO comfortable, heavenly. There were a couple times we had to call for things like bad creamer needed to be replaced, room service was there in a flash. We had a suite and the rooms needed a bit of updating (furniture a bit worn and one of the light fixtures was broken), but overall good size, spectacular views and very clean. I would return to this hotel again.

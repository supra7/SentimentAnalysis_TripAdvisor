Great location and views from room. Rooms are clean, spacious and pleasant. Parking is expensive at $36 a night. I asked valet to direct me to the parking garage, guy talked me into parking valet, said it was only $3 more a night. I was too tired to argue with the him and ask him once again where the garage was so I ended up doing valet. It was a bit of a pain calling down to have them bring the car around every time I went out. other than that I'd probably stay there again but only if I got a cheaper deal on the room.

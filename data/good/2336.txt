I go up to Seattle a few times a year for business and mostly stay at the W Seattle. If I have some spare time, I like to take a walk down to the shopping area, its pretty close to restaurants. Easy to find, valet parking available. The lobby is a little funky at night, but in a cool way. I've had drinks in their bar and lounge area before, nice vibe. The room was comfortable, nice flat screen, bathroom was a good size. Although they need to do something about the shower curtain. Its too short and has no weights in the bottom of it and is constantly blowing back on me. Next time I'll make sure to ask for a room with a separate shower stall. Plus it has a straight shower bar, they need to install the curved ones. Apart from that, the stay was great. Definitely going back.

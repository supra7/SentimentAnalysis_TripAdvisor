This hotel is very cozy feeling and is great if you want to be near the water or in the Pike's Market area (only a 10 minute walk). My room was suppose to be a city view room, but when I checked in they upgraded me to a water view room. It didn't have the tub that you see in the pictures, but it had a great rock and glass walk in shower. The beds seem to be very comfortable at least for me. The decoration of the hotel is a little kitchy (sp?), but cute. I felt like I was in a lodge or a place that should be in fhe forest. The fire place was a nice touch, I didn't use it because I was in Seattle on one of those off days in June when the weather was actually great and some what warm. The staff at the Edgewater were very helpful and accomodating. They were able to help me with many of my questions or issues that I had unrelated to the hotel. I bought fish at Pike's market and they were very quick to make sure it was well preserved until I was ready to check - out. I was easily able to connect to the wireless network that they have available through the hotel. The location of this hotel is great for anyone that may be taking the Clipper to Canada. The dock is right next door to the hotel and they will even help you with your luggage to the ferry. Very accomodating. I would stay in this hotel again and would recommend it to people who want to stay on or near the water in Seattle and near Pike's Market. If you go to Pike's Market and enjoy Cheese, there is a great place called Beechers... they have the best soups and Mac and Cheese ever!

We had to stay in Ka'anapali area for business and picked the Outrigger because this chain had always provided excellent condo accomodations in the past and the Maui Eldorado was no exception. We had a 1 bedroom partial ocean view unit that had recently been upgraded, full tile floor, big furnished lanai and everything we needed to feel at home for a few days. The garage parking seemed safe and secure, but the one caution would be this property did not seem handicap friendly (access to most units involved steps or a steep walkway up or down). I had worried about traffic noise as the complex is just downhill from the highway but it was quiet, quiet, quiet! We used the pool deck grills 2 nights and had the whole area and it's ocean view to ourselves. It was an easy walk down to the beach or shopping and restaurants at Whaler's Village, and next door to Round Table Pizza and C'J's Deli for quick meals.

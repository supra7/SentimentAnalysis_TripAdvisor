Humble, demure, and cozy best describe the Hotel Vintage Park. From the lobby to the hallways, the restaurant to the guestrooms, this Kimpton exudes peace and tranquility after a tumultuous day. It doesn't have the opulence of higher-end Kimptons, but its classic old-world charm will captivate you. If you still don't know what makes Seattle Seattle, you soon will as you are greeted in the lobby with a serious coffee bar seemingly poised to compete with a certain coffee giant. The staff is a super friendly bunch, proactively informing you of what's going on around town and willing to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The guestroom isn't the most spacious you will find, but they pack all the creature comforts within. Complimentary wifi, large flat panel tv, his and hers bathrobes, and the most generously-stocked minifridge and amenity kit I have ever seen definitely make for a comfortable evening. If you forgot to bring toiletries, the fine folks downstairs will gladly furnish you. And the best amenity ever for when visiting Seattle - an umbrella! Brilliant! This alone is worth one star. There isn't much negative to say about Vintage Park. If I had to nitpick, I would say the $30 nightly fee for valet parking is a bit on the steep side. Loved this Kimpton though. I'd definitely stay here again.

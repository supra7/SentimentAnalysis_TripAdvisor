Overall our experience at the Hyatt Regency Maui in Kaanapali was fantastic. The staff was great  from the front desk and housekeeping to the bartenders at Umalu. We enjoyed the atmosphere and location as well - plenty of restaurant options on the resort or nearby to keep things new and lots of fellow honeymooners and other fun couples to meet. It's a close walk to Whaler's Village which gave us access to a variety of other restaurants and activities. We were most impressed with our VIP Concierge, Monica Ellison. Monica's dinner and activity recommendations along with her overall perspective on the island was authentic and on point. Her enthusiasm and passion for what she does shined through right away and she truly made it a great experience for us.

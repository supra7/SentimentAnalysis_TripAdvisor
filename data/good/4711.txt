Having arrived to Venice by train we were very hot and needed a rest. You can only imagine our happiness in being lead to a beautiful, green themed, room in this stunning little hotel. The most comfy bed we slept in during our whole Italian vacation, a breakfast fit for a king and all set in a beautiful area. We were worried after reading the tour guides that Venice was going to be like 'Disneyland with Canals' but the Domina is situated in a lovely quiet area, surrounded by local restaurants and shops. A far cry from the hustle and bustle of the Rialto Bridge, that's for sure! We will shall be returning to Venice and when we do we shall defiantly be returning to the Domina Home Ca'Zusto!

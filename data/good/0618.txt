We (another couple and my wife and I) use the pre-cruise package. First of all very nice hotel. Easy to get to from the airport. Had I known just how easy the rail system was and how close it was (like it is right at the mall connected to the hotel) this may have bee the way to get there from the airport. Great location and walking distance to everything that one would probably want to see on a one night stay over. East check in and check out. The breakfast included was just fantastic (not a continental buffet deal). The included transportaion and tip from the driver on how to get ahead of the cruise terminal check in process was most time saving! Would stay here again.

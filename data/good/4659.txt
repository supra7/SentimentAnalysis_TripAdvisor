My husband and I loved the hotel!! It was a real value. Yes, it's not the the most glamourous but the rooms are updated and clean. We had a oceanfront view and it was just as described which was beautiful. The only negative feedback I have is that the resturant is not too great but there are PLENTY of resturants within walking distance. The beach was also beautful

This hotel is very dark in terms of lighting and colors. The doormen are dressed like bouncers instead of the tradition doorman attire. The lobby area was very dark and at night the lobby turns into a loud lounge. The hallways are also very dark. The rooms themselves were fine and nicely lit. Hotel has a good location but for the same price you can get a room at the Fairmont which is right on the next block.

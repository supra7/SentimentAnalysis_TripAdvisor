The hotel is very nice. The room was a little small but the bed was so comfortable that it really didn't matter that the room was small. Our room had a king size bed and a nice little work space that my husband appreciated. The free internet was also a big plus. The only problem I had was the valet parking. We stayed there for 2 nights and each time we called ahead 15 minutes before we left our room to get our car ready. Each time we requested the car it was never ready. On Saturday night we had to wait an additional 10 minutes and almost lost our reservation at the restaurant. This would not have been a big deal but the $30 parking fee plus taxes and tip for the valet increases my service expectations. The valet did apologize for making us wait so long but with a parking garage across the street I could have parked there overnight and would not have had to wait to get to my car. Other than the parking the hotel was great.

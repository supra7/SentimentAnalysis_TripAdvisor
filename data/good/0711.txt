I would definitely recommend the Moore. It is the best deal for downtown Seattle hotels, including the parking voucher which allows you to park in a garage a block away for $12 a day. The hotel doesn't have a lot in terms of "extras" like fitness rooms or breakfast, but it more than makes up for that in cost, location and friendly staff. We stayed in mid-August and never felt too hot in our room and we slept VERY comfortably. The Moore is just a quick walk to the Market, bus lines and other downtown attractions, and it has a lovely/super affordable Vietnamese restaurant (Long) right across the street if you find yourself hungry upon check-in!

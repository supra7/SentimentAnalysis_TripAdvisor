I booked my hotel stay at the Max in May. I decided to do a little splurge for a June weekend getaway. Judging by the reviews, pictures & location, I decided to book my stay here. It's a lovely boutique hotel that's perfect couples or single person. The bed was soft, warm & comfy with goose pillows; a nice-sized flat-screened TV & the room actually came with a Love Kit. I completely missed that part when reading reviews and it wasn't until I read a short review on the Hotel Max in a local Seattle magazine, that I found out the room came with this kit, plus a vibrator, wine for 2 people, design book & a host of other things. Of course it wasn't free, but it was on their snack price list. I got a kick out of this. For dinner I dined at their Pan-Asian restaurant the Red Fin. I enjoyed a tender, juicy, teriyaki steak with tempura onions & mashed potatoes & for dessert, tempura green tea ice cream. The prices were reasonable. The bathroom is slightly small and the rooms are small as well, but if you are not spending a full day in your room and it's just you alone (or with another) it's worth the money staying here. I would DEFINITELY book here if I decide to visit Seattle again.

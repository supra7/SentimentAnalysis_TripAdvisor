We stayed here for two nights, just for a fun trip down to seattle. The location was great, just a three minute walk to the needle, emp, and monrail. We left our car parked the whole time and took the monorail, tunnel buses and walked. Staff were great, let us check in 2 hours early! We had an updated room, nice down comforter and pillows. Just the bathrooms weren't updated. Don't miss breakfast! definitley worth waking up for. Something to suit everyone, even fresh waffles! Would stay again.

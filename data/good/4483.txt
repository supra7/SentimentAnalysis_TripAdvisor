My husband planned our trip as a surprise for my 40th Birthday. I had NO idea where we were going until just before we left. I was amazed to be going to Maui, and when we arrived at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel I was even more amazed! Who knew my husband could plan such a wonderful trip? Luckily, we landed here, at Hawaii's "Most Hawaiian Hotel". It is an older hotel, but is kept up nicely, the rooms have been updated, and the location is fabulous. It is 200 yards from Black Rock, a famous snorkeling spot. The hotel has everything you need right there, so you never need to leave the area if all you want to do is chill out & relax in paradise. If you do want to get out & about but stay close to home base, there is a beach walk in front of the hotel, spanning the length of the stretch of hotels in that area. We went to a Luau at the Hilton, which was easily within walking disntance. There is also the Whalers Mall, an outdoor mall, with lots of quaint shops & restaurants. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, with lots of trees, including plumeria, so the whole place smells like heaven! There is a gift shop, convenience store, restaurant, a tiki bar, and a grill, all near the pool. They also have a stage outdoors where local talent is presented nightly, for free. And, a rental place for snorkeling & other water activites.Additionally they have a Dinner & Magic show (Kapunaha) that was alot of fun- our kids loved it & the food was fantastic! The restaurant serves regular meals & also has a breakfast buffet that we enjoyed. The Hotel offers FREE classes in Hawaiian arts & activities....but a word of caution, sign up EARLY or you will miss out, like we did! We were upset that we missed the Lei-making class & Hula dancing! They staff is so friendly & really go out of their way to welcome you, help plan activites on or off site, and take care of all your needs. We plan to make Maui a regular vacation spot, and wiil definitely always stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel!

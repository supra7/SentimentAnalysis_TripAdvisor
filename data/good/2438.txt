W is chic and trendy. I liked it. My parents? Not so much. They weren't into the club/lounge scene at night and how dark the hallways were, but they were happy with the size and cleanliness of the room and bathroom. The beds are heavenly (well, they are Simmons Heavenly Beds)! So plus and comfortable and warm. I'm buying one for myself next month! LOL! And I really liked the soaps, shampoos, etc...it's bliss (no pun intended, but seriously, the W uses Bliss Spa products)! The staff greeted us when we walked in, but that was it. We looked for the concierge a few times, but couldn't find him. He was never at his desk. Thankfully, we found what we needed. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant as we were warned that it's expensive, but the W is within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and the Elliott Pier. The neighborhood is safe, but there isn't much around in terms of shopping and restaurant. Luckily, the shopping district is about a 15 minutes walk. Upon checkout we were promptly greeted by the woman at the front desk and a bellhop helped us with our bags and flagged a cab. I would stay here again, but if you're older then these types of hotels may not to be your liking. Like I wrote, my parents liked the room, but not the club scene in the lobby especially when we arrived back to the hotel after 10pm.

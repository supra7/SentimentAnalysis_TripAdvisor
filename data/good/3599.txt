This hotel is absolutely beautiful. The beach is impeccable and the service is the best I've ever had. We stayed here on vacation from Oct 22- Oct 26. I would definitly go back next year. The hotel offers great nightly entertainement and you can book day trips with the travel agents in the lobby. The food at the restaurants was surprisingly really good. Breakfast is the best at the World Cafe, where there is a huge buffet and a variety of juices and coffees. Lay out on the beach with beach bar service from a waiter or get in the pool and enjoy the swim up bar where the bartenders are so friendly. We booked a swim-up room in the Preferred club. I will say the swim-up pool at your back door is so nice. We used it enough to make it worth it. The water is colder than the ocean but it's not too bad. The preferred club is a rip-off! The only perk is a private bar in a seperate buildig by your room, that also has a small breakfast continetal style. The breakfast is lame and you can get much better by ordering room service or walking a little way to the restaurants. Preferred club is not worth the money, trust me. We never spent time in the bar there and it was always empty. Other than this the resort it awesome. The staff are always happy and always greet you with a smile and hello. The staff was willing to help us with anyhing we wanted or needed.

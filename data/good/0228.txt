We stayed at the Warwick for one night (was supposed to be two but the train ran 10 hours late!). The front desk staff were fantastic - we arrived in the morning after missing our first night due to the Amtrak train running late and we were fully expecting to be charged for the night we missed - but they waived that nights charges, something they didnt have to do. The rooms were nice and clean, we had a fantastic view of the Space Needle. We were using this hotel as a temporary stop over before going to the Inn at El Gaucho (see review) and when we were leaving the Warwick provided a shuttle to El Gaucho - fantastic service. Felt a little guilty leaving as we had no complaints at all with the Warwick and could have happily stayed there. From our experiences at the Warwick I would happily recommend the hotel.

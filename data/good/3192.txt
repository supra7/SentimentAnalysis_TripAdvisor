We stayed at the Hotel Le Crystal in Montreal for our first getaway as a couple. The hotel was in the perfect location within walking distance to many restaurants, bars and shops. Our suite was bit small, but still had all of the amenities...kitchen, sofa, etc.. and was beautifully decorated. I was delighted to see that the hotel provided Molton Brown toiletries!! The bathroom was large in comparison to the scale of everything else in the room. Great shower! The pool and gym area were really nice. I can't remember what floor they were on, but somewhere in the middle of the hotel/condo building. I believe the condos were all the floors above and hotel floors were all below. At any rate, the pool area also included a terrace with a hot tub and the most amazing views of Mt. Royale and the city below. Although we took a peek during the daytime, we actually went back after a long day and took advantage of the hot tub and view one evening and it was even more amazing at night! We had brunch in the restaurant at the hotel and the food was delicious. But, it was way overpriced. There were so many great restaurants nearby we were left wishing we had opted for one of those instead to save a few dollars. Oh well. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. We are planning to go back to Montreal and would stay here again in a heartbeat!

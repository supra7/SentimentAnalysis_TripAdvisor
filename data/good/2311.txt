I spent a week there, nice place, nice frontdesk very helpful people. Old Building downtown Seattle, 11(or 12) stories just few block from everything and in front of public libray (amazing place!!) The room was big ( superior room) on the nine floor, with a big bathroom but with old forniture inside... It is clean and confortable. A little expensive for what offer. As usual Minibar with CRAZY prices. WIFI Internet available for FREE!! Fast and easy to get. Breakfast not included but the restaurant downstairs offer good one for 10 box and very good italian dinner too. Last but not least Every late afternoon (from 5 to 6 pm) the OFFER WINE a glass of wine.... good wines from WA and other places.

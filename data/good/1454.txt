I've stayed at the Seattle Sheraton a couple of times. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. They show little wear. The hotel is well suited for family or business travel. The hotel location is excellent, centrally located in downtown Seattle. Major construction just started this spring and is scheduled to be done in 2007. 400 rooms are being added in a new tower being built next to the existing tower. According to the hotel staff, this will make the Sheraton the largest hotel in Seattle. Parking is problematic. All self-parking at the hotel is gone. It's all valet, at $28.00 bucks a day. No additional parking is being added for the expansion, so once complete, parking could become a major headache.

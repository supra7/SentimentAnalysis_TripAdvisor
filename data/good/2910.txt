Better than some park and flys We needed a 14 day park and fly at SeaTac. This hotel has a decent price for that because most will charge you a parking fee after 7 days. Although I hear now that the Red Lion South is also charging after 7 days parking which will make it not as good of a value. The rooms are clean and it will be really nice once the remodeling is done, I hope they don't raise their prices because of it. It takes about 10 minutes to get to the airport from there but we liked that because you couldn't hear the air traffic. We would stay here again if the prices aren't too high.

We stayed here recently and we greeted with pleasant staff and a clean hotel. The location is excellent, albeit on top of a hill - but Seattle is a very hilly place! The room was extremely quiet as we requested a room away from the street, and it was very clean. We slept with the windows open and couldn't hear a thing all night! For the price, we'd certainly return.

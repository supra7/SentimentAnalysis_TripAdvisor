My husband and I went here on our honeymoon, overall a great hotel. I loved the setup, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, loved the Hawaiian cultural activities offered daily! Best part of Ka'anapali beach is right on this property. Kid friendly, but also great for people without kids! The only think keeping me from giving a 5 is that they do not offer room service. In spite of that, if we ever go back to Maui, we plan to stay here.

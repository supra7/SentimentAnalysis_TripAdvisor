Just returned from an 8 day stay at the Hyatt Regency with my wife and two teenage children. This was our second trip to Maui in 5 years. Overall we were very pleased with the resort. The service and staff were very friendly and accomodating. We ate at all of the restuarants on the grounds and found all to be very good but pricey as you would expect. The location of the resort is at the far sound end of the beach and as others have noted, the beach is much nicer the further north you go. The work out facility at the resort is top notch with good equipment. We had a Ocean Front room in the Atrium Towers with a very good view of the Ocean and resort grounds. If you like Zip Lining, I highly recommend Kapalua Adventures in Kapalua. However, it is not for someone who is afraid of heights. Also went to Warren and Annabelle's magic show in Lahaina. It was very entertaining and would recommend. If you like Sport Fishing, I recommend the boat "Reel Lucky" out of Lahaina Harbor. Even though we caught just a couple of fish, it was fun and worth the experience. Only drawbacks. During peak season, be prepared to to grab a lounge chair very early in the morning by the pool (no later than 7:00am) or risk not having one for the day. The rooms, while comfortable, were very out dated. One other recommendation - There is a Safeway supermarket in Lahaina. This is a good place to stock up on snacks, beverages, etc. for your room. Much cheaper than the mini and snck bar in the room.

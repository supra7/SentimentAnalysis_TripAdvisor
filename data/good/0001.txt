Stayed there one night, December 16, on the way from Norther Virginia to Philadelphia. Located about a mile off 95, this place is clean, bright, and welcoming. The rooms are large; so is the made-to-order breakfast. The bedding is a cut above a Hampton Inn, say. All in all, a good stopover, with two caveats. Ask for a room not facing the Interstate. And have low expectations for the fitness center, a small room with one elliptical and two treadmills.

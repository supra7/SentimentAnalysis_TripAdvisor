Can't go to Seattle without visiting Pike Place Market. so why not just make it easy on yourself and stay at the Inn at the Market? We were there in August for a wedding ( about the only month you can plan an outdoor event) and the town is slammed with cruise ship tourists as thats the height of their season too. Don't even try to rent a car, - ridiculous parking rates and fees for downtown spots. We stayed at The Inn at the Market and loved the proxicimity to waterfront, ferries to out islands, museums and shops. Tasteful rooms, very clean. Just make sure you get a waterview room- worth the extra$ because the view is awesome. They also have a great rooftop deck for afternoons of wine and cheese from Bechlers at the corner.

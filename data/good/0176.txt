When we originally booked our trip to Seattle we only booked the first night at the Warwick (as it was a bit cheaper), but when we arrived I was really impressed. The hotel itself doesn't exactly look amazing from outside but the staff were really friendly on arrival and our room was brilliant. It seemed really big (I don't know if this is just an American thing) and we had a prefect view of the Space Needle. The other side of the hotel faces downtown so whichever side you're on the view should be alright. We were really tired after our flight but we did venture downstairs to the bar / restaurant for a few drinks before bed. Again the staff were really friendly and the food in the restaurant looked good (although we didn't actually have anything). The prices all seemed pretty reasonable. The following morning we were off to get on our cruise to Alaska and would be coming back to stay in the Fairmont Olympic one week later. In all honesty, even though the Fairmont was a 5 star hotel, I would have quite happily just gone back to the Warwick, it definitely had everything we needed. The location is pretty good, most things are easily in walking distance - especially the restaurants and shops of downtown. Pike street market is only about 5 minutes away and I would definitely recommend you give that a visit.

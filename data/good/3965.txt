Having stayed at several Hiltons this one has to rank among the highest. The views of downtown San Diego or the cornando bridge are great. depending on which room you can even seen the ball park. The Hotel is very big. parking is easy to get in and out. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The fox sports grill downstairs has some delicous burgers to chow down on. Check in and check out is a breeze. TWO THUMBS for this place.

We spent the Labor day weekend in San Diego to enjoy the Giants and Padres. The hotel is great location within walking distance over a very nice footbridge directly to the park. Great food in the Fox Sports cafe. Easy walking all over downtown Staff at hotel were very helpful and always willing to give you a smile. The rooms were worth the value and the higher rooms have great views.

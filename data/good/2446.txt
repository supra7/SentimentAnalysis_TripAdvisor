My first experience with a W and probably not the last. Arriving early, we were upgraded to one of the "w" named rooms whose designation escapes me at the moment. (Methinks they go a little overboard with all the "w" lingo) Check in was fast and efficient and the bell staff very good and quick. The room was large with a large sofa, king bed, desk, flat screen TV, robes and a huge bathroom. The condition of the furnishings was very good with no wear and tear noted. One note, if you are somewhat less than agile, the bath/shower required quite a step over the edge. Views from the upper floors are good with three sides offering a view of the Sound and the fourth of central downtown. Corridors are not well ighted as is typical of a W but more than adequate to find the room and elevators. The bed was comfortable although dealing with the 7 or 8 pillows was a struggle. The location is excellent for shopping and sight seeing. The Public Market with the "Flying fish" and many other shops is about 5 blocks away and the spectacular Public Library one block over from the hotel entrance. There are many restaurants nearby as well as what seems to be hundreds of coffee shops, this being Seattle. From what I have read before, this W is more or less typical of the chain. I recommend it to those who wish to be near the heart of Seattle and would stay again on vacation or business.

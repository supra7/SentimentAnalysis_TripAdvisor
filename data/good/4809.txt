If you happen to be in Istanbul during the colder period of the year, the spa facilities of this hotel are just what you need after a day sightseeing. The very friendly staff provided great service and the location is just perfect for the major sights. Rooms are clean and comfortable (we did not have a seaview but because of the bad weather it didn't make a difference to us). Very good restaurant next door (left hand side).

My friend and I were looking for a place for a girl's weekend and we picked the Mayflower Park. Our room was on the 11th floor (1110) with a peek-a-boo view of the Space Needle and Elliott Bay. The room was clean and well maintained with a English country house flair. We had a spacious bedroom with two double beds, a desk, a lounge chair and a small table holding a coffee maker. Best of all we had a huge closet and two bathrooms!! The hotel is right across the street from Macy's, a block from the monorail, 4 blocks from Pike Place Market. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. About 1/2 hr after we arrived in our room one of the front desk folks called to make sure we were satisified with our room.

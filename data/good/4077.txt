The Hyatt Regency is a very nice hotel with a huge pool and varied restaurants/shops. If you care about the beach do not stay here. The beach in front of the Hyatt is almost non-existent although we did see turtles literally right in front of the hotel. If all other things are equal except the beach I'd choose the Sheraton in Ka'anapali over the Hyatt.

I was attending a conference down the way at the Hyatt. This hotel was a great option, but it is a long walk to the Hyatt (which I appreciated, but some might not). The Hilton is modern and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. I did not go to the pool, but it did look small, but it did have lots of deck space for sunning. My room was on the smaller side, but my rate was very good (I think it was in the $150 range). I only ate at the Fox bar, it was standard bar food, but the service was attentive. There is a full service Starbucks on the ground level, which was good for breakfast. The hotel is beside the convention center and within easy walking distance of the Gaslamp Quarter. I also stayed at the Marriott Marina (the next hotel down from this one) and I much preferred this Hilton property. The Hilton was much more relaxed and less overrun with people.

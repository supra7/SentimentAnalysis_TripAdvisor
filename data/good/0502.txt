The rooms etc. have been described well enough by others, so I won't repeat. I generally use my hotel rooms only to sleep in, have a shower etc., so my expectations are easily met. It was quiet, had some charm (unlike many other pricer places I have stayed this year) and had a very friendly and helpful staff. The free wireless access was a big plus as well. The free wine tasting on the eve of my arrival was a very nice touch - not one I've run into at all elsewhere, and a good PR move by management. The rooms were as I expected from previous reviews, and there were no unpleasant surprises. Having a fridge, sink and stove were more than I required, although I did make use of that fridge! It's a good location, lots of nearby restaurants, a grocery store, liquor store and so on. The sights of the city are easily reached from there as well.

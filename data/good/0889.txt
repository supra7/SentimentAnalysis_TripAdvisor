We stayed there for a weekend just prior to Christmas. The service was excellent throughout, and the location was ideal - walking distance to Qwest Field, Pike Place and Westlake, and not far from Seattle Center. An excellent value for money. The only drawback was that the walls in our room were very thin, a fact we realized when the couple next door started horizontal jogging.

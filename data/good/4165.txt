We did the second leg of our honeymoon on Maui for a different pace than Oahu. Upon arrival, we were told there was no free self-parking and we had to park valet. The staff was trying to deal with a 500-person wedding and luau on Saturday night and was obviously frantic and harried. We were rushed through check-in and had to prompt the front desk to explain our honeymoon benefits as well as the free breakfast that came with our room. We were also told that all king size bed rooms were sold out (despite having reserved ours back in March). Our experience at the Hyatt did improve from here, however, with a nice room and gorgeous pool area. The beach in front of the hotel was deserted so we basically had a private beach which was great. This hotel was on the high-end scale but we felt nickeled and dimed for a lot of things. Despite paying a resort fee, free self-parking was very scare, free wireless internet was not included in our room and our complimentary champagne could only be used in one of their restaurants. We would consider staying here again, but it may not be at the top of our list.

I really appreciated the free cookies available at the front desk when we checked in at 11pm. They were probably the most impressive part of my entire stay, but that's not really a disappointment when you're paying just over $60 a night for a room in such a central location. The 6th Ave is the only survivor among a number of classic motor inn type establishments formerly available in this area, the others have been converted into dorms for Cornish College. Call them directly and they usually have something available well below market rate for the neighborhood. Like I said, though, it's acceptable but absolutely nothing beyond. The decor was probably original and not very attractive. The bathroom was clean. The bath/shower combo featured permanently installed product dispensers and scaldingly hot water. Noise travels a lot, especially if you have your windows open. Not my favorite place, but good for what it is.

I came to Seattle for a convention. The junior suite at the Inn was roomy and clean. Best of all it was both inexpensive and only 3 blocks from the convention center. The staff was helpful, and access to the hospital cafeteria offered very inexpensive breakfasts and lunches. It's not the Hilton, but you wouldn't expect it to be at the price we paid.

Room was spacious and clean and had a great view overlooking the harbour. It was very nice to just literally step out the 'back door' and go for a walk all around the bay in the morning. The hotel is really close to the Gaslamp area but not so close that you get all the noise and traffic that go along with it. The hotel has a Starbucks on site which was also great. My only complaint was they seemed to be understaffed. For a hotel that has conference and function rooms you would think they would be better equipped to deal with larger volumes of people they have staying there. There was always a huge queue at the concierge desk so I can't really comment on the staff (other than check-in, which was fine) because you couldn't really get anywhere near them.

Spent four days at the Hyatt Regency, Maui in March. The weather wasn't the greatest the first two days- The hotel was wonderful I took a package called 3 for 3 which included breakfast buffet and car rental. ( I did pay a little extra and upgraded the car to a convertible which I would recommend) When I checked in( I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member) they gave me an upgrade to a room with a ocean view. Very nice. I asked for a refrig. in the room and they sent one within the hour. The pools are very nice and the grounds are very tropical. Lots of chairs around the pools and on the lawn facing the ocean. Not much of a beach there, but no problem to walk down a ways toward the Westin and the beach is much nicer. I have stayed at the Westin and the Sheraton Maui and would definately stay here again.

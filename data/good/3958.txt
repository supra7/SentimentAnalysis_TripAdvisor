This was my second time @ this hotel. last time i was there was in nov. 2009 and i was pleased to see that changes for the better have been implemented. For one, the gym is free of charge now. last time i was there they were charging $15 a day. Also, paper @ your door M-F is free now( was 75C before) . and l was pleased to see when i was there that they had two people @ the concierge desk.. used to be just one person and a long line ! the restaurant is still good, breakfast buffet still pricy but decent. rooms are really nice, great bed!!. they only thing i still can not get used to is that the main entrance to the hotel-- hard to access if you are on foot -- entrance is hidden on the side of the hotel, facing a parking structure . but overall it is a very nice hotel.

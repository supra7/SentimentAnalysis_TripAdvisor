I just returned from a trip to Seattle and stayed at the Doubletree Hotel at SeaTac Airport. This hotel is very very good. I arrived two hours late and they had my room right available and it even had a nice balcony and view of the airport. The room was massive in size and they had all the amenities one could want in a hotel. I highly recommend this hotel for its pool, beds, proximity to teh airport (you can walk) and restaurant.

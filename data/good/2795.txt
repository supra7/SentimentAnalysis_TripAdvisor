I have been staying at this hotel for over fours and have stayed here over 60 nights during that time. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are very clean and tidy. If you can, ask if you can get a corner king room in the tower on the 4th floor or higher for a nice view of the Olympic Mountains. A major mall is only a 10 minute drive from the hotel with Nordstrom and Macys as two of its anchor stores.The only thing this hotel needs to offer is free wifi internet access. I will stay there again in the very near future and highly recommend it

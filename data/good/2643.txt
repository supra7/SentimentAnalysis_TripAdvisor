We stayed at this hotel for one night on May 20, 2006. We enjoyed it. Yes, the rooms are small but the bed is wonderful. We stayed in a king room on the 7th floor. We came in on the train from Sacramento and didn't arrive until 1:00 a.m. We had no problems checking in at all. There was actually a lot happening in the lobby and the music was a little loud from the restaurant/bar. There was no noise at all in our room. I thought the bathroom size was fine. We had a full bathtub/shower with plenty of room to get in and out of it. The staff was great. We checked out of our room Sunday morning as we were flying home that evening. When we went back to get our bags, we were met outside by a male staff member who told us he knew exactly which bags were ours and he ran inside to get them for us. Do yourself a favor and check out the breakfast menu there. We had a great breakfast. Originally, we didn't plan on eating breakfast there...it is a sushi restaurant after all. However, they had great breakfast items on the menu and it was all delicious. I would recommend this hotel but I do agree with other posters on this site that I am just not sure where someone with more luggage would put it. I would estimate that the rooms are about half the size of a normal American hotel room. However, the place is definitely hip and modern and very unique. If you are looking for something a little different from your average "cookie cutter" hotel room, check this place out.

We recently stayed 3 nights at the Hyatt Regency Maui as part of a family vacation that also included the Big Island. Our group was 10 people of various ages from different parts of the US. Maui is paradise on earth! The amazing climate and nature here really makes one feel glad to be alive. The Hyatt Regency Maui has a nice pool with a swim up bar and you can swim underneath a waterfall. The kiddos can enjoy a waterslide into a shallow kiddy pool. The grounds are well maintained, they even had black footed penguins here. The resort is not far from Lahaina which is a good place for shopping, eating or just a pleasant stroll. The lobby area was undergoing renovations so we did not really experience this property at it's best. Had I known about renovations at the time of booking, I definitely would have picked a different place to stay.

Mayflower Hotel was very nice and very convienient to points of interest and shopping. Room was clean and well maintained. Staff was professional and helpful. Found both Anduluca Restaurant and lounge excellent. They both mix superb drinks and food is out of this world; both worth a visit. My only complaint was that elevators are slow.

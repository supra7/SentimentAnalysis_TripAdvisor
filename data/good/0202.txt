We arrived on Sunday and checked into our room. We did just as we saw here and asked for an odd numbered room on the sixth or higher floors. The view was fabulous. The skyline and a direct view of the Space Needle. Quite impressive. The room was boutique and smaller than most luxury hotels but it was clean and comfy. We spent five days there and everyone was nice and helpful. We used the free internet to help navigate around the town. A very nice hotel centrally located in the downtown area. Everything was easily accessible by bus or foot. It would have helped to have a few bus schedules to points of interest in the lobby but the people riding the buses as well as the drivers were quite friendly and informative. The tv worked fine and had a great selection of channels. There is in room coffee, quite convenient but this is Seattle, coffee is much better from the surrounding shops. Pricewise and value wise this was a great place to stay. We enjoyed it thoroughly.

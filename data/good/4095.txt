Very good overall, but with one major exception.... the parking is awful. Every night we came back to the motel the parking lots were full and we had to use valet parking. The motel did not charge for valet parking under these curcumstance, but some of the valet staff were absolutely rude and it became a major annoyance. I would not mind the inconvience so much if the staff would have been more professional. In one situation the Hyatt staff directed me to park my car in a certain place and another staff came over and "chewed" me out for parking there. When I tried to explain that I was told to park there the staff member becamce more argumentative. My wife and I could not believe were treated this way.

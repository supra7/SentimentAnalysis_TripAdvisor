A great small hotel in historic building. The rooms are small and the street is noisy....but who cares, it's NYC. Basically, in NYC, space is at a premium and everything is small & expensive, and everything is sort of dirty and crowded...but that's New York. So, if you don't want to stay in a small hotel room, and want everything clean and perfect, don't go to New York City. For New York, the room rates are fantastic. Plus it's right next door to a subway stop. The best part of the hotel is the roof-top terrace - with it's amazing views. Also, the building is about 100 years old. So the building has lots of charm. So If you are looking for perfect cookie-cutter hotel rooms like the Hilton or other big chains, you will be disapointed. But if you want a real New York experience and are on a budget, it's PERFECT. When I return the New York, this is the only hotel I will stay at.

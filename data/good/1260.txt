We stayed for 4 nights and had booked in to one of the Club rooms on the 34th floor. From our room (3413) we had a good view of Puget Sound between the sky-scrapers. It was clean and modern and the king sized bed was really comfortable. It was very light and very scenic with the full sized window. We had free WiFi and use of the Club lounge. The lounge was not as good as some hotels but OK - the lounge was quite small so at busy times it was hard to find a seat. The main complaint with the club lounge was that the alcoholic drinks were NOT free (which they are in some cities). The bar prices were quite expensive but probably no more than other city centre hotels.

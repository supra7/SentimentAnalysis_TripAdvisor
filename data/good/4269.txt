My husband and I stayed eight nights at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort; this was our first trip to Hawaii. We had a very relaxing time. We elected a stay at Hyatt hotel after evaluating package prices on Travelocity; we took a leap of faith based on a good experience at a Hyatt hotel in London. Our reservation package included breakfast. We couldn't have been more pleased by our choice to stay at Hyatt. The hotel was well kept and clean. The entire staff seemed to effortlessly provide the most hospitable stay that we've ever had. The hotel provides numerous services on site including numerous restaurants. We had a great breakfast everyday at the Son'z. We had the best sushi at the Cascades Sushi Bar. There was a business center (for fee Internet service) and a guest laundry center. There are numerous shops --including a Macy's -- in the hotel. Our oceanfront deluxe room looked just like the picture posted on the Hyatt web page. The room was spacious and well appointed; it had a nice closet, sofa and balcony. The room had an 'iHome' iPod docking station/alarm clock - it was nice to listen to our own music. Our room and bath were extremely clean. The bath was stocked and restocked with bathrobes as well as full-sized bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion in addition to a full-sized bar of bath soap. The room had both a stocked mini-bar refrigerator as well as an empty refrigerator for our use. The room came with a coffee maker, but we were a disappointed with the quality of the coffee in the room. The pool and hot tub are clean and well maintained. The grounds are beautifully maintained. The lighting on the resort at night was magical.

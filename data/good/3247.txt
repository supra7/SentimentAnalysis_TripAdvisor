"We stayed at the Destiny Palms from April 4 till April 18 and enjoyed our stay there. The price was very affordable and the customer service was better than we expected. Any time we needed something the staff and management were always there to help us out. Chuck and his staff took really good care of us and made our stay very pleasant. One night we had some noise in the room next to us at about 1 in the morning and Chuck had come down within minutes to keep things quiet so we could sleep. The rooms were a little small but they were very clean and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. Probably the best we had ever experienced from a hotel in recent years. The maid service was also exceptional as we had our room cleaned and beds made thoroughly on a daily basis. The maid in charge spoke with me ( I think her name was Sita ) and I told her that her staff did an amazing job. I will pass on the good word to my friends in Canada about this hotel.

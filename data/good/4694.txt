My husband and I chose this hotel based on a raving recommendation from our travel agent and much research. I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews at this website because I enjoy plush, beautiful hotels...and many of the reviews noted that this hotel was 'dated.' I am soooo pleased that I read all of the reviews -- good AND bad...and my husband and I are happy to say that our 8-day dream vacation here was incredible. Our room and the service (especially the bellmen/maid/valet service) was beyond expectation...the warm, welcoming, cozy, tropical, Hawaiian atmosphere was exactly what we wanted our Hawaiian experience to be -- not a cookie cutter resort that had a 'created' atmosphere! My husband's highlight was the nightly hula show -- what a welcome sound to come 'home' to every night! The beach is by far the best in the area! We have plans to return (and have our lei re-strung to include a white nut!) and it won't be soon enough! The only investment in improvement I would recommend is at the Mixed Plate restaurant...but the other restaurant was wonderful and it worked out nicely that we had the option to use our breakfast buffet dollars toward a breakfast meal there! It was a wonderful experience!...thank you KBH!

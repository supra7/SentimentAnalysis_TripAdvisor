We paid $110 per night for 2 nights for this hotel. Overall I would say its decent, very good location and somewhat walking distance to mostly everything. I loved the artistic style of the hotel, quirky accents throughout the hotel and unique styles per room. However, the deluxe room we had with 1 queen bed was WAY too small for Seattle. It was almost NYC standard, we could barely get our legs in between the bed and the night stand. I would go back but maybe upgrade to a suite for more space. If you aren't a boutique hotel lover, this place isn't your dish.

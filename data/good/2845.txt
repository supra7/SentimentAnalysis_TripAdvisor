We stayed a couple of days in Seattle We were glad for the lower cost of staying outside downtown, combined with the convenience of public transportation. The 124 bus stops in front of the hotel and they provided a courtesy shuttle to the train station a few streets away, which was good because of the rain. The rooms were great, clean and comfortable. Rooms could have been more spacious but not much we can do about that. My daughter in laws were glad for the wireless because they could use there book readers to pass the evening hours. The staff were very helpful in directing use to the popular tourist areas and booked tours for us so we could see Seattle before going to Alaska.

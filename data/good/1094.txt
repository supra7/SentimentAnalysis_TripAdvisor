The Hilton is located close to many malls and shopping centers. All the stores are conveniently located within walking distance. Staff was very friendly and helpful in providing directions to the various attractions. Rooms are decent, nothing spectacular. Grabbing a taxi from the airport to the hotel is expensive o I would suggest taking the metro or shuttle.

Our familyof 4 visited this resort for 3 nights prior to our stay at the 4S Lanai. Here are my thoughts: We booked on the Regency Club Floor. Check-in was effortless and polite. Our room, while commanding a perfect view of the Pacific Ocean, was dated and dark. The beds and linens were comfortable but not luxury. The Club lounge offered standard breakfast contintental fare and a Happy 2 Hours with gratis beverages and pupus. Nice. The club staff was friendly and accomodating. The grounds were beautiful. The swimming pools and grotto bar were fun for both our children and ourselves. As mentioned in previous reviews, the beach is almost non-existent directly in front of the resort. However, to the left ( in front of the exercise/spa facilities), there is a very nice beach with activities for hire. The hotel lobby is somewhat impressive with exotic birds and Koa wood. Again, it is a bit dated, but is maintained well. Food at the restaurants was good to excellant. We liked the fact that we could walk to Whaler's Village for a change of venue. Having stayed at the Fairmont Kea Lani (2X), Westin, several luxury Maui condos, I would recommend the Hyatt for guests who like deluxe pool facilites, and would settle for basic amenities in their room. The location is great, workout facility is excellant, food is above average. We would probably return as our children loved the pool and ground facilities. Happy travels.

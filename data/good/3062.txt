I was recently in town for business and stayed at the Doubletree at the airport for one night and the Hilton for the second night. I found the Hilton to be a much better hotel for the business traveler. The beds were more comfortable, the rooms were quieter, and the room service food was above-average. While this Hilton was overall not as nice as other Hilton properties (no Executive Lounge/Floor and the look and feel more akin to a Marriott Courtyard), it was much newer and cleaner than the majority of airport hotels I've encountered. I can't speak to the parking garage situation since I left my car with valet and had no problems. I should note that the difference in price between valet and self park was minimal. If you're in town for business, this is a solid choice for an airport hotel.

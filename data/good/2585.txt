This is a great hotel close to everything downtown - Westlake center, Pacific Place for restaurants, shopping and movies, monarail and short walk to Pike St. We went there for our anniversary and we had a great time. We were able to get a king room for $119 which included free parking, wifi and 2 water bottles and chocolate truffles. Nice touch. Every thing was clean and nicely appointed. The workout room has 2 treadmills , 2 elliptical machines and a small weigh area. The TV in our room did not work but it sounds like they are in the process of replacing them as they breakdown. Overall we had a great time and would stay here again when we want to see the town and spend little time in our room. (Rooms are nice but small).

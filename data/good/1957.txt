I'm a Seattle native of 27 years. My wife and I have been staying in the Westin Seattle annually for a few years, for various local getaways like the Holiday season shopping. I find the Seattle Westin to be a great sleep, custoemer service-oriented, and always an exceptional location and value. My repeat business is a good indicator of the latter as they run specials like a free $100 gift card during the Holiday season and great AAA or Corp discounts, especially for a Downtown hotel location. You can usually find a way to get some type of discount. Highs: - Exceptional bed and comfortable room for the value - Iconic Seattle hotel with great views. Friendly and willing to "upgrade" you to a high floor most of the time. - Location to shopping, dining, and heart of Seatlte Downtown / Belltown Lows: - Dated exterior relative to the newer hotels. Rooms have all been remodeled though. - Parking premiums

We spent 4 nights at Secrets but, the hotel was overcrowded and we were asked to switch.The hotel was accommodating with the switch providing transfers and a terrific 2 night stay at Zoetry. We loved the beach at Secrets. Its great for long walks and water is crystal clear . They work hard to maintain the beach too clearing away any seaweed that washes up.The selection of restaurants/availablility of food is good.We especcially loved the mexican restaurant! The location of our room was nice with a view of swaying palms and local critters. The room was nice but not what we expected. The jacuzzi(pink stainsaround jets) and tub outside(had sand in it, bird poop) was not as clean as it should be therefore we did not utilize it during our stay. Staff was friendily and accomodating in most situations (even got us ice cream to go) However, tipping is a real issue that management needs to address. This is an all inclusive resort but staff"expected" tips. As a frequent traveler, we tried service without tipping at the pool/beach and got our first drink, never to see them again the rest of the day. When we tipped, they came back shortly afterwards. Pools are nice but need more loungers/floats. We look forward to returning when it's not quite so crowded with our free nights from our bump to Zoetry.

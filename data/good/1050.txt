Our trip to Seattle in late July/early August started with a 2 night stay at the Seattle Renaissance. The best part of this hotel was the location. It is such easy access to all the main sites of Seattle. We were able to easily walk to downtown, the piers, Pike's Place Market, and to the Monorail that took us to Seattle Center/Space Needle/Duck Tours. A rental car wouldn't have been necessary for the activities we did. The pool on the (?28th floor) was small, but offers a great view of the city. You can find an even better view of the city from the lounge/bar area. They offered a great happy hour with great tasting appetizers.

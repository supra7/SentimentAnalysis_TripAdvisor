I /we have been to KBH 8 times and I am planning to go back for number 9 in two weeks. I guess I just love the location, and the people who work there they are very friendly and not phony as I have seen in other places. I love the grounds, the food is good and affordable. The Tiki Grill at poolside is great as well as the bar. There are also many activities to keep you busy if so desire. In the evening there is a free show in the courtyard, at sundown which is also very entertaining. I guess I just love the place, and that is why I make the trip from Massachusetts to Maui each year.

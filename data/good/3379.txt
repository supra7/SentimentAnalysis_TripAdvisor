The property was very clean. All of the employees were very helpful and extremely friendly. We stayed at the preferred level which I don't think offerred much benefit over the regular rooms. We did have our own club where we checked-in and had access to beverages, snacks, and computers. However, even though the property was full, it didn't seem as though regular checkin area was busy. There was an abundance of food and drink and the club level did not afford you any special privilege as far as dinner reservations as it does at some resorts. We had an ocean view on the top floor which was very nice. comfortable beds, but luke-warm shower. Turn-down service was hit or miss. The rooms were very clean, but serviced at random times throughout the day. There were exercise classes, kyaking, biking, tennis etc, but it seemed most people hung out by the pool and drank. I don't drink much, but it they had a wide choice of top-shelf liquor. The main pool was heated. One thing we discovered early on was that they had great beach beds by the bar on the beach that you have to reserve a day in advance-most people don't know this. It made our days at the beach quite enjoyable. The beach is beautiful white sand and cleaned daily. There is a reef that you can take a short boat trip to snorkle, but there is no snorkling off the beach. The food was what we expected at an all inclusive. breakfasts were very good with an excellent choice of fresh fruits. The lunches were ok. Dinners were good, not great. The Portofino restaurant was actually quite good and the best meal we had. We never had to wait for a table even though most of the restaurants didn't take reservations. We didn't make it to much of the night-life partying, but people seem to enjoy themselves. they also had first run movies in the outdoor theatre which was cool.

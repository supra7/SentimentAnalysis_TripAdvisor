Great central location close to the local attractions of Pike Place and the waterfront. A short walk from the football stadium and space needle or monorail. Great shops located nearby. Room was typical of this type of hotel, comfortable and quite. Top floor pool and gym were novel, although a larger changing facility might have been better! We used valet parking, which as is typical for Seattle isn't cheap; it was efficient though. Some indication of the current US economic downturn was evident at night in the local area, but they were kept out of the hotel. The bar was fine but we didn't use the restaurant as there are plenty of affordable local one's nearby.

My husband and I spent 5 days at this hotel Jan 2012 and really enjoyed ourselves. The place started with great staff, always helpful and very polite and ended the same way. The breakfast buffet was included in our stay and it was very delicious. We never had to wait for anything here, the staff always was available and so very polite. Our only problem, which was remedied after the first night, was our room type wasn't available (2 Queens instead of 1 King). After talking with the front desk people and our travel agent, the King was available the next day. The pool was pretty little, but it did the trick anyway. The beach is beautiful there so that was a big hit with us. We ate dinner in Lahaina every night, and it was really very convenient. The traffic in this area of Maui is terribly congested, but the beauty of the area made up for this. Since this was whale watching time, you could watch the whales jumping out of the water at any time of day right from your balcony. It was spectacular. We also did the magic show at the hotel, very fun with a great dinner too. The concierge there was very informative for us, and she suggested the "Feast at Lele in Lahaina, which was a total blast. Great food and great hula and dancing. We would definitely come back!

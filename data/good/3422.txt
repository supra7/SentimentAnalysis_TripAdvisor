I don't think you could come to Secrets Maroma and not enjoy your stay. The resort is lovely, the rooms are comfortable, the staff is wonderful, and the beach is perfection. They provide numerous small services that make you feel very special. For me, the two big factors in choosing Secrets Maroma were the quality of the food and the beach. The expectations for these were both set by the reviews in Trip Advisor. This was my first stay at an all inclusive resort, but I have been on several cruises, and while the food on cruises has always been plentiful, I have never found it particularly good. So I was definitely swayed by all of the excellent food reviews I saw. The quality of the beach definitely lived up to expectations but the quality of the food did not come close. I am a well-traveled foodie from the San Francisco Bay area, so my standards are pretty high. The dinner we had at the Teppanyaki table at Himitsu (reservations required) was the one excellent dinner that we had. The dinners we had at Oceana (seafood) and Portofino (Italian) had a few good items and were otherwise ok, but if I ate at a restaurant of that quality at home, I would not go back or recommend it. The dinners at the Mexican restaurant and the two special buffet dinners we went to did not stand out in any way. The breakfast buffet was very nice and the hamburgers that they had for lunch by the pool and the beach were the best burgers I've had in a long time anywhere. The grilled fish with garlic sauce by the pool was very good as was the food they served around the pool. The guacamole was great. No matter what I thought about the quality of the food, the service was always excellent! Everyone was very warm, welcoming, and couldn't do enough to help you enjoy your stay.

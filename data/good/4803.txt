What a little gem of a hotel for tourists. Excellent location (10 mins walk to most of the key sites), really good facilities and top class service from every member of staff we dealt with. Only one word of warning - 'deluxe suite' rather over-states it by anyone used to American hotels - deluxe room would be a very fair description, though. Extremely quiet (unlike many hotels in the same area), very comfortable, well equipped and beqautifully maintained. Highly recommended.

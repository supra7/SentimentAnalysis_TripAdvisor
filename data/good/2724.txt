Located within a few miles of Sea-Tac this is a very large hotel with a Starbucks, gift shop, meeting rooms, breakfast room, bar and dining room. The food was a little expensive-$13 for a burger and $12 for an omelette alone. However it was good enough. I had a spacious and clean suite with fridge, microwave, nice sized table and a comfortable bed. I loved that the heating system was quiet. I had plently of outlets, but my suite on the 12th floor had recently been remodeled. The walk out balcony was a nice surprise. It has a main tower, which is the best place to stay as you are close to everything, as well as several wings. From the wings it was a bit of a hike to the restaurants and front desk. Nice pool and fitness areas. Parking is expensive at $25 for valet and $21.50 for self-park per night. Free shuttle to and from airport helps. Verify internet price-not free. Good jumping off spot for wherever you want to go.

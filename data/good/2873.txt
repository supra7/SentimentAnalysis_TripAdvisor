We stayed here for one night with our 2 kids (ages 7 and 9). Our room was very clean and spacious. Very nice to have a separate room for the kids to sleep in. The managers reception was great- the kids had Shirley Temples and we had some cocktails. We ordered pizza from a local place and the front desk staff gave us a bunch of coupons to choose from which was very nice. The breakfast the next morning was very good- lots of choices. My only complaint is that there were no luggage carts when we arrived. Also, the $8 fee for parking seems silly. We have stayed here in the past and there was no parking fee. The staff held our luggage for us the next day after we checked out while we went to the Mariners game. This was very helpful since we didn't want to leave all of it unattended for several hours in our car. We would definitely stay here again. If you are willing to pay in advance, the on-line rates are very reasonable.

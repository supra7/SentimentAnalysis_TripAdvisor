Based largely on Trip Advisor reviews, my husband and I stayed here 3 nights while vacationing in Montreal. Le Crystal is a new, sleek suite hotel in a very convenient location (unless you want to be in Vieux Montreal). We loved the privacy of the bedroom within the suite; the large, well appointed bathroom; and the lovely pool and exercise room. The location was good as well - near a Metro stop, shopping, Mont Royal and restaurants.

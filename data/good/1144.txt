Quality Inn was, like many, in need of updating but was clean and comfortable. Bed comfortable and showers hot. Stayed 5 days, one more than planned. Original room was small, queen bed, but because of a water leak was moved to a king suite. Even the smaller room provided the comfy bed and hot shower! Staff were friendly, courteous, helpful and accommodating. Parking is an issue but they do have limited parking. Early arrival probably helps. We never got into our car after arrival. Great breakfasts provided also. Best part is location. 2 blocks from Space Needle, Music Experience and Monorail. Restuarants, bars in area. Monorail will get you downtown where you can easily walk to Pike's Market and Harbor area. You can also walk down Broad St., which is near, down to Harbor area. Tour buses also available near Space Needle. Beautiful area! Definitely would stay here again.

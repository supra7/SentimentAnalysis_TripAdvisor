We just got back from our second stay at the Hyatt. This was another great experience. The first day we saw whales from the beach, which was an unexpected surprise. We rented a cabana and had the beach completely to ourselves, which was very relaxing. Most people stay around the pool, which is also nice. As others have mentioned, if you leave at night, finding a place to park when you get back can be a challenge, and like every other hotel in Hawaii, the on site restaurants are horribly overpriced. If you take a short drive into Lahaina, there are good restaurants that are more reasonable and less crowded than those an Whalers Village. The ground are amazing, complete with Penguins, Swans, Flamingoes, Parrots and all sorts of other exotic birds. Overall, we really enjoyed the stay and will likely return.

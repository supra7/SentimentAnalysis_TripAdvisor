We stayed at your sister hotel in Tacoma,The Hotel Murano and were so impressed with decor, staff, location that we decided to try the Max. It is so close to everything in downtown, and yet easy to get to other destinations. The room was a bit small, but very comfortable and for the price, exceded our needs. Look forward to doing some downtown Christmas shopping and staying so close to the shops. We are looking forward to having dinner at the Sushi restaurant, the menu was impressive.

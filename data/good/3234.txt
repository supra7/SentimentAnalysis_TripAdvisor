We chose Destiny Palms as a result of using a coupon advertising $29.95 a night. Didn't get that rate due to Presidents Day Weekend but took it at $44.95 because of good write ups on Tripadvisor. After 3 weeks of mostly cool and windy weather in Destin we decided to drive Southwest to Orlando area for warmth. Warm it was as temperature were in upper 70's and 80's for our 8 days there. Room was a bit small due to all of our luggage but overall was quite nice including an outstanding king size bed. Dining area for breakfast was very tight and was our only complaint. A good many restaurants closeby and of course Disney property was very close.

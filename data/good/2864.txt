We were quickly checked in and found the staff to be helpful in directing us to restaurants within walking distance. The room was pretty nice, but the sofa was in desperate need of new upholstery or replacement. Food at their restaurant is quite high in price, but the menu selection was nice. The free evening reception consists of popcorn, salsa and chips for food. The drinks are not to be taken lightly; they actually serve hard liquor and don't hold back on the pour either. Samuel Adams is also served on tap. My husband was very impressed and happy with this. Most evening receptions are beer and cheap wine only. The free breakfast was also fantastic!

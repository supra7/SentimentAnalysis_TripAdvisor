Me an some friend havd a wonderful visit to hawaii We stayed @ the hyatt Maui resort spa ..........but found it very dissapointed to learn that there was no smoking on the outside balcony of our hotel room. yes we knew that we were in a no smoking hotel but they did not specify that there was no smoking on the balcony. All of the hotels that i stay in that are no smoking allow you to smoke on the outside balcony. You guys should state this prohibition in your ad. We would have chosen to stay at another hotel that was not so STRICT!

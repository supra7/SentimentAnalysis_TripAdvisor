Very good location in the down town of Seattle. Walking distance to the Waterfront, Food Market and Art Museum. Very professional and friendly service, including afternoon testing of Washington wines. The downstairs Italian restaurant is the good option for the evening, reservation recommended. The room and the bathroom we had, were quite small and dark, with an uninteresting view from the window. But the was the cheapest option in the internet rates. The pleasant surprise at the check out - free parking for the whole stay.

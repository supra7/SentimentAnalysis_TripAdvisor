We stayed here in 1990 and couldn't wait to come back. The hotel is very Hawaiin with hula lessons, lei making and other free cultural/nature acitivities offered. Entertainment every night in the courtyard area. The small touches suchs as orchids on your pillow everynight, cookies too, box of macadamia nuts, and a bottle of champagne in the fridge because it was our anniversary. The welcome breakfast my husband wanted to skip but I am so glad we did it, the whole staff housekeeping included gets up on stage to sing a hawaiin song/welcome. The place is not fancy like upscale high rise glass and chrome places but has a homey atmosphere. The tiki bar is outside and fun to sit and relax, watch the show, watch the sunset. The Tiki restaurant is outside and we ate there every morning for breakfast the food is great, but not cheap. I think you are paying for eating outside. But we loved it. Plus that area the sidewalk runs along the beach and lots of of other hotels restaurants to eat and explore. We ate a Lelainis the first night at the nice restaurant not bar and grill food was good, $40-range. Again you can eat outside which we loved. The Hula Bar and Grill was ok too we started at the bar and then ate outside when we got a table, the entertainment was a little more "hip" than the KBH. Nice change. All in all Maui is great - don't miss the Volcano drive and we ate in Paia at Charleys where Wille Nelson stops in - he is right there breakfast is great!

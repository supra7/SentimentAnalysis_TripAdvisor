Excellent location on Kaanapali Beach. Beautiful beach with pretty beachwalk connecting resorts and Whalers Village shopping mall. Hotel has beautiful, well-maintained grounds with an outdoor bar and grill. Rooms were adequate, but not luxurious. Staff was delightful and very helpful. Excellent value for the price; a relative bargain along this pricey stretch of beach.

My boyfriend and I, along with 3 seniors(my boyfriend's grandma and her 2 sisters) had spent our thanksgiving of 2003 in maui, and we stayed at Hytt. The whole experience was great, it is just that i wouldn't recommend maui for seniors though. The hotel did provided a wheel chair for one of our seniors and very attentive to our need. The hotel is very nice, with just one thing dispointing, the BEACH. the one right in front of the hotel is practically unusable, you would need to walk about 15 min to the one in front of westin or marriot. of course, if you are looking for the better snorkelling spot at black rock, that would be a good 30 min walk. There is a beach path that would take you all the way to blackrock by the way, which is nice, along the way, the whaler shopping center is right there too. so, you could take a break. Overall, it 's not a bad experience. We are going to Maui again Oct 2004, and we will be staying at Wealia this time, will have a comparison when we come back.

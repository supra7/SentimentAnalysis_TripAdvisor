Stayed 3 nights at the Alux Playa hotel and was pleasantly surprised as to both the value and location of the hotel as it's great. We travelled on a budget as we were going south to Belize, but let me assure you if you can get a flight to Cancun and need a base in a great location (Playa del Carmen) then this is the spot for both cost and location as i would give it maximum points on both. The hotel is clean, comfortable and basic and if you bear this in mind you will not be disappoint. The owners/managers were very nice and helpful but spoke very little English. All in all a good value vacation stop if you need a cheap and cheerful spot to rest your weary head

My husband and I got married at KBH in April 2008 and we stayed there for our 2-week honeymoon afterwards. We found all of the staff to be extremely welcoming and friendly. Everyone from the valets, bus boys, waitresses - everyone was very nice. The wedding coordinator was very helpful during our wedding planning process. The grounds are maintained to perfection. Our room was average. We stayed on a ground level room looking out onto the gardens and pool. Next time we would like a room on one of the higher levels. We bought the breakfasts with our packages. We grew very tired of the Mixed Plate breakfast buffet. Actually by the end of our stay, we didn't even want to eat there any more because we were so tired of it and the food was only so-so. The dinners at the Tiki Terrace restaurant were delicious and the entertainment was very good - especially the Saturday night band. The parking in the lot isn't very good and the spaces are very tight, so you definitely want to pay for the valet parking. Some of the best snorkeling is right on the beach there at Black Rock. Whaler's Village is a short walk away. We will definitely stay there again and bring our leis back with us. It's an excellent value for the money.

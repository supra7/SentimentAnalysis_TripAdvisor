We have stayed at the eldorado about 8 or 9 times and it is our favorite. We stayed at the Westin the last time we were in Maui and it was great for a hotel but it isn't as nice and laid back as the eldorado. The staff at the eldorado go above and beyond to make your stay perfect. From the desk staff to the maids and grounds keepers they are all wonderful and we can't wait to return.

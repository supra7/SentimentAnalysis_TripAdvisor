I stayed here for three nights and never had a problem. Parking is a problem and the cost is $23 a night or $26 a night with in/out privileges. Parking garage is located behind the hotel and and getting to it is interesting, but, once you mastered it, no problem. Location of hotel is great. Walking distance to most all inner harbor attractions and Little Italy section of Baltimore. Staff is courteous and friendly and provided maps and directions when asked. I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in Baltimore.

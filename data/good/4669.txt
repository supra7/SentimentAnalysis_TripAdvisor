We had an OceanView Room with a nice view of the Whale Pool , Garden and Ocean. Fine. 2 Breakfasts daily included in package, and rental car. They gave us a nice bottle of Champagne. The Hotel and staff are wonderful. The only downside is they need a hot tub or two. On the 6th Floor Maui Wing the ice machine was out for a week and the soft drink machine empty and we complained to management and nothing was done. Staff very friendly, a good value, a lot of free activitiies. Great Location on Beach and close to Whaler's village and near Black Rock Snorkel. We could see Lanai and Molokai from our 6th Floor Balcony. There is absolutely no competition for good beach chairs. There did not seem to be a shortage of Cabana's for rent for $30 a day. It would be nice if the hotel had room service. In the Whaler's Village please avoid the Rusty Harpoon, way overpriced and the food is terrible! Don't eat here. The Hotel had a safe and fridge and free coffee and the room decor was nice. All in all we enjoyed ourselves and would stay again.

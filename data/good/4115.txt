Great accommodations. Clean. Lots to do and a great place to relax. Good meeting facilities as well. Nice spa. Good food. Overall expensive which one would expect from a resort like this. The beach was ok-- small. We had a bad experience with the customer service at the concierge desk which surprised us for Hyatt. Other than the poor customer service at the concierge desk, we were impressed by the hotel. We would return only if business brought us back to the hotel but we saw a lot of vacationers who seemed to be enjoying themselves.

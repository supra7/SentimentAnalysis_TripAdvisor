Stayed 4 nights recently. Booked cheapest room and upgraded to a Fabulous room on 23rd floor with an awesome view of the bay and needle as a Gold member. Used the Acura service, which is free and will take you anywhere downtown. The gym was recently redone and was nice with new equipment and fresh fruit to eat...NO bottled water...boo! They have a great Happy Hour till 7pm, M-F. The prices are cheap for Seattle so take advantage, get a drink and sit by the fireplace. Manager of the hotel was outstanding. I needed $10 dollars to pay for a cab ride and the ATM was disabled. I asked the front desk if they could add the $10 dollars to my bill and give me the cash. Front desk clerk said "NO" and manager said yes, no questions asked. Outstanding service. Location is perfect. Walking distance to everything. Pikes and shopping is all within 2 to 5 blocks of the hotel.

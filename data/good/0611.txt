We immediately liked the look and feel of this hotel. It is very conveniently located for those of us taking public transportation from the airport. All the members of the staff were gracious and helpful. We were upgraded to a suite on the 10th floor and were very pleased with it. The curtains in the bedroom allowed us to make the room very dark, which made for a great nights sleep. The housekeeping service was wonderful. Both concierges were incredible and helped make our stay fantastic. We thank them. It was an easy walk to Puget Sound and all the sights there. The monorail was easily accessed - we didn't have to walk outside to get to it.

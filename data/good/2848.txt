This is a great choice for a budget minded family on an overnight stay in Seattle. My family of 5 stayed here as a stopover on our way to Houston. The hotel staff were friendly and our suite was big enough for our whole family with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed. This hotel features an excellent hot buffet breakfast and a nightly managers reception which was on for 2 hours. On the breakfast alone, this is great value for a family of 5. Two thumbs up.

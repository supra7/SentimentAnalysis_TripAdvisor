Great location next to the gaslamp district. beautiful decor in the lobby and rooms and plenty to do near by. great views and the bay is right outside your window. I strongly recommmend this hotel to anyone visiting San diego. The light rail is also very close by. THe only drawback is that you have to pay for parking and it may be a little expensive at times. The staff was very professional and friendly

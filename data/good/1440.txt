My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to our Alaskan cruise out of Seattle. I booked this hotel on Hotwire for 129 per night, which I think is a good deal for the $$. Pro: Great location, just a few easy blocks straight down the street to Pikes Market, the monorail to the Space Needle, etc. Big bed, comfortable, good coffee. Quiet overall. Con: Small disorganized lobby (under renovation), slow elevators, dated room furniture and decor. Overall, a very nice place, and I have no major complaints. However, I wouldn't rate it a four star, nor would I be willing to pay much more for the room than what I paid.

Although it was a very short stay at this hotel (The Hyatt Regency Maui) we enjoyed our time spent there. The hotel grounds were lovely and offered many "quiet" places to meditate and just enjoy the calm beauty of the grounds. Our only disappointment was the food. The Swan Court was fine for breakfast but did not care for the cuisine at Son'z Restaurant.

Easy check-in/out. Courteous front dask and Coldwater restaurant staff. Room amenities above average, dual shower heads height NOTan issue, my height is 6' tall. Location very condusive to exploring most city sectors on foot. Four available elevators Never encountered a wait issue even with on-going conferences. Utilized ajoining parking garage at $126.00 weekly with skybridge connection to North tower. On street parking very expensive bordering on excessive and quit a deterrant to recurring visit! Room attendants tasks appeared transparent during seven day stay. On our floor there was the occasional barking of a dog which we acclimated to eventually. Rating of stay 9 of 10. P.S. Gardeners Do try to visit KUBOTA Gardens.

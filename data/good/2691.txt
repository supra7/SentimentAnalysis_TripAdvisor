I found the Roosevelt Hotel on Easy Click Travels.....very good value and THE PERFECT downtown location. Rooms could use a refresh, but clean and quiet. Elevator went out for about two hours and I had to hike to the 18th floor. Staff was very friendly and responsive to my needs. Given that I spent the entire trip out siteseeing, I'll return again and again for the price and value.

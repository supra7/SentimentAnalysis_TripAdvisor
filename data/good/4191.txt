We exchanged via a timeshare and our room was a bit tight for 2 adults and 2 kids. Aside from that the hotel delivered everything as promised on their website. The staff were absolutely right on the mark. There was no sense of employee unhappiness at any time which is very important to my wife and I as were are both union and spend lots of time south of the American border where the atmosphere is not always so welcoming. All the support staff were nothing short of 1st class !! Not one experience in 7 days of staff angst!!!. We can't wait to come back and reccomend this property to anyone looking for a outstanding experience. P.S. Dont miss the "Stargazing on the roof" event. The gentlemen guiding this experience is absolutely top shelf. His passion of showing us the stars through his telescopes was truly fantastic. To see the planets and stars from the top of this hotel is not only suprising but wonderful.

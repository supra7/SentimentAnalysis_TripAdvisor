Very good location in Kaanapali although the development is set back from the beach. Although a lot of the units have no ocean view, our end-unit in Building A was right on the golf course and had an excellent ocean view (perhaps we paid a premium). The cabanna on the beach was reserved for Eldorado use only and we found it to be very useful and convenient, especially with the golf-cart type shuttle service provided between the units and the cabanna. The two bedroom and two bedroom unit was very spacious (approx 1800sf) and the beds comfortable. The main swimming pool is not very attractive but we did not mind too much as best use was made of the beach. Black Rock at the beach has great snorkelling but only when the water is reasonably calm. TIP: get a membership/discount card at Foodland in Lahaina (from the service desk in the store at no charge) and save an average of 20% on food and drink.

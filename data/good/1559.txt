Long flight, wonderful doorman, sent us to Palace kitchen around the corner for exactly what we needed. The room was comfy and location was centrally located for the touristy things we wanted to do. The gym could use another machine, had to wait both days. Thats the only negative comment I can make about the hotel. Will stay there again.

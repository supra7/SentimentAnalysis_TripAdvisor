Like the Apple Cider & that we got a great deal on Priceline. The room was modern and the bed was comfortable. Disliked that the parking was twenty dollars a night. Cheaper at Wally Park next door. The internet in the room was $5 an hour, and would disconnect you after each hour to have you renew (very bad if you need to remote in to work).

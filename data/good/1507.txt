I have stayed there a few times and each time it has been an excellent stay. I have recommended friends there and family also. Me and my wife stay at the Hotel when we want to have a weekend getaway from all the busyness lol. The rooms are warm and comfortable. I like how the Hotel itself is going "green." And for the location it is very quiet and relaxing. And the prices are just right and affordable, you will definitely get your money worth at this Hotel.

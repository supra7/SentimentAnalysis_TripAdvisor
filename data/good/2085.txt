This is a huge hotel! Many amenities and considering all the people that are staying there, the rooms are surprisingly quiet. Me and my husband checked in late at night. The view from the room is nice. The next morning when we left, there were a million people walking around, but the great thing is that we never heard them. It has great cable tv, room service (which is overpriced as you would expect, and food is just ok). I'm sure there are many amenities here that we didnt take advantage of but overall the peace and quiet in our room was worth every penny.

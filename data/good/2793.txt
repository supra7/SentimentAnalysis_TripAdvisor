As prior reviewers state, great place to stay the night before a flight. Stayed with my teenage son. Wonderfully quiet, considering the airport is literally across the street. Rooms large and comfortable. But still charging for the internet!! (and no in room wireless). It may be a profit center, but when Best Western gives free internet, it is time to change the policy. Also, charge for parking for overnight quests leaves a sour taste. I understand charging when leaving the car consecutive days when not using the hotel, but there shouldn't be a charge at a suburban hotel for guests for one night.

I spent there 8 nights. Just opposit the desk, it isn't too big room, but there is enough place for your things, and the bathroom is large. You can use aircondition and a little fridge in the room. I go to Rome every summer, and this was the best place up to now. Evereything is close, on Largo Argentina you can find plenty of bus. They have put a big sign on the frontdoor, so you can find it easy.

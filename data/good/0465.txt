Even though only one of our three requests were met, we still had a great experience at the Crowne Plaza booking through Hotwire. The staff was friendly and efficient, the room was great, and the location of the hotel made it extremely accesible to all of Seattle's highlights. I couldn't see myslef paying $150 a night for this room, but through Hotwire, $73 was more than acceptable. The only negatives; I understand parking is ridiculous in downtown Seattle, but the $27 valet parking fee should be made clear when making the reservation. As for the requests we made; We wanted a non-smoking room but wound up with smoking. Not too bad though considering the smell was not very noticeable. Our friends who stayed in the inter-connecting room next door (our only request that was granted) were not as lucky. They are non-smokers as well, but the room they were in was definately not. My friend's girlfriend actually got a headache because the stench was so overpowering. (The hotel allowed them to switch to a non-smoking room for the second night of their stay.) The last request that was denied was not too big of a deal. My lady and I wanted one queen bed, but ended up in a room with two doubles. We remedied this by pushing both of them together. All in all I was happy with our stay at Crowne Plaza. I would recommend booking through hotwire if you are the kind of person that can go with the flow even if not getting exactly what you request, i.e. non-smoking, # of beds, etc. The money we saved on the room allowed us to be less frugal when enjoying downtown Seattle.

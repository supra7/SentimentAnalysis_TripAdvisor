I stayed at the Westin with my husband, mom and dad this past weekend for one night. We came to Seattle primarily to catch a game at Safeco. We got a great deal on two rooms through Hotwire, and although we had requested a king bed in each room, we were told when checking in that we were placed in adjoining rooms with two double beds. The pleasant lady checking us in told us we could have rooms with king beds but they would be on different floors (20th and 21st). That was no problem for us. The line-up to check in was fairly long as we arrived at 4:00, but it went surprisingly fast. We were happy with our rooms and other reviewers are right when they say the rooms are rather dated but the beds are heavenly. We had an iron burn in the carpet right in the middle of the room, but I had the best sleep I've had in ages! To me that is more important. The hotel is in the perfect location. It is easy to get to from the I-5, and within walking distance to everything. We didn't take a cab anywhere, but we do like to walk when we can - helps to work off all the great food! We even walked to and from Safeco even though we were told it is too far to walk to (it's about 30 minutes at a good pace). It helped that on the walk there we stopped for dinner and drinks, which did break up the walk nicely. The concierge was very helpful with our questions. The lobby bar was expensive, but it seemed like the normal price for bars in Seattle from what we could tell (we're just not used to paying $9 for a cocktail). I would not hesitate to book the Westin again, only next time I'll book for more than one night!

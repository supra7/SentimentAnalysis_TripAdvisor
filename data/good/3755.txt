My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as a short getaway to Indianapolis. One of the things we were looking forward to doing during our visit was a tour of the Colts' Lucas Oil Stadium. As far as location goes, this hotel is the perfect place to stay if you're wanting to do that or are going for a Colts game. On the other hand, this hotel is just a short drive from the Indianapolis Zoo, canal walk, and downtown shopping and sightseeing, but might not be ideal if you're wanting to walk to those places. They aren't as close as they appear on maps, and local construction and busy streets made walking not as safe. Besides the stadium, two other hotels and a gas station across the street, there isn't really anything else within a few blocks. During the stay, you can either park in a parking garage adjacent to the hotel or in a small parking lot behind the hotel if there's room. There was room for us to park in the lot, but they still automatically added $10/day to our bill for parking, which I thought was odd... The room was nice with trendy furnishings, but nothing spectacular. We were able to enjoy both the whirlpool and the heated swimming pool. The gym also looked nice, but we didn't use it during our stay. I loved how the front lobby area was decorated and enjoyed sitting there in the morning to watch the news on TV. There also are three computers in the lobby that are free to use and had super-fast internet. The hotel provides a free, but basic continental breakfast with one hot "special" of the day (scrambled eggs w/ diced ham one morning and bacon and hard-boiled eggs the next), and also served bagels, toast, cereal, danishes, fruit and juice, milk and coffee. The hotel also has a cafe/bar area where you can order meals and drinks and I noticed a lot of other people eating/drinking there. Overall, we were satisfied with this hotel and would probably stay there again when visiting Indianapolis.

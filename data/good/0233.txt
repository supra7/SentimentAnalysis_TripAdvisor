The room was nice, Location was good, View was wonderful.... Top floor (19th) Corner suite Room 1901 the balcony they advertise you can barely stand sideways on. The staff were great. The only complaint was the bathroom.... dirty Q-tip on counter when we arrived and dirty towel on floor by garbage can! How can a Housekeeper miss this? Hair in the tub. Room could use some upgrading looking a little worn.

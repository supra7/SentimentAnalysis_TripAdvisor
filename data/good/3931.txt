Stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of June. Hotel is very conveniently located next to the convention center and has a new pedestrian bridge over to the Gas lamp area, and Petco park. We found the hotel staff to be quite friendly and helpful. Our room was fairly basic but nice and clean. We had a pretty good lunch at the Fox Grill which is attached to the hotel. My only complaint would be the incredibly expensive wi-fi service. Overall we had a nice stay here and would return.

We stayed here for two days our cruise ship was leaving out of Seattle. Westin was in a great location to the Market, Space Needle, Statium, and restaurants. The consierge was fantastic and offered great ideas. We had no clue there was free transportation! Our room was so comfy, had a great view, and most importantly was super clean. We used the gym both days we were there which was hotel typical, but again clean and updated. We had a great stay!

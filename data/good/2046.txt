Hotel is very well located to see the highlights of Seattle. Monorail to Space Needle/Experience Music Project/ Sci-Fi Museum is a few blocks away, easy walking distance. Same for Pikes Place Market and great local restaurants. Hotel seems to cater to business travellers which explains the coffee stains on the the carpet next to the desk. No joke. Stayed in 3 different rooms in same hotel. Coffee stains in 2 out of 3. BUT have to say after checking in very late (1am) and the next morning mildly complaining about the cleanliness of the room, we were upgraded (without asking) to a room on the top floor with a perfect view of the Space Needle. (Thank you Marissa!). Many fine local restaurants within walking distance nearby.(Top Pot for doughnuts, Serious Pie for pizza). There is also a drugstore one block over for any forgotten items. Check out the "Local Vine" for some great Washington wines! Staff very friendly and helpful Happy to make reservations for dinner etc..). BTW Taxi service in Seattle is awful. Waited 45 minutes for taxi to cruise pier that never arrived. Can recommened Daniel at Liberty Transport [--] who helped us out while he was there picking up another fare. Overall would definitely stay here again and would rec'd to anyone. Try out the "Washington Red Apple Martini" with free wi-fi in the lobby at hotel.

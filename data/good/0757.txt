The Moore Hotel offered us a night in a very nice bed, which we were not used to in our homestay. For 35$ per person, the night was very comfortable and the shared bathroom perfect. The Hotel was very clean. The People at the Reception friendly. You felt very safe in this hotel because they cared!!! Thanks a lot!

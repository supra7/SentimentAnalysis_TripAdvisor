Pros: On the whole was an enjoyable stay. Rooms and bath were clean and the beds had crisp sheets. The room was well appointed (amenities like DVD, Audio Players were a nice touch) including the furniture. Minibar was well stocked with items including toiletries. Cons: The service was good but could have been better for the price. It would have been great if they included items like free Internet connectivity and simple items like a complimentary bottle of water. Comments: Agree with the other review that the lighting in the halls and public places could have been brighter (atleast twice as much) without sacrificing the ambience that they are endeavouring to create.

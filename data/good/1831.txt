The Westin Seattle is in a terrific location in the heart of downtown. Weather permitting, it's walking distance to lots of sights, including the Space Needle and Pike St Market. The iconic round towers make for great views from the rooms all the way around. Service is warm and welcoming, public spaces are nice, conference space and service are good. The rooms are comfortable, clean and well-appointed. Overall, very comfortable property.

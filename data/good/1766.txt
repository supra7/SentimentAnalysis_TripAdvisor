2 adults in early 50's for 3 night stay on priceline bid July 29-August 1, 2008. The location was excellent as we walked to pike market, space needle and pioneer area of town, never needed transportation. We did do a sightseeing tour of Seattle as well. We received a room on the 1st floor and were upgraded to King Bed no charge, we were offered to upgrade to waterfront for 50.00 per night but declined. The hall way was dark and there was a musty smell but once we opened the door to our room we were very happy. Although on the first floor we could not leave our curtains open as people are always walking by we only needed the room for sleep as we are out all day long and evening. There are train tracks nearby so beware you will hear the train blow and it is loud, I heard it at 3:10am one night and then the next nights I did not hear it, I am a very light sleeper and my husband did not hear it at all but he sleeps like a log. The waterviews from the lobby and lounge are so nice we sat and had happy hour one day and used the lobby lounge to look out at the water so no need for the extra cost of a waterview room. The weather was also on the cool side so would not have sat outside anyway. I loved the washroom in the room it was awesome, every time I entered it I told my husband how much I loved it. The bed was comfortable and had a nice TV. We did not unpack and there was very limited drawer space. We also had robes in the room which was nice. Overall for the price we paid I was pleased. I do not think this hotel is good for families as it is unique for its decor.

This was the first time we stated at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel, based on the recommendation of a family friend. We chose the least expensive room and it wasn't bad for the price. Other reviews on TripAdvisor have mentioned that the hotel was run down or showing it's age, not in our case. Our room was very standard, clean and neat. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful (and our value priced room even had a slight view of the ocean). The pool area was nice as well. The pool was perfect for familes with children of various ages. We did find that the restuarants at the hotel were over priced (as are most in Ka'anapali) by a wide margin. Paying over $45 for breakfast is not reasonable anywhere (especially when it's a buffet). We chose not to pay to have our breakfast included in our room rate and couldn't have been happier (there are several places to find breakfast deals or even the local grocery to buy a box of Cheerios). The housekeeping staff was generally efficient and did a throuough job. The only complaint (other than the price of the restuarants) is that the walls seemed a bit thin as goings ons of neighboring rooms could be heard at all hours. When we go back to Maui, if we stay in Ka'anapali, we will definitely consider staying at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel again.

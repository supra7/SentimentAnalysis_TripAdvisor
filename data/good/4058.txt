The resort itself is beautiful. There isn't much of a beach but just walk 50 yards and there it is, awesome. The staff and pool area make up for the lack of beach. Just don't get sick... They have a doctors office on site and I have had to visit twice on 2 separate vacations. The doctors are great but the receptionist is as rude as they come. I would have expected her not to be there the second time with the level of service the Hyatt provides as a standard but I guess a doctors receptionist is not held up to the same standards as a bell man or bartender. Should be especially when you need comforting the most at a doctors office. By the way ended up costing me $500 since the receptionist gave me the wrong information. I should have gone to the hospital. Go see the Japanga bartenders their steer you right! The slide is great!

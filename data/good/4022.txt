This hostel is next to the S-Bahn station, not a block away 5 minutes away, next to! It seemed brand new when I stayed there in 2008 and what impressed me was the cleanliness and the precise construction of the building. The hostel's design suits it's purpose well and the lobby /lounge area draws you in. Did I mention the place was spotless? Breakfast was the best I had in any hostel in Europe (London,Paris,Florence,Rome,Barcelona) and the nearby supermarket was sooo convenient.

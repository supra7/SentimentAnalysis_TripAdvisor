Have stayed at three different rooms here during 2 stays over the last year. Happy enough the first time to return for a second. The value is great if you can score a room with the view out to Elliot Bay. Just beautiful. You dont need any more than the minimal ACe white decor with a view like this. Also enjoyed room with large glass shower also (no view). On the last occasion, $160 is a bit much for a small room with no view or special shower features. On both visits, found staff very friendly and helpful. The location is central. Late nite pizza/beer joint across the street is key after a long night. Breakfast included adds to the pleasure.

This is small hotel (sister hotel of Hotel Sonya nearby) but the rooms were clean and the air conditioning was excellent. Via Firenze is not a busy street, so the hotel is quiet at night - besides the double-glazed windows would keep it quiet even if on a busy street. The location, near the train station, makes it ideal for trains and buses. The hotel has free internet and you can request a laptop (netbook) for the room too which I thought was a nice touch. Easy to walk to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, etc. We walked everywhere in Rome. Hotel has a small elevator. Rooms have flat screen TV and SKY. Staff were very friendly and helpful and I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and I would stay there again.

I stayed one night at the Westin Seattle for business. The hotel lobby is pretty large and well kept. My room in the North tower was clean and modern. The bed was comfortable and the room had a nice flat screen tv. The fitness center within the hotel is free of charge. Only your room key is needed for access. For a hotel, the fitness center is quite nice with cardio equipment and a variety of actual free weights. Most hotels do not have as good equipment in their fitness centers. You have to pay for wireless internet from your room, which may be an issue for people considering the price paid for the room alone. I didn't have to park a vehicle, but if I had to it would have cost a pretty penny as one of the nearby parking garages would've been utilized. The location of the hotel is good. It is a block or two from Westlake Center which is a mall in downtown Seattle. The Space Needle and Pike Place are short cab rides. Overall the hotel is pretty nice and I had no complaints with my room. Paying for Internet and parking are considerations for others wishing to stay here.

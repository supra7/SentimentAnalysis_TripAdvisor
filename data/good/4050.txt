This was my first time staying on the west side of the island. While I found that I like the south side of the island better, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Hotel self-parking is complimentary, which is appreciated. As others have noted, the parking spaces are way too tight and I sweated out whether my rental car was going to get damaged every time that I parked. As I booked through Priceline, I received a room with a weird full size and perhaps twin sized bed in it on the ground floor facing the parking lot. While far from the nicest room that I've stayed in, it was good enough. The bed was comfortable, although as others noted, there are no fitted sheets, so the sheet underneath you easily comes off. The amenities in the bathroom are nice. There is a $25.00 resort fee, which is annoying and steep, although it does grant you speedy internet access. The pools are amazing, and there is a small and usually crowded hot tub, too. There are numerous restaurants on-site, as well. There is a beach on the hotel that was rarely crowded, perhaps due to the rocky nature of the beach just off shore underwater, but it was relaxing nonetheless. The staff was exceedingly friendly throughout my stay, as is everybody on Maui. I'd consider this hotel on a return trip.

Stayed here on a quick trip into the city December 2011. The price was amazing, for what you get. The rooms are comfortable, modern, with that "design" feel. The rooms are very clean, and the bath amenities nice. The hotel opened in 2007, so things still work. And the location is great, close to Soho, and with the F train subway at the door. Plus, the free continental breakfast is nice (but the yogurt was expired... likely just an oversight). My only complaint was the free WiFi. It didn't work, and despite asking 4 different employees about it, and them resetting it, it never worked! I was left having to steal WiFi from an unsecured network in the area, which was spotty at best.

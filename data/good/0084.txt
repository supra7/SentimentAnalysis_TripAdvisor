We went through priceline and got a great deal for a quick overnight. It was $99 for the night. This boutique hotel is elegant and fun. The room and hotel decor is unique and the staff were very helpful. When we checked in we immediately went up to our room. It was nice but our window looked out at another window of a building that was very close. We went back down to the front desk and asked if there was another room that had a window with a better view. We were immediately given a room with a side view which had much better lighting. We went to happy hour at the restaurant of the hotel and the prices and food were very good. I think we spend less than $20 for 2 drinks and 3 appetizers, and there was lots of food left over. The rooms were nicely appointed although on the small side, but that is to be expected with this type of hotel. We loved waking up in the morning just a few blocks from the Seattle waterfront and going for a run along the waterfront. The one downside (which we didn't know when making reservations) was that parking was $45 per night!! We ended up parking in the Seattle Public Library overnight for about $20. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.

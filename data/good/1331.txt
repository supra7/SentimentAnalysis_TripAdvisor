The Sheraton is a big, bustling hotel immediately across from the convention center. The rooms are nice, but vary a lot by the price you paid. Based upon fellow travelers, opaque site guests will get the rooms next to vending machines, elevators etc. I liked the hotel, but fellow travelers (girls) complained about the beds not being comfortable. Internet charges are high, and overnight parking is $40. The hotel is 3 blocks from the light rail station (to the airport) which is $2.50 and 30 minutes. Taxi fare to the airport is $35 and 30 minutes as well. Busses in the downtown are free, but this is a good walking city (bring an umbrella). About 5 blocks to Pikes Market. Nothing special about the hotel (except convince to the convention center), but you will like it

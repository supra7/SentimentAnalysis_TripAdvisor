Hotel Max was in the ideal location to Pike's Place Market and various restaurants in downtown Seattle. The friendly staff guided us to fantastic restaurants, in the area, and must-see things to do. Yes, the rooms are small. But, we didn't fly to Seattle to see the rooms. And, don't miss out on the breakfast and Red Fin!

I would rate Hotel Max with five stars but we just did not sleep very well. Noises from the street woke us every hour. We had a corner room and the views of the city were wonderful, but that is price we paid---two streets, twice the noise. OTHERWISE, we loved the hotel. Will stay again because we know the hotel cannot control the street noise. The staff was outstanding and the restaurant food was great, and room-service breakfast was amazing. Like I say, we will return but shall bring earplugs next time. Cheers!

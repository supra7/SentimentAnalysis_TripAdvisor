My daughter and her two year old daughter stayed at The Seattle Pacific Hotel for just over two weeks when my daughter and her husband were separating. It was a very emotional time for her. The staff at the hotel did everything possible to make her and her daughter comfortable. They actually seemed to care about her emotional well being. Having worked in hospitality my entire life, I find it rare that a staff would be so attentive to a young woman and her toddler. If you in the Seattle area and need a welcoming environment, stay at the Seattle Pacific Hotel.

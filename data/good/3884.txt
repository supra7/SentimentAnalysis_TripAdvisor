We stayed here for one night and the hotel is beautiful. The lobby is great and the rooms are very nice. The bed, as with all Hilton hotels, was divine! The location is outside of the Gaslamp and does require a decent walk across a bridge or a quick cab ride. Don't be fooled into thinking that this is in the Gaslamp. Also, we had breakfast in the restaurant downstairs and the service was very slow. The food was decent and the views were great. But, service was very very slow. I would recommend this hotel, however.

We were here in August following an Alaska cruise. We chose to stay here and make reservations at Tulio's, a favorite family restaurant for years, to meet family for brunch the next day. The room sizes themselves were so spacious and with three children in one room, after being in a small stateroom on board ship for a week, they loved it and were sprawled all over the place. It was also great not having the small bottles of bathroom products but to have dispensers in the shower with gel, shampoo, and conditioner. We arrived early (since the cruise ships get in early). We couldn't get into the rooms right away, but they stored our luggage for us so that we could go out exploring. The staff gave us directions when we needed them and directed me to a car rental facility nearby, which I needed at the last minute. Brunch the following morning was terrific. The upstairs balcony area of Tulio's was prepared for our large group. The staff was helpful and accommodating and the meal was terrific. We will return when we need to stay in Seattle.

Upsides: Our room was comfortable, well updated and clean. We had a nice view of the iconic central library building across the street. The staff are friendly. The breakfast is worthwile - a light affair in the in the cozy 'Seattle's Best' down in the lobby. For all this I thought the price was reasonable. Quirky classic building. Downsides: Those walls are really thin. Fortunately for us, our neighbours didn't watch much TV! Strange minor note: For some reason, the little personal bottle of shampoo in our room was empty!? They sent more up eventually.

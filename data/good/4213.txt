The property was absolutely beautiful and I was very happy to lounge many afternoons listening to the surf pound the shore from the wonderful poolside chairs. :) We were perfectly fine with the beach situation (little beach that is usable) because the pools were great and if you wanted to have beach use a short walk down the beach walk would provide that. The location is at the very end of the beachwalk so you have a little more privacy of your property than the more central properties. The walk to Whaler's Village was a nice and beautiful walk - and if you were tired at the end of dinner/shopping they have a shuttle service to deliver you back to the resort free of charge. We did not eat at the resort so cannot comment on the food; but they looked very appealing with good atmosphere and views. My husband surprised me one afternoon with a massage at ocean side !! WONDERFUL -- ask for Johanna as she did a wonderful job. Room size was fine - it accomodated 3 of us very well. There is a walk-in closet with drawers for your clothing. All staff were very courteous and helpful! I would definitely stay here again when on Maui! LOVED every minute of our stay.

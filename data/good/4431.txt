Stayed here for a friends wedding and was happily pleased. Their wedding was right out on the lawn with the view of the beach in the background. One of our most memorable trips with our friends. About the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel... Location: Great location... 5 minute drive from the main area of Lahaina, 5 minute walk to Black Rock and decent snorkling... and most obviously thumbs up for beachfront property. Property: You can tell that Ka'anapali is a privately owned hotel. They keep the property maintained, not too many frills, but it's Hawaii.... not many frills are needed! Only downfall is that I stayed in one of the older buildings on the 4rd floor without an elevator. I'm 30 and so is my husband, so it wasn't too big a deal for us to lug our suitcases up... but definitely would use the belldesk if needed. It can be a bit of a walk and climb to your room. Parking: $9/day... what a deal. Property all over Hawaii doesn't come by cheap, so when I heard parking was under $10 a day... I knew I was going to rent a car. Rates: You can't beat the rates at this place. For the location, quality and price, I was very pleased. Yes you can stay at resorts that cost more, but you're in Hawaii, I basically used my room as a place to store my belongings and sleep. Aside from that I was always out and about. Tip for guests: If youre celebrating a honeymoon, anniversary... mention it at the front desk and you might get a free bottle of champagne. My anniversary fell on our trip and so it was a nice treat.

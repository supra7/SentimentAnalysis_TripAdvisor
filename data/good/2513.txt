I stayed here for an art festival who got the artists a great rate, so I was not sure what I was in for. It's a wonderful, artsy hotel beside a DELICIOUS sushi restaurant, COMFY beds, and a staff to die for. Easy walking distance to Pikes Market, the Needle, Aquarium, Art Museum and many other attractions. I will DEFINITELY stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle.

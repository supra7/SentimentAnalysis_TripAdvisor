Stayed for 3 days in March. Great location...clean...reasonable rates...very friendly staff. Easy walk to to many attractions...Ralph's Market across the street is excellent. Some negatives though. Noisy heater fan in room...seems like a lot of rooms have this problem. PPV movie channel had terrible picture. Lots of interference on screen. Staff alerted but couldn't fix it. Pool is small but OK. 3 out of 4 aerobic machines in fitness centre broken! A Space Needle view will have you facing Lenora St. This is a very busy bus route so be prepared for lots of street noise. In my experience, any downtown hotel has lots of street noise so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.

The room was small - it is an old hotel. Fine for 2. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. I had excellent customer service from Jennifer who changed a reservation to a lower (on line) rate that I requested; she also arranged a limo pick up for me; all of this was done via email. The front desk (Andrea) was efficient and every employee encountered was friendly. I loved the wine reception. A great way to meet others staying in the hotel! Excellent parking garage right next door.

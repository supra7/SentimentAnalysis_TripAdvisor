My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in May 2010 having booked directly on the hotel's website. We booked way in advance and did not get a 'deal' so our value for money rating reflects that. As other reviewers have commented the location cannot be bettered. Although we encountered the elevator problem the staff coped with it very well on the whole. (I can't believe they are still fixing the elevators in July - hope its a fixed price contract!). Our room was on the 12th floor and on a corner and it was spacious (perhaps reflecting the room rate) and quiet. The lack of a restauarant was a minor inconvenience and we breakfasted at the Daily Grill just up the road. One of the great pluses is that it is within walking distance of the Light Railway which is by far the best way to travel to and from Seatac Airport. We had a nice dinner at Etta's near Pike Place Market and also took the Boeing Factory tour which was great. Sadly, Seattle seems to have more than its share of the homeless (perhaps in part attracted by the market?) and although we felt safe, prospective vistors should expect to be approached fairly regularly in the downtown area. The Roosevelt is an excellent base for exploring the city and we would not hesitate to return - perhaps when the elevators are fixed.

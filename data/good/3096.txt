The Radisson Gateway is probably the closest hotel to Sea-Tac airport. The location, along with a great rate we found on the Radisson website, is the reason we chose this hotel. Check in was quick and easy and they have free parking. The room was very clean and comfortable, with a sleep number bed, large desk and comfy easy chair. It was very quiet- I recommend asking for a room at the back of the hotel away from the front parking lot and busy street. The bathroom was also very clean and had a cool new shower head! Although this area is not very close to downtown Seattle, there are several restaurants nearby, and it is a short drive to the Southcenter mega mall. To go into downtown Seattle, we walked across the street to the airport and followed the signs to the link light rail train. We enjoyed the hot tub, and the general pool area was clean. My only complaint about this hotel was the food- the breakfast buffet wasn't anything special and the a la carte items were way overpriced. We decided not to eat there so I can't say about the quality of the food. Check out was simple and we took the free airport shuttle on the morning of our flight. This is a great hotel if you want to stay close to the airport and don't mind walking or driving a bit to get to other parts of the city.

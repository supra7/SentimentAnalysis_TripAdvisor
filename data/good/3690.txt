great location-just around the corner from the Trevi fountain and 5 mins walk from Via Condoti and Piazza Novonna a lot of these hotels in city centres are rabbit huches but not Trvi-we were on the 5th floor with balcony overlooking the busy streets below and the room was a good size-not a suite but enough room for us. good bathroom facilities and very clean. Breakfast was usual continental buffet affair and adequate only minus point was the TV was supposed to have some english channels but didnt (but then who needs TV in the eternal city anyway?!)

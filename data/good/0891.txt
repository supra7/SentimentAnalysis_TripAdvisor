We live an hour away from Seattle, and stayed here on a Saturday night to meet friends in town for the weekend. Great location, great price and the room was fine. While I would not choose this hotel if I planned to spend a lot of time in the room (the bathroom is particularly tiny...), it was the perfect choice for an overnight visit that included a visit to the nearby Seattle Art Museum, dinner near Pioneer Square and shopping. Friendly staff and Seattle's Best Coffee connected to the lobbymade it extra nice. Will stay here again!

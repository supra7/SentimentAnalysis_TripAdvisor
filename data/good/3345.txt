My wife and I have been to seven all inclusive resorts. Secrets Maroma Beach ranks fourth. First, the positives. The food at this place was excellent. Room service was fantastic and very efficient. The beach was the absolute best we've visited. They even serve drinks and food on the beach. The grounds were immaculate, lots of plants and trees. Our concierge , Javier, was wonderful. He's the reason why they received 4 stars and not 3. The negatives: Resturant wait tims were terrible. We usually travel with two other couples, so there was a total of six of us. One night the Japanese resturant had an hour wait, another night the seafood resturant had a 2 hour wait. This is completely unacceptable. We have never had this problem at the previous resorts we've visited. The housekeeping was unacceptable and unpredictable. The VIP services were an attempt to sell you a time share. This is completely unacceptable at a five star resort. Finally, the mosquitoes were horrendous. Most people there were bitten multiple times. We were bitten at least 15-20 times each. This reason alone I won't ever return to Secret Maroma Beach!!!! The mosquitoes are everywhere including in your rooms.

Our third stay here and we are always thrilled we came. This trip was but 2 nights at the Hyatt as part of a 10 day Hawaiian vacation (the others were spent at 4 Seasons Maui and The Koa Kea in Kauai reviewed separately. ) We were celebrating our 30th anniversary and spent time at the Hyatt on our honeymoon in August '81. We were upgraded and flourished with gifts to celebrate the occasion I contend the service here is as close to perfect as possible particularly considering the size of the hotel. As an example, after checking in we were wandering towards the beach/pool area tired and probably looking lost we were approached by Kekoa Mowat who (unsolicited) asked if he could help direct us, after pointing us towards our destination near the beach he offered to get us towels (which were in the opposite direction) and a few moments later he appeared with said towels in hand and a smile. He refused a gratuity. Later that evening we received a card from him congratulating us on our 30th Anniversary. These touches have always been a hallmark of our experience at the Hyatt. Kudos also to Victoria at check-in and Jimmy at the pool/cabana deck. We love the buffet breakfast, the overall vibe, the views, the staff, the shops (thanks Nadine in South Seas), the atrium lobby, the beds, the pool, the gym and the general location. This would be a 5 star if the beach was wider and a little less rocky. Overall this property always brings me good feelings.

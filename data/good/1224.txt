My grandparents took my cousin and I on a cruise that left from Seattle, so we stayed in the Sheraton one night. I typically really like the Sheraton, and this stay was no exception. I loved that we could walk so many places from the hotel! Since it's right on Pike's, you just walk down a few blocks to get to Pike's Market, which was great. And there's a bus/subway station right around the corner (we took a bus to U of W). The next morning, when we weren't sure where our ship was docked, the staff was very helpful with getting us to the right place. It was also a surprise to find a pool/spa and gym on the top floor! Overall, great stay. Would definitely recommend it.

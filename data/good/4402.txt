Our third time to this property...they always make return guests feel welcomed and appreciated...we received a wonderful fruit plate on our first full day back. They also gave us a gift on our 4th day last year so not sure if we will see something this year as well. We can only comment on the BEACH Front rooms as that is where we have stayed each time. I'm a "hotel snob" so I am picky in regards to cleanliness and condition of room...each year our room has been clean and comfortable. Our vacation trip included hotel, car rental (high pressure sales at Budget rental counter at the airport so be ready for that and have a plan), two breakfast buffet coupons per day (food is pretty good and the seating in the courtyard is relaxing and pretty. The Ka'anapali Beach is the perfect place to relax, enjoy the beach (uncrowded and very expansive), snorkel (Black Rock has tons of fish AND turtles most mornings), good food (and not so good). The cleaning staff at KBH are wonderful (please be sure to tip them daily...cleaning up your mess is not easy)...some of the lobby staff is les welcoming but still FAR BETTER than many other options. FOR AFFORDABLE FUN, stay at KBH...aloha!

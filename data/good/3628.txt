I stayed here with my Mum on our first trip to New York. It was easy to find when we arrived on the subway from the airport. It had a good location as some important points of interest were in walking distance (Broadway, Wall Street, Ground Zero and Battery Park) and for those that weren't, the hotel was close to subway stations. There is also a whole foods supermarket very close to the hotel which was very useful for day to day provisions. Hotel East Houston was clean and the staff members were friendly and helpful. The breakfast (a help yourself buffet) had variety and everything was fresh and tasty. The building was tastefully decorated in a modern style and the roof terrace had fantastic views to the North of sky scrapers. Our room was small and clean, and the double glazing shut out any city noise which would have otherwise kept us awake. The only draw back was that the bathroom was divided from the room not by a wall, but by a frosted glass partition. It was a bit weird to see the outline of my Mum on the loo! But it was OK as Mum and I are comfortable with each other, it may be a problem if your with a friend rather than a partner or family member.

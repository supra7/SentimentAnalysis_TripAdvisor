My friends and I went to Seattle for the weekend and booked a cheap room through a website that ended up being at the Sixth Avenue Inn. The location of the hotel is great, we were originally going to stay somewhere near the space needle but were glad that we choose this location instead. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food and service at the bar/restaurant was great and the meals are value for money plus they do room service. The room itself was clean and comfortable. It's not the newest or most upmarket hotel in town but it was a great base and place to sleep. I would recommend it to other travellers looking for good, cheap accommodation in Seattle.

The hotel is near the centre of the city, the rooms have recently been remodelled and look very modern and above all very clean! The breakfast is well served, the staff is friendly and the hotel suits the purposes of a cultural get-away to the eternal city. It is near the main underground lines and there are bus-stops, restaurants, cafs and shops within a 200m walking distance. We used the underground much less than we expected.

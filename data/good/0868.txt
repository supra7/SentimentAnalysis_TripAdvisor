We couldnt fault the location and the price , we paid $89 plus taxes total $109. We were in room 218 which faced the library and the road. A little bit of road noise but not a major issue. Rooms were clean , however the bathroom was very small but functional. We found the beds comfortable , the coffee machine filled with Seattles best coffee was fantastic. There is a Mexican place across the road and we had cheap breakfast for under $10 FOR 2 including coffee We walked 1 block along 4th ave to the University to catch the light train out to Seatac airport , at $2.75 and it only taking 35 minutes it was a real bargain.

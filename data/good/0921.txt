This hotel offered a fine bargain in the heart of Seattle. I had a King corner room which was quite nice. The hotel is older for sure, but the staff was friendly, everything was clean, and it is right in the best part of town. There is a Seattle's Best almost in the hotel lobby which was convenient for a quick breakfast which was great, and you get all this at a much lower price than the typical hotel in this area. My only complaint was that the wireless internet access was slow and unreliable, perhaps because I was on the 6'th floor?

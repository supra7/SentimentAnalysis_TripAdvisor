I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Great location, just a few blocks from Pike's Market. If you take the light rail from Seatac for $2.50, in 40 minutes you will arrive at the University Street Station which is only 2 blocks from the hotel. Our room was small but we only slept there, Seattle is too nice of a city to spend time in a hotel room. For $76 (with fees and tax about $89) we had a clean, nicely decorated room, comfortable bed and very accommodating staff at the front desk.

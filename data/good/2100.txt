We stayed at two different hotels this trip, the Edgewater and the Westin. The Westin was about half the price of the Edgewater. When comparing the two I would definitely choose the Westin over the Edgewater. The Westin had a good location within walking distance to Pikes market and other shopping malls and eateries. The rooms were very large (especially compared to the Edgewater) which was nice since we had our 1 year-old with us exploring everything in the space. It was clean and comfortable and had a good view. The only drawback was the noise. It seems poorly insulated for noise. You hear everything out on the streets (ambulances) and in the hallways. Luckily the way the hotel is set up there are not many rooms on each floor. But it is circular around the elevators so everyone probably hears the elevators noises. We could hear our neighbors like they were in the room with us. To help we put a blanket below the door to the hallway and the door to our neighbors. This helped tremendously. We would stay here again despite the noise (we are heavy sleepers). The staff was also very friendly to us.

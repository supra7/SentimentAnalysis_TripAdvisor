I stay at a lot of hotels, but not usually in this price range. It's a little on the high end, but wow! (Not perfect, but very impressive.) Really nice beds and bedding, housekeeping staff were actually friendly and did a nice job; customer service was very good, room was large, nice toiletries, balcony, & airport shuttle. Place is huge and has just about everything you need if you need to stay put by the airport. Would have been nice to have small refrigerator; room service prices and parking fees were steep, and the nearby planes could be a little loud at times. A/C-Heating controls in my room and throughout the hotel (was there for a conference) should be adjusted a little better, but nothing major. Cutest little coffee set up and radio/alarm system. Overall, really enjoyed my stay and look forward to a future stay!

We stayed for three nights. On the plus side, this hotel is in a great central location in downtown Seattle; the new main library is right across the street and plenty of stores and services are within walking distance, so you do not need to rent a car. It's an old building with character, something that's hard to find these days. The price that we got was very reasonable too. The staff was very friendly and helpful and attentive to our needs; a special thanks to the very friendly doorman, Stanley. On the negative side, our room was rather small and so could not include a desk and chair. The window needed to be washed and some of the furniture is approaching the time when it needs to be replaced. The tub drain was extremely slow. Like a lot of hotels, the walls were too thin, but our neighbors quieted down, so we did not have to complain about it. The biggest negative for us was the fact that the elevator lobby is not level with the street, so if you have mobility problems or require a wheelchair, this is not the hotel for the disabled. But, we managed fine in spite of it. It is quite a hike up to the hotel from the waterfront--not for the out-of-shape!

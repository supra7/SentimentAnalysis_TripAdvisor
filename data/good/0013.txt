Just returned from a visit to Baltimore and an overnight stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in White Marsh, which is on the outskirts of Baltimore. Location is very convenient, 2 minutes off I-95, hotel is visible from the highway. A large mall is nearby and the hotel is in a quiet location near a corporate park. It is only about 20-25 minutes from the Inner Harbor and downtown Baltimore. Rates are much more reasonable than the hotels there, if you can manage not having to be in that immediate area. Room and bathroom was spotless, with a comfortable bed, and a coffee maker and microwave in room. A small pool and fitness center are available as well, with freshly cooked buffet breakfasts in the restaurant. The only minor complaint was that the air conditioner was a bit noisy, but all in all, an enjoyable visit and would recommend it for a return trip.

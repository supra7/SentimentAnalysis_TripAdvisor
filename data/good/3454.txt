I travelled with my husband, son and daughter-in-law and sister, check in was smoothe, we were given 3 rooms together in bldg 24 swim up suites.The rooms are beautiful, and the swim up pool had almost total privacy in this bld., the only complaint we had was the air conditioning didn't seem to go below 78 degrees, but we just spoke to concierge, Yannik who is amazing, and he arranged 3 fans for our rooms immediately. Yannik also made our special events memorable, 2 anniversaries and 1 birthday. The food was great, we enjoyed the breakfast bufftet, and Oceana or The Barefoot Grill for lunch. For dinner we did the French, Italian, Himatsu Hibachi table, Seaside for steaks and the Mexican Fiesta buffet. We had room service often especially on 2 days we spent in our swim up pool, they deliverd food, drinks and buckets of beer. The beach is perfect and water clear, and there were schools of some kind of white angel fish that would come in swarms if you fed them. The shows were good, Grease, Rockshow and Fireshow, and the theater is very comfortable, they even had a huge blow up TV screen to watch the Stanley Cup playoffs. Even with the airconditioning issues, we had a near perfect vacation and would definitely recommend this resort.

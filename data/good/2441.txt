Was in town last weekend for my brother's wedding and stayed here. Arrived in the midst of a parade after one of the worst flying experiences of my life..and was thrilled to have check-in take all of 3 minutes before I was placed into an elevator and whisked up to the 22nd Fl. Room was impeccable; I loved the bathroom. View was fabulous. My 3 main nit-picky criteria with hotels that seperate the good from the great are 1.) full length mirror, 2.) lighting and 3.) pillows/bedding. This passed all 3 with flying colors. Above and beyond; the staff were amazing; not one bad apple in the bunch. Every staffer I encountered was competent, professional and very accomodating. A rarity when travelling today, there's usually at least 1 moron. The location was great too. I was a little pressed for time because of flight delays, but I was able to hit many of the tourist attractions Sunday morning. The Fish Market, the Space Needle monorail, and some great downtown shopping are all within blocks of the hotel. If ever in Seattle again, I would not hesitate to stay there again. I would also recommend this to those who are traveling there.

I found this hotel the way I find almost all my short-notice domestic hotels: through Hotwire. As usual, I was pretty happy. It was late at night and I needed two things ~ an airport shuttle and a reasonably nice, clean, comfortable, safe place to get a good night's rest. This hotel affords all that. It's a sprawling property, though, so you'll joke with your friends later that the walk from the front desk to your room takes longer than the ride to/from the airport. I had made that remark myself and then overheard someone else quip the same thing. I'd certainly stay here again.

The Hotel was in a great location for walking to many attractions in downtown Seattle. We arrived on the train and didn't rent a car but we were able to walk to the hotel within 10 minutes and walked everywhere from the football stadium to the Space Needle comfortably and with no problems. The rooms were basic but clean, the staff was nice and, even though there were in the middle of remodeling and construction, everything operated pretty efficiently.

We just returned from a nine day stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. This was our first trip to the Hawaiian islands and we chose the KBH because of its reputation as being the most Hawaiian resort and its great value. When we first arrived, the hotel seemed small and unimpressive compared to the newer condos that surround it. I soon realized the KBH had something the other places don't: very large, beautifully landscaped grounds and a large easily accessible beach. In addition to the beautiful property, the staff was always friendly and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and the view of the ocean from our balcony was gorgeous. We'd go back!

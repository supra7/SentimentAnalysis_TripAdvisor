stayed at Hotel Opera Roma for 3 nights and realy love it ,within 10-13 minutes from termini station and subway stops ,if you walk from termini station to the hotel the easiest way is to walk to Piazza Repubblica & walk down on Via Nazionale than make left on via Firenze (follow the Hotel Centro sign the building is next to the hotel) . on my arrivel I was given a room on the 5th floor which had a strong cigarette odor after complainnig that I can't stay there I switched to a room on the 1st floor (No 102) which had a bigger bathroom and save me useing the realy small and nerrow elevetor. the rooms are not that big but very clean and have all modern facilities from flat screen tv ,safe ,air condition unit ,mini bar ,hair dryer (with 120v-220v outlet) Free WIFI I even got a complementary asus eee laptop for my entire stay which was a big plus for me . the breakfast is very basic but good to start the mornning. the street of the hotel is very quiet and felt safe all the time however in some rooms you can hear any noise, the stuff is very freindly & speak english and given me a city map and marks all main attractions for me. this is not the chipest hotel if you are on a budget but it's worth every cent ,I will definitely see myself staying there again .

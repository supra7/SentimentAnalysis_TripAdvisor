I stayed at Hilton in march 2010 for a week with my husband a my 2 year old child. I was in a conference-vacation trip so the hotel location was just perfect for me. I uppgradated my room and we got a really nice view. Pros: relly nice for my daughter, next to a park for a wal, warm pool, and so close to the conderence center. Negative: They charge you for everything extra. Internet, parking. There are nice restautants quite close to the hotel but if you have enough money then you should try the restaurant, nice service and good food. I must say that I did not pay for the hotell, It was payd by my jobb. But I think I would pay by miself If I had to come back again.

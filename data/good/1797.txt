I stayed at this hotel for three nights last weekend. The staff, outstanding and extremely accomodating. The rooms, comfortable and full of style. The feeling and energy, amazing. Somehow despite having all the modcons you could want to keep you happy, the hotel has retained its original look and feel inside (think early 1900's glamour), and maintained it from the rooms to the public areas.... and the resulting energy is excellent and a far cry from modern, cookie cutter hotels. My only hesitation and the reason why I did not give this a 5 is because they need another elevator when things get busy. (I wanted to give a 4.5 but didn't have that option). Highly recommended for business or pleasure, I will be back.

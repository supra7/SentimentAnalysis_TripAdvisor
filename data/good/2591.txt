This was our first time staying at Hotel Max and we enjoyed our stay. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful with pointing out places to eat and things to do nearby. The hotel itself was really funky in a good way we loved the artwork all around and the decor. The Bed was extremely comfortable for me but my 6'3" boyfriend was a bit tall for the bed. The itty bitty stand up shower was also a tight squeeze for him but we managed. The towels were amazing. It was very quiet, we never heard any of the other guests but i know they were there as we say them in the hallways and elevator. We were on the 2nd to top floor so the traffic noise was fairly nonexistant for being downtown. This hotel is an excellent value for downtown if you can deal with close quarters.

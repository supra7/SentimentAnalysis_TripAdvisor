We really enjoyed our week stay at the Hyatt. The room was pretty nice (although not the nicest for the class of hotel), and we have a view of the luau in our oceanfront room. The poolside restaurant (Umlau) was really good, but expensive. Hard to find pool chairs after 9 am, so we ended up paying $50 for a cabana on the days we planned to hang out by the pool/ocean. It would have been nice not to have to do that, but oh well. The ocean was really rough the whole time, so we weren't able to swim/snorkel in it. It seemed like it wasn't so rough further up the beach in the Westin area. It was nice to walk to Whaler's Village, and it's a short cab ride to Lahaina, which was great. We would stay here again.

I avoid these large, tip for everything,hotels in big cities but I was there for a conference and the hotel was very nice. It was convenient to metro rail, lots of great restaurants and shopping around. Easy to get around and short walk to Pike's Market. The Westin White Tea fragrance in the bathroom products was a nice plus. It was fine, expensive but typical for a large city, conference center. Nice experience!!

The staff here were very accomodating & helpful. Rooms are very comfortable - we stayed in a suite with seperate bedroom with daughter & boyfriend and when told that the sofa bed in the lounge was most uncomfortable the management immediately put us up in a seperate room at no extra cost. Enjoyed our short stay here & hope to go back again.

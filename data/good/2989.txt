The staff at the front desk were top notch. Everthing was nice and clean. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom in the non smoking room did smell of smoke. We turned on the fan and kept the door closed. There was a refrigerator and microwave. We caught the free shuttle at 5 am and it was too early for breakfast, so they gave us a lunch to go with a yorgurt and danish. There was fresh coffee in the lobby and a free USA Today. It took 7 minutes to get to our gate at the airport. There is a casino and 2 restaurants across the street. This was a great value and I will stay here anytime I have an early flight.

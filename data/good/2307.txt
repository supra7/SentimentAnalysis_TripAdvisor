We had a pleasant experience at the Hotel Monaco in S.F. so we decided to stick with the Kimpton hotels when we vacationed in Seattle. Hotel Monaco Seattle had no rooms available so we stayed at the sister hotel, Hotel Vintage Park. Pros - 1. The room was a good size, well furnished and comfortable. It was also appointed with all the necessary toiletries ... nice stuff by the way! 2. Staff was very friendly. The concierge spent a lot of time with us to plan a day trip to some wineries. 3. Wine hour from 5 to 6 where we got to try regional wines. 4. Excellent location across from the library and within walking distance from the waterfront (10 minutes) and Pikes Market (15-20 minutes). There are a lot of excellent restaurants in the area. Try the Ipanema restaurant for wonderful Brazilian food and drinks. Cons - 1. The pillows were too firm. We asked for some softer down pillows but they were unable to accommodate us. 2. The view was of some construction going on next door. Not the hotel's fault but the room didn't muffle the sound very well. A lot of street noise could be heard. 3. The concierge was very friendly but she didn't really instill confidence. 4. I'll list the $30 valet parking here but to be fair it isn't much cheaper in the parking garage. This is probably the norm for the area. Besides, the cabs are plentiful and reasonable especially since a lot of attractions are nearby so just skip the car! I didn't try the restaurant but I heard several people at the hotel say it was very good. Overall an excellent experience. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because it's not perfect but for about the same price as a generic big named quality hotel you get something with more character and charm.

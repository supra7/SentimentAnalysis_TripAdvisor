Located in the Queen Anne area, the University Inn provided us a great base location as we explored the area. Excellent customer service, comfy beds, pleasant and knowledgeable courtesy shuttle drivers and free parking. Standard continental breakfast which worked just fine for us. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate available in the lobby at night. Overall, a very pleasant experience. The hotel is pet friendly and provides baggies for cleaning up after your 4 legged family member. Grassy areas are a couple of walking blocks away.

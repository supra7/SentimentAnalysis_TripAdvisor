This nice and friendly hotel has spacious rooms and is located near the Top Kapi, and a lot of other famous buildings in the city centre on the European side of the Bosparus. The hotel is easy to reach with the tram (also from the airport with one transfer from subway to the tram) with the nearby stop called 'Sirkeci'. The rooms are spacious and clear with fresh sheets. Only the rooms on the street side could be a bit noisy, also because the tram goes strait by. The staff is very helpful. The free WLAN is not on every floor accessible but in the lounge does it a great deal. The views from the rooftop are great! The breakfast is also served out there.. I stayed in Kafkas Hotel on the way to a backpacking trip in the Levant . On the way back I stayed there again.

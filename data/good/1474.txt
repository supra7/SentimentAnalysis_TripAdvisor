The value for your dollar in a city location is great. We booked online at the hotels own website and booked the BVR rate which includes parking and 2 breakfast vouchers which by the way my wife and daughter said was very good and plentiful. Yes its an older property in a city setting. So expect sirens, garbage trucks clanging at o'dark thirty in the morning etc. I've heard all these noises at places where I paid twice as much. And yes there are more improvements that could be made; better windows, better sealing around the door to reduce noise bleeding in the room. That said, the value and the desk staff were great. The room was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for the night. Everything worked great. Fridge, microwave, HVAC, Flat screen TV, WiFi, etc. I can't forget the cookies at check-in. A nice touch and since we checked in so late I helped them reduce the inventory so there would be no waste. If you're on a tight budget or want a great location and don't mind a few minor annoyances I have no problem recommending a stay here. To the management and staff, keep up the good work.

I booked Prime Hotel Principe Torlonia for three nights with Expedia as an arrangement including flights for me and my family to visit Rome during the last weekend of July. We sure appreciated the tranquil atmosphere in the hotel and the overall quietness after a dazzling, overwhelming, hot and interesting day in the historic city. Breakfast was great and more than sufficient. Scrambled and boiled eggs, ham, salame, bacon, sausages. Fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereals, fruit juices, nice cappuccini or what ever you would prefer to start the day off with. The rooms were lovely. Airconditioned. Except for 1 room no. 05 on the ground floor where three of us stayed in; aircon did not function. Too bad. I surely would recommend this hotel to my friends.

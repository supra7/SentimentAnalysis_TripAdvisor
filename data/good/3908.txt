This is a newer hotel property from what I gathered. We stayed on the 17th floor facing the city and the bay. It was gorgeous! I loved the views, amazing! There is a boardwalk style walk way that you can take from the hotel all the way down to the Seaport Village for food and shopping. There is also a bridge that will take you from the hotel to Petco Park which is the baseball field where the Padres play. The hotel is also right next to the San Diego convention center. This hotel has a great location. It is very light in color, lots of white and blue with light colored wood. It has a clean summer feeling to it. There is a salt water pool that looks out on to the bay. There is a loading and an unloading dock for ships on the left side of the hotel & pool. It didn't really bother me too much. There was a yellow dole pineapple ship unloading for the three days we were there. You will get to see lots of navy ships and some commercial ships come in and out of the bay daily. The area felt very safe and clean. The rooms were very nice. There were three restuarants on site as well as a starbucks and a frozen yogurt shop. The prices were not too terrible. If you can pay the little extra for the view of the city and the bay. It is worth it. There is a ship yard view, I heard it was not so great. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and will definately come back. There is a charge of $27 a night for parking, which is in the garage attatched to the hotel. Park on the third floor, there is a small walk way that will bring you to the main entrance of the hotel. I did not like having to pay for parking.

Stayed there for two nights during a business visit near the airport. Check-in was quick and friendly. Rooms nicely furnished, typical chain hotel style but absolutely clean and sufficiently equipped. Breakfast buffet was okay but could have been better for the price. Although there is a regular shuttle service from the airport it took more than 30 minuten for the bus to arrive at the airport. Altogether a conveniently located hotel for a reasonable price.

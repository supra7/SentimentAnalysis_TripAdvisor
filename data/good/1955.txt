The rooms are great. The building is a cylinder, so rooms are like a shaped like a piece of pie, with a desk centred on a huge window overlooking the city, incredible view. The lobby bar has Guinness for $4 a pint and free internet. My room was clean, with great bedding. The gym is an after thought. It's ok, gets the job done, but not an experience. Pool the same. I was at the Empress in Victoria prior to the Westin an it's pool was fantastic. Both hotels are four star. Overall good value .. it's very close to the westlake metro station, and thus free transportation within the city during the day.

My wife and I love the location and the local flavor at KBH. I can't give an honest opinion on whether or not it's the "Most Hawaiian Hotel" since it's the only one on Maui that we've stayed at, but they do make you feel like you are in Hawaii. The rooms are nice, the staff is friendly, the beach is awesome. I love the kukui necklace that they give you upon your initial stay. When you stay with them again, they take your necklace and replace one of the brown kukui nuts with a white one. It's a simple little thing, but my wife and I always make sure that we pack our necklaces when we head to Maui. My only complaint is that when you go to there evening hula show and musical performance, they will not let you bring your own bottles of water. That's a bit ridiculous considering that we spend between $2500-3000 every time to stay at this hotel. My wife usually drinks water but I ALWAYS order a few mixed drinks, so they are getting money from us during the show. This is an outdoor show that many can watch from their balconies, yet if you are sitting in the serving area, they will not let you bring water (EVEN IF YOU PURCHASED THAT WATER AT THE HOTEL). That seems a bit ridiculous and petty. This hotel obviously treats there workers well, because there is very little turnover. We've been going to this hotel over the last 10 years and see many of the same workers that we saw our first time in 2001. When I've told some of the locals where we're staying, they all seem to really have respect for this place. If you are traveling to Maui for the first or even the fifth time, I highly recommend Kaanapali Beach Hotel.

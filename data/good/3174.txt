The hotel is modern, shiny and new, with some attractive features. The reception staff were swift, welcoming, and helpful. Im not sure if we were given a room upgrade, as the suite/ room was huge! There was a separate living room, and bedroom, a large bath, walk in shower, and generally much better than we expected. There were a couple of annoyances during our stay. Firstly although the room was "cleaned" every day, it was very much a low impact clean, with little effort put into tidying the room like in other hotels, it was a simple make the beds, change the towels job. Our other minor issue was with the friendliness and service in the bar. Despite not being particularly busy, the barman wasnt welcoming, and made us feel like he was doing us a favour by serving us. Other than that it was a very good hotel, reasonably close to the centre of town, in a wonderful city.

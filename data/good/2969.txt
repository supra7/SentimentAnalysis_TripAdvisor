I stayed here the night before an early flight from Sea-Tac. It was only 5 minutes from the airport and the shuttle service was prompt and left from the front entrance every 15 minutes. The lobby was decorated in a mountain lodge style with 3 individual desks for check-in. Unlike others I did not have to wait in a line to check-in and the front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful. I had a king bed room that included breakfast (even room service breakfast). I had a room near the elevator and would suggest requesting one if you don't want to "hike" to your room like others. I will definitely stay here again.

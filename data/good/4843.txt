It had been a relaxing stay..hotel room is spacious. Stayed at dubai suite.there are 3 bathrooms. There shld be an iron board n an iron tho in d room.breakfast was tasty but there shld b more choices n varieties like fried rice or noodles. Front reception is prompt to receiving requests frm rooms. However they shld be more smiley especially the lady the conceirge service is good.. The porters are pleasant n courteous.. Location is gd as it is near deira city ctr mall n supermarket.. There are a lot of taxis that run on meter infront of the hotel.. Hotel taxi will charge mire.. Overall my stay is worth my penny.

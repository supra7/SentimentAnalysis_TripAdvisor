I surprised my husband with a trip to see Seattle. The W is beauitful, we were checked in quickly and they had a birthday cake for my guy in the room. I was kinda of upset that I asked for a suite and they messed up my room so we ended up with a delux but no biggie. The concierge was helpful but not the best I have had. Room was nice, looks like any W we stayed at. The bar was fun but quiet, had a good late night scene since the tourist wuldnt venture to far at night. Shopping was a walk but the same stores I have in NYC. We did a lot of walking since the location isn't prime but we were okay with that because what better way to see a city. I liked Seattle and the outskirts but the people were very quiet and there were a lot of homeless kids there. I wouldnt go back but would go to Vancouver next time. Maybe just for a couple of days but move on.

This is a brand new Hilton Property. I understand it was opened early this spring. The hotel is great, the facilities are everything you would expect from an upscale convention hotel. It is located directly accross the street from the San Diego Convention Center. The Gaslight section of San Diego is a long 3 blocks away. This locataion has hundreds of restaurants, bars and shops.

New high-rise on water between working port/railyard and marina/Convention Center, with one small end facing the bayfront. Targets conventioneers on expense accounts and Japanese visitors to their economic colony, who reserve the water rooms very early in advance. Modern Japanese decor pleasingly throughout and everything costs only about 2-300% more in USD than expected. Parking $25/35 day! LIMO/Taxi-oriented, but can walk in about 15-20 minutes to trolley stop and fascinating Gaslamp Quarter. No local transportation provided, contrary to webpage. Restaurant offers "absinthe program," which had thought to be illegal and did not try. Hi-class spa and exercise facility. Usual confusing Hilton chain TV designed to snare $ and make it hard to watch free TV. Watch the bay water from many indoor and outdoor chairs, you can see Coronado Island and the bridge , but if not your thing than spend your USD better elsewhere.

We enjoyed our stay here for 5 nights. The hotel is centrally located, in the downtown retail area, 3 blocks to light rail line and tons of busses, many of which are free, 5 blocks to the Monorail, 7 or 8 blocks to Pike Place or Pioneer Sqare; all very walkable. The hotel is nicely appointed, classy lobby, lounge, ok restaurant. We got our rooms through Priceline, but being kind and curteous at check-in yielded us a room on the 24th floor, although still on the highway side of property. However, on a clear day you could see Mt. Rainier. (We used the fan on the AC to create white noise and had no problems sleeping.) The room was large (esp. for a big city hotel) with 2 queen beds, a desk, lounging chair and ottoman, flat-screen TV and fridge in the TV stand, and closet. The bath had a nice large counter. Our third night there was a major water leak on the floor above ours. We we away when it happened, but the staff moved our luggage and misc. so that nothing was damaged (offered to pay for any that was), gave us a free dinner, and upgraded us to a multi-room suite on the top floor! Wonderful views of the city, sound, and Space Needle. We were happy with our first room, but the second was a real treat. All the staff we dealt with were courteous and accomodating. Lots of airline pilots stayed there. We would recommend to all.

Just returned from Maui, and loved the Kaanapali Beach Hotel. The beach is so beautiful, and is right at your doorstep. The view from our 'Partial Ocean View' room was quite acceptable. The tsunami event that occurred while we were there was a bit unsettling, but there was no damage. Sam who gave the snuba and snorkel lessons in the pool was great! He gave me the confidence to try snorkelling at Black Rock which fullfilled a lifetime dream! The breakfast buffet was tasty, with a good selection of food. We hope to return soon.

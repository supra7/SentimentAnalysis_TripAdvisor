This was one of several conference hotels. It was quite comfortable, the beds were comfortable, the shower worked well, the room was clean, we had a good view from our room of the Space Needle and the location is good. We were able to walk easily to Pike's Market with a straight shot to the Pier. I knew there would be a lot of walking, but that is Seattle. The staff were cordial and helpful when we needed assistance. We did not have a car, so no issue there. The elevator was not a problem as far as wait time for us. I did happen to jump on the staff/service elevator once which embarrassed my daughter no end, but the staff just laughed it off. It was October so the air conditioner was not an issue either. No noise issues for us and we even had a connecting room with the extra door. Overall, a very comfortable stay and I would stay here again.

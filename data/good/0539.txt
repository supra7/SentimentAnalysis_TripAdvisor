Fantastic Queen Anne location surrounded by restaurants with lovely views. Hardwood floors and old porcelain tubs, spacious rooms and suites, friendly and helpful staff. Not for you if want all modern cookie cutter chain rooms. Sound proofing for quiet nights means no fresh air. Room service from nearby 10 Mercer wonderful, great breakfast across the street at Pepe's and Toulouse Petit.

The hotel lobby and such is all very updated and very nice. Our room was older but still very clean and well appointed. The staff in this hotel are amazing. Very friendly and very helpful. The parking is expensive but they give you unlimited in and out prividges plus its no more than other hotels in the area. Its a typical Westin and we enjoyed our stay and would stay again.

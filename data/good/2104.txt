Getting a room with a fantastic view, clean and decent washroom and a king size bed in a 5 star hotel in the heart of Seattle for $147.00 per night. Great start to our holiday. If shopping, great restaurants, great service and cleanliness is important to you, book this hotel. Preferably via a discount site if you can(we used priceline) What else could you want?

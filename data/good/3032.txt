Obtained through Priceline (check prices on Bidingfortravel.com). Great room with a comfortable mattress, excellent bathroom, hugh tv, and down pillows. Dennys is right across the street for an inexpensive meal. Avoided the $20 parking fee by returning my rental and using the hotels' free shuttle service. Noticed a large number of flight staff from the airlines stayed here. Very large hotel, so your room can be a good distance from the lobby. Several computers allowing internet access next to the cafe.

I spent one night in a double room, room clean and spacious with fire & small living area, large television and comfortable beds. Breakfast was suprisingly not inclusive of the expensive rate and was a little overpriced, but excellent meal. Valet attendents, concierge & cleaning staff very friendly, excellent service, receptionist not so much. Stunning foyer/ bar area on top of the waterfront. Internet available in business area but wifi not free.

We stayed for four nights at the Mayflower for a short vacation, and the location was ideal. Easy walking distance to Pike Market, Belltown and only about a 10-minute walk to Capitol Hill. Rooms are pretty basic, but we booked a good rate (average of $209/night) from Friday night to Tuesday. Never ate at the restaurant but the hotel does a have a limited 24-hour room service menu. Ultimately, great location for a very walkable city.

I planned a last minute trip to Seattle and was looking for a decently priced hotel in a central location downtown. The Roosevelt was great! I booked through Orbitz and got a great deal. The hotel is in an awesome location in downtown. It's really central, so getting around was easy. I took the Light Rail from the airport for $2.50 and it left me two blocks from the hotel. It's not the fanciest hotel, the rooms are a little small, but comfortable and the staff was helpful and efficient. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and I requested a higher level room so I had a good view. I'd definitely recommend this place to others.

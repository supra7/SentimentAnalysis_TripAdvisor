My husband and I are a childless couple who were looking for a romantic trip to Maui, and this resort is more geared toward families with children than adults without kids. Couples without children were the minority- all of the kids running wild really annoyed us, especially at the pool area, which is seemingly designed for kids only. In fact, I think adults were outnumbered by children here. The families in rooms on either side of us were really loud, and screaming kids woke us up each morning before 8 am. It is definitely a perfect family resort. Children aside, we enjoyed the breakfast served at Swan Court each morning. The Cascades restaurant was ambient and the food was better then average for Maui/Lahaina area. The frozen drinks here are amazing, and are served poolside. Try the Lahaina Lemonade. It is a must to reserve the beachfront cabanas- do it the day you get there, and for the duration of your trip. Overall, the staff was very nice. The beach in front of the hotel features murky water, and dangerous tides and coral. On our first day, my husband accidentally brushed against some coral in the water, and we had to visit the Dr's office in the hotel. Coral cuts must be treated immediately with antibiotics, the Dr. told us, because it is rife with staph and other bacteria. One amazing feature of this resort is the great Dr.'s office onsite- we were very grateful for it. Snorkelling at Black Rock is amazing! Skip the luau- it was only marginally entertaining, and the food was revolting.

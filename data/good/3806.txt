My wife and I came here for a very relaxing and quiet anniversary and thats exactly what we got:) The food and drink were very good, everything was "top shelf"! Some of the high points were it was a very quiet (adults only) resort and was very relaxing!! The resort and our room were very clean and maintained well. The entertainment was surprisingly good and we loved the cover band that played one night! Some of the negatives: (please understand that this was the down season and they may have been understaffed)The staff was nice, but not overly friendly, the service could have been faster/better, the spa and massages were good but not great, and there were a few mistakes, but overall everything was wonderfull! We were married last year at their sister resort Azul Beach which was amazing!!!, so we unfortunately compared this resort to it often. We wished we would have gone back there!!

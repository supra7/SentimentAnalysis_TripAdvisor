Stayed at the Hotel Trevi with my family and loved it. The staff was welcoming and helpful with all of our questions. It is just around the corner from the Trevi Fountain and within walking distance to many sights. Stayed across the street in a family room with 2 twins and a double bed. Very comfortable and quiet. Would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for a hotel that has easy access to sights throughout Rome.

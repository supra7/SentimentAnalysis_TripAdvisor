I recently stayed at the Hotel Max on a business trip, and chose it based on price and location. Travelling alone, I wasn't particularly concerned about room size, and had read reviews stating that the Max was quite small. The check-in process was speedy, and conducted by a very polite and attentive desk agent. Check-in time was to be 4:00, but I arrived around noon, and was worried I might not be able to check in early. I have had that problem in the past, but was pleased to find that my room was ready after my 12 hour flight, and all-together 16 hour journey. The room itself was a very clean, yet probably quite old room. The halls looked immaculate and new, but the best way I can describe the room, is an older room (walls, trim, floors, showers) with some stylish furniture ( bed, chair, desk, sink) and accents thrown in to cover that fact up. I imagine some would be less than pleased with this, but it didn't bother me at all. The bed was comfortable and clean. I had rotten sleeps on the bed, but that was likely jet-lag, and no indication of the bed itself as I have slept comfortably in far less comfortable beds. My only complaint was the window-unit heater/air-conditioner is incredibly noisy. I came from Japan where it was over 100 degrees some days to Seattles, cold and damp. I wasn't as well prepared as I would have like to have been, so I needed the heat... Loud as it was. The restaurant was great. I ate in the restaurant once, and ordered room service a few times when I was stuck inside doing work or conference calling. Surely not the best Seattle has to offer, but delicious nonetheless. The front desk staff, and the doormen were helpful, and attentive. A very good experience with customer service. All in all, I would recommend this place, and I'd go back again if I was going alone... With a spouse, or with a spouse and a child, it would be a tight fit in my Queen of Art room. Perhaps the others are larger?

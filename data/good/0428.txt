I stayed here for twp nights in November while traveling on business. The rooms were clean and very quiet and the wifi worked well. On the 16th floor, the views were nice with large windows. The lobby was very basic but there is a gift shop to buy basics and they have free umbrellas for the typical weather and you can print your airline boarding passes. You can walk to about 10 Starbucks and to Pikes Market and major shopping and restaurants on the water (Elliotts was good). The only downside was the parking which was valet only and expensive and not much else nearby. The hotel is convenient near the freeway too and not too far from the airport. The exercise room was minimal with a few machines.

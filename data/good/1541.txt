I don't understand many of the negative reviews here. We stayed one night here mid-September. The location was great - walking distance to Pike Place, across the street from the Westin. Front desk staff was very accommodating. The in-house restaurant had a great breakfast -friendly staff, lots of food, & it was tasty too. The room was okay - clean, basic, no complaints. It wasn't fancy, but it was sufficient. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

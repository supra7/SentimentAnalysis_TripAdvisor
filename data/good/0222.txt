We like the Warwick because of the great location - an easy walk to Pike Place Market, the Science Center, and downtown. Many good restaurants close by, and the incomparable Ralph's Deli right across the street (whose wireless signal works fine - you don't need to pay $9 for the hotel service). Ask for a room on the west side. The "weekend escape" rate at $179 is good value: it includes parking (otherwise $21) and breakfast (a $20 value).

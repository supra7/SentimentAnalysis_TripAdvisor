A lovely Hawaiian hotel, great location, easy to find and situated on a lovely sandy beach overlooking Black Rock. We saw Humpback whales and dolphins from the beach! The room was clean, air conditioning ice cool and beds very comfy, although the bathroom was quite small but all was decorated fairly modernly and in good taste. The beach and grounds were all immaculate, the pool was clean, although quite small, and no seperate kids pool which is sometimes nice if you are travelling with no kids yourselves. The staff were friendly and helpful, they evening left a bottle of champagne in our fridge as it was our honeymoon, they also give you a leaving ceremony where you are given a Lai necklace. We booked bed and breakfast, breakfast wasn't bad, buffet style, some odd choices but usually quite tasty. We tried the restaurant and it was one of our best meals, very good quality food, we also tried the tiki grill for lunch which was also really good. Generally a nice relaxed hotel and we enjoyed it very much. The down sides were: Quite expensive for what you get. You have to pay $9 per day parking, which is a bit of a cheek! The Bar closes at 10pm! Pool is quite small Not that much to do, they did some classes but I never saw any going on Not many sun loungers on beach, you also have to pay for those. Despite the chilled reputation Hawaii has, we found it quite strict there, not as chilled and relaxed as we thought it would be for example: Smoking only in designated areas (which are few and far between) No alcohol on the beach Our bar closed at 10pm Fireworks banned Plastic carrier bags banned Maui does offer so much to do, we ziplined, drove up a volcano, went whale watching and saw some amazing sights, lots of restaurants and altogether highly recommended, We would definately go back but not necessarily to Kaanapali Beach Hotel.

I spent four nights at the Anda in Seattle in October while visiting the city and surrounding areas with a friend. The front desk staff were pretty aloof during check in and the one or two occasions when we stopped and asked for a restaurant recommendation or city information. The room was very nice. A bit on the small side for two people, but the beds were deep and plush. The furnishings are a mix of Ikea, W, and Scandinavian post-modern with browns, blues, and greys. Very soothing. The bathrooms are small. There is a tiny fitness center which has some weights and an eleptical machine. The Greek restaurant off the lobby is very good. Conveniently located just two or three blocks from Pike Place Market.

I was traveling for business to Seattle recently and my colleagues recommended that I stay at Hotel Max to get a "feel" for Seattle. It was clean, the staff were all very friendly and helpful and it's in a great location! It's within walking distance of the convention center, Pike Place Market and many shops in downtown Seattle. The only downside to the hotel, as other reviews have mentioned, the rooms are on the small size. I think the closet in my room was slightly bigger than the bathroom. :-) If you can get past that though, this is a great place to stay if you're looking for a hip Seattle experience, in a centralized location.

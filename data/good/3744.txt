This must be a nearly-new hotel as it's spotless inside and out. Room was one of the smaller ones in that it was a junior suite rather than full suite, but still plenty spacious enough. Breakfast was good. Only minor gripes - flat-screen TV was fixed to the wall and could not be angled, meaning it could only be watched from the bed and not the sitting area. Pool was indoor and very small - shame they didn't plan to make it a more useful size. Still nice and refreshing. Close to several restaurants and easy to get out of the city.

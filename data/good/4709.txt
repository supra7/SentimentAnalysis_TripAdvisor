We stayed here for only 1 nite but was very pleased with reception and comfort level. Quiet and easy to get good night's sleep. As there is no bridge between the hotel and the vaporetto stop you can easily roll your luggage in. Reasonable size room and very clean bathroom. The breakfast area was also very pleasant as it included an enclosed courtyard to eat in open area in quiet. There are two lifts one small one for luggage only and one for 4 persons.

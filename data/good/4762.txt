This resort is great, just make sure you get a suite that has been updated as there are many in this property that have never been (since opening in1969) We were first put in a room that was of the older variety inside but we asked to be moved because the bedroom was connected to the living room and our son would not be albe to sleep at night if he were basically in the same room as us. Our new suite had an accordian wall that pulled accross. Plus, it had recently been renovated. Our shower was not draining at one point and they were really prompt in fixing it. All staff has been so accomadating and friendly. This hotel is on Ka'anapali beach which is rated the best beach in Hawaii. It is also right on the golf course. It's just a gorgeous location. It's walking distance to Whalers village and a 5 minute drive to Lahaina. You cannot beat the location. It has 3 pools, one of which is really big. We have been really happy here, The Sheratin is right next to this hotel and rooms go for a minimum of $380 a night and we paid less than half of that here for the same beach location, plus we have a full condo with kitchen and everything and the Sheratin rates start at just a single room so I'd say it is a great value. Just make sure you are placed in one of the remodeled suites and you are good to go. I would recommend this hotel absolutely.

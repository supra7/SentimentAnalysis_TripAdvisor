Hotel is located in Tukwila so it is not adjacent to the airport. It has free 24/7 shuttle service to the airport and it takes about 5 minutes travel time. There are restaurants located nearby as well as a large shopping mall. The Seattle Link railway is very close. It's better to stay here than at the hotels next to Sea Tac. However, don't ever count on them accommodating early arrival. Their policies are such that this just doesn't happen if they are full the night before. You must pay $10 for parking and $10 for slow wireless service. High speed is extra... Room had a small fridge, microwave, and bar sink, as well as an individual coffee/tea machine. Free breakfast was great.

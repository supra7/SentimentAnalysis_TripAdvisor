The Hyatt is one of the premiere properties in Maui, with lush, beautifully landscaped grounds, including the atrium, restaurants and the pools. We were here for a whole week, and had a tough time leaving...but that was probably more so because we were in Maui, rather than the Hyatt. The rooms was bearable, at best. The bathroom curtain was stale smelling when we first checked in, but it was promptly replaced after a call to housekeeping. The furniture is dated, but who really spends a lot of time inside the room? We had heard about the luau being the best in Maui, and it sure didn't disappoint. The fire dance was spectacular, and so were the other routines. The food was mediocre, but that's Hawaiian cuisine for you ;)... The location is great. Lahaina is a fun town with a whole spectrum of restaurants, shops and art galleries. Unfortunately, the beach strip attached to the hotel is not the greatest of Kaanapaali. Walk/Drive to the Sheraton grounds for the best portion of the beach, near Black Rock. My only other gripe was the lack of free internet access...But that was a blessing in disguise because it kept my wife away from her laptop ;)... Other areas in Maui that we would consider living in on our next trip would be Kapalua and Wailea. All in all, the Hyatt provides a great location and amentities for a first-time Maui traveller. PS>> Ask Paul, the concierge for recommendations. He pointed us to some great local hotspots, traversed by locals and tourists alike. He also gave us excellent tips for booking our excursions, and was always ready with a map to help directionally challenged drivers, such as myself :).

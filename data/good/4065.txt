I felt compelled to write a review for those people who are considering staying here soon. Please do not be alarmed by the tight wads commenting below. It behooves me that people shake thier head and p*ss and moan if their trip experience deviates in the slightest of their expectations. It really makes me wonder if these people would have had a good time anywhere in the world. The construction is not bad at all. If you are planning on sleeping until noon, you may hear some construction noise, but let's face it - you shouldn't be coming to Hawaii if you want to sleep the day away. View is amazing and the pool is terrific. As far as getting notice about the construction, all these geniuses had to do is check out the website, but then they wouldnt have their normal outlet of p*ssing and moaning on a website. To each thier own, but if you aren't an uptight *ss you will have a terrific time.

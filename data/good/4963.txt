Ok don't know if i could do this but would anyway...My sister and dad were looking for a place to stay for her trip to England to enter her University of choice. They wanted to do some shopping and was looking for somewhere in Finsbury. I have so much faith and confidence in TripAdvisor that i decided to do my research using the reviews from this website. They enjoyed their stay immensely at Central Park Hotel and the convenience of everything around them due to their wonderful location!!! the service was great and the only complaint was their exceptionally slow internet connection. Other than that they had a wonderful stay!!!!

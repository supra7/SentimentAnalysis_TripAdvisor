We had a great rate to stay here and knew Renaissance is Marriott's luxury hotel brand. The hotel turned out to exceed our needs. We were staying for just a nice before driving to Canada. The hotel shows that it's recently been renovated with great furniture throughout the lobby and guest room. The staff is really friendly even though we felt they were understaffed when we arrived and had to wait in line while the desk attendants were helping others with directions. Hotel parking was convenient underground. Based on Tripadvisor reviews, we asked for a room away from the 5 Freeway which meant it was quiet -- we were across from the city courthouse. We also had drinks in the bar at night and thought it was a nice lounge, quiet on a weekend.

We stayed at the W in Seattle for 2 nights of our honeymoon. The decor of the hotel, lobby and rooms, was very cool - different than the ususal hotel. We were able to easily walk to Pike Place market and Pioneer square from the hotel. Room service was very $$$ and not very good. I didn't compare parking prices but I think $29 a day is a bit much too!

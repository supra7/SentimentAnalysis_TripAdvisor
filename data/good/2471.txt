Positives: The beds were large and absolutely fantastic to sleep in. Along with the big pillows, I was tempted not to go home.....The staff was courteious and extremely helpful....Nice decor with the lights set at a intimate setting....Great location to walk around downtown and close to Pike St Market Negatives: I don't mind when the rooms are chilly, but I did notice the AC was on full blast...The biggest pain was probably the parking. Not a big area to pull up the car for valet, so found myself waiting in the street for the person in front of me plus a few cars coming out Overall a good hotel and would recommend staying there

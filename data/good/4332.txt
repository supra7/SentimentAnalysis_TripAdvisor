We like the hotels Indonesian motif. The staff gave us leis upon check-in and we got an overview of the amenities from the bellman as we walked to our room. We thought it was great that our room was upgraded to a partial view of the ocean even though we didnt request it. From the lobby, you can see the ocean, coconut trees, many tropical plants, and feel the ocean breeze. It rained one day and you can get wet walking through the lobby area since it is open to the elements. Dont forget to take pictures with the macaws, penguins, and coi pond. There are several shops as you walk through the first floor. Theres even a small Macys clothing store. The room was clean and we admired the decoration. We liked the walk-in closet. The balcony was a little small, but at least theres one. The beds were soft and they provided many pillows. As we ventured around the hotel, we found many spots to take pictures, as the grounds are lush with tropical plants and flowers. The main pool is big and is connected to the kids pool area through waterfalls and a cave like tunnel. Oh yes, there is a bar in the tunnel. The kids pool area has a slide and many fountains. Artificial sand is all over the area and can keep the little ones occupied. The luau Drums Of The Pacific was pricy. It is a smaller production compared to ones Ive been to. The restaurants are also pricy but it is expected since it is in a 4 star hotel in the Hawaiian Islands. Whalers Village, where other restaurants and shops are located, is a 15-minute walk. If you plan to take the $1 trolley to downtown Lahaina, you must walk 5 minutes to the pickup stop. Other than that, taxi and rental cars are available. We rented a $40 a day cabana at the beach. With it included was all the ice water you can drink and pineapples. The beach is not wide but there is enough space for the little ones to build sand castles. Overall, we had a great time at the Hyatt and we would stay there again in the future.

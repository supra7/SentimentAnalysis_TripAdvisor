We chose the Roosevelt because of a rate that included valet parking in downtown Seattle. The hotel is within walking distance of many attractions, including Pike's Place Market. The room, while on the smaller side, was clean and featured an incredibly comfortable queen-size bed. There are many shops and restaurants surrounding the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.

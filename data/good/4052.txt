The hotel, beach and grounds are nice. But we were disappointed that the renovation removed a lot of the resort experience. A lot of the main part of the hotel is surrounded by scaffolding and there are many walkways blocked off. The front desk is in a room. The penguin pool and koi ponds have scaffold supports in them, some fountains are drained and off and there are temporary and long wooden steps down to the pool areas.During the day there is the sound of work being done and the smell of paint. If you look at the notice on the hotel's web site, you are lead to believe that this is a minor renovation that will not impact your stay. That is just not so. There are other parts of the hotel that need updating. That will likely be the next project. Also, if you plan to self park be sure that you have a narrow car. Whoever painted the space lines in the self parking areas must have been a motor cycle driver.

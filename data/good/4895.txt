Our review of this hotel is split in a negative and positive experience. When we checked in for our 3 nights stay, they gave us room 102. This is a room that is smaller than a shoe box. It is not possible to have your suitecase open and at the same time open the door to your room. This room is on the ground floor and have no windows and is next to the breakfast room. The breakfast room is noisy from approx 6:30 hrs and will clearly wake you up even if you are using earplugs (I did). Looking more closely at the reviews at tripadvisor I found a bad rating that was based on room 102. The next morning we made a polite complaint about the noise that woke us up and asked kindly if they could move us to another room. The resepsjonist behaved like he was waiting for our complaint and gave us a much better room on the 2nd floor. Our new room was nice and very quiet, and based on this room the overall rating is very good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the hotel. The location is also perfect as the distance to Termini train station is walkable even with a bit of luggage. The hotel is also very close to the Repubblica metro station. When it comes to the staff I must say that we are a bit disappointed that they gave us room 102 to begin with. For the room rates this hotel charges room 102 is not value for money. A week later we stayed in SuiteDreams currently rated as #1 of the hotels in Rome. This hotel is in the same neighbourhood as Hotel Opera. SuiteDreams was a much more pleasant experience than Hotel Opera.

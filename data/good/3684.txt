Great location for Aquarium and Convention Center, sports. However, the first room had a horrible squeak in the AC unit and we had to switch rooms. Later that night, I tried to get ice and had to try 4 different floors to find an icemaker that worked. No out-of-order signs. No apology from staff. Could not understand the new reception girl who mumbled and didn't listen to our answers. Breakfast was a free upgrade because we are Gold Hilton members--we enjoyed it but the server ignored us after we got the initial coffee and juice. It was half self-service we guess. Food was good though. To get to the hotel you go south on President Street until you get to the Gold flame statue in the circle and do a turnaround. This is not clear on most maps. Parking is in a PMI garage on the opposite side of the hotel/also part of Homewood Suites, so you can enter both hotels through the garage. This was Hilton room quality but with a lack of attention to maintenance and service. Not what we hoped. Final analysis--we have done better at Hampton Inns--lower part of same chain.

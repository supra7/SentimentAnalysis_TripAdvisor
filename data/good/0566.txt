Spent a week in Seattle staying at the Marqueen, handy for the Seattle Centre and Space Needle and only a monorail ride or quick bus trip to the heart of downtown with plenty of bars and restuarants in the area if you want to eat locally. Rooms are big and come with a fully equipped kitchen and mine was comfortable and clean. Plumbing was rather antiquated but eveything worked which was the important thing. Front desk staff were attentive and helpful and happy to provide advice and guidance on local amenities. If you're a light sleeper I suggest you ask for a room at the rear, my room was at the front as the proximity of the main road and bars and restaurants means some late night noise, particularly at the weekend. It didn't stop me getting a good nights sleep, more of an issue was the noise from the fridge in the kitchen which I found it best to turn off overnight. Overall, I'd be happy to stay again at this well-appointed and individual hotel.

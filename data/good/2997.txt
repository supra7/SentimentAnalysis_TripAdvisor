Spent just one night here but will go back for a longer stay next time. Conveniently located near Sea-Tac. Rooms were clean and well-decorated. Ours had a microwave and fridge in addition to coffeemaker and hairdryer. Hotel offers expanded continental breakfast including waffles, hard-boiled eggs, and yogurt. No problems with aircraft noise, comfortable beds.

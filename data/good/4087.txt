The grounds are beautiful, and the room was comfortable with a beautiful view. However, we found a used condom wrapper in the nightstand drawer. Breakfast was ok, but get there early if you don't want to wait in line. The rester aunts are not good and overpriced like everything in Hawaii. Concierge service is great. They took care of all our little trips. Beach just south of the hotel is great, and the pool is fabulous. And, the bars' lava flows were like candy. Overall, it was good, but the food and prices could be a little better.

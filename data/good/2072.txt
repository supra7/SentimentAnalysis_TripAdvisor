We booked our stay through hotwire and got a great deal at about $130 a night. I have to agree with the previous poster though, in that I think that the Westin provides different quality rooms for people who book through online discount services. When we first checked in, the lady even acknowledged that we had booked through hotwire. But for what we paid, the hotel was great! Clean rooms, albeit some stains on the carpet, a nice pool, and a great location. This hotel is great for all the central activities such as the Market, Space Needle (hop on the monorail) and great dining. All that being said, if we would have paid the $300 a night that the rooms were going for and recieved the room we did, we probably would have been a bit upset. Oh, and one other thing.....don't expect any above and beyond "extras." The internet was 6$ for 15 minutes on their computers (free airline boarding pass print-out though), refrigerator stocked with pricey!!! items such that you cannot put anything else in there, and stains on some of the linens and mattresses. Again, it seems it was a case of you get what you pay for so we were not upset, but definitely will never pay full price if all the rooms are like that!

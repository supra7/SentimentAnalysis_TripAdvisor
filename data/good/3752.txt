We got a great deal on this hotel via a certain discount website! Our room was clean and spacious (we were put in a handicap room), staff was friendly, pool was nice, beds were comfy. Our view was of Lucas Oil Stadium just across the street. It was a short distance to downtown and museums. I would stay here again.

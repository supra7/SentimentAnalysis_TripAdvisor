It's not the newest Westin, but there is something that I like about this place. The dual circular towers are unique. I've always had an amazing view -- either of the water or the city. Be sure to ask for the highest floor they can get you on. The Westin heavenly bed is something to look forward to at the end of the day when you're away from home. The room service menu is a step above average and the staff is friendly. The location is walkable to good shopping and restaurants. It's not trying to compete with some of Seattle's more fancy boutique hotels, but I'll take it over some of the other mainline hotel brands any day. Oh, and one of these days I'm finally going to buy one of the fancy glass sculptures they have in the gallary on the lobby level. They're pretty amazing.

No problems here. great view from airport side rooms, beware the glass elevator if you get a high storey room its quite a way up there. breakfast good but on one evening i had the 'juicy angus' burger in the restaurant, would not recommend it. Overall staff very helpful and airport shuttle available 24/7.

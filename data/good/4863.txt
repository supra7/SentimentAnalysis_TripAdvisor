After confining in a flight for over 10 hours, my friend and i arrived Rome in early morning and came to the Hotel Opera Roma at about 8.30am. The staff (Ms. Silvia) was so kind to try her best to arrange us an early check-in, and also offer us cups of coffee, which indeed made a very good start of my journey in Italia. Also, the hotel is quite near to the Metro. Also, the room is clean and tidy though not a very big one.

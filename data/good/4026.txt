My husband and I honeymooned here in September of 2011. Overall we had great time! Room was beautiful and spacious- it was a partial oceanview and I loved enjoying my coffee every morning on the balcony waiting for my husband to wake up. Pool area was awesome- the waterslide is a must try! We had a blast on it!. Hot tub was large and spacious- this is where we either started or ended every evening. Like previous reviewers have mentioned, the beach is pretty much non existent, so if you want to be able to go to the beach without leaving your hotel, this is not the place for you. We of course rented a car and tried a new beach every day. Our favorites were to the north, Napali beach where you could see sea turtles swimming along the rocks, or south, past Wailea, to Big Beach, which won our hearts (just be careful exploring the rocks on the right side of Big Beach, because on the other side is Little Beach, which is a complete nude beach-boy were we surprised! Food was pricey at the hotel, as is everywhere in Hawaii though. Parking was tight, but if you come back at night and the parking lot is full, they do open up the valet lot so you can self park free of charge- it really wasnt a hassle either way. There is a convenience store in the hotel which has anything you could need, from over the counter medications, snacks, beer, to souveniers. Over all a wonderful stay!

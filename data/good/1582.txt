Hotel Andra was recommended by a close friend in 2005 - our stay at that time was just wonderful. Six years later we are back at the Andra... and it is just as good as it was in 2005. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with trendy modern furnishings. The hotel staff are so friendly and helpful. The hotel restaurant 'Lola' is a great place for brunch on the weekend (breakfast during the weekend is good too!). There are so many great restaurants in the local area within close walking distance. If you prefer to stay close, gives Lola's a go for dinner - you won't be disappointed.

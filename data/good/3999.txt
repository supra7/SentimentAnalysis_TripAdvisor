Excellent hideaway amidst the chaos of Mexico City Great location between Reforma and Zona Rosa. In a relatively tranquil area for Mexico City. Extremely well furnished with modern and stylish decor. Lovely staff. Great value. would certainly recommend over monstrosities like the Sheraton around the corner

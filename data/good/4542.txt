We just got back from our 5 night stay at KBH and couldn't have been happier. When we arrived they upgraded us to a partial ocean view which was beautiful. The grounds are gorgeous and you're literally just off the beach - also an easy walk to shopping and more restaurants. We went to the welcome breakfast which encourages you to book excursions through them - worth the hour for a free breakfast (I guess). It was very clean and quiet - we would definitely go there again!

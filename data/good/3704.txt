We recently stayed for 4 nights in the Boutique Trevi. It is in a fabulous, central position, 5 doors from the Trevi Fountain. The street is pedestrian only and buzzes night and day with life. From our little balcony on the 5th floor, we could listen to accordion players in the street below and look at the rooftops of Rome. When it came to going to sleep, the double glazed doors and heavy curtains shut it all out. Bliss! The staff were polite, but were slow to rectify some maintenance issues (shower curtain and towel rail falling off and security shutter handle broken). The room was not large, but comfortable and the breakfast delicious. The staff organised a car to the airport for us at a lower rate than we could by internet. So much of Rome is well within walking distance from this hotel, so even though it is expensive, it is well worth it to have all of Rome right there at your doorstep. It has pay as you go internet at reasonable rates.

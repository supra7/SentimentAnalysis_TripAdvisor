I stayed such a long time ago that I won't write a detailed review. However I wanted to mention a couple things and post my pictures because I notice there are not many for people to view. What I can say most about this place is the location. My Grandmother was at the University medical center having heart surgery and we wanted to be close and this was the perfect place to stay. The parking lot was small but we found a place and after we discovered the free shuttle to the hospital didn't need to move the car again. We were also able to walk to a couple places to eat. When the surgery didn't go as expected and we needed to stay another night the front desk staff were very helpful! The room was just ok and the beds not comfortable, but the lack of sleep probably had more to do with our situation that the place itself. The hotel was also 100% smoke free, has a great complimentary breakfast, free internet, and afternoon snacks. These things may have changed since my stay in 08 so please verify. Overall I would recommend!

We have traveled to AI hotels in the Riviera 1 to 2 times per year for the last 10 years. Secrets Maroma was just as I expected, nice, but not amazing. Our previous trip was to Excellence Playa Mujeres so I will use that hotel as a reference. Everything at Secrets was slightly lower quality than EPM, except, and this is a big except, the beach. Maroma Beach is AMAZING, without question on of the very best in the area and one of the top 5 I have visited worldwide. When we travel to a beach hotel one of the top requirements is a great beach. I didn't love Secrets, everything was just OK, but because of the beach we will definitely be back. Honestly, it is a really nice hotel and my comparison to other AI's is only by the slightest margins. I would expect that 99% of travelers would love Secrets. One note on the quality of service at this hotel, the staff is very friendly and accommodating. When we were there the hotel was overbooked and the staff did a great job dealing whit the number of people staying at the resort. So, my advice, if you don't really care about the beach and spend most of your time at the pool, go to EPM, the food, service and facility is a little nicer. If the beach comes first on your list, go to Maroma Beach. I think Secrets is the best AI on Maroma beach. I would also recommend not spending the extra money to upgrade to the select rooms. Almost every room in the hotel has a view of the ocean. We were in the back of the resort and I could see the amazing blue water of the Caribbean from every part of my room, yes, even from the shower.

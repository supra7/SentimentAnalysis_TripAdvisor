This is our third trip to Seattle in which we stayed at the Sixth Avenue Inn. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the location is convenient, and the price is definitely right for being so close to downtown attractions. It can be a bit noisy at night due to other guests (thin walls, a few partiers, lots of street activity), but not so much to keep us up at night. One note: if you are traveling with children, request a room on the Sixth Avenue side because the back of the hotel looks out over a VERY BUSY "gentleman's club," and you might not want to explain that to your children. Also, bring shorts, as it is quite warm in the rooms.

We love to visit Seattle and love the Moore Hotel. It's just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and only a few more blocks from the Piers. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. The hotel is older, but is packed with some great artistic decor. The bar downstairs is a dive, but worth checking out just for the people watching opportunity alone. Beds are cozy, bathrooms are clean. Prices are much better than nearby chains. Plan to visit nearby Ohana Restaraunt (excellent!!) and our new favorite bar, Bathtub Gin. We've even stayed here for a few Seahawks games. You can catch the bus nearby, or walk the mile to the stadium.

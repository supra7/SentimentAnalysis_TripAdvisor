I went to Istanbul for the 1st time with a friend of mine, and we stayed at Gunen Hotel - Laleli. It was just wonderful... Our room was perfect and clean, the rates were very reasonable, the staff were personable and helpful, the breakfast buffet was very delicious and healthy, the location was perfect for site-seeing and for shopping. It was great. We couldn't have found a better place. I will stay at Gunen Hotel everytime I'm in the city, and I would recomend it to everyone. M. Mehrabani 30 Aug - 6 Sep, 2011

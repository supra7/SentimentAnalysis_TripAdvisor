We stayed here for one night due to a late flight arrival time, and had a great stay - short, but great. The location is super easy to get to by tram from the main train station. Check in was easy as well - I sms'd my contact at the hotel when we were leaving the airport, and she was there when we arrived. The room was amazing - it was quite spacious, and the decor was french toile with a great chandelier. The bathroom was small, but very functional. Apple computer with tv and radio functions, plus some movies and cds available for your use. Coffee machine in the shop downstairs is available for use as well. All in all, no complaints. If you're looking for a 24 hour concierge, room service offering type of place then this isn't for you, but if you're more independent and looking for a comfy bed in a greal location, then this is a good option for you!

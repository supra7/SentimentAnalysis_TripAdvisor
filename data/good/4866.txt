It is close (walking distance) to the main train station and the subway. It is a good location for site seeing. Our room was modern, quiet and clean - a little small, but fine. The breakfast room was a little crowded, but the food was good. The front desk staff was very helpful and pleasant (even when dealing with some other guests who were being really rude). They set us up with a private driver to the airport, which was less expensive (for 3 people) than a taxi and more convenient than taking the train.

Stayed here before a 5:50 am flight. Got a great rate on Priceline. Lobby is lovely and check in fast and friendly. I asked them to put us in a room that was close due to a foot injury, but we were in a room 2 long hallways away. Room smelled fresh and was very clean.The view was on the back of some bushes. I do think they put customers that book through on line sites in less desirable rooms, but other than the location, it was fine. Beds a little soft, but nice pillows. NO BEDBUGS!! Nice large flat screen TV and small sitting area Of course they chaqnge for internet. Ordered room service and everything we got was great. Hash browns are a meal in themselves!! They have a nice pool that we used on previous stays. Check out was fast and airport shuttle was easy and I appreciated the friendly driver at 4:00 am.

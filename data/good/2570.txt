We stayed 3 nights at The Max. Service at the front desk is great, friendly and to the point, location is perfect (close to the center, but without the noise and crowd), rooms are rather small but show tastefull design. Only (but really frustrating) negative was the old fashioned and noisy airco in the room (you know, the box mounted in the window). If you can live with that, The Max is really a great stay. For me, it is the only reason why I will not return to The Max.

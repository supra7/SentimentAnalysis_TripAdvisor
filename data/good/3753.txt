We have stayed here twice now. Everything about this hotel is very good. You are just across the street for Lucas Oil Stadium. And only a couple blocks from all the action downtown. The rooms are very nice and clean and big. Especially if you can get a good deal on them. Well worth it. If you're going for the game, the parking is only $10 a night. But beware, they will charge you another $30 for parking for the game. The 2 bedroom suites are nice, but the divider only sticks out maybe 2 feet, so there is not a lot of privacy, if you're with other people. Haven't done the breakfast yet, usually go to Steak n Shake before the game. Bed and shower are excellent though. All in all, great location and hotel.

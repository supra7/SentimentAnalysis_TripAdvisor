We had a great stay at the Hyatt Regency for six days this November. Everything from the check-in process to housekeeping was handled very well and we were always made to feel very welcome. The location of the hotel is very good -- an easy walk to Whalers' Village and several other resorts in the area as well as to nice beaches right near the hotel. The rooms were nice, but a bit small. The bathroom (toilet and shower/tub combo) was very small, but fortunately we were staying under the family plan and had two adjoining rooms, which made it easier for the four of us to get ready. The biggest issue was the lack of sound proofing in the rooms. We could frequently hear people in the hall or upstairs, but the most difficult time was the evening the hotel had an outdoor party for the Maui Invitational basketball tournament. The music kept the kids up until after 10 pm. The grounds are very nice and the pool, waterfalls, bars and restaurants are all great. The waterslide was closed the entire time we were there (just before Thanksgiving) and so the kids were disappointed, but other than that they enjoyed the place. All the meals we had at the hotel were very good, but for breakfast both restaurants only offer a very expensive buffet. One restaurant is supposed to offer an a la carte breakfast but when we asked about it we were told to just get the buffet because it was cheaper. Overall it was a good stay and consistent with the last two times we stayed at this hotel. Next time we are in Maui I have a feeling we'll be back...

When we got to the front desk they informed us they upgraded us to an ocean view room. Went in to take a look and the floor all around the bathroom area was flooded so Walter (bear) took us on a little tour of a few others until we found one we liked. We stayed in A108. Room was very comfortable for the two of us. Great having a washer and dryer. Everyone there was super nice to us. The grounds are very nice with lots of flowers and good photo ops. The 3 pools are small and simple compared to the larger resorts but nice just the same. I was the only one in the pool every time I went swimming. There is a little market in the lobby with a good variety of stuff. The location is good and close to a lot of things just make sure you know where you are walking before it gets dark. We were trying to get back from the Sheraton the first night and couldn't see a thing, we were wandering around the golf course not sure where to walk and the sprinklers were going off. Its funny now, but we were so tired and frustrated. They will drive you to the beach cabana and back. It has a fridge and towels and beach chairs. We had a great time and felt very comfortable at the Maui Eldorado. We stayed 8 nights and it was not enough time to see and do everything we wanted. Go for 2 weeks if you can. Would go back in a heartbeat. My favorite things in Hawaii was swimming with turtles at Napili Bay, hiking the bamboo forest on the road to Hana. We ate at Mamas fish house, was amazing. Very expensive so I bought a $100 gift card a couple months before we went to take the sting out of it. I packed a bunch of snacks and cereal and I was glad I did, the prices are a bit shocking at the market. Really great pizza at Kula lodge in the upcountry. ooohhh I can't wait to go back!!!

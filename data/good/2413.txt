Passing through Seattle on a roadtrip, and stayed in the W for the evening. I like the W hotel brand. It's hip and trendy, and generally provides good service. That said, I can certainly see this type of hotel being an acquired taste. If you're looking for a luxury or business class room, and not worried about the experience, this may not be your kind of hotel. That said, the W met most of my expectations. The downstairs lobby area is indeed a lounge bar on weekend evenings, and the fitness centre was well laid-out and equipped. Rooms were standard, bed okay, bathroom clean and modern. The location, in central downtown Seattle, is good for accessibility to shopping and the sights. My biggest complaint is, as expressed by others, the dark hallways. Yes, I understand the W brand, and its attempt at establishing an appropriate mood in all the common areas. But the hallways in the evenings are way too dark. You can barely find your room key in the lighting! Here's a suggestion -- if one wishes to maintain the hip mood of the hallways, just install some halogen spot lights or some track lighting in the hallway areas. This still promotes a hip mood, but allows the hallways to not look like something out of a scary movie. Anyhow, despite this critique, I still really like this Seattle hotel, and I would return again when I'm in the area.

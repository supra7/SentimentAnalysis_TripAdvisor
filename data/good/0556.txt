we stayed for 1 week and enjoyed the historic hotel and bohemian surroundings. the front staff were helpful and friendly yet professional. there are good restaurants in the area and queen anne street provided a nice, albeit short, stroll. i skipped breakfast because there was little to offer (cold croissants with jam and butter, coffee, tea, some fruit and breakfast bars) and the fitness center was rudimentary. the parking was costly at $20 per night with no other options (plus tip each time you take out your car and return it). also there are no elevators. but we had no problems with street noise and i liked the kitchenette which was convenient so overall, a good choice.

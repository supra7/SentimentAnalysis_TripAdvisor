We booked The Sorrento via Last Minute and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the old style hotel. Its definitely old - so if youre looking for sleek fittings, bland colours, lots of glass, designer taps, plasmas etc then this is not the place for you.....head to somewhere that was built in 09 instead. This is a beautiful old building that has been taken care of and is very welcoming. Its a step back in time to a simpler world - beautiful furniture and linen etc. Its located on top of the hill so you get a fair bit of incidental exercise every time you head into the city centre / markets. Happy hour offers some great drinks deals and next time we visit we will book for the high tea. A nice change from the standard hotel ....definitely recommend it.

This hotel is conveniently located in the central downtown area. The city is very walkable, making the location of this hotel ideal. The staff was pleasant and always willing to make a recommendation or provide directions. Everything cost extra including parking ($28/day), internet ($10/day), and water ($4.50/bottle), but I suspect that is typical of the downtown hotels. I really enjoyed the breakfast wrap on the room service menu and the restaurant had great food as well.

I just got back from staying at Hotel Vintage Park and their staff is excellent. We were celebrating our 1st yr anniversary and the hotel upgraded our room to a King Premiere and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne. The hotel is located in a pretty good location, in the shopping district and about a 1/2 mile walk to Pike's Market. The hotel itself is small and older but the staff makes up for it.

The rooms in this hotel were very nice - large and modern with a comfortable bed (although the bathroom needed a better shower and more counter space). The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was very convenient for fisrt-time visitors (across the street from the Pike St. Market and near many good restaurants and shops). The hotel terrace was GREAT...a wonderful place to sit with a bottle of wine and a book and spend an afternoon relaxing or watching the sun set!! For people that like the smaller, one-of-a-kind hotels in large cities...this is a very good choice!

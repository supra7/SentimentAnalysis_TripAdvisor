We stayed here for five nights with our extended family. We loved the beautiful grounds and all of the gorgeous birds! The beach walk was great and you could easily walk to Whalers village. An oustanding snorkeling spot was also within walking distance at Black Rock. The regency club was great as was the breakfast buffet. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Great location for easy access to Lahaina.

This is a full-service, all-inclusive resort with a great location and wonderful staff. Sadly, the only thing they can't control is the weather! We were at Maroma Beach the first week in January and even though the sun only came out 50% of the time, we had a great time at the resort and plan to definitely return again. The staff is truly amazing - everyone really makes you feel at home and caters to your needs. They have fun, themed dinners around the property each week with decor and entertainment, as well as 5-6 restaurants and 24 hour room service. Most of all the Entertainment Staff are fun and friendly and make sure everyone is having a great time, regardless of the weather. Look for a list of the next day's activities on your nightstand with your turndown service each night. There's tons to participate in - or just relax on your own. Also, one of the prettiest spas I have seen at a property. The one reason I gave it 4 dots instead of 5 is because we paid for a swim-out room, and didn't realize this is just a private pool for our building. It was too cold to swim in, and we didn't see anyone in there all week (again, not their fault it was chilly out!). Next time we will not spend the additional on a swim-out room and instead opt for a room with a jacuzzi on the balcony. Enjoy!

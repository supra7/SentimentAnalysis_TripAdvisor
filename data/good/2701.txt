We spent 2 separate nights, with a night in Victoria in between. The first night we had the jacuzzi suite on the 6th floor. Lovely large room and nice jet tub for 2. This room had partial view down Pine St. to ocean. The second night we opted for the basic queen. A very small, but clean and perfectly adequate accomodation. This one was on 12th floor, so really nice & quiet that far up from the street. Excellent location with a quick 7 blocks to Pike's Public Market and only a few blocks to Monorail going to Space Needle. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. As an added review I would suggest Elliott's for dinner, right on the water, wooonderful food!! Skip The Fisherman's restaurant down the street from it (mediocre at best & in similar price range) and as far as transportation to/from airport, the Gray Line Airporter Shuttle is fine coming from airport, but DO NOT get the round trip ticket(s), as the bus never showed up for us after waiting over an hour and finally rushing to take a cab.

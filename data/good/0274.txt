Superb location with the famous bustling Pike Place Market literally on the doorstep and an easy walk to shopping areas restaurants and attractions. We arrived early and upon asking reception if we could stow our bags were pleased to be allocated our room. The room was exceptionally clean with good quality toiletries and a strong hairdryer in the well lit bathroom. We were pleased to be able to keep our water in the spacious fridge. The hotel roof terrace with views over the market area and Sound was a nice touch. Sleep quality was not the best with traffic stopping and starting off again at the lights ouside - still we knew we had booked a City side room as the others were above our usual budget! Bugbear was the air con unit at the side of the bed which not only seemed to amplify the street noise but meant that there was no bedside cabinet/table on one side of the bed.

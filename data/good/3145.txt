I have just arrived back home from a short trip to Berlin and i must say this hotel has an excellent service from the moment i arrived till i left i felt like staying in a 5 star hotel (Outstanding Service). All employees were great but i must say, Philips needs a particular mention, this guy is a star! He was very helpful and provided all the information i needed. I got maps, directions, train and bus tickets, early check in at the last minute and change my reservation without any penalty! Definitely i will stay again in Lindemann's hotel. Rooms are fine, very comfy beds, big windows and enough space in the room, and price is good too.

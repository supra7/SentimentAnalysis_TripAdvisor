Super friendly staff. Concierge was great, helped us out with a dinner reservation for a large party on the same night. Beds are ok, a little too soft for my taste. Rooms are a little dated, but spacious and clean. In a decent location for downtown, although there are lots of hills in the area. The water in our room would not hold a consistent temp (going from warm to scalding hot, to tepid, then back to warm). The front desk was apologetic, and agreed to a breakfast voucher for 2, but only after I asked. Breakfast buffet at the restaurant in the hotel was just decent. We got a rate that included parking, which made this a great deal since parking is so expensive downtown. I would stay here again and would recommend.

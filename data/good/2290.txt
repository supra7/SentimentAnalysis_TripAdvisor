Room: We had a fairly large room with a large bed, Plasma TV etc. We were in a disabled room whhich did not have an efficicent layout (ie the desk was by the side of the bed so kept walking into the chair). No view outside but the room was quiet. Bathroom: Good size and clean Staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again if in Seattle.

I read many reviews ahead of booking my 5 night stay in Seattle. I am a research nut and as i was traveling solo, i was even more focused on finding somewhere safe, convenient and good value. The Mayflower hotel ticked all these boxes - i found the hotel staff efficient and professional in all my dealings - from the initial booking (i emailed them after booking through expedia.com.au for directions using light rail - there was a super prompt and detailed reply), to the doormen who were so friendly and courteous, to the front desk check in/out process. It was super handy to use the computers at the front desk for free to print reservations - the lovely Asian front desk receptionist already had my printouts on the countertop before i even had a chance to log out of the computer. The 2 door guys - sorry fellas, I didn't catch your names, but one wore glasses and always had a smile and the other was tall and dark (and handsome!) - both of you were so pleasant and professional and so prompt with welcoming me to/from the property. The room was a good size for 1 - and i had a view of the macy's downstairs. Found it confusing to get from the light rail exit to the actual hotel front door - i suppose i could have studied the map better, but really didn't know which exit i came out from. dragging my suitcase through evening traffic didn't get me off to a good start. I caught a taxi on the way back to airport and this was organised by the hotel - in fact, they actually had the hotel private car waiting and so i took this instead as it was ready to go - cost me a bit more $40? from memory but got there safe/sound early in the morning. I felt safe at all times in the hotel - despite being hassled by the usual suspects once i went out of the hotel into the masses. Had some yummy local meals - Cheesecake Factory, Palamino. LOCATION IS FABULOUS. can walk everywhere, including Pike Place Markets. Loved Seattle and would definitely stay at The Mayflower again without hesitation.

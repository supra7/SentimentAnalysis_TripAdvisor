We stayed here for the last 7 days of our honeymoon....the hotel room was great, but the shower and toilet area were a little tight as they are right next to each other with a door for privacy. the views were great and the food throughout the hotel was great--we got the breakfast buffet as a package deal through our travel agent, Jen Byrne at theTropicaltravelers.com. She really set us up with everything we love--pool, snorkeling, beach! The beach bar was fabulous--we enjoyed swimming up to it for drinks. The walking path through all the hotels on Kaanapali is convenient but very very crowded and narrow. We enjoyed walking down to the Sheraton's beach for AMAZING snorkeling and a wide open beach that had a safe way in and out--the beach at the Hyatt is tiny and there are quite a lot of rocks when getting in and out of the water. Overall it was a great hotel, just crowded at the pool and walking path (not the beach though). the Luau was also good at the Hyatt--but don't pay the extra VIP fare--not worth it--we are so glad we just paid the regular price. The rental fee for the beach chairs was very reasonable at the hotel---they were so perfect for our days away---great idea to rent if you are going off for the day to other beaches! We thought that the towel tickets were a little annoying---who wants to steal bright yellow towels if you can afford to stay at a Hyatt...I recommend they just give you as many towels as you want, no tickets---everyone will give them back---no one wants a wet yellow towel--trust me!

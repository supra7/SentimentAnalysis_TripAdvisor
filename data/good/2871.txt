We were there for 3 nights and the service and staff was awesome. We had a 2-room suite with King bed in the bedroom and pullout in the living area. Management and staff were exceptional and the entire place was clean and pleasant. Even my 12-yr-old daughter commented on how clean the place was. Our stay came with daily hot breakfast and openbar manager's reception in the PM. Although the place was packed with teenage girls for the volleyball tournament, nothing ever got out of hand. One thing that would have made stay better was a better bed in the pull-out.

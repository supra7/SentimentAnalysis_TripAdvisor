This was my first stay at a Kimpton hotel, and I have to say I was pleased. We had a very late check in, so I was happy to have a speedy experience at the front desk. We ordered a quick bite with room service, which was a nice to have available so late at night, and it arrived quickly. We had a Monaco King room which was pretty spacious, with a desk area, lots of room, and a really comfortable bed. The only thing I wasnt really crazy about was our shower had built in dispensers of shampoo and conditioner instead of individual bottles. They do, however, offer a handful of amenities at the front desk such as toothpaste and the like if you forget to pack them (some free, others for a fee). We had an issue with our mini fridge, and not only did they service it right away but they immediately brought a cold drink from the bar downstairs since what we wanted from the fridge wasnt cold. At every encounter the staff was friendly and efficient. Ask for a goldfish, and your stay is complete! It is centrally located so you can walk to many attractions in the city. Its extremely close to Pike Place Market, and you can walk down to the original Nordstrom. They have complimentary coffee in the morning, and I think a cocktail hour in the evenings? We booked the $1 breakfast, which was okay  for $1 its a perfectly fine continental breakfast, but dont expect to be full. Theres actually a great little bakery across the street down a block by the Fairmont that I would recommend for excellent pastries like ham and cheese croissant, cinnamon buns, etc. I would stay here again, and will probably seek out their properties in other cities. I also recommend joining their loyalty club for some nice extra perks like free WiFi.

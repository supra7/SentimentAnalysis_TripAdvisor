i stayed at the seattle westin jun 25, 2005 the evening before boarding our princess cruise ship for an alaska sailing. the negative comments had me a bit concerned, but having worked in the travel industry for almost 25 years--well i've learned to take others comments with a grain of salt. we arrived at the hotel when it seemed like the entire 2 towers were filling up-or emptying out at the same time! however if you are a starwood gold or platinum member there is a dedicated check in 'room' where 2 efficient agents were checking people in. our wait was not more than 5 minutes. we were given a room on the 36th floor which had spectacular views of the bay! the room was clean, everything was well stocked and as usual the heavenly beds were so comfortable. too comfortable infact as we lay down for a short nap and woke up 3 hours later after a long morning of flying. the sunset we woke up to was amazing, with two cruise ships following each other out of the harbor----picture post card perfect! the only thing wrong with the room was that housekeeping had just cleaned the carpets and the solvents/detergents used had a horrible smell--that disipated though by the time we came back to the room from a short walk around town. i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friend and client. enjoy the views!

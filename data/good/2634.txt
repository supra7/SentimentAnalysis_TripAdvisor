We grabbed a single night paid room here prior to staying two nights at the Fairmont Olympic for our 10th Anniversary. It was nice, and had an edge to it that wasn't trying too hard. The rooms were relatively good size, but for an older property, some things are understood like smaller bathrooms, window units for AC, etc. For the money though, the location was really good, very close to the good shopping, and we liked the overall ambiance. The bar was hopping after hours as well...

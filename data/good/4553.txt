As a travel consultant with cre8adventures.com, I've seen quite a few resort hotels in Maui. The Kaanapali Beach Hotel surprised me, in a good way. The resort provides something none of the other resorts on this awesome stretch of beach can - authentic aloha spirit. It's not a luxurious option for sure, but ongoing maintenance keeps the hotel in satisfactory condition. And the following features helped me look past small annoyances: - excellent beachfront location - fun regional touches - free sunset hula shows - Hawaiian activities - Hawaiian meals - performances of Hawaiian songs and dances by the staff This property is a throwback to Old Hawaii. It offers a real change of pace. That it's close to golf, tennis, shopping and all of Kaanapali's attractions is icing on the cake. The landscaping and outdoor facilites aren't amazing, but the courtyard with a large lawn and a whale-shaped pool facing the placid beach is nice. The terrace restaurant roasts a spitted pig every Friday as part of its luau ritual. Again, it's not fantastic, but it's above average and the atmosphere is solid. The tiki bar in the courtyard showcases Hawaiian music and torch-lighting ceremonies We highly recommend splurging for an oceanfront unit in the Molokai Wing. The views are amazing and compared to other similar vistas, the rates are relatively low. The units are all large and generally well maintained, but we did notice some oversights (worn carpeting and nicked up furnishings) in our room and the hallways. I can't over-emphasize the staff. They are friendly and always smiling. This hotel offers more old-fashioned aloha spirit than any other resort on Maui, and the flood of good cheer casts the maintenance flaws into the shadows.

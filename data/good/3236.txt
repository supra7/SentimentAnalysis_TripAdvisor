Decent place to stay. Comfortable beds with fitted sheets (unlike other hotels in this price range that use flat sheets that slip off during the night). Room and linens clean. Yes it has a slight smell, maybe some soap scum build up and slight dark spots in bathrooms, but this is Florida! Happens in the best of places! All the older hotels smell like that! Staff very helpful. Breakfast average, but much better than other places in this price range. Yes rooms are small, but again when staying in this area you're not there to hang out at hotel. If you want resort amenities then stay at a resort. No noise issues, shower worked well (who needs a tub). Would stay here again.

We've stayed here several times when we party in town. Its much safer then driving under influence. Don't be frightened when you walk through the door and there's a huge line for check in. The line goes pretty fast. We weren't in line for longer then 5 minutes. Check in was a breeze. They do give you an option of higher or lower floors. I assumed they would give us a king size bed. But when we arrived it was two doubles. We went back down and requested another room and it was not a problem. The rooms are a decent size. Beds are comfortable and there was a desk and two comfortable lounge chairs. Location is right next door to the Seattle convention center. A 5 block walk to Pike's place market. And a short cab ride $6 dollar cab ride to Belltown and Capital hill. There's always a line of Taxis outside of the hotel. My only complaints: Hearing doors slam shut, parking prices is outrageous, and they only provided 2 bath towels.

Generally the Roosevelt and the Wickham are the best priced nice hotels in downtown Seattle. What can I say, it was nice and cheap enough with a great location but I was disappointed that there wasn't a room safe and the room bathroom was quite small. Its a bummer they didn't have a pool either, because the Wickham does.

My Fiance and I stayed for a long weekend in Playa. This hotel is a hidden gem. The price is excellent for the clean rooms and the lovely people who own this charming hotel. It is a few minutes walk to the boardwalk. The air conditioning is wonderful and everything is very clean. I would recommend it to anyone ;) We will be back since this is were we were engaged on a rainy day in playa!

My wife and I actually had reservations at the Secrets Capri (which was very nice), but when we were offered a chance to try their sister resort out for the last couple days of our stay, we figured, "why not", and we were so glad we did! Secrets Maroma was incredible! Before we even got there, we were told that the beach there was one of the best in all of the Cancun/ Riviera Mayan area, possibly even in all of Mexico. Now, I haven't been to all of the beaches in Mexico, or even all of them Riviera/Cancun, but we did walk quite a stretch and it was by far the best that we saw! We had an incredible room that even had a patio that walked right into a semi-private pool (they lined the back of 12 rooms). There was a double-wide jacuzzi tub in the bathroom that you could use and still watch the tv in the bedroom area...it was sweet! The staff was great as well as the restaurants, bars, and grilles! If you're planning a trip to this area, I recommend the Secrets Maroma Resort highly!

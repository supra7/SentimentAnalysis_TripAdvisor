Several family members and friends were congregating in Seattle for a memorial service. Well traveled people ranged in age from 23 to 68, from points as far flung as Hawaii, Paris, Los Angeles, and Reno...everyone loved it! Very convenient location for walks to the Pike Place Market (waiter at the Athenian Restaurant is a great comedian to go along with your breakfast), the Seattle Center, shopping, etc. Hotel staff very attentive. One room shared by two people was a little small and they moved them without any problem to a larger room. Rooms on the 10th floor were spacious and visited on occasion by seagulls on the window ledge. Did have one mishap but was taken care of graciously and efficiently. The parking attendant placed a small scratch on a front bumper of one of our party's cars. The manager called and stated what had happened, said their insurance was already contacted, and wanted to verify information so that a repair could be made ASAP. He also asked that a visual inspection be made to verify what had happened, which we did, and again, the manager was very responsive, apologetic, and very helpful. Things like that happen, but it was handled really well. Kudos. Everyone at this hotel made an extra effort to take care of the guests, from parking attendants, desk clerks, maids, and the manager. It's a vibrant, fun place to stay, with it's art everywhere (including on the room doors themselves) and very secure in that you have to use your room key to activate the elevator. Would definitely stay here again.

We spent 3/22/04-3/29/04 at the kbh, we couldnt have picked a more hawaian hotel on the island. we have bee to maui 6 times and this by far was the friendliest hotel. the rooms could have been a little nicer but we really cant complain. for the price i would definately stay there again.ask for a lower floor room bigger aaand better.

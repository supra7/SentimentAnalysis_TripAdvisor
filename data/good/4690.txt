We stayed here the last week in April 04. The hotel was nice. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The pool wasn't as fancy as some of the other hotels but it was very low key and uncrowded-there was always plenty of lounge chairs and shade-not a lot of loud kids. They have a great tiki bar with good drink specials everyday. The tiki hut grill also served up suprisingly good munchies also at a reasonable price. We received free breakfast buffet tickets because our booking agency had made a mistake-I would not recommend using these for the Mixed Plate buffet. The food here was cold and not very good.Not much variety either. You can use your breakfast tickets at the other Tiki restaurant where the food is much better-don't waste your time going to the Mixed plate buffet. The hotel is a very short walk from black rock where there is the best snorkeling-almost better than the snorkeling cruise to Molikini we took. We saw some turtles and tons of fish too. Also a very short walk to the Whalers Village where there is lots of good shopping and great restaurants-try Hula Grill or Leilani's. We tried them both and we would highly recommend them. There is no jacuzzi at the hotel but we just walked next door to the Whaler hotel/condo resort and used there's-they didn't mind.The room we had was kind of outdated but very clean-you're hardly ever in your room anyways. It was actually a garden view room but we still had a really good ocean view. We had requested a renovated room but there wasn't one available when we checked in. All in all this place was pretty nice and we had no complaints. We would definately stay here again. It's a lot less expensive than all of the other hotels. Some people will always find something to complain about so I wouldn't be too concerned about the other reviews on this site. You can save yourself lots of money by choosing to stay here and you are right next to the best snorkeling on the island-who could ask for anything more?

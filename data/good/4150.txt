Our trip was a package through Costco so we expected nice amenities. What we got far exceeded our expectations. The rooms were ocean front, clean, and well appointed. We slept with the sliding doors open so we could hear the waves. The hotel had several places to eat included a very good restaurant open to a lagoon and under a waterfall. The service everywhere on the resort was top notch. The staff all seemed quite happy and also seemed genuinely interested in us. It felt like personal service everywhere. The hotel is in a good spot on the beach with pool and cabanas right there as well. The drinks were a bit expensive compared to ones just down the beach but were good. We had free internet included in our package and that was the only bad part of the trip. You have to establish a connection every time you access the internet and it failed more times than it worked. Every time it failed a screen would come up trying to get you to upgrade to paid internet acccess. After a few days, we usually gave up if it took more than 30 minutes (often) to connect..

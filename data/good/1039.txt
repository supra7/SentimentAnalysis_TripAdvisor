The Renaissance Seattle Hotel is rated as a four star hotel on many websites. While it is very nice, I don't believe it's a 4-star property. The service is very good and the staff is friendly and ready to help with any request. The hotel is showing wear and tear in spots. My room on the 21st floor faced I-5 and I could hear a bit of traffic noise. If you are staying here, plan on more road noise the lower you are  if you are staying on the east side of the hotel. One of the sound proof window panes in my room had failed and was cloudy. My room was nicely appointed; the refrigerator in the room is a nice convenience. The bathroom, while nice was very small. I visited the top floor lounge and the views are impressive. But, the place looks like it was last renovated in the mid 90s. I think the hotel is missing an opportunity here to turn this space in to something nicer. Much has been made about the parking situation at the hotel. If you don't have to drive to the hotel, don't. You don't need a vehicle to get around Seattle from the hotel (yes there are hills, so if you're out of shape, you might disagree with this statement). The $30 non valet parking does give you in and out privileges with your room card key, but the garage beneath the hotel is hard to navigate and has a 6' 2" height restriction. I received a nice deal from Priceline on this hotel. If I would've paid something closer to rack rates, I dont think I would have been as happy.

My wife & I just returned from 5 days at the Hyatt. We enjoyed the hotel very much. A couple of things regarding previous reviews... yes there is a $15 resort fee per night, per room, it covers cost of coffee/tea and use of athletic facilities. The covered wood chaise lounges on the beach cost $30 per day to rent. They do not charge to sit in a hammock. Yes a poolside cocktail is $7.00, duh, your in Hawaii remember? Valet parking is $10, self parking is free. The grounds of the hotel are very beautiful and relaxing. This is what you will remember most. They offer free water aerobics, yoga, etc. If you dont have kids, avoid this hotel during the summer time. We went when school was back in session and found very few screaming children running loose. The staff was very friendly. We recieved a lei from the bellman and all staff was accomadating throughout our stay. We stayed in a deluxe ocean view which had a nice balcony on the 6 floor of the napili tower. Restaurants are a dissapointment, dont bother with more than a burger/cocktails poolside. If you have read other reviews, you know by now that the beach is small, it is still beautiful and has plenty of room to lay on the sand. The walk toward Whalers village/decent restaurants is a little long, but is also a nice walk along the water during sunset. Enjoyed our dinner at Leilani's and the bar at Hula Grill is good. This is a very nice hotel. There are quieter, more mature hotels in Maui. This is a hotel that has pretty much everything you could want (except good restaurants). I didn't feel nickeled and dimed. I would probably return to this hotel, I would definitly return if I had kids. Aloha.

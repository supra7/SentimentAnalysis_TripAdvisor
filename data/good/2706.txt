Good points: the staff were very courteous and helpful. Our room was spotless and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent - right in the heart of downtown and within walking distance of restaurants, the market, and shopping. We also had a late flight and the hotel was happy to hold our bags after we checked out. Bad points: the size of the room and the bathroom - they were quite small, but even so my SO and I still found the room to be very comfortable. The hotel only has two elevators and one was being serviced during our stay so there was often a wait. That's not something the hotel can really help, but it was still a minor annoyance. Our room also did not have a refrigerator which was rather inconvenient. We were disappointed that they don't offer free wireless internet - it cost $10 a day. They do, however, have a computer with internet access in the lobby that guests are free to use. Overall we were very satisfied customers and would stay there again.

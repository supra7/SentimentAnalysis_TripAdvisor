We stayed at the hotel a few days ago and we had a very good experience overall! The personnel are very polite and helpful. A couple of months ago when I was searching for a hotel to stay in Istanbul I came in contact with the hotel to ask some questions about internet access etc and they were very helpful, answering me straight away. We also received a free upgrade for a Bosphorus view room which was one of the most positive parts of our stay! The restaurant is indeed very good, although Istanbul has many good places for food I would recommend for someone to have dinner in the restaurant once during their stay. Breakfast was fine, it lasts until 10.30 strictly (after that in about 5-10 minutes everything is gone!). The only negative experience we had, was that our room had a bad smell sometimes coming from the bathroom. I had not contacted the management about this as by the time we came back at the room the first time we were very tired to short this out and then the next time that happened was during our last night and we left the next day. I am not sure if they could do much though as the smell was coming from the sewage. The ventilation was not working. The room was contemporary decorated and the bathroom had a lovely marble finishing. And just a tip for the management which may be looked at, the pillows were either very big (I believe these were the decorative pillows) or very small (the actual sleeping pillows), none was very convenient. The hotel is located close to the metro station and close to restaurants & shops. Internet access is fast in the lobby & restaurant. There is free internet access in the rooms but as we were on the 7th floor the signal was not strong. As previously said all hotel personnel was very polite and helpful. We had some drinks and the waiter was very polite and the front office staff were arranging our excursion or giving us tips whenever we needed them!

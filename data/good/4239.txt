This is a beautiful hotel and exquisitely pretty... the pools are nice and the kids really enjoyed the waterfalls....the lobby is a pleasure to walk into....Rooms are ok ...ours faced the ocean and had a very pretty view... was worth paying extra for.... Swan restaurant is great for breakfast... serenely pretty with the swans ...good choices for food.... In room dining is really bad... small portions...very expensive and bad quality.... Pool side dining is ok.. i guess....nice portion and decent prices.....if you don't want to go out and rest by the pool it is not a bad idea..... The SPA is nice ...went for deep tissue massage... expensive and the staff could have been friendlier .... Staff needs to learn to be nicer.....the business center people are out right rude...not helpful at all

We spent two nights at the Vintage Park during a recent trip to Seattle and the San Juans. Our room was very comfortable, clean and fairly quiet. There was some early morning trash pickup noise from the alley, but it was short-lived and no more that could be expected in any downtown location. The staff was friendly and helpful and we had an excellent dinner at the in-house restaurant Tulio. Although complimentary morning coffee service in the lobby is a nice touch, an in-room coffee maker would have been preferable.

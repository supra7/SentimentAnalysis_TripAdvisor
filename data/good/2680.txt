I stayed here a couple of nights after attending a conference. The hotel was right across the street from the conference hotel and right in the middle of a bunch of shopping and restauants. It was an easy walk to the market and Westlake station. (I rode in on the light rail.) The room was comfortable and modest. It was very clean I loved the soft bed. The flat screen tv was great. Downstairs in the lobby there are 2 computers with internet access you can use or bring your laptop down for free internet access. Staff was helpful with directions. I would definetely stay there again.

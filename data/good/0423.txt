We live in Victoria, BC and arranged a "Clipper Vacation" - taking the Clipper from Victoria to Seattle. I'm not sure which hotels are partnered with the Clipper. We stayed at the Crowne Plaza. It was clean, up-to-date decor, friendly staff. The room was lovely - a king sized bed, and we had the option of staying on a delegated "quiet floor". There was a fitness room with good equipment, and also a "business room" with two computers. The only way this hotel could have been better would be if they had a pool. (this is why i gave location & value only 4 out of 5 - If it had a pool, everything would have been 5/5) I was really disappointed as I had brought a swimsuit & was really looking forward to a relaxing swim. Other than that, yes, it is a good hotel.

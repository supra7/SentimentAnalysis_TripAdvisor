The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is right in downtown and centrally located so that you can easily get to the most popular attractions, restaurants, and shopping, either by foot, taxi, bus, or monorail. Also, depending on where you stay in the hotel, there is a great view of the Space Needle. We found the hotel to be very clean....very clean. The bedding was all white and luxurious and the room was spacious. Floor to ceiling windows the width of the room were nice too. The downside of the hotel is the servce. It was really lacking. We weremissing things in our room that we should have had and had to call for each one. The tv and remote were hard to figure out and there were no directions or channel listings in our room which was annoying. We didn't have coffee supplies the first morning even though they were to come standard. Also, the swimming pool was NOT heated....in Seattle! It was absolutely freezing and unacceptable in my opinion. It was all little things, but it added up. Overall, for the price I go (which was great!) I would stay again. But I wouldn't stay if I had to pay more than I paid.

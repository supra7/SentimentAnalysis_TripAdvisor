This was my first stay in a W, but I understand most of them are pretty dark. I only stayed one night so I cna't say much about it. The fitness center was great. The business center was lacking, but it got the job done. There is no parking, so you'll have to shell out about $20 for overnight parking nearby. The city views are nice.

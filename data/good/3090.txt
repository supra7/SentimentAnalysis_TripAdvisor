My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night prior to taking an early morning flight back to Washington, DC. We arrived late on a Sunday evening, after traveling from Vancouver Island where we'd been staying, but the bar was still serving the full dinner menu even thugh the restaurant was closed. We just had sandwiches, but the food was good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant. The hotel isn't fancy, but it met our needs for a clean, affordable place to stay. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The only problem we had was that all the numbers were worn off the buttons on the TV remote, and it was challenging to figure out how the TV worked without them. The hotel is within walking distance of the airport, but we took the shuttle because it was pouring rain the next morning. They told us that the shuttle runs every half hour, but it was running more frequently than that when we left due to the demand. We booked at the non-refundable rate on the website, and the price was very reasonable. I was concerned that it might be noisy, but we really didn't hear planes once we were settled in.

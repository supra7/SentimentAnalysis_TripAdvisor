My favorite hotel so far! We stayed at a slightly "fancier" hotel in Oahu so when we first checked in I thought KBH was roughing it, but after the first day I realized it was so much better than the big bells-and-whistles hotels. The vibe here is quiet and chill, they have a gorgeous courtyard of grass and trees and a pool. We usually hung by the pool where there is both shade and sun and lots of little birds and plumeria, and walked the 50 feet to the ocean to play in the waves. The KBH is located near the end of a strip of about 5 hotels, and there is a boardwalk that you can walk up and down and visit the different restaurants and shopping and most of all jump in the other hotel pools ;). Everyone is generally really cool and happy and it was always great to walk back to the most chill of all hotels and hang by our pool. We took a surfing lesson that you can sign up for at the KBH towel cabana and the instructor was awesome (Patrick)! Cool and not pretensious at all. Everyone we talked to (staff) was so genuine and nice. I highly recommend this Hawaii experience.

I could never afford the $250 pricetag they wanted, but a 3rd party site helped me get down to $100 a night. But, the parking is ridiculous: $18 a day for self park and $22 for valet. If you self park, it's a hike to get back to your room. What did I actually like? The beds were comfortable and the hotel on the whole is very well-kept. The gym was the highlight for me. Individual tv screens for each cardio machine! They had weights and stability balls, with a scale. One night they couldn't get the doors to open, and I was desperate to work out. They graciously called my room as soon as the problem was fixed, so that was a very nice gesture. What I didn't like? The parking rates are too high, daily internet charges are ridiculous, the restaurant, Spencer's, is exceedingly expensive but was good food. This hotel is not worth the $250-$300 a night pricetag.

Internet accessis $13.95 or 19.95 per day. Fitness Center is $15 per day. Room service is hit or miss. Skip the spherical pancakes, but the Farmer's soup was amazing. Really disappointed by the lack of details (non working coffee maker, houskeeper failed to change the ice bucket, non-organic fruit in fitness center). Here's a tip to hotel management, if I am willing to spen $15 to workout, then I'm not eating pesticide ridden fruit. Just a thought. Room is gorgeous and spacious. Views of the bay are nice. Location is perfect - close to everything, but quiet. I would stay here again, but I prefer to be charged the right price and have the amenities included in my stay. Less annoying.

I was looking for a hotel with a good location, but didn't want to spend $350+ a night. I booked last minute and found a room at this hotel. Very contemporary, with just enough lighting in lobby and bar areas, and with a good flow. The building is old, but the rooms are very refreshing with comforting earth tones and very quiet as well. I never heard noise from other rooms while I was there, and hall noise was at a minimum. The bathrooms are really the only thing that are not as updated, with a small and low to the ground toilet, although little touches like a small dimmable lamp and seperate "his and hers" shower heads are great. The $60 oxygen bottle, an option like a water bottle "to revitalize you" is purely ridiculous, as is the extra small Voss water by the bed. So, like W, it is modern, hip, and a great location, and can be had at a reasonable price. But W hotels are understaffed with jaded 20 year olds, all the halls are unforgivingly dark, and the Voss water is $10 (but it comes in the glass bottle.) So there the comparison ends. Hotel Andra is what W Hotels should be. Period. So what was bad? The valet lot must be a city away as it routinely took 10 - 15 minutes to get the car. $35 a night for that honor didn't help. The restaurant (Lola) was very hip and very Greek; I wish there had been a couple more Americanized appetizers for when I just wanted a snack. But thats just my taste. The crowd in the restaurant was mostly walk ins, so they are doing something right. Overall an excellent, excellent choice in this price range. I felt like I was coming back to a cool apartment, and not a hotel room. And that was a great feeling.

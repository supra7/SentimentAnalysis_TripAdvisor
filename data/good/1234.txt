Just got back from the Sheraton Seattle . I was a little nervous because I am normally a Hyatt, Hilton person, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my stay. I went there for a pleasure trip with teen daughters. Its across the street from their fav. places to shop, H&M, American Eagle, American Apparel,Levis. Down the block in any direction were other fab places to shop as well. Its across from a big Cinema , walking to several nice restaurants. The lobby is huge, with lots of sitting areas, a cafe of sorts, and a place to print out your boarding passes for free. Our room was nice, 19th floor , great view of course. The rooms seemed to be quiet, usually I am very bothered by noises, but maybe I just had quiet neighbors this trip. They do charge for every little thing however, water, snacks, internet 10.95 per nite! Free in the lobby though..... I enjoyed my stay overall.

we stayed in L100, 2 bedroom. It had lots of space, and was very clean. the kithcen was loaded with all essentials needed. the only down side there was a bar close for drinks at night and the cabana wasn't open later in the day to watch the sun set. All in all i would recommend Maui Eldorado to families. Cleaning daily, towels were there on request and front desk was always pleasant and helpful.

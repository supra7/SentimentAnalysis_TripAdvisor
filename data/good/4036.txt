I booked two "resort view" rooms at the Maui Hyatt for the week of Jan 7-14, 2012. Upon check in I was assigned room #1404 and room #1502. I expected both rooms to have views of the interior courtyard, or nearby golf course, or even a parking lot. #1502 was okay. But, look at #1404! I complained and the Hyatt did give me a new room the following afternoon - room #1704. Overall, the Hyatt is a lovely property. It is located at the quiet end of Ka'anapali Beach, has a great pool for kids, fantastic gym and very fresh seafood at the Sushi restaurant. I would stay there again, but only if I got an ocean view room.

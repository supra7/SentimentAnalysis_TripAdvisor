The Roosevelt is in a great downtown Seattle location; close to the Pike Place Market, Convention Centre, Paramount Theatre, Stadiums, Nordstrom's & I5. Yes the bathrooms are smallish, but so what? Only a problem if you plan on sleeping in the tub. Nice bed, large flat screen TV, fitness centre & Von's restaurant at street level which has a great Happy Hour. Pets are allowed (we took our dog long). All-in-all an excellent value.

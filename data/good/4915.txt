The rooms were a decent size and very clean with a nice kitchen. The staff was fantastic - very polite and welcoming. Location is ok - a block and a half away from green line metro, close to McGill Ghetto and about a 25 minute walk to Old Montreal. The 24 store grocery store next door is nasty, use it only in emergency. We stocked up at a regular supermarket a few doors down towards rue Sherbrook instead. The only real negative is the 5-day a week construction across the street with noise starting at 7 am, so try to ask for the rear facing room. Chez Cora breakfast place downstairs is at best average and overpriced but fun for small children - the menu has pictures and food comes beautifully decorated with fruit. Chez Gaultier a copule of doors down has better prix-fixe breakfast for the same amount of money. There's a fun (and expensive) wine bar called Pullman across the street for a late drink - check out the huge chandelier made of wine glasses. Interesting little fact - if you buy a day pass for Metro it expires at exactly same time as time of purchase next day as opposed to midnight of same day. So if you plan right, you can save some $.

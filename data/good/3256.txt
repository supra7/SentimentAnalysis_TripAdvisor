My husband and I stayed at Secrets Maroma for 5 nights in the middle of March. We had a great vacation. The resort is relatively close to the airport so the ride was quick. We had arranged for transportation with Amstar, which Secrets recommends, and they were quick and accomodating. The resort is super clean (even the bathrooms near the pool and beach had no sand, floors always spotless, and clean towels available at the sink). The room we had was spacious, great view. We loved the lounge bed on the balcony, the bed was comfy. Minibar was always stocked. The only weird thing I didn't like about the room was that the bathroom area was not completely closed off from the room...and the door to the toilet area didn't have a handle but an open hole instead. There was a huge variety of restaurants and if you didn't want to leave the room, 24 hour room service available to you - and it came pretty quickly and privately too if you wish (through the "secret box"). Food was good - we loved the Bordeaux the best. I didn't think the breakfast buffet was anything special though. The entire staff was SUPER friendly - saying hello, thanking you every second, great service at the restaurants. They really wanted you drinking at this resort! I was really thirsty from being in the sun at the beach one day and at lunch kept asking for water, (which they brought) but kept insisting - "Have a drink!" and listing all their popular drinks. We were there for my birthday and my husband had them arrange a small surprise in our room while we were at dinner - balloons and a dessert waiting for us. The pool and beach were both great - nice comfortable chairs, always found a spot no problem. The computers in the business center were slow and I thought it was kind of annoying you had to pay for wifi in the lobby (not clearly specified in their website). All in all, a wonderful place to stay - highly recommended.

I stayed at the Mayflower Park during a convention this past week. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous; refined, yet not stuffy. I initially chose the property as it was one of the more reasonable options for my group. We were not disappointed; even the smaller rooms were comfortable and well appointed. The only complaint that I heard was that even though the beds were comfortable, some would have liked fuller pillows. The fitness room is a converted hotel room, so don't expect much. The best part of my stay was the hotel that adjoins the hotel - Andaluca has the best roasted mussels dish I have ever had!

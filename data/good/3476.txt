TIPS FOR TRAVELERS 1. Swim-out suites..worth it! We spent more time in our "own" pool. FYI They don't connect to the main pool which is just as well. 2. Lobby cookies...YUM! 3. Make sure to tip...but only for exceptional service. 4. Skip the entertainment/shows...we felt sooo bad for the ventriloquist. 5. Don't be afraid to ask or even to follow up on your request. TIPS FOR SECRETS MAROMA RESORT 1. Personal floats for all swim-out rooms. 2. Hide the cookie recipe...YUM! 3. Seal up the rooms or get bug zappers. 4. Awesome beach, keep up the cleanliness. 5. Hotel transportation to popular locales would be nice. 6. Focus on consistency and small guest requests!

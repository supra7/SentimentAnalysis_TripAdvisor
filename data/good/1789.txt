Excellent stay in cozy, beautiful room. Perfect bed, pillows and I loved the fireplace and beautifully decorated bathroom with a claw-foot tub and full glass shower. Only complaint was that we reserved over a month in advance for dinner as well, but left due to noise from the bar, but the staff set us up with reservations elsewhere. Only other issue was that someone was in our room when we tried to open the door. A manager didn't inform the front desk they were staying there evidentally. Aside from that, the view, the room and staff were all excellent. i can't wait to go again :)

We had the best time here on our honeymoon! The breakfast buffet was delicious - i agree with some others that the selection can get old from day to day, but i still enjoyed it every day. The wait staff were always helpful and very pleasant. A walk to whalers village was def nice throughout the trip as it was only about 3 minutes on the walking trail.. The room was very spacious and comfortable - sleeping with the slider open to hear the waves was amazing! The beach was NEVER crowded and neither was the pool, there was always a place to put your things - you didn't have to get up early and reseve chairs. The food at the tiki terrace was great - although their selection was not huge, what they did make was very good! Our goodbye ceremony was a nice touch and the the lei bead program is a great bonus as i would love to imagine i will be back again someday :)

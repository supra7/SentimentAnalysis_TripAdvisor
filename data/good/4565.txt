This was our fourth time staying at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel over the past 4 years. We return for several reasons. The staff is very friendly, from valet, check-in, housekeeping and wait help. They always say hello, good-morning, or aloha. A little really does go a long way here. Also, the location really is great for going to the beach or shopping at Whaler's village mall. The Mall is within walking distance, so it's a good place to browse, shop for trinkets, or get necessities at the ABC store. The room are not luxury however. They give you everything you need, but they are dated. While there, we noticed that they are renovating by floor, so in a few months time, it may be different. Our room was ocean view and faced directly toward the ocean in front of Kaanapali beach. We spent the majority of our time on the beach, under umbrellas or in the water. The location is perfect if your idea of relaxing is gazing out into the pacific from dawn till dusk. The most perfect sunsets! This is a great value hotel with a great location and friendly staff. The food at the hotel is pricey as with any hotel, so I would recommend eating outside of the hotel. Malo, near Lahaina, is a great place for breakfast right on the water. Enjoy the pacific ocean at this "most Hawaiian" hotel.

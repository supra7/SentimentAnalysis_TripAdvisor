This is a great hotel and we would definitely stay again but there are two areas of criticism. The carpet is visibly stained in every hallway we entered including the club floor- looks absolutely awful. We had drinks in club lounge each night and each time there was only one poor person trying to serve everyone and cleanup- this basically meant tables were left dirty for more than an hour and food was not replenished. Aside from these two comments we found everything else fabulous and will be back. Such a shame about the carpets as it really lets down the look of what is elsewhere a lovely hotel

The Westin is a nice hotel. Very centrally located to the major tourist attractions in Seattle. The studio sized room was a good size- a bit larger than studios usually are. Front desk check-in was slow. Room was equipped with all basic amenities. The elevators were very fast as well. Tip: Park elsewhere, not in the Westin parking lot, because the rates are extremely high. (40 dollars for one night of parking).

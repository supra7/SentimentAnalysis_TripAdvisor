I almost didnt book the Inn based on reviews here, but I am glad I did. The location alone is worth the cost of the room. It is in the heart of Lower Queen Anne with plenty of choices for food, drink and entertainment all within less than a 5 minute walk. Of course as with any big city, there are street people around and if that bothers you I suggest only staying in the suburbs or staying home. I always felt safe and comfortable. Many families and europeans were staying here during my stay as well as a few retirees. The rooms are rather basic, they could probably be remodeled and it would make a huge difference but for a 100 year old building designed for retired clergy its all ok. The bed was decent, not great, didnt hurt my back. There was a small kitchenette and a large closet. The bathroom was tiny and there was no place to set your toiletries except the toilet. The tv worked and there was a small a/c unit for the three days a year it gets hot in Seattle. You have to pay for parking or park on the street and get up early to feed the meter. All in all I would defininitely stay here again. The hotel is very European in that it is old, small, basic and full of character. If you require sparkling fixtures and everything brand new, you should probably stay elsewhere. If you love the city and everything the urban landscape has to offer, you would be foolish to stay elsewhere.

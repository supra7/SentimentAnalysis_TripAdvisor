We really enjoyed our stay here! It is a huge hotel and is right next to a conference centre, so there are lots of people milling around from the conference - however the views are lovely and the surrounding area is delightful to walk around and you are so near to the gaslamp area to walk in and get a good meal very easily and without parking. Also the beautiful Coronado Island is very near and has a fabulous beach! The staff were very nice and the pool area was lovely -not sure why they need loud thumping music round the pool though - but every hotel we stayed in on the West coast seemed to do the same so maybe thats a Californian thing!!

Loved the decor, amenities, and sleek bar/lounge on the first floor. The sexy fries are to-die-for. The rooms are spacious. We got a complimentary upgrade, so we had a giant sofa in the room that can easily sleep another person. It was nice to be able to hangout in your own hotel bar/lounge after a long day of walking!

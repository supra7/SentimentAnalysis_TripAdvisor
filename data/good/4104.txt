We stayed here for half of our honeymoon (the other half at the Fairmont on the Big Island). I can't say enough great things about the staff here- they really took care of us and made us feel welcome. They blew the Fairmont staff away. We had a great ocean view room- small, but with a view like that, I can't complain! Only downside (and reason for 4 stars instead of 5)- the pool area was extremely crowded and it was often hard to find a chair- especially in the shade. The water slide was also closed when we were there. We would definitely return!

Seven of us stayed here for New Year. Although the rooms were incorrectly assigned (twins/doubles) this was rectified on arrival. The only soap provided is in dispensers, no shampoo, but the rooms are clean and very comfortable. Both U & S stations are easily accessible on foot and the bus stop by the front door covers useful routes. The female staff were friendly and helpful. The male staff couldn't even be bothered to turn the lights on in the bar area when asked, and provided slow, dismissive service. All in all, a good place to stay but use local bars and cafes.

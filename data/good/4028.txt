This is a real five star hotel, except for the somewhat uncomfortably firm beds. Located at a strategic spot on Kaanapali Beach, it's within walking distance of good restaurants at Whaler's Village. Morning walks on the beach were fun. We included breakfast in our reservation (served in Son'z al fresco overlooking a pond), which was copious, excellent and convenient. Having a car made Lahaina easily accessible for other dining choices (and self parking is free).

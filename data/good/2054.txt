We did a priceline for this hotel, and was happy with the price accepted. Four star (according to priceline) for $111.07 including all taxes. Unfortunately, the guy checking us in was unhappy with this, kept making comments like - well, you got this as a priceline, so you'll get what I give you. I only wanted a king size bed, I didn't care about the view or anything else! He was able to give us that - the hotel obviously was not fully booked so not sure what the big deal was. The parking at the hotel is outragous! Dont' park there unless you have money to spare,. It's $39 for valet, $37 if you self park. There is a garage connected next door that only charges $18 if you stay at the hotel. There is also a walkway from the hotel to get you there, very easy! The bed was very comfortable, the TV was nice and big (flat screen) Starbucks coffee and assorted teas in the room, free wireless if you bring your computer. The business center let us print off our boarding passes for our flight the next morning, but wanted to charge something like $7/HR for internet use. Easy to get to the airport, we made it in 20 min, so good location for that as well as walking to Pike Place, which is a must do! You can also pick up the monorail a block away, which we did to get to the Space Needle. It was $4 round trip per person. Worth it. I would stay here again, if I got a good price. I just started with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole priceline thing while checking in. Priceline rocks if you don't get attitude with it!

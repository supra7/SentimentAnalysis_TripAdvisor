My husband and I stayed for 4 days at Secrets Maroma- it was a much needed get away and we had a blast. I really can't say more that what is already added by everyone else, but here is my opinion of the resort. Pros- - Place is beautiful and super clean - We did the Preferred Club- got us a nice ocean view room- to us this was worth it and it really didn't cost too much extra so we were happy with our choice. - Spa is awesome and they had some good deals - The service and people who work there are amazing - everyone says hello and go above and beyond to help / serve you. Yes, we tipped, but never felt it was expected. - World Cafe has an awesome breakfast buffet and the Italian place was the best- who ever would have thought, great Italian food in Mexico? Cons- - The food. It wasn't bad, nor was it great. It just got old- we were only there for 4 days and by the end of 4 days, we were sick of seeing the same things over and over, just dressed up differently for each place to eat. I don't know how people lasted for 9 or 10 days. The meat is just different there - not what American's are used to- very fatty and just not prime cuts of meat- However, we realize we were in Mexico and rolled with it, - The steak place was BAD... again, meat not great at all. Overall, we had an awesome time- it was a great get away from every day life and stress and some great time with my husband. Am I happy we went, yes wouldn't change a thing! We had an amazing time. Would I got back again, maybe....maybe not.

We came here on our honeymoon . This was our third island and third hotel that we stayed at on our honeymoon. Overall it was great except for the fact that we paid for the full ocean view room which was pricey and when we checked in they gave us a partial ocean overlooking a roof that was being worked on. We complained and they said that they gave someone else our room. Thankfully our travel agent got everything straightened out and we were moved the next day to the room we paid for. The hotel did give us free breakfast everyday for the inconvenience. Overall my husband and I were very happy and will definetly return!

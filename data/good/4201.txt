Service is below your regular Hyatt hotel. We had many bad experiences with front desk staff, bell person, and valet. People generally seem unhappy to provide service. One person made this stay better (Jesse Kearns) solved many of our problems with front desk staff unable to comprehend basic reservation information. Staff at the regency club are so unprofessional, the person providing drinks had a stash of dollars lined up in front of her, simply asking us to tip her for doing suboptimal job. Other older lady was not attentive at all, during our 9 nights stay, she did not ask us not once if we needed any thing. Bottom line is if you used to Park Hyatt like us this is a lower end Hyatt.

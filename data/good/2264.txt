Stayed at this hotel this last weekend for a couple of nights. Upgraded to a corner king with a great view of the Seattle Public Library. Hotel is in a good location, near to 5th Ave shopping and a short (though steep) walk from Capital Hill bars and such. Really enjoyed the wine reception in the evening at the fireplace lobby. One night they had the vineyard owner there pouring the samples from his winery. Nice. At times it was a bit crowded, but met some really helpful people with great restaurant recommendations. Coffee and papers in the morning were a nice touch too. The room was wonderful. Lots of space with great amenities. We could hear the maids out in the hall and wondered if we would be woken up at night when people came in, but never heard a peep after dark.

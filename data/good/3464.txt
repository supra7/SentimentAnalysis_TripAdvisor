Great hotel and food, excellent service. It was very inconvenient, not to mention hot, to not have electricity for all of one day that we stayed there. The staff did not act like this was a big deal. We also had alot of rain when we were there and there were leaks EVERYWHERE! The lobby, restaurants, bathrooms. Basically there were leaks everywhere but in our hotel room. That was surprising for such a nice place.

We stayed here for 6 days and had a wonderful time. The hotel is right by a lovely stretch of the beach with plenty of room to be found to sit and gaze at the fabulous views across the water. The rooms are nice, clean and spacious, with good bathrooms and everything you need. The staff here are absolutely lovely and seem to really enjoy working at the hotel. It prides itself on being very Hawaiian and they do a lot for the local community, which was a big plus point for us. Everyone who works there has a vested interest in the success of the place which does mean people really care about what they are doing. The hotel is also very good value compared to some places in this area. And it is right by the Whalers village so there is easy access to shops and restaurants. Lahina (which was a lot nicer than we expected!) is a 10 min drive away.

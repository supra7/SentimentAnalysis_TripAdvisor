When we arrived we were not offered the welcome drink, but as soon as we asked for one we had our welcome drink within minutes. Asked about upgrading our room and were offered a room in building 15 instead of building 12 for an extra 50 dollars per night. Declined this as the room was no different and location only slightly better. Our room was not cleaned to a very high standard, the same 2 dead insects were there the whole 10 days we were, and for 2 days the bath wasn't cleaned. Check the "all inclusive wine" for yourselves as a previous review said the sauvignon blanc was the better of the white wines. I drank this for 2 days and then tried the chardonnay which I much preferred. As every one says the beach is lovely. The pool area's are also very nice, but the best spots do get reserved very early!!! The gardens are beatiful. Loved the Mexican resturant but did not like the french resturant. The french resturant served the meat, duck and chicken dishes all coated in the same thick brown sauce. The waiters were not very friendly here either (very professional though) Other than the french resturant the staff were all lovely. We enjoyed most of the show's, particularly the hypnotist night.

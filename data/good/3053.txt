This hotel is everything you can expect from a Hilton at this rate. The room is spacious , the bed is wonderful and the bathroom very nice. However what always annoys me is you have to pay for everything . Maybe I'm getting to used to the HI Express / Fairfield Inn's where all the services are free. But in a hotel like this it is $ 20.00 for parking ( and a 10 minute walk to the garage ! ) , $ 12.95 for internet , a great breakfast but another $ 20.00 ( excluding tips ). I have to say the quality in the breakfast is stunning , but still $ 20.00 is ridicilous. Especially nowadays. I didn't bother to check the prices in the restaurant at night... The staff was great. Frontdesk very nice people , always greeting the customers when they walk by. The belldesk helping very friendly and efficient when needed. To the people cleaning the rooms. Still , I think the hotel is overprized for the value. No hotel is worth $ 250.00 in my opinion. No matter what. I was lucky to have a better deal. But still all the extra's added up in the end. If money's no issue you can book this hotel . If it is there are cheaper options in the same area. Therefore I give it 4 out of 5 points . Since there is not much to complain on when it comes to the quality . It's just they're overprized .

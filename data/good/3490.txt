We generally tend to avoid all-inclusive resorts, mostly because we get sick of the food and overcrowded beaches. We were pleasantly surprised to find Secrets Maroma changed our expectations. We didn't feel like we were herded around, and buffets were not the norm rather there were nice restaurants where you can enjoy a meal with your partner. Enough variety was offered so we didn't get tired of the food. Premium drinks were available. Pool area is nicely designed so that many can sit by the water, with pretty views of the ocean. Poolside has more energy and ambient music. The beach is well maintained and is on the best stretch -- actually better than Maroma resort, a pricier hotel a few doors away. Excellent service at the pool and beach, with servers offering drinks, bottles of water, and occasional hors d'oeuvres. Entertainment staff are friendly and fun - offering sports and amusing activities if you are in the mood. We played beach volleyball every day. Rooms are very comfortable. We enjoyed the swim-up. It was well heated and we felt it was worth the extra money. Housekeeping service was fine, though turn-down service was sporadic. Rooms were mildew-free. We are a gay couple in our 20s/30s and found it was completely a non-issue at this resort. Our only negatives: you can hear people who are laughing/talking on the way to their rooms in the hallway at night - a minor annoyance as the resort is fairly sedate; the landscaping/foliage looks young/bare and didn't provide that much privacy to the swim-up pool; check-in process was confusing - there was inconsistency among 2 different staff as to which rooms were available. Overall we would definitely recommend this resort.

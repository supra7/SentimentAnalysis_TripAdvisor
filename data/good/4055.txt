This is our third time to stay at the Hyatt in Maui. The first time was 20 years ago when the property was nearly new . . . now, it is showing some of the signs of age, but the ambience is still quite nice. We were surprised to find that the lobby was being renovated, but found our way to the back of the building where the valet met us and we were escorted into an impossibly small, but efficient check-in area. Our room was away from any construction noise, but we did have the "benefit" of hearing the luau on the evenings it was being held. (a little drumming goes a long way). Our suite was very nice, but I would like to see the bathrooms be updated on this property. The shower/tub(s) do not match the beauty of the rest of the property. We rented a beachside cabana for our stay and that was GREAT!! It's nice to have a designated spot with "room" between you and your neighbor. There is also a tent near the ocean where I would highly recommend taking advantage of a lomi-lomi massage . . . fantastic! The pools are still in good shape, but the cave where you can either swim up to a bar or continue through to another pool is really kind of smelly . . . again, this was a great concept when we stayed here 20 years ago, but should undergo an update. We ate dinner at the buffet in the old "Swan Court" . . . this was a disappointment and I would definitely avoid. There is a "snack bar" down the way . . . it was okay, but this was another area which could use some improvement. Overall, it was a great stay. I would stay at this property again, but probably only if the children were with us. The staff were all very conscientious and the room was tidy each day when we returned.

This is a great hotel...nice and modern. The pool area is really nice as well. The view from our room (1033) was fabulous- bay and city. I am surprised a previous poster stated that the location is out of the way because it is a FANTASTIC location. Right across the street from the convention center and Petco Park, as well as the Gas Lamp District, which is a very quick walk...and I was pushing a big stroller! We walked all around Gas Lamp, and even walked to Horton Plaza easily. It is also a lovely walk along the water to Seaport Village. Another plus is that the room rates are very inexpensive. On the negative side, I agree with a previous poster that nothing here is complimentary, but perhaps that is because the room rates are really low.

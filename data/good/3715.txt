Very central location. The street is very busy and crowded. The area though is nice, there are many restaurants around ( hotel is without the restaurant). Rooms are very small, but very clean, and bathrooms are clean too. Staff very helpful. The only area for improvement is coffe served for breakfast. If one needs to go the airport I recommend ordering taxi through hotel - cost the same as taxi, but it will better car.

We just got back on Sunday and I couldn't wait to write a quick review. The KBH is wonderful. It was clean, comfortable, and convenient. Every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful. We booked a beachfront room and was upgraded to a suite. The view was spectacular (see pictures). It's not the Four Seasons, but it was still very nice. Would definately stay there again.

The Sixth Avenue Inn is a great location. James cheerfully checked us in early. We were told to make sure no valuables were visible in the car. This is an older hotel and does show some age. Our room was quite small, but had everything we needed and was very clean. It wasn't a big deal, after all, we weren't there to stay in the room. I did end up turning on the air conditioner, however, to drown out the rowdy group (Cornhuskers in for a game) staying on our floor, but we feel that was on them for being rude and not the fault of the hotel. If you are looking for a clean, nicely located and budget friendly place to stay, Sixth Avenue Inn is the place. PS- befriend them on Facebook and you're likely to get a discount from their social network director. Parking is only $15 in and out- some others we checked out charge $25-30 for parking.

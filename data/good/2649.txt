Stayed here for two nights with a couple friends. Easy walk to Pike Place and lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. Only complaint I would have was that our room smelled of bleach (at least we knew it was clean!) and we found the heater very noisy, especially at night. But overall a good hotel with friendly staff.

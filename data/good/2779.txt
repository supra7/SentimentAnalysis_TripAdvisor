We've stayed in this hotel three times in the past 2 years and overall we've been very satisfied. The stay, park & fly packages are *usually* a good deal, and their airport shuttle service is fantastic - I believe it runs every 20 mins around the clock. Great for those early morning flights, and no worries about traffic jams as Seatac Airport is right across the street. Front desk service can be a bit hit or miss, but the location, shuttle service, and stress-free park & fly service wins out. The rooms are relatively spacious, our kids love the pool, and the breakfast buffet isn't a bad deal for what you get.

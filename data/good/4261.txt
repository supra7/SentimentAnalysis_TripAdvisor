We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon last year, and we loved it. The grounds and the hotel itself are stunning. When we arrived in Maui airport we discovered that there was a Huge fire on the island, which meant that we couldn't get to our hotel for the first night! We had to stay in a shelter, which was not an ideal start to our romantic honeymoon. By the time we got to the Hyatt we just wanted luxury, and we wasn't disappointed. The staff were absolutely lovely. Welcoming us with flowers, chocolate strawberries and sparkling wine, it made up for the misfortune of our first night. The beaches there are stunning, and surprisingly quiet. The pool area is great, sometimes a bit busy but good on the whole. The lobby area of the hotel is a beautifully decorated garden. Location-wise, the hotel is a very scenic 20 minute walk from the whalers village, such a nice walk that we did it every day! On the negative side, we found the restaurants in the hotel to be average in quality and over-priced, and cocktails and other drinks can be extortionate. Having said that, the buffet breakfast is one of the best i've ever had, with a fantastic array of breakfast from all over the world. Again though, this is very expensive, we were lucky we had breakfast included in the price! Also, when we got back home, we discovered that the hotel had reimbursed us for the first night we missed without us asking, which we thought was great as it was not the hotels fault. Overall, an amazingly beautiful hotel, with excellent service, ideal for honeymoons but don't forget to bring the credit card!

We were in Seattle for a quick weekend getaway to do some shopping, see a show, and take in the holiday decorations downtown. We arrived to the hotel about 2pm and were pleased that our room was ready for check-in. Valet and check-in staff were all friendly and efficient. Hotel parking is high, $40 a night, but from previous reviews I see management is quick to point out this is the going rate for downtown hotels. Booked our room on the Kimpton website. When checking rates again before arrival rates had gone down. Kimpton reservation line quickly rebooked with new lower rate. The hotel is in a great location, a 10 minute walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do. Christmas tree in the lobby was beautiful and we enjoyed the tarot card reader and a glass of wine before dinner. We've had several stays at Kimpton hotels this year, normally we receive an email from the concierge asking if there is a special celebration or if we need help with dinner reservations, etc. before our stay which is a really nice touch. Didn't receive one from this property. Usually receive a newspaper delivered to our door in the morning, not this time, but newspapers were available downstairs in the lobby along with coffee and tea service. We received a $10 raid the honor bar coupon and a welcome note in our room at check-in which was a nice touch. Our room rate also included coupons for either two continental breaksfasts or two cocktails. We are aware that the Kimpton hotels are pet-friendly. It's never been an issue and we enjoy seeing the pups in the hotel. I was told at one time that guests with pets are assigned different rooms/floors for stays than those guests with no pets. I have pet allergies and have never had a problem before. Couldn't figure out why I was sneezing so much during the night then realized we must have been assigned a room previously occupied by guests with pets. I contacted the hotel and they're are making note in my record about pet allergies.

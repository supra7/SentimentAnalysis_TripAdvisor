Got a good deal from Hotwire -$109 for a snowy January stay. Front desk was efficient, Bell captain was eager to help at the door - "Wow, you travel light!" My room was clean, facing an alley to an office building. The room was clean, very clean in fact, for a 4* hotel. But,... you'll hear the neighbors' doors slamming shut at night and in the morning. Maybe I am such a light sleeper. The plumbing was loud too, when your neighbors take a shower, you'll hear it. Thermostat is digital and it is quiet. Went one block north and had a great dinner at Purple Cafe. The next day, had dinner at Tulio's one block east, good also. If the price is right, I would stay here again. Not sure if it is worth >$300/night though. Just my humble opinion.

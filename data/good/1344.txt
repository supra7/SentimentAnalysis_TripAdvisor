This hotel was only a few blocks from Pike's Place and the tram, so it was convenient to walk around if you wanted to stay downtown. We did not have a car since we only stayed here for one night. We took a taxi to get to the hotel from the airport (around $30). The hotel itself is nice and the rooms are comfortable.

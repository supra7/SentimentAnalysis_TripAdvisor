I stayed here for 4 nights on a business trip and really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very arty and dark in its decor. The rooms are a great size and very comfortable. Unfortunately the Wi-Fi didnt work for 3 of the 4 nights which was a real pain and when it did work it was pretty pricey. The restaurant was nice, although I only had breakfast there and the service was excellent. Its a great location to checkout Seattle.

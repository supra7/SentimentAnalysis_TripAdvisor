The Radisson is one of many chain hotels lining International Blvd., adjacent to Seatac airport. In many ways, there's not much to distinguish it from other lodgings in the area, but it has a few pluses: - It's walking distance from the airport. Literally. The pedestrian walkway from the terminal ends right at the hotel's front door. So, you could skip the wait for the shuttle and avoid cab fare. - It's fairly new, with large rooms and updated furnishings - It's got Sleep Number beds (if that's your thing) - It's quiet...you'll have no idea there's an airport next door - It's got a small, overpriced restaurant and bar...but there's a "must see" 24-hour restaurant right next door (see my review of "13 Coins") - It's got Seattle's Best coffee in the room - It offers an array of discounts (we used AAA) Service at the desk was friendly and reasonably prompt. The hotel is clean and the staff is unobtrusive. There are two Internet stations in the lobby, and free wireless access throughout the building (guest rooms and lobby). They offfer a central printing station, too -- for those early check-in boarding passes. Overall, an airport hotel that exceeds expectations and offers a competitive price in a good location.

My boyfriend and I stayed here last October. We went through a travel agent so they arranged pickup/ drop off for us at the hotel. When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and a very friendly staff. The lobby is very nice and overlooks the entire property. We have never done all inclusive before but were willing to give it a shot. The food is average. Some food is great, some is pretty bad. Have to say the french restaurant is the best place (yes better than their Mexican restaurant, we were shocked). Drinks are strong and they keep the mini bar stocked in your room at all times. They also walk around the pool and pass our appetizers before lunch which was a huge bonus. As far as the ascetics go, I have to say there was a little more concrete than I like to see. Around the rooms there was foliage but in front of the main building it was very plain. Not the lush tropical experience I hoped for. We are by no means huge partiers but this is a very tranquil place. Most couples seemed to be on their honeymoon or celebrating an anniversary. If you are looking for a more lively resort this is not your place. We found ourselves getting pretty bored of the lobby bar, and the club they claimed they had never seemed to be open. Nonetheless we kept ourselves occupied and got plenty of rest...but after 6 days we were ready to escape the quiet! The room has a great feature where you can get room service without having to open your front door. They put it in one side of a cubby and you open it on your side when you are ready, so fantastic! The rooms were gorgeous inside and the beds were very comfortable. All in all it was a good stay but I wouldn't go back as I prefer a bit more action on my vacation.

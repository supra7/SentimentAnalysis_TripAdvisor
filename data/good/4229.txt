The reviews that call for updating are right. There is a tired feel about the hotel. But the plantings and exotic birds throughout are still pretty interesting. The bed was very comfortable and the shower, while small, had a great shower head and great water pressure. The fitness center was really nice and the beach walk out front was the perfect place to watch the sunset. Only here for one night and we ate in the cascade restaurant. The poke was really good as was the balancde of our light sushi meal. But the breeze was good and the wait staff attentive so all was good.

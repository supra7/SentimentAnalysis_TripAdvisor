We went here for a conference and as a venue for conferences it was ok aside from the shoddy WIFI and the overcharging per device for internet. The hotel was a great location and easy to get into the Gaslight district. Food and drinks at the hotel were to be expected. Very good facilities and rooms, and great views. The area is clean and safe. FOX Grill was a nice place to hang out especially during happy hour. Nice pool outside but feels like an after thought.

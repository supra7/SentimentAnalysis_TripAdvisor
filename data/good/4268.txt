We stayed at the Hyatt in Maui after coming from the Hyatt in Kauai for our Honeymoon. I wrote a review to that one too if you are interested. The hotel is on Kaanapali beach. A 10 minute drive to Lahania and Front Street. Upon arrival we were escorted to the front desk. Since it also happed to be my birthday they gave us a Hawaiian style photo album. Really nice touch. The grounds are beautiful with tropical flowers and nice landscaping, birds, fish ponds, flamingoes, penguins. We got an ocean front room in the atrium tower (middle one). It was ocean front indeed. It felt like you could touch the ocean. The balconies are very small. Just enough room for 2 chairs and a small table. The beach is very narrow, in some places not even wide enough for a beach towel. I guess that's why they put a lot of money into the pool. The pool was huge. It had waterfalls, water slide, caves, pool side bar. Not actually a swim up. They had lots of chairs some with canopies so you didn't have to roast in the sun if you didn't want to. They were so close together and they were pretty full each day. They had women serve drinks and food to you chair. The breakfast which was included was similar to the breakfast at the Hyatt in Kauai. It had anything you could want. There was something there for everyone. We ate at the sushi and steak restaurant (i forget the name) for my birthday dinner. I really liked it because I like sushi and and husband won't touch it. he's a steak lover. The next night we had champagne and fruit delivered to the room. The fruit actually made me sick later in the night. I think it may have been the yogurt dip. We got a couples massage next to the beach. It was ok. I would have liked it if the huts were futher away from the people lounging by the pool. The spa in Kauai was way nicer. All in all we enjoyed out time at the Hyatt in Maui. Hey you are in Maui, what's not to like?

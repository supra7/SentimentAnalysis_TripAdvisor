I had a pleasant stay at the Ace Hotel in Seattle! The staff was super helpful and the room was clean, fresh and comfortable. A bit self-consciously hip - eames shell chairs, kaws art, etc. - but I liked it (although I have to admit, I like the look of their Portland location a bit more). I stayed in one of the standard rooms on the front of the hotel with a shared bathroom down the hall. The shared bathrooms were clean and close to my room (and having a sink and vanity in your room helps tremendously), but I think if I came back, I'd spring for a room with a private bath. The weather was great while I was there, so I was neither hot nor cold in my room, but because I was facing the street, it did get a little noisy on Friday night. With your nightly rate, you get a free breakfast downstairs in their little cafe/lounge with yogurt, toast, tea, coffee, granola, juice and fruit. Everything was fresh and plentiful. Plus there is a vending machine with a great selection of unexpected snacks like Pocky. Inexpensive parking is available and the hotel is in a great location. A unique, fun place!

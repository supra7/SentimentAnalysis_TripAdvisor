I love the fireplace in the room, which has kind of a romantic, snugly ambiance. The good sized bathroom had a cool rocky rustic look with an extra large shower area. The bar is wonderful with such great waterside views and live music on the weekends. Try the lobster mac'n cheese yum! Very walkable to many of the top sites of the city. Staff were all friendly and professional.

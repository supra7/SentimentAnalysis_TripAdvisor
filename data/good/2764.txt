This was a real bargain through Priceline and perfect for our late-night arrival the night before our cruise. Right near the airport with a free shuttle and a great concierge. Only complaint was that the room was quite far from check-in, which was a bit annoying for us wearied travelers and a challenge for a handicapped guest we saw. Not really an issue though considering the incredible rate and excellent customer service. We even enjoyed our little balcony and the nice breakfast buffet in the morning, great coffee - yum!

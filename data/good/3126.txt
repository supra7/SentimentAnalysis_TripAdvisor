Very good airporrt hotel. Comfortable bed; nice toiletries, good gym, nice pool. If you use the pool, go dressed and with a towel. There is no shower/changing room in the pool area. The breakfast was good. I had oatmeal, coffee and fruit and they only charged me for continental, not the full breakfast. They arranged a car service for me -he was reliable and came back for me at the end of the day. I had a fedex sent there, and a message was left for me that it was at the desk. It's really very close to airport entrance. The free shuttle came after I called (about 15 minutes) but you could walk it if you didn't have a lot of baggage. I have only one complaint - I could hear some road noise in the room. Very faint and I was tired and it didn't keep me awake, but I could here it when awake. There was wireless in the room, but my work laptop waws not set up to use their router. Bummer.

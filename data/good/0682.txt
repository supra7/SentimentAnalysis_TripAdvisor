I planned and coordinated a formal event at the Mayflower Park, and stayed there that night. Their restaurant and kitchen are exceptional. The evening of the event, the catering and staff impressed everyone. The following morning, eggs benedict with smoked salmon lifted any fatigue. The rooms were beautiful, relatively spacious, and well appointed - for a very reasonable (by Seattle standards) rate. I came in from out of town, and they were more than happy to accomodate my luggage until I could check in. Concierge was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to volunteer information before I needed to ask. I think an important note is that they helped us keep the event contained, so that no other guests were disturbed by the reception going on in the upper lobby. If I had been a guest at this time, this would have been even more appreciated. Certainly a quality hotel, with above average service and staff. I would definitely stay there again, given the opportunity.

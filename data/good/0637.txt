Eight family members, four rooms. Depending on which room you get, you'll love it or be really disappointed. Me and hubby got the tiniest room I've ever stayed in with an even tinier bathroom. Wow, a larger person would have difficulty getting into the shower in this bathroom as the sink blocks the shower entry. The bed was pretty comfy and our room was very quiet. The other three rooms my relative received were huge! Actually twice the size of our room with a full bath as well. The only thing is all bathrooms have a glass over the back of the sink which makes it challenging to wash your face without hitting your forehead on the glass. Strange. There is a doorman at both street entrances and they are very friendly and helpful. The front desk staff were helpful and pleasant. The lobby is lovely, we especially enjoyed the mezzanine lobby area which was like we were sitting in a living room. I tend to go for boutique type hotels and this one did not dissapoint even though our room was tiny. We all agreed that we enjoyed our stay in this lovely hotel. The Mall being "attached" to the hotel made going back and forth so easy. We also enjoyed our breakfast at Andaluca. We would definitely stay here again!

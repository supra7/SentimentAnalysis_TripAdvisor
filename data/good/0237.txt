We stayed for one night, before a cruise to Alaska leaving from Seattle. We had previously stayed at the Warwick, and this hotel did not have near the same comfort level, but was still very comfortable and within walking distance of Pikes Placed market and other downtown attractions. We will definitely stay again!

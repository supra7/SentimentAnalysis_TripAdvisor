We stayed at this hotel over the Halloween long weekend. I was travelling with my husband and two friends, we got the double queen room. The hotel was easy to find and there was parking available (15$ per day). Upon first entering the lobby I was a bit dismayed as the lobby carpeting is in terrible shape and overall it's not a great first impression. Then I went to the counter and they didn't have my Expedia reservation on file - I got a sinking feeling. However, the staff at the front desk were very helpful and he got us a room anyways. He was incredibly polite and I got the feeling they wouldn't have left us stranded. We headed up to the room and I felt much better as we stepped off the elevator - the hallways were in good shape and well maintained. The room itself was clean and nicely furnished. The beds and pillows were not great and the room was a bit cold with the heating off, but when we turned it on the room warmed right up. The bathroom was small but clean and well maintained, however the shower was absolutely impossible to turn on to a reasonable temperature. It went from too cold to burning hot with the slightest hair of a turn. My only other complaint was the hotel back faces a gentlemen's club and it was a bit noisy at night. Well to be honest I slept through the noise, but my friends complained. The restaurant was fantastic. The servers were excellent, very friendly and helpful, and the food was good. The restaurant itself is really well maintained and nicely decorated. Overall, the service, cleanliness, excellent location and cheap price brought all four of us to agree that it's a great hotel for downtown Seattle. If you are looking for something within walking distance of all of Seattle's attractions that won't break the bank, this is the place.

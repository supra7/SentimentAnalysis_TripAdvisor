Centrally located in Downtown Seattle, within 2 blocks of Pike Place Market and the light rail station for Sea-Tac, the service was friendly and helpful. Bus directions were clear and concise, and lobby staff were professional without being aloof. Shame about the lack of Wifi in-room, but the lounge (where access is available) is very pleasant to sit in. Rooms are by no means luxurious - but unless you're used to being pampered at 5-star Hilton Resorts, you'll find everything you need! Afterall, who spends that much time on holiday in their hotel room, anyway? All-in-all, an excellent stay, would recommend!

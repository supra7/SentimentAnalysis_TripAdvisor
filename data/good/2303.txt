This is a great boutique hotel located in the financial district of Seattle, just a 10 minute walk from Pike Place Market. Maybe not the best place to stay if you want to be right in the middle of the action though. Vintage Park has a great restaurant and wine tastings right in the hotel. If you want to stay in a little quieter area, but still close enough to all the excitement of Seattle, I'd definitely recommend the Vintage Park. The rooms are awesome, with really comfortable beds, a large bathroom, and beautiful decor.

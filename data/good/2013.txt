Landed a great deal through Priceline for 3 nights at the Westin Downtown Seattle. shaved over 60% off the published rate and well worth it. Service is great - location is excellent and the hotel has great views. The westin consists of two round towers so every room has floor to ceiling view of either puget sound, downtown, or the eastern part of Seattle. The bar in the lobby is friendly and reasonable. Would highly recommend this hotel - But strongly recommend that you try Priceline or other negotiation before paying published rates.

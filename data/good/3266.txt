The trip was wonderful. Can't say enough about the staff all just willing to be so helpful and friendly. Pool was perfect temperature, beach was beautiful a ltitle cool but it is Feb., food great love not having to make reservations, drinks awesome top liquor. We were in the Pref. Club it was nice. The first time we stayed here we wasn't in pref. don't think the few perks are really that important for the extra $. Would for sure go back when I can get a good deal again!

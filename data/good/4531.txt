We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for the second part of our honeymoon. Our travel agent recommended it to us because it was within our budget and in a great location. I was leary after reading many reviews, but I would stay there again. CONS: **The hotel is very much a 3 star hotel and needs to be refurbished and remodeled. **The tub did not drain and water filled to the top of the tub while showering. **Bar and dinner service at the Tiki Terrace restaurant were billed separately and were expensive. The host at the Tiki Terrace restaurant was the least pleasant person at the hotel. (He was the exception.) **The pool looked run down, had cracks, and had leaves on the bottom. (We did not swim in it.) **The bed was very hard! PROS: **Excellent location!!!! **The hotel room was very clean! The sheets, towels, etc. were worn but clean. **The beach is fabulous and very close to Black Rock. **Service at the Valet Desk and Front Desk was great and people were friendly. **The air conditioning was very cold! **The dinner at Tiki Terrace was delicious (but pricey) and you can watch the entertainment while dining. **Shows every night were not excellent quality, but were fun to watch. **Shows also ended early enough so that they did not keep you up if you were in your room. **Breakfast at the Mixed Plate was not the best ever, but good variety and quality. **The landscaping is very well maintained and very pretty. Large outdoor area to relax. **Local artists displayed their work in the lobby. **Great variety of free activities. **Lei ceremony when you leave is very heartwarming and sincere. We stayed at a nicer hotel in Honolulu before we came to Maui. Because of this, it took me a few days to adjust to the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. I will stay here again because now I know what to expect. Do not come here expecting a luxurious hotel or you will be disappointed. The people, location, and beach are great!

We stayed at the SeaTac Hilton in November during a travel layover and had a prepaid reservation. We have stayed here before, always in a prepaid room. We like the location and the hotel in general, although we are often in one of the smaller rooms on the first floor, probably because of our prepaid status. It is comfortable, clean and quiet. We usually have a meal in the bar. They have a good selection, and the prices are far lower than in the restaurant. The airport shuttle runs regularly.

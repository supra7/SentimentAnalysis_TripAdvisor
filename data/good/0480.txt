Stayed here for the weekend of July 29 - 31. Front desk staff very friendly and answered our many questions...even at 11pm at night!!! Room was well equipped with everything we needed...even an extra large walk in closet!! Hotel location was very good as it is right across the street from Seattle Center and a very short walk to the Seattle waterfront. We enjoyed our stay here very much!!!

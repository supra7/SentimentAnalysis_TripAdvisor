We stayed here over Spring Break with our 4 children ages 16,14,11 and 8. The location is great, hotel is beautiful, but if you don't go down and reserve a chair by putting your towel and stuff on it by 7:30am you won't get a chair. Everything else about the hotel was great. My kids loved the water slide and waterfall. They also loved the penguins and birds throughout the lobby. We did the star gazing tour one night which was really neat. I would recommend this hotel. We had dinner one night at the restaurant Sonz at Swan Court and it was one of our best meals. We were able to get the family rate which comes with connecting rooms, so the kids are right there and their room is about half price. You can't beat that!

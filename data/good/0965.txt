We stayed here for the long Presidents' day weekend and had a great stay. I was a little worried after some of the reviews I'd read. Lots of people complained about the workout facilities; we don't go on vacation to work out so we never went anywhere near that so I cna't comment on that. As far as the actual room goes, we requested a room on the west side away from the hotel and as high up as they could get us, and were given a room facing west on the 20th floor. It had a great view of the modern library, many of the tall downtown building and water (I don't think it's the sound, just an inlet or lake or something). We didn't hear any traffic noise up there; what we did hear (and this is something you'd hear anywhere that high up I think) is the wind on one particularly windy day. It still wasn't enough to wake us up or anything. The room was very clean and all of the staff: the front desk clerks, the bartenders, the doormen, the lovely concierges - were fantastic! The bed was very comfortable as well. I think the location was great too. It's about a 15 minute walk down to Pike market and the front desk clerk advised us to walk over to Pike on 5th so that we didn't have to deal with going up or down the massive hill that runs right by the hotel (it's not nearly as severe going down Pike). We didn't have a car, just walked everywhere and nothing seemed to terribly far away. If you do want to take a cab to Pike's Market (we were running late for a tour and had to get there quickly), the doorman will hail one for you and it's only about $6 for the trip down there. I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Seattle!

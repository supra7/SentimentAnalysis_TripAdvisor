Read all the reviews and was pleased that it was all that everyone said.. The staff was very friendly. Our room was large.. the only complaint I have (which is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) is the bathroom was tiny. There was no room to put my makeup, curling iron, really anything. There was a small shelf and no counter.. But it worked out they had a mirror in the living room area I got ready in. The location was amazing. The parking was alittle high so we found a park lot a few blocks (howell St) that was half the price. You don't need a car unless you plan on going outside of Seattle which we did for a whale watching tour. All and all a nice hotel

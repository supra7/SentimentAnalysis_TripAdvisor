The neat thing about the Hyatt is the amazing ambience.The grounds, with the tropical flora and exotic fauna, are worth a visit even if you're not staying there.The rooms themselves are nothing special, but the service is friendly, the pool areas are fun(gotta love the grotto/waterfall bar), and the beachwalk that runs up to the Sheraton is great for people-watching. Another plus is a well-maintained fitness facility that lets you enjoy ocean views while toiling on a treadmill.(If you try running on the beachwalk around sundown you will NOT be setting a personal best.)If you visit, don't forget to say hi to Spike, the resident African crowned crane - he'll try his best to peck and claw his way to your heart.

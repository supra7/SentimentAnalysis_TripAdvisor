Our room was in the new tower, facing south and thus offered an nice view of the park at 2Union Square. The room was pretty much an ordinary 'nice' hotel room: two armchairs, two queen beds, long desk/dresser. Not a lot of drawers for two people and a long stay, but adequate. Beautiful tub, stylish vanity with not a lot of counter space. Similar room in the other older tower was slightly smaller, with homey blond wood 'country' style furniture (lots of drawers), bathroom had a small tub but a large granite vanity. Hotel concierge was most helpful. Little coffee/breakfast bar (like Starbucks) great for coffee and grabbing a quick bite, but not open late. Fitness facility on the top floor with views is topnotch with 6+ top of the line treadmills and 4 or 5 stationary bikes, plus weights, mats, and other machines. Pool is a decent size. The public spaces are contemporary and spacious. Hotel location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing, right next to the Convention Centre. Pike Market is a 10-minute walk. The service in the hotel was by and large excellent. The only thing we couldn't quite wrap our head around was the "green" room cleaning concept. You are offered the option of not having your room serviced at all, for which you receive a $5 voucher which can be used in any of the hotel's eating and drinking spots. But there didn't seem to be an intermediate option of just having the maid come in and make the beds and vacuum. Mostly we got fresh towels and bed linens every day, even though we would have preferred otherwise. Three calls to the front desk could not clarify this. But that is a minor quibble. I'd be happy to go back to the Sheraton any time I was visiting Seattle.

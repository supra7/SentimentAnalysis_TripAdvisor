The beds are comfortable and staff are extremely accommodating. There are options for dinning and while the Starbucks line can be long in the morning, they are quick. I was there for a conference and the location is great for events like that (Gaslamp district, Convention Centre). If you like to run, the bayfront walkway is excellent, and even at 5am, there is lighting (which is a bit dim as you progress) however there are generally so many other people out that early, you never feel uncomfortable.

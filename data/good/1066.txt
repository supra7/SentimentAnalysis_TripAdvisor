We stayed two nights here at the end of August 2008. First impressions weren't great (the building itself looks a little long in the tooth, it's beside the main highway and the lobby is dated), but the room was large and clean, as was the bathroom. The hotel's location wasn't bad either, within easy walking distance of most downtown attractions, though the steep hill on its doorstep is tough to negotiate after an evening meal! Speaking of food, the breakfast--especially the pancakes--was good. The staff were very friendly and helpful and even offered to store our bag for three weeks while we were in Alaska.

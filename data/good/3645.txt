I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on my first visit to NYC, and I was very satisfied with the choice I had made (it had taken me quite a long time to find something decent and half-way affordable): It's location is very convenient (next to the subway station Lower East Side 2 Av, different restaurants and delis nearby), the place was really calm and quiet during my stay (though you could hear the traffic in the room that had its window facing East Houston street), the room was not huge but very clean with a fancy bathroom, the staff friendly, free wi-fi that worked, and a great view of the city from the roof. Breakfast (included) was ok (a buffet with a choice of cereals, yogurt, bagels, cheese, orange juice, coffee - you have to make do with styropore cups, plastic knives and paper plates) though the room in the basement doesn't make you feel like staying there longer than necessary. Cost: almost 600 US$ (taxes included) for 2 nights, not exactly a bargain, but apparently that's what you have to be willing to spend in NYC...

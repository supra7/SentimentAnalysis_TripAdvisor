My husband and I stayed at Hotel Max for a 30th birthday weekend away. The decor was interesting and funky. The location was awesome-we walked to the waterfront, Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, shopping, dining, and art museum. The hotel staff was very friendly, helped with directions, helped print boarding passes. We ate breakfast at the adjacent restaurant as part of our package and the service was not so hot and food was just okay. The rooms were small -think slightly larger than most European rooms. I would stay there again but upgrade to a larger room next time.

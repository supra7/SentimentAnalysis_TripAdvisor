We needed a place to crash and dry out our camping gear while we went downtown for an evening soccer game at Qwest stadium. We took the Doubletree Hotel free shuttle to the Sound Transit station just down the road, and then took the light rail to the stadium. After the game we took the light rail back to the airport, and had to wait a little while for the Hotel Shuttle which we thought ran "continuously", but eventually made it back to a very comfy bed and spacious room. It was great that the bathroom had two sinks, one with the shower and toilet, and another across from the closet. Our balcony overlooked a lake, which was a nice surprise for an area in which most hotels overlook a parking lot. Our gear and tent dried out nicely out on the balcony. Our final bill was slipped under our door before we woke up, so we just called the front desk from our room to confirm, then jumped in the car and were on our way. We also got an amazing deal using Priceline.

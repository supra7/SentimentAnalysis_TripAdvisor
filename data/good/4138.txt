We were entertaining friends & family visiting from out of town. They had decided to attend this luau in Kaanapali. It was a perfect evening. The setting was gorgeous, the entertainers were great, the food was delicious. But most of all the service was fantastic." Blythe" was our server that night and he was professional and kind. He went above and beyond to meet a need (children traveling). Thank you, BLYTHE !

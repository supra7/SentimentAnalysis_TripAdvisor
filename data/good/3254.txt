Because we have 3 teenagers, we chose to stay in two rooms, which worked out great. The price/value allowed us to do this rather than getting a suite in a larger hotel. The rooms were newly decorated and very clean. Hotel service was great, and the breakfast was reasonable to give our family a great start to each day (stayed 3 nights). I would stay here again based on our experience.

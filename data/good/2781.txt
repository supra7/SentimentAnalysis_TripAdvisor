We stayed at the Doubletree on New Year's Eve because we had to catch a flight to Cancun early in the morning. We got an amazing rate on Priceline (total 53$). We used the shuttle to get to the airport terminal where we jumped on the train to head downtown to celebrate New Year's. We also used the shuttle again in the morning to get to the airport to catch our flight. The hotel offers were yummy cookies when checking in. It is a big hotel but very clean. Definitely one of the nicer airport hotels I have stayed at.

This is an ideal property for business travellers, close to the city approximately 35 minutes on the light railway and minutes (walk) from the airport. Good Breakfast, prompt check in and out, professional and efficient concierge. Room was large and comfortable. Good wifi access in the lobby. Bar food a little expensive but quality of the food was good. Staff in general were very pleasant.

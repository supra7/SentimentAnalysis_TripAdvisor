The rooms are showing their age; but the location is great. We stayed in a corner tower room with a great view. Try to ask for one away from the elevators, or you'll find a few curious tourists looking in as they travel up the glass elevators. We had to move twice due to problems with the room (t.v. not working and recently cleaned carpet still wet). The front desk staff were exceptional and quick to include a few extras to accomodate us for the inconvenience. The food in the downstairs lounge was very good and reasonably priced. It is a very large hotel (850 rooms) so the pool was very busy; but it was still nice to have. I can't say enough about the cookies they give you when you check in. They were delicious!

Used Priceline and got 2 rooms for $55 each. Called the hotel two days before we arrived and asked for connecting rooms for our family. Got a King room and 2 Queens connecting. Very clean rooms, but on the noisier freeway side. No problems sleeping though, the beds were so comfortable- down quilts too! Some problems/concerns-$18 parking, pool locked and needed two calls to security to get it unlocked, hot tub cold with no jets,one elevator out of order for more than 24 hours. Some very helpful and respectful front desk people. Wouldn't stay here at the rack rate but for $55 it was fantastic.

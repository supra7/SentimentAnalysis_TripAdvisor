We enjoyed the KBH but it seemed like two different hotels at one time. We were in the Kauai wing - NOT renovated,and our room was somewhat down at the heels and worse for the wear. We wanted an oceanfront room, so we didn't have much choice as this is the building in which such rooms were located, but walking around the property in the evening, we saw rooms in the other wings that clearly had been renovated and looked much, much better than our room - completely different. (But I still wouldn't trade my beachfront patio). Also, we never received any turn down service with cookies and flowers, have no idea what the other writers were talking about. All that having been said, the people were friendly, the location can't be beat, and if you spend too much time in your room when you are in Maui, well, you don't know what you are missing. But I would insist on a renovated room.

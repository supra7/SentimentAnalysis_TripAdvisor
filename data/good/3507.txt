The resort is very nice, the food is as good as any all-inclusive and as mentioned before the service is outstanding. If we could voice one complaint it would be the seating in the Lobby bar--the chairs are by far the most uncomfortable we've ever found and I must say the two circular beds offered are just weird. We went armed with OFF for the mosquitos that had been mention in previous emails however in our one week stay we didn't see a single mosquito. The first day it rained rather hard and we thought there would be a problem following that but no!!! I thought the suites could have been a little more elaborate and although we paid for an oceanview the oceon was barely visable over and past the tree line.. We've stayed at Secrets Capri on several occasions and did prefer the smaller, more intimate surroundings however both are nice. Our next vacation in April will be to a Riu Palace--the jacuzzi suite is far superior to Secrets accomodation, the downside being not exclusively adult!!

Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during a business trip to Seattle. Read all the complaints about the elevator, but did not have any problems with it. Both elevators were working and were fast. Recommend the valet parking as it is reasonably priced and they bring your car very quickly. Room was charming and fairly clean - only complaint was there was a large greasy hand print on the outside of the window, which was there during my entire stay. Quiet hotel but the HVAC was very loud and made the walls/headboard vibrate when on. Had to sleep with it off. Also windows that open means poor sound insulation from the streets. Concierge and valet were very friendly. Could have used a refrigerator in the room for the left-overs from the yummy restaurants.

Pros: All the amenities expected in a Hilton property (e.g. workout center, concierge, Starbucks, etc.), good restaurant and bar, travel kiosks for airport check-in, quiet, comfortable rooms, convenient location to public transit and Seatac airport. Cons: Labyrinthine property where your room could easily be a mile from the reception desk, restaurant and bar pricey, limited places to eat within walking distance This hotel offers solid comforts away from home. My experiences here have been very favorable, and I have found the staff polite and helpful. The rooms, while not huge, are quite comfortable. Beds feature down comforters and pillows with medium firm mattresses. Each room also has a nice size flat screen T.V. One of the downsides is the sheer size of the property. The first time I stayed here it took about 10-15 minutes just to walk one way from the conference end of the building to my room. With bags you can imagine how that might be. If you have a car, parking can get pricey (i.e. $20/night), however this opens more dining and sight-seeing options for you. Without a car you are pretty limited to a few restaurants within walking distance. Also, you need to be careful walking alone, because the nearby neighborhoods (a moderately transitional area) could be a safety concern. Overall, if you need a comfortable place to stay near the airport with all the amenities of a mid-tier hotel, this is a sure bet.

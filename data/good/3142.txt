Nice hotel with very clean and updated design. Nice and clean. Very good value for the money. Is placed in a slightly rough neighborhood where I did not feel 100% comfortable. There are though nice buses that stops very close. Easy access to metro as well. First time ever I got a course in the reception on how to open the look. It was actually needed ;-)

This Westin is like many others: round towers. My room had a view of the opposite tower, so I was disappointed that I didn't have anything to look at and I needed to keep my curtains closed for privacy. The room was furnished nicely but in an impersonal way. The bed was comfortable, all westin beds are. Shower had some water pressure issues. Also getting an elevator in the tower was a challenge. I'd stay here again, but I think it's overpriced. There are smaller hotels with nicer accomodationd nearby for less price. This hotel is very very large, so I felt lost in the crowd.

We stayed here when I took my husband to a piano bar for his birthday, and the hotel is in a great location in the middle of downtown. The room was a little tight, but the hotel is decorated in a cool, modern style and the staff were very friendly. It was also very quiet and clean, Great price, we would stay again if needing a place to stay overnight downtown. Also, redfin sushi is downstairs and they are amazing!

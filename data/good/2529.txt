We enjoyed our weeknight stay, on an overnight trip to Seattle from Portland. I was especially interested in the hotel's original Northwest art collection. The decor and interior design overall were distinctive and welcoming. The staff was friendly and helpful. And Red Fin the sushi, etc. restaurant adjacent was very good. The room we stayed in was on the 10th floor, with windows on two corners. The views and overall appearance of the room were great. To our surprise, the internet access was not free. The bathroom layout was very cramped, but generally functional. Our primary disappointment was how cold the room was. The December outdoor temperatures were in the 20s and 30s, and the room felt not much warmer than that when we arrived. The windows appeared to not have double panes, and minimal weather stripping, so drafts were very evident. The only heating unit struggled to warm the space, and never fully succeeded. Happily, the duvet on the bed was warm, so sleep wasn't too cold. My husband and I are in our 30s and generally like a cool climate, but this room was a shocker. I would likely go back, preferably in warmer weather, and would request the heat be turned on before I arrived if it's a winter visit.

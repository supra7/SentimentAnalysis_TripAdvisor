I was on the west coast for business and had my wife fly out to Seattle for the weekend. At the last moment I decided that to stay out by Sea-tac where my company travel person had booked me would be crazy if we wanted to do touristy stuff so I went on Priceline, bid really low and had it accepted by this property. After I read the reviews here, I was worried that I was going to be in a bit of a dump but was very pleasantly surprised. I called and asked for a king room on the opposite side from the highway. The staff were very helpful, honored my request and allowed us to check in before noon at no extra cost. The room was one of the nicest I have stayed in for a long time. It was decorated in what I now call thew "Zen" style with lots of wood and a huge flat TV which we never did turn on. Towels were large and high quality and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. This is not the place to stay if you don't like walking. We do so it was not a problem for us. You can walk straight down Madison to the ferry but it is a steep climb back up. To go to other sites, cut across on 5th Avenue. The gradient is gradual all the way to Seattle Center. Just go down any of the cross streets to get to your destination. I would recommend this hotel.

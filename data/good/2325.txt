My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park on the evening of March 18th. We booked a King Premiere room directly through the Kimpton Hotel website for a rate of $155 +tax. We were able to check-in early, around noon, and we were also given a late checkout of 2PM the next day. This was our first night being away from our 14th month old little boy, so we were a bit nervous, but the staff took great care of us. The valets were very pleasant, as was the bellhop. The front desk ladies were nice in both demeanor and appearance. We attended the complimentary wine tasting that evening in the lobby and were treated to a couple of glasses of a nice local cabernet. The overall appearance of the room was pleasant. The bed linens did seem a bit worn and/or threadbare, but overall decent. I will say that the king size bed was not very comfortable and it wasn't a pillow top. The bathroom was small but functional, although my wife did not care for the faucet handles, she thought they were difficult to operate when her hands were wet. Standard TV set-up with pay-per-view movies, including the usual 'adult' selections. We were in the corner room on the 10th floor, room 1004. So we had a great view down Seneca to Elliot Bay. The ice machine is outside this room, but we never heard any other guests the entire time we were in the room. For the price, this is a nice place to stay. We would stay there again.

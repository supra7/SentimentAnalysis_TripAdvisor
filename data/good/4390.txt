We stayed at Kaanapali Beach hotel early Januaury 2011. It is an older hotel, slightly outdated, but the rooms are clean and serve the purpose. The location is unbeatable. Centered right in between Whalers Village and Black Rock on a pristine stretch of Kaanapali Beach, this is the ideal location. We enjoyed our trip so much last year that we are returning to Kaanapali beach Hotel again this year.

We had a really good experience staying in this hotel. We recommend it to everybody. Near to all facilities, tourist attractions and shopping in Seattle. Personnel at front desk very kind, helpful and welcoming. We stayed in this hotel for 2 days (July, 11-13) and we really appreciated our time there. Our room was big enough for 4 people.

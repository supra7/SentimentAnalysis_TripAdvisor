I travel to Seattle often for business and this hotel is a very good value. I use the Starwood website to get a consistent rate. The front desk is nice enough to upgrade me when possible. The hotel is in a good location for getting around the city. The rooms are large, the restaurant is good for breakfast, and I cannot complain.

We booked this hotel for attending U2 concert. It was the second time we stayed at W Seattle. The hotel is still living up to our expectations. I loved its bathroom, very spacious. The concierge lady was very friendly and helpful. We read previous reviews about parking at W Seattle. When we arrived, the hotel parking was full. Luckily, a public parking lot/building was right next door at $31 per day (tax included). So, if the parking at W was really $45, we saved $14 bucks and the parking was right beside W.

This hotel is the best value of all hotels on this stretch of beach. The location is perfect. Great snorkeling just minutes away at Black Rock. Sunsets are fantastic. Lahaina is just three miles south for shopping and funky eats. There are good restaurants at this and nearby hotels. We drove to Hana for the day, not to be missed. The Ka'anapali area is the best area to stay in on Maui. It's all about location.

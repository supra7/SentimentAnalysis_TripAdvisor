We checked in late evening for 3 rooms. They gave us a really good price. We had checked Travelodge next door just prior to coming here. Quality Inn beat Travelodge's price's by about $15 per room. Quality Inn also offered free parking whereas Travelodge wanted to charge us $12 to park our car. Parking is a little tight at Quality Inn but we did find a space. If you walk out to the end of the hotel lot you can see the Space Needle. The girls at the front desk were very courteous and helpful in helping us find a restauant at a late hour. We flew out of Seattle early the next morning so I cant speak for their room service or breakfast. Overall it seemed like a clean comfortable hotel at good value!

We stayed here before a cruise in 2 rooms, 4 adults. Ages from 30's to 60's. Excellent location for cruiser's, you can walk right to pier 67. Lobby and rooms are more "forest lodge" decor while lounge and restaurant are very modern and interesting. Views from the lounge are great as you are right over the water. For those that suffer from "mal de mar" it could be a problem, but then it's a good precurser for your cruise. Rooms are small with fireplaces and some have city view which are fine but not very scenic. Bathrooms are tiny but fully equipped and stylish.Nice amenities in bathrooms. Very clean, neat rooms. Service was friendly if not always accurate with information. It's a long uphill walk to restaurants and shopping. Seattle has good transportation system though. Be sure to visit the flight museum outside the city.

Never stayed at one before, usually at higher end places, but needed a passport quick and San Fran office unable to accommodate , given choice of Denver or Seattle , love seafood so no brainer, this place has free wireless Internet, sleep comfort beds, nice breakfast buffet not free but Internet- buffet? Take Internet-close to light rail though 35 min to downtown but cheaper than car and here's a tip buy roundtrip rail ticket and since no timestamp as a security guy told me was able to use it during the entire day.

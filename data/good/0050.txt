My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night after returning from a cruise. The hotel was conveniently located downtown, only a short walk from Pike Place Market. The Space Needle was about a mile walk, and you can take the monorail to shorten the walk. Very friendly, helpful service at the hotel, especially the bellhops. The room was nice and clean. My only complaint was the room doors which were older and noisy when people shut them, which woke me up a few times.

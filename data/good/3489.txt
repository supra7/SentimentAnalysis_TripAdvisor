We chose to stay at the resort June 7-13, 2009 for our honeymoon after extensive research of resorts in Mexico. I thought this one was perfect for us and it definitely exceeded our expectations. High points of our trip were the beautiful beach, excursions, amazing views, friendly staff, delicious lunch buffets by the beach and pool and the room service was incredible. However, the few restuarants we visited at the resort werent that great...food was much better when ordering room service. As many others have said...minimum privacy in the bathroom so be prepared (also a bad smell-not sure what thats about). Another problem was that if you dont get up early enough you dont have a good chance of getting a chair by the pool. Activities we booked were dolphin swim at delphinus (RECOMMEND THIS!) and the tulum ruins tour and xel-ha waterpark. We also took a 15-20 minute taxi ride from the resort to the strip in Playa del Carmen to go shopping which was really nice. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the resort and we would recommend it to anyone!!!

We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for a night for my daughters college family weekend. The hotel had great service, but very thin walls. We could hear every word of the conversation in the room next to us. They were going to a business meeting the next day. The lobby was nicely furnished, and the Great American Grill had decent food.

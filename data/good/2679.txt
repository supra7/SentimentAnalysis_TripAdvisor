Stayed here for a quick overnight visit to Seattle. We encountered some problem with our room being ready for us at check-in time (almost an hour after check-in time of 4), but the hotel staff was extremely apologetic and went out of their way to "fix" the situation and make sure we were satisfied. This is not a 5 star hotel as far as amenities, but the location alone makes it very worthwhile for a Seattle stay. The short walk to all shops, restaurants and Westlake stop was perfect for our short trip! The room was very small but clean. The bathroom was also tiny but had what we needed- a clean sink, toilet and shower/tub combo. Wi-Fi was free. Flat screen TV w/movie channels. AC was on the noisy side but worked well which was more important. For the rate we paid (under $150) we found it to be well worth the value and would stay here again for the same price.

Stayed 3 nights here while in Mayaguez to see the Caribbean Series baseball games. Hotel is adequate and inexpensive. Rooms are very clean, with a small television (high on the wall). Beds are on the "very firm" side, and because the hotel was full, showers during peak morning hours only reached "lukewarm". We had to ask for a hand towel and washcloth. Maids were extremely friendly; we didn't encounter the rude woman that an earlier reviewer noted. There are no elevators, so be prepared to carry your luggage up stairs, or request a ground floor room. We were in room 21, and oddly, there are shuttered windows in the room that open to the lobby. So several mornings we were awakened to people conversing in the lobby. Ask for a room that doesn't have that. Not the place to stay if you're used to resorts or high-end accommodations, but if you like "unique", you're comfortable in hostels, B & Bs, etc. , and you like to support local busineses, then you'll be happy here. There is secured parking out back and the front desk folks spoke English and were helpful. Within walking distance are a nice plaza with historical buildings and many unique restaurants.

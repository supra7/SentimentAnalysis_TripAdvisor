A great location and can be a great view. The hotel could use some carpet updating but the furniture in the rooms is exceptional (very comfortable king size bed). We loved sitting out on the balcony overlooking the water until Friday when the cruise ship docked, so when you check in you may want to make sure there are no cruise ships scheduled into port. We were leaving Friday so it wasn't too bad! I would definitely reccommed the Edgewater but try and book your room as close to the check in area for the best view.

We stayed in one of the rooms at the back of the hotel for 3 nights in September. We had a really nice stay - the rooms are nice, modern clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel isn't in the thick of the action, but the transport links locally are amazing and therefore this didn't matter one bit. Having a quiet room is really important to us, and we didn't hear other guests at all during our stay. We were at the back of the hotel, and could hear the busy road at the front at busy times, but it didn't disturb at all, and I'm the type of person who notices! If you prefer your room to be quiet, I'd highly recommend going for one of the rooms at the back, as the hotel is on a fairly busy road. Reception staff were great - very helpful and no complaints there at all. We gave breakfast a miss because we didn't think we could justify the cost of it, so couldn't comment on that. Again, we were so close to places we could get breakfast, it didn't matter. The only other small negative thing I noticed is something another traveller pointed out in her review about a slight smell in the bathroom. But that would be being very fussy as it was barely noticeable. In terms of a more general travel tip, we'd highly recommend buying a Welcome Card/ or the Daily ticket which allows you to use the trains, buses etc on an unlimited basis for the duration of your ticket. We saved a lot of money and saw Berlin for ourselves at the same time, rather than organised tours etc! In summary, great hotel and enjoyable stay.

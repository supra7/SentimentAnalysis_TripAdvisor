I took a weekend trip with my infant son and mother to Seattle and enjoyed the central location of the Sheraton for shopping and fine dining. Our request for a room on a high floor was taken care of, as was the availability of a crib. The lobby is beautiful with modern furniture and lighting, along with many beautiful orange flowers. The hotel bar was cozy and comfortable for an evening drink on the sofa or a variety of other seating configurations. We walked to the malls, major department stores, Pike Place Market, and Pioneer Square. The bedding is very comfortable, the bathroom was redone in all modern materials, and the artwork was pleasing. We even got a paper delivered on Sunday morning.

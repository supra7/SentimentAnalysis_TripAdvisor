We stayed one night at this hotel and the service was great. Because we came fromthe cruise ship, we arrived very early but there was no problem to check in. Rooms ar spacious and clean. There is a very good concierge service for all your questions. We had a red eye flight out and with an additional fee we could stay a couple hours longer in the room which was very nice to have a late afternoon shower. Only - point was, we stored our lugage till we left to the airport and when we collected it my carrion bag the handle was broken. We told the girl that that was not like that when we stored it and we didnt get any reaction or so from her.

As an avid fan of TripAdvisor's page, I was dedicated to reading reviews of Maroma prior to going on our honeymoon- I was well-informed. As to avoid breaking down each part of the resort, I'll highlight on a few of the most obvious pros & cons. - I'd guestimate 40% of the resorts' guests as honeymooners. Not a bad thing- just felt a little like part of a cult. - The resort is incredibly well-kept & the Secrets staff are forever maintaining the grounds. Be aware of repair/landscaping noises while lying at the pool during the day. - Drinks are plentiful- ask for top shelf & you shall recieve. - Food is very good- Portofino was easily my favorite. - BY ALL MEANS, VISIT THE SPA!! These men/women are incredible (and will easily beat the hell out of a massage @ your local place.) - There are bugs, so consider yourself warned. Nothing crazy, but I came home with a few bites. - The resort seems to shut down around 6pm to prepare for the restaurants to open. This is -definately not the place for hard-partying folk. - We upgraded to the Preferred Club out of sheer indulgence. I happened to enjoy it quite much. Much simpler check-in/out, appetizers and snacks all day, free WiFi, and a little respite from the masses. - By the end of our 8-day trip, we were ready to head home. The all-inclusive is an amazing deal, but at the end of the week, I was going a little stir-crazy for some action outside of the resort.

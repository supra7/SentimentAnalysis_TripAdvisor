I've stayed here twice in the last year and I loved it both times. The location is spectacular (within walking distance of the space needle, shopping, and the light rail) and the staff is always helpful. Also there is a bar & grill on-site which is wonderfully convenient. The room I had most recently was much nicer than the room I had a year ago, which was a great surprise.They're making improvements as needed.

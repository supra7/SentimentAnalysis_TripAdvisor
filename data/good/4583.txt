This was our third stay at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and we liked as much as the previous stays here. The staff is friendly the property is located on a beautiful strech of beach and the fragrant plumeria trees on the grounds are so pretty. The Tiki Bar is a great place to relax with a Mai 'Tai and you are always guarenteed to meet nice people from all over the world. Because we were return guests we got upgrades to our room, breakfast at the Tiki Terrace and a car. We have stayed at the Westin twice and I like it too but the KBH has a more Hawaiian feel to it and many of the employees have worked at the hotel for years. I would definetly recommend the KBH if your looking for a small Ohana style hotel.

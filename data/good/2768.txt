We've already stayed at this hotel three times in January 2011 alone. Living in Northwest Washington a drive of a couple of hours from SEA, we need a spot to park our car and a place to rest our heads prior to early departures or following late arrivals. The Doubletree fills the bill very nicely. We have stayed at a variety of SEA properties including a couple of Hampton Inns, a Hilton Garden Inn, and the Hilton just up the street. As Hilton Diamonds, we find that the Doubletree is one property that offers us recognition in the form of dining certificates that are appreciated. They often offer a very competitive park-and-fly rate with valet parking that lowers the cost of the room to as low as $30-50, if you subtract what you'd pay at the cheapest airport parking lots, e.g. Shuttle Park 2, for the same period of time. They offer a 24-hour shuttle that runs every 20 minutes for much of the day. Because of the routing, it takes 7-8 minutes to drive to the airport, but only 5 minutes or so from the airport pickup point back to the hotel. We're generally given an upper floor room in the tower, and find the rooms very comfortable. We connect our laptop in our room since Hilton Diamonds and Golds now receive free Internet as a perk worldwide. However, there are several free computers available outside the restaurant bar adjacent to the Starbucks stand, and free wireless as well in the lobby area. Last but not least, we have eaten dinner there a number of times and have never been disappointed. Their head chef has apparently been with them for many years, and the menu offers a good variety of reasonably priced and attractively presented entrees. We genuinely look forward to eating there. We're staying there again in a few nights and looking forward to it, despite facing a 6:00 a.m. flight the following morning. We're pleased to recommend this property as excellent choice for SEA.

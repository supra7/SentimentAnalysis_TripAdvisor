I stayed here with friends for two nights. This hotel has kind of a 1960s motor hotel theme going on. Our room had two queen beds but was a little cramped. The location and the breakfast were easily the two best features of the hotel. We were only a few blocks from the Space Needle and the Sci-Fi Museum/Experience Music Project. It was an easy walk to the "free zone" for the buses, which allowed us to get to Safeco Field for a Mariners game without driving or paying for a cab. The breakfast was a full hot buffet, with biscuits/gravy, sausage links, etc. Pool looked nice, but we didn't use it. The parking situation left a lot to be desired. There were no spots left the night we arrived, so I had to park on the street (no charge) and move the car at 8:00 the next morning to avoid feeding the meter or getting a ticket. A tip: Use your keycard to get into the underground garage off of Thomas St. I saw the gate and didn't realize guests could use it until after I'd already found a spot in the regular lot. The desk staff didn't make it clear that it was for guest use. Internet access was flaky in our room on the third floor near the end of the hall. I tethered with my BlackBerry for most of our stay. My last complaint is that it cost me $2 to receive (not send) a one-page fax. That can't really be justified in my mind. I would stay here again.

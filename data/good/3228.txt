American travelers will be turned off by the shabby decor and sparse offerings, but this is a very clean and safe hotel that has some nice features. The price is very good, and the hotel offers free onsite parking in a secured (locked) parking lot. If you look past the somewhat shabby dresser and bedspread in the room you will notice that the floor is a beautiful old tile that people now pay dearly for when renovating homes. Appreciate the architecture and the fact that it's not a sterile American-style hotel -- it is more reminiscent of what you find in Europe. Our room (#19) was very small (a marvel of engineering in how they fit the double bed and dresser "just so") but had cable television and an updated bathroom. Seriously, if you are an obese person, you don't want this room. The water pressure in the bathroom was excellent and there was plenty of hot water. We slept well and the hotel was quiet. We passed on the free continental breakfast (travel packs of cereal) but there's a wonderful local bakery two blocks away (Ricomini Bakery) that we enjoyed. It also serves hot and cold sandwiches and other deli offerings. There is free WifFi but it only works in the small eating area off the lobby. Finally, the staff was very pleasant and wanted to help wherever possible. While not luxurious, it was a fine place to stay for a couple of nights while touring the area.

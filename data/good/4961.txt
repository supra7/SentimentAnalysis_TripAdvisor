good for business trip nice and clean hotel with a particular design from - I assume - the 50's. And a very unique lift that you'll discover on site.Rooms are large, clean and modern. Very comfortable bed and very nice bathroom.The restaurant on the top floor makes delicious meat. The terrasse has a nice view and is undoubtedly very nice in the spring or summer.Breakfast is OK.Their is a fitness room and a sauna and hammam but I haven't tried.

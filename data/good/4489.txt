My partner and i have just returned from maui and stayed at the KBH. The hotel is so welcoming to all guests and really make your stay amazing. the hotel rooms are very big and relaxing. The hotel is right on the beach which makes for amazing snorkelling by day and the best sunsets ever by night! located right next to whalers village you really have a wide variety of choice of evening entertainment, tho the nightly shows at the hotel make you want to stay! cant wait to return for our honeymoon :)

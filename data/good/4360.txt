My husband and I just returned from a 10 day holiday at the hyatt in lahaina.We both agree that it was not a luxury hotel but not a standard one either,actually it was a balance of both.the grounds were beautiful,we got upgraded to a full ocean view room...and the view was amazing,ocean in front,the mountains to the side.The room was nicely decorated not luxurious,the bed was so comfortableBathroom could be updated but it was fine for us.The pool was lovely and the slide fun,we had no problem getting poolside chairs.I agree with others,the beach in front the hotel,was rocky and waters murkey but a short walk down the waters are clearer and calm. The staff was super friendly but everything in the hotel was expensive,and concierge was a bit misleading at times with thier refernces.Cascades restaurant the dinner and room service was quite good...and we had complimentary breakfast at swans Court food is decent.They gym was superb,and we enjoyed the grounds of the hotel alot....we did daily expeditions to all over the island and other hotels and found the hyatt the staff and other guests were the friendliest.

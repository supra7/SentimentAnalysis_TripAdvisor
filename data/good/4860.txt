This hotel is a tiny bit "no frills" but is located in a perfect spot to explore Rome by foot, which is what we did. The hoteliers provided a good breakfast, with fruit, yogurt, eggs, cheese, baked goods including cakes and pastry, and excellent coffee. The rooms are small (it's the heart of Rome!) but well outfitted. We had three to a room (parents and 19 year old), and it was a tad tight. There was good security, too. The bathroom was quite nice. Being on a side street, the room and hotel were fairly quiet at night, too. Free internet was a very welcome finding. It's not the Grand Regency, but the hotel was much more than adequate for our needs, and not overpriced at all.

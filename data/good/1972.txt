Stayed at Westin Seattle on BC Day long weekend. This is a four star hotel, rooms cost upwards of $200 night during weekdays. The business travellers leave on Friday, the hotel gets empty, and we got a very good discounted rate for Friday to Sunday nights. The hotel is located right downtown within walking distance to Pike Place, restaurants along the Pier, monorail etc. Rooms are old but have been updated. They are quite spacious. Concierge is very helpful and can get you to near the front of lineups at some of the popular restaurants around Pool is small, but is indoors, very clean with its own changing rooms and lockers Disadvantages, free wireless internet only in the lobby. But there are no computers, so you have to bring your own laptop. The Sheraton a few blocks away offers a whole bunch of computers in the lobby for use by the guests. Parking is also very expensive in the Westin lot. Use the lot beside the hotel its cheaper. You can tell the lot because its across the street from the hotel and accessed by an overhead covered walkway connected to the hotel

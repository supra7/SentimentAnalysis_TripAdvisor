My wife and I spent 4 nights at the Hyatt during our honeymoon were pleased with our experience. We were greeted warmly by everyone, ranging from the valet to the front desk clerk to the bellhop. At the front desk we were given a photo book, champagne voucher, and an invitation to a weekly honeymooners "cooking class" (more like a cocktail hour - still fun). The rooms were fine, not spectacular, and the beds were a bit soft for my liking. And the general decor is a bit dated but really, who cares? The grounds were absolutely beautiful and the restaurants, though pricey (like everything on Maui), were very good. Location on Kaanapali Beach is nice, though since the beach is narrow there you'll want to walk north along the path for better beach access. Pool is nice but a bit more crowded and active than some of our other honeymoon stops. If you plan on lounging for a while get there early. And as for parking, you should generally be OK with the self-park lot unless you return late on a weekend night.

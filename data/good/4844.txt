This is a TRUE 4 star hotel -- keeping in view that some hotels I have stayed in Dubai who claim to be 4 star would hardly qualify as 3* in other countries. Nice, clean, comfortable room and immaculate service. My room had a great view of new Dubai and even had a Jacuzzi, so that was a plus. Very close to everywhere -- City Center Mall, Bur Dubai, Metro Station all easy walking distance. Breakfast though was very average - same items every day, and not much variety. And they should work on free WiFi as charges of Dhs 75 / day are astronomical

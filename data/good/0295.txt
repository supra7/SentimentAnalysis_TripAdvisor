We needed a hotel for just one night, prior to departing on a cruise. This hotel was perfect for us. Great location, just steps from the Market. We enjoyed walking around the area. We booked two rooms; both were clean and comfortable but on the small side. Bellmen went out of their way to help us and give info on the area. We really loved the fifth-floor terrace. We enjoyed both an afternoon snack and breakfast there; we picked up food from a couple of the many nearby eating places. We highly recommend the cheese shop at the bottom of the hill. I would probably choose this hotel again when returning to Seattle.

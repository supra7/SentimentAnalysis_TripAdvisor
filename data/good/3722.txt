Very trendy hotel with funky furniture (although not entirely practical - e.g. none of the basins have shelves next to them to put your stuff). Didn't really live up to its 5* rating I thought, and was a bit disappointed when one of my wife's belongings got stolen whilst we were out of the room. Bathtub in the room is something different - but you're only going to have CNN and Bloomberg to watch if you don't want to watch Spanish TV! Great location - all the cool shops are on the same road, and the tourist bus stops right outside. Recommend Tenorio and Citrus restaurants within 50m walk. Best thing about this hotel is the location for sure - but remember this is on a main road so you will hear police/ambulance sirens at night etc.

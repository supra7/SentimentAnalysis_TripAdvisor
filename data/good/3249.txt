Good location for Disney Holidays, quiet area off H-Way 192.Near shops and restaurants.Buffet breakfast added advantage,and nice food.The manager and his assistant were top blokes,very friendly and helpful.Rooms had comfy beds and a good shower.Would come back in future.Just get the windows cleaned!

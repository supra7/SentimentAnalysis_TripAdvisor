We are currently at Secrets Maroma and have been very pleased. Had read a comment here about the El Patio restaurant being the worst of all of the restaurants but we were very happy with our meal. If you are expecting 'TEX MEX' this will not provide that; however, if you are looking for a higher end Mexican meal, this is very good. Also noted a comment from a past visitor who said they never had hot water in their room. Our room had the hot water opposite of where it typically is found in the shower -- just turn the handle slightly to the left and you will find the hot water instead of the cold.

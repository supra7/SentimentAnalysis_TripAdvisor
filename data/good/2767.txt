The service upon check-in was great. We were offered a fresh cookie, although due to nut allergies we had to decline. It would be nice for kids with allergies to have an alternative. Room was a good size and comfortable, but the hotel is huge so some rooms are quite far from the lobby. Restaurant food was good. Shuttle to airport was on time. Park n Fly was a decent price.

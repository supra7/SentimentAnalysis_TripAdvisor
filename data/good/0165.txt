I chose the hotel for location and price. I was extremely happy with the service during my whole stay. Staff was friendly, responsive and helpful. Location is extremely convenient. Rooms furnishings are not the newest, but that does not detract from the comfort, and it was quiet at night. I did not eat in the restaurant and cannot respond to negative reviews of that restaurant's prices, but I will note that nearby restaurants are all pretty expensive.

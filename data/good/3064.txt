The Hilton Seattle Airport is a good airport hotel. If you book on-line with advance purchase, it is cheaper than the comparable product - the Airport Marriott. The room was comfortable, the food was great, and the shuttle very convenient. I prefer this hotel to the Seattle Airport Marriott. Internet costs $10 a night, which is standard in a good hotel. Others [--]about the extras, they should stay at a cheap motel like the Red Roof.

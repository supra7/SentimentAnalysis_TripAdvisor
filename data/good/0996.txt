Good hotel in Seattle which provided good customer serivce. The hotel is about 8-10 blocks from the water and tourist area's. I wish it were a little closer as within the two block area there were limited choices of entertainment and dining. The room was nice and clean. The beds were comfortable and the desk had plenty of outlets to charge everything. The food at the bar was average and a little below is portion sizes. The beer selection was good and they offered Sam Adams Octoberfest. Overall, I would recommend staying. If I had a choice of a similar hotel closer to the tourist area I would choose that but if not I would stay again.

I've heard a few reviews. After going there in May, here's what to expect. A 30 minute ride to the resort, a mile at the end is dirt road. It wasn't well organized coming out of the airport. But it seems resort had nothing to do with the fiasco. At arrival we entered the resort greeted by an conscier, champagne and an overall comforting feeling. We were asked about becoming members, and knowing It's a time share sale, we waisted no time saying no. No problem, checked in and off to our room. It took about half an hour for our bags. Really no problem if you have a little patience. The food was average and great, depending on your taste. Drinks were weak but flavorful, as I was thankful not t o be blitzed on an expensive vacation. Room was great, swimout pool was our pick. The beach was great, and the service was great. Every 5 minutes a waiter was there. It's not the grand thing you see in the movies. But for the price It's as close as you'll get, unless you have1000 a night to spend.

This resort boasts one of the most beautiful enterance and lobby areas I've ever seen. From live penguins to fabulously colored parrots and foliage to die for, it is something you don't get at just any hotel. The hotel's "Son'z Maui and Swan Court" has an amazing open pond where you can admire the swans swimming as you eat a delicious breakfast. The hotel's pool system introduces a swim-up grotto bar, and a fantastic water slide; great for most all ages. The hotel is within short driving distance of the gorgeous town of Lahaina and within just walking distance of the popular "Whaler's Village"- a great shopping area that also hosts several restaurants. The Hyatt Regency Resort is a great place to take family or a spouse, it offers many different luxurious choices for activity and not to mention, it's beautiful.

Small hotel located on the 2nd and 3rd floor of an old building in a quiet alley, in convenient walking distance of the river, Trastevere, the big shopping streets, and all the historic squares and cultural heritage sites. Taxi driver found the street without problems, there is a big brass plaque on the door with the name Domus Ester, and as the reception staff has the front door under video surveillance, he/she will buzz the front door open for you the minute you have arrived. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Top quality beds. Freshly brewed coffee and tea, warm rolls, slices of rustic fresh bread, butter and jam brought to your room every morning. Lots of space for clothes. Very small bathroom but nice and clean, with everything working perfectly. Only minus as I see it is the lack of a lounge and bar for a night cap, but then there are loads of cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood where you may hang out with your friends instead - or you may shop at the Spar supermarket just around the corner and bring the stuff to your room and store it in the mini fridge. At the price of EUR 110 for a double room in the heart of Rome at the beginning of the high season, this hotel offers good value for money.

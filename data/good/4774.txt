We had a five night wonderful stay at the Maui Eldorado. The condo was large and very nicely appointed. The grounds were well maintained. The location was convenient yet away from the tourist hustle. At night, it was quiet and peaceful. I thought the condo was a good value. We paid approximately $100 per night less than if we were on a resort directly on the beach. However, be aware, it is a long walk to the beach. We were in Building C and it was a HIKE to the beach. There is a beach cabana with facilities and a refrigerator, so once you are down there, it is nice. The beach there is quiet and beautiful. The pool near our condo was smallenough for an afternoon splash but thats about it. The condo itself was nice. It was clean large and quiet. The resort is a true CONDO  no restaurants or bars. Its strictly BYO everything.

But Maui has so many nice places you'll want to see. The pool was great. You can swim up to the bar inside a cave, but no curb side service. You have to get out to get your drink. The waterfalls in the pool are fun. They even had a basketball hoop and several were playing. The kiddy pool had slides and was separate. We had the Breakfast Buffet included and it was perfection. Crispy bacon on a steam table seems to be an oxymoron, it's usually soggy, but not here. Eggs Benedict with salmon. YUM. (twice I added my bacon to my Eggs Benedict.) You sit by the Lagoon and relax and eat. We found a great waitress named Dee and always asked to sit in her station. They were very accommodating. The stores inside the resort were a nice touch. There is a couple of nice art places, and other nice shops. We got a great Koa framed picture They wrapped it nicely for our trip home. The view we had was sunset all the way. The Lanai was a bit small, but we were the only two in the room, so it didn't matter to us. It was relaxing to sit there and watch the sun go down. There is a luau on the same side as the wing we were in, but the music wasn't bad at all. It ended by 8:30. Truth be told, even on the lanai, we couldn't hear it. We walked by the luau and the dancers and singers were great! We wished we had gone. It was the first luau I had seen that had what appeared to be 4 part harmony, and I am a sucker for good harmony. Beds comfy, newspaper next to the door in the morning. Nice to look over at breakfast and find out what was going on in town that day. I like to be connected to the world, even when in Maui.

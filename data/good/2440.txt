In many ways, very much the "W" experience: decor, vibe, service... which is a compliment. Though the lobby area is quite small, still very functional and service is very attentive and helpful. Unlike other W's, the elevators are quick! Gym is incredibly small and claustrophobic. Location is excellent - close to all the shops and Pike's Place Market. Good, reliable stay with excellent service

Location - apparently in the trendy Beyoglu district. Still, we had a hard time looking for really trendy bars. It's near this main strip where a lot of restaurants and bars were located, but these places seemed more touristy, not really hip. Rooms - modern furnishing and decor, which we love. However, very tiny rooms! I thought our room was already tiny, but upon looking at photos from other travelers, I guess we were lucky already! What sucked though, was the location of our room, which was an internal one. I guess that's the price you have to pay for paying so cheap. I think it faced a wall. Amenities - nice spa. Women should be careful about the hamam, though. I booked one, not knowing well what a Turkish bath entailed and that the masseuse was a young man. I think I may have gotten more than I bargained for there. Breakfast - OMG. Absolutely awesome! Forces you to wake up early, just to get to the spread. Various continental and middle eastern cuisine at their buffet area. Don't miss this! Price - quite reasonable, especially since we booked with Expedia. Maybe spring a few extra bucks for a room that actually has a view of something other than a wall.

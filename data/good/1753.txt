The Edgewater is a well-appointed hotel on the (as the name suggests) edge of Elliot bay. The lobby literally looks down upon the water and is very restful. The decor is an interesting blend of cabin and hunter-chic, with columns fashioned out of tree bark and chandeliers of deer horn. The bathrooms had beautiful stone floors and a very clean, earthy feel. I would bring a pair of slippers and plan to use the in-room alarm clock, since the wake-up call we requested never came. The Edgewater will provide town-car shuttle service to the airport for a $40 dollar fee. The driver was courteous and arrived 30 minutes before our requested time, so that part went without a hitch. The hotel is a few feet away from Anthony's Pier 66 restaurant, so we didn't get to sample the room service or hotel restaurant menus, but Anthony's was superb. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves very much.

I stayed at the Hyatt in Maui and it was fantastic. I loved the pool and their slides. I think the ocean that they had in the back of the hotel was gorgeous and had the most amazing sunset you could ever see . I ate at one of the restaurants and they are alright, but there is much better food places out of the hotel.While you stay at this hotel you must go to the pool and ocean!!!!!! :) Also check out the birds in the hotel too.

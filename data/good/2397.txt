Just want to say that this hotel is in a great location, very clean, great food , and awesome customer service. My friend and i had a close encounter of the technical counter of the technical kind during our stay( not our fault) and hotel staff were very prompt to look after it. I was very impressed with the service at this hotel and with its management team. All i can say is keep up the great service.

I travel to Seattle 4-6 times per year and almost always stay in the downtown area. The hotel market is competitive in the high quality bracket, and in truth it is hard to go wrong with a 4-star, downtown hotel. Receltly I discovered Priceline gives great deals on Seattle hotels, and so bid on a 4-star room at $122/night. I got the Westin, and was not unhappy with staying there. With taxes and fees, the price came to $143/night. I thought the Westin was well worth it, despite the fact the hotel is the largest in downtown Seattle and is probably about 30 years old. It may be a big old sleeping factory, but it's still a good one. First off, the check-in was effortless. Perhaps there was no check-in line because we arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Nevertheless, there were enough people at the desk to handle the flow. Despite the fact we were Priceline customers, we were put on a high floor in a recently-remodeled room that had views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains, in the distance. The large windows were clean and very welcome, letting in light and making the smallish room feel larger, but did a good job keeping out street noise. We were greatly impressed with the quietness in the rooms. We never heard our neighbors making noise, any toilets flushing, or the bells announcing the arrivals of the elevators, just across the hall from our room. The in-room amenities were excellent; far better than comparably-starred Sheratons or Hiltons. We really liked the two-headed shower and the marble bath. My only complaint about the place is that dining options are not what they used to be. Roy's Restaurant and the Nikko Restaurant have departed. Nikko is now empty space and what has replaced Roy's is not as good. However, that dining complaint is a mere quibble. There are literally dozens of excellent dining options within easy walking distance, so it is hardly as if you are in a culinary desert!

We have been staying at this particular hotel for over 20 years and have never been disappointed! We particularly like the spacious rooms, full breakfast and cocktail reception in the evening and the rate is generally so affordable (especially for a family of 5!) The rooms have all been remodeled and look great - we wont stay anywhere else when we visit Seattle!!

We found the staff to be friendly not so much helpful. The rooms were extremely spacious clean and comfortable. The gym was fantastic had lots of equipment and lots of space with a fantastic view. we were walking distance from the main road with lots of restaurants and shopping. The restaurant at the hotel would be one of the best meals we have ever eaten with the staff know all about the wines on their list. we would recommend this as a nice place to stay when visiting Montreal

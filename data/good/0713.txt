Two blocks from Pike Place Market, you'll find this little gem. And for $100/night (for a Thursday) in this area of Seattle, you'll have a hard time beating the price. This is a renovated original building, complete with real keys (versus the plastic variety). I felt like I was in an old movie when I walked off the closet sized elevator, down the hallway. It's not one of those all frills included hotels, but you will get clean linens, and basic toiletries, and excellent guest service. The bathrooms have claw foot tubs, and although the shower head was a little low for my height, the charm of the room itself made up for it. I rated the sleep quality as average related to the box spring mattress, but the room itself (on the 7th floor) was quiet. The location and the charm are two of the best features of the Moore Hotel. As long as their prices and service continue, I would pick this hotel again.

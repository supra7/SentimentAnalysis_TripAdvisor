Our room was in a great location with a view of the pool and ocean. This hotel could use a little lovin', but you get great value for the money. It is on a nice, swimmable beach, has a good pool, and a cute bar. The room cleanliness was fine, but some updates are definitely needed. The Whaler's shopping centre is a short walk away, along with some nice restaurants.

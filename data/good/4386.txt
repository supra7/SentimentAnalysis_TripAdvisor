This hotel is in the perfect location on Ka'anapali beach, It's a short walk to Whaler's Village, where you have lots of dining options (well, at least for a resort area) and shops (although, what is a Louis Vuitton doing here??). The hotel also fronts a beautiful sand beach that is large and lovely and close enough to Black Rock that you can walk there but not so close that this area of the beach is overly croweded. I've stayed at the Hyatt on Ka'anapali before and although that was a much nicer (newer) hotel, the location of the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel cannot be beat. The staff here is extremely warm and friendly and made our stay fantastic. We didn't really use the pool or eat at any of the restaurants on site so I can't really anything about that but we could see the pool from our balconey and although there were always people there, it seemed like you could easily get a chair whenever you wanted to. The rooms are a bit dated but totally clean and spacious and nice. No wifi though except in the common areas. All in all, a great stay. Will definitely be back!

Loved the hotel and the service was fantastic. Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous. As many of these reviews will tell you, the rooms are very small. In spring and summer, you don't get much of a fire in the gas fireplace, since it is also the room heater. The little "in-room" goodies (bar, snacks, rubber duck, and teddy bear) were way expensive. The parking charge was a real surprise at $30 per night. Also, the restaurant is nice but plan on about $40-60 per person for dinner. Another surprise on the car rental was all the taxes added up to 30% (11.9% airport tax). Tourism tax (9.7%), plus sales tax (9.5%), on the room added up to 18%. Washington really rakes in revenue on their tourists.

We arrived at the Hotel Max via the new light rail service from the SEATAC airport which takes you to the Westlake shopping center, about 2 blocks walk from the hotel. It was really cheap - $2.50 each - but took about an hour as it doesn't yet go all the way to the airport- so you have to take a free shuttle bus for the first mile, to get to the rail line.. But it saved us a fortune in taxi fares. When we got to the Hotel Max the friendly receptionist upgraded us to a king-size bed instead of the double we had originally booked. When I asked if they had free wifi, he gave us the code for no charge too. So ignore any complaints about unfriendly reception folk! Our room was around the side overlooking the courthouse so we didn't suffer too badly from street noise apart from police sirens one night. We didn't notice noise from any other rooms. The AC was noisy so we turned it off. We liked the European-style bathroom fittings and the artwork.

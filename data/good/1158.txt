I need to say this hotel is not 5 stars but it's good enough. In Seattle, most of the hotels charge for parking but not this one. This hotel also offers free breakfast. The air conditioner was noisy but works. Location is okay. Close to Space Needle and I think Walgreen will be open (or maybe already open?) soon a few blooks away from the hotel. At the 1st floor, the hotel offers free coffee, hot chocolate, or tea. Everytime I go to Seattle, I use this hotel.

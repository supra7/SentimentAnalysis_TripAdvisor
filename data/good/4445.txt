Stayed at Kaanapali Beach Hotel for 31st Anniversary and was very pleased with this Hotel. The location is perfect for staying on Maui and the rooms were a nice size and comfortable. The beds are outstanding. Althoough there isn't a great restraurant on the premises, Whalers village is a couple hundred yards away with a couple of great places. Would definately stay there again.

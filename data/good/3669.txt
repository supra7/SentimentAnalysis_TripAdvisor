Hilton Garden Inns are generally nice, modern and well-run and this one is better than the usual HGI. Rooms are decent size, with modern looking furniture and decor and have a microwave and refrigerator. Staff is very efficient and friendly. Has a business center with complimentary internet access and printing. For pool and fitness, hotel guests are allowed access to the Maryland Athletic Center, which can be entered directly from the hotel. This facility is FANTASTIC; a large space with an enormous variety and quantity of equipment. Has two lap pools and two smaller pools. The only drawback is that it is not open early morning or evenings on weekends. The hotel website should be improved to clearly indicate this. There is valet parking ($32) and a parking garage for self-parking ($23). Both vehicular access and egress from garage to hotel are not straightforward; better explanation on the website, better signage and better staff explanation would be an improvement. There is a standard HGI restaurant; breakfast was good, but nothing special; no reason to eat there for dinner with all the other nearby choices. Very good location in the Harbor East development; decent number and variety of restaurants immediately around the hotel; there is a 24 hour CVS a block away and a cinema next door to the hotel. A short walk to the Inner Harbor and Fells Point. A longish, but pleasant in good weather, walk to Camden Yards, M&T Bank Stadium and First Mariner Arena and the downtown office district. Cabs are available if walking is unappealing. NB: A block away is a Whole Foods; the salad bar there provides a fast, inexpensive and healthy (if you are careful) lunch/dinner option.

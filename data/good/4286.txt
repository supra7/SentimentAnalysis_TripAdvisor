My husband and I really enjoyed this hotel. When we arrived in the area and saw the others we were contemplating, I was thrilled to see that the Hyatt was ours. The entrance is lit with propane tiki torches and sets the mood for your Hawiaan Vacation. We did not pay for any kind of upgraded room, and stayed overlooking the pool. It was a nice room, though electricity seemed a bit spotty. We WERE there for the earthquake, but the hotel recovered quickly and we weren't really impacted. My best advice: pack a collapsable cooler in your suitcase. We went and bought lunch and drinks and traveled with it every day. Also, at the dive shops, you can rent beach chairs for the week for those that like to lay in a chair rather than on the sand. We ate at the hotel restaurants and enjoyed them, but our favorite meals were off site at the Lahina shopping areas. I bought a $12 Maui Dining guide off of Amazon and it really helped me decide where to make our reservations in advance. You do have to rent a car- there's no getting around this in Hawaii. If that's not in your budget, save Hawaii for another time. The spa was awesome. We paid the spa fee for the last day so we could lay out all day and use the spa to get ready for our flight home. It was well worth it and actually "bought" us an extra day. I'm happy to answer any questions. Would go back. If we didn't stay here we would stay at the Westin or Marriott, but don't regret the Hyatt at all.

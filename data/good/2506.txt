Great hotel centrally located in downtown Seattle.. they have some of the more reasonable rates in an expensive City. We just stayed this past weekend and because we're from Vancouver we qualified for an offer that includes Free parking and $20 breakfast voucher each day at the restaurant.. Very friendly staff who aim to please..

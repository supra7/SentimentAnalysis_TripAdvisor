I stayed at the FH-Imperial two nights ago. Spartan but clean accomodations. Room had nice flatscreen TV, comfortable bed, and good A/C. Water was lukewarm at best. About $95 U.S. but you may be able to get a better deal if you book in advance. Rate included breakfast which wasn't anything special (eggs, ham, toast, etc.) but was quick. Hotel is close to Little India (about 15 minutes walk from the Mustafa shopping mall which sells EVERYTHING). Also 5 minute walk to Lavender MRT station. I'd stay there again.

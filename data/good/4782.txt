My husband and I stayed at the Outrigger Maui Eldorado 6/18-6/21. We try to always stay at Outrigger or Ohana resorts when we are in Hawaii because of their liberal policies towards airline employees. We arrived late night and had booked a partial ocean view one bedroom condo. The condo they put us in was not partial oceanview but it was a 2 bedroom and seemed to be larger then our own house back home. We found out the next day that that was the only condo available when we checked in and needed to move as the owners were coming to stay. The entire staff was very apologetic and accomodating. The next day when we returned to the condo we found a large gift basket waiting for us and a card from the manager. The hotel overall had beautiful grounds and we loved the tiled pool. The beach was a bit of a walk but not more then 10 minutes and was well worth it. We would definately stay here again.

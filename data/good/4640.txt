We just recently visited Maui for business/anniversay. Every staff member was extremely pleasant and willing to help with whatever our needs or concerns were. The gardens are beautiful, rooms clean. The management staff is extremely helpful. Guest Services outstanding. There are free onsite things plan for those days when you are just hanging out at the pool and relaxing. Mikala Nolan is very knowledgeable about Hawaii past and present. Makes you laugh and smile even on a rainy day. We will definitely stay here on our next visit to Maui.

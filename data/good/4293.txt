My husband and I honeymooned in Maui and stayed at the Hyatt. We loved it. The breakfast buffet was amazing!! The food was great, the luau at the Hyatt is great! travellers from other resorts come to the luau at the Hyatt. The pool was amazing. Not only clean but spacious so you were not crowded at any time. The grounds are beautiful and vast. The rooms are small but clean and if your in Maui your not going to spend much time inside. Overall the best vacation ever. Would I ever go back...in a hearbeat!!!

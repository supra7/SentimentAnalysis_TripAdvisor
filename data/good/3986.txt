Stayed here recently. The hotel was pretty nice, the rooms are decent and were pretty clean. It is a relatively new hotel so it was modern and had a nice HDTV in the room. Great for watching football or other games if that is your thing. The views from here of the water are pretty nice. In the bottom of the hotel there is a Starbucks so you can get coffee in the morning. Also you can take a nice walk along the seaport. They are building a pedestrian walkway that will connect you right next to the Ballpark, once that is done it will be a bit better. But overall you are only a 5-10 min walk from the Gaslamp District for food and shopping. Bring your own water, it is like $4.50 in the room and vending machines want $3.50 for a drink. So I suggest you bring your own water and/or drinks. Self parking was $21.00 a night. Which is about the average rate for the area.

My wife & I just returned from a 6 day stay at the Seattle Sheraton. Its a VERY large hotel, and our room itself was quite large, but it was a handicap-access room so I dont know if our room was representative of others. It did lack luxury touches like terry robes, magnifying lighted bathroom mirrors,espresso makers in room, etc. Service was very good, although they could consider enlarging the cleaning staff so that rooms could be cleaned and made up more quickly. Although we arrived early, and I asked for a handicap facility, our room was available immediate;y. AND, I had mentioned to the concierge that I had a reservation at a restaurant on our wedding anniversary, asking if the place was a good one for the occasion. She said it was, and, the evening of our occasion, I lovely tray with wined, cheeses, etc, was sent up to us by the hotel. That WAS 5 star. We'd stay there again if we wanted to return to downtown Seattle.

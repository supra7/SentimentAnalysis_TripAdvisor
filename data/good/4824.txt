we just came back from singapore last night. cant wait to complement the staff of this small hotel chain. Jona, the front desk receptionist went out of her way to lend us change for the bus fare because we only had large bills.as stated it is very small but very clean though. we had a room on the 4th flr with windows that has a pool view of the house behind it. the staff was very accomodating. we asked for 1 extra pillow after midnight without any problem. a bus stop is a step next to it to take you to both Novena and Toa Payoh MRT stations. food court nearby too. hotel prices are very steep in Singapore. glad they came up with clean, affordable and safe budget hotels like this one.. ..what more can you ask?

We stayed there for three days after spending a few days at the Valentin nearby- and we really loved the property. The way it is laid out makes it very easy to go from the pool, to the beach, back to your room, and everything is very central. Also loved the games everywhere such as chess sets, ping pong in the water, and other options. The best part was the food was amazing. We did the Italian, and the French, and we loved every minute of it. We couldn't help but to leave our amazing servers big tips because they were so incredibly nice. It is comparable to some restaurants I've been to in Boston/New York City. That being said I was very unhappy with one situation which was my room in building 16, a preferred building. When we arrived in our room, we realized it smelled really strong of cigarette smoke despite being a non-smoking room. I'm not talking about a subtle undertone, I'm talking it was absolutely so strong and disgusting. I called and complained of course, and I was told housekeeping would be right up and take care of it. I called 3 more times every few hours, as we were in and out of the room and housekeeping never came, and a manager didn't return any of my calls. This really bothered me and since we were there such a short time- I was pretty upset. I decided I should just get over it and make the most of the stay, even though it is something that bothered me a lot. They called about at 11:30 at night after we had gone to bed and offered to move us, this would have been great a few hours ago, but at this point we only were staying one more night, and I wasn't going to move in the middle of the night... I would have expected that situation to be handled better, especially since we paid the upgrade to be part of the preferred club. Other than that incident though, everything else was great.

The Warwick is in the heart of Seattle easy walking distance to Pikes Place, the Monorail terminal and Downtown Shops. We stayed twice recently at the start and finish of a tour of the Pacific North West. Staff are very helpful and knowledgable, rooms are large and comfy except that they only have one armchair in a large two bedded room. Rooms have fridge and coffee maker.Parking is on site, it is expensive, but I guess it reflects city centre parking prices. It is in the Free Zone for travel on Seattle's buses so it is very cheap (free) to travel around central Seattle, and there is a handy grocery store opposite

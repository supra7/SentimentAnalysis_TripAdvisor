Just around the corner from the San Diego convention center, the Hilton is in a great location for most business travel and downtown SD in general. Everything on my stay felt like "Hilton new" with a great bed, plasma tv, well sized room, clean, good. Like most hiltons you'll pay for parking, wifi, and food isn't cheap but it's par for the course and well within polite rules for the expense reports if you're on business. Back to location... You'll find the water Just outside but good beaches require a little drive out of downtown. San Diego is a waking town so plan to spend 5 minutes getting to gas lamp or any food outside of the hotel property... But that's ok, it's a nice walk. And of course petco park is a block away for all you padre fans.

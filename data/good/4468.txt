Everything went great for us. Traveled with my 87yr old Dad. They were so accommidating to him. The hotel is clean and the food is excellent. Close to everything.for shopping and the hotel sits right on the beach . This hotel is family oriented and very laid back. You will go home relaxed. We will be back.

Location Location! Nice botique hotel. MTR is only 20 meters away and this makes it easy to travel anywhere. I booked directly with hotel and found that cheaper. My room was small but cozy. The washroom however was a decent size and very clean. For the price and location it is an excellent choice. I speak chinese so the staff were not rude to me nor were they friendly either. Lots of shopping and eating close by and bars at night near by. TST area has it all...highend shopping and cheap stuff too. I would stay here again in a heartbeat but if you are use to north american size rooms then this is not the place for you. More suitable for couple/singles.

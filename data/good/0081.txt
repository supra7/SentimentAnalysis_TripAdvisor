I used to live in Seattle & always loved downtown. This hotel is located in a great area: quiet but very accessible to EVERYTHING a tourist would want to see- Pikes Place, Pioneer Square, shopping district, First Hill... The area is very safe, so not to worry about that. There is a Starbucks next door (naturally) & a few other dining establishments very near. From the airport, we took the connector bus to the light rail (no need to take bus by Jan '10) & it drops you off (University stop) literally 1 1/2 blocks away. $2.50 per person is much cheaper than the $40 cab ride. The staff is polite, very helpful, & they all remember the guests. We asked for a "quiet" floor & despite booking on hotels.com (for $130 total midweek), they relocated us to the 9th floor. Although our view was of another building, it was peaceful. The decor is very loud, but fun & the entire hotel was spotless (& I searched). I did find some small stains on a couple towels, a gross vent in the bathroom along with some soapscum, & some scuffs on wall corners, but considering the rest of the experience I gladly ignored those minor things. I was a little confused about the heater because it seemed to stay at 72 degrees no matter how high I turned it up: strange. I had a touch of the flu, so this was really the only thing that irritated me. The bathrooms counters are a nice granite & they offer Aveda bathroom toiletries. I'd highly recommend Hotel Monaco for anyone. Never learned what you need to do to have a friendly fish in your room! Enjoy.

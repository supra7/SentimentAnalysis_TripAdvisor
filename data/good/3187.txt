I'm actually sitting in Le Crystal right now. I love hotels and manage a boutique property. I tend to only stay in boutique properties. The website of Le Crystal was inviting, the combination of luxury and boutique appealed to me. The hotel is well designed, quiet, superb service but it has more of a business feel than a boutique feel. I am staying for 5 nights. I was given a suite with a balcony but no bathtub. I did call to ask because the floorplans all showed a bathtub. Sadly a balcony AND a bathtub could only be procured at an upgrade for an additional 80 dollars a night. Now the room is available, the hotel is not busy and I am staying 5 nights. The cost of making me happy to the hotel is nothing. The staff has been trained to upsell but I come from the hospitality school of thought that if the cost to the hotel is nothing I will go in for guest satisfaction EVERY time. Both my friend and I were surprised that no one mentioned that the hotel had a much more business feel rather than a boutique feel. We wanted a large comfy room to hang in if the weather was bad. The room is large, well equipped, clean but lacking the character of the common areas, The rooms are well maintained. The staff has been trained to a very high degree in personal service. The housekeeping is well done. The front desk staff has been superb. My reservation was lost when I arrived but it was handled promptly and professional. The reception picks up immediately are are completely reactive to any request. Every restaurant that the concierge has told us about has been spot on. The service and philosophy is that of a boutique hotel and kudos to the effort that has gone into the staff training. Will I come back, I'm not sure.... I've been awake since 4 am and would truly have loved a hot bath but not at 240 dollars.

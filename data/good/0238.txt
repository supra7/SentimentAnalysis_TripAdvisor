This hotel had character! I really liked our room too. It was tiny but fun. Very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. If you need space to spread out this isn't the place for you but if you plan on enjoying the room just as a place to drop your things and go enjoy the city than this is the perfect place. The location was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hallways made me feel like I was in a dream. I loved the decor!! Very artistic, not like any other place I have ever stayed. I was a little concerned because I had seen that this hotel was listed on the bed bug report. I called ahead of time to inquire about this issue. I spoke to the general manager who told me that bed bugs have now come to Seattle and they are a problem in the industry and any hotel at any time could have them. He also assured me that they bring in dogs to check the rooms on a regular basis and if any are found they are properly exterminated. I don't think you can ask for anything else. We had no bed bugs in our room! Yea! Anyhow the place is great! I would go back for sure. Give them a try.

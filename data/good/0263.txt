Wow, thought I had died & went to heaven when I fell into the bed after 2 nights of camping w/minimal amenities (no showers or running water.) Additionally, I had to order room service from Cafe Campagne, which was utterly delicious! The location was dead center for visiting Pike's market; and availability to visit the rooftop & enjoy the city & Puget sound views are an additional bonus. Plus the staff were very amenable to helping us plan some future outings. Granted it was high season, but worth the expense for location & convenience. I liked that we didn't have to pay for wi-fi. We didn't use any other services tho, but location, location, location!

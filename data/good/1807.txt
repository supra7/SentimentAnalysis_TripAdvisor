First of all, this hotel is a fine facility down to the details. Just staying in such a historic place is worth the experience. So the details, but with explanation first: this was a business trip, and I arrived about 9 pm and checked out at 8 am the next morning, so my experience with the hotel was a bit limited. The check in was warm and efficient, couldn't be improved upon. The room--mine was small but wonderful down to the smallest details--was impressive. When I took a shower, it took a very long time for the water temp to come up to my comfort level. The checkout was not so good. Another woman rode the elevator down with me, and I waited at the desk behind her for several minutes before someone finally came out to answer the phone. We were both ignored while he engaged in a long discussion with the caller. Since I had a timeline, so I ended up just tossing him the key and leaving. When it's all said and done though, I hope to come back for a weekend getaway sometime, I'd like to explore the hotel and the area at a more relaxed pace. I recommend this hotel.

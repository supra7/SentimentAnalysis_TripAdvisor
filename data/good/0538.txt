My husband and I were visiting our daughter for our first trip to Seattle. The room was very large. It was on the street side of the first floor and I really didn't encounter a noise problem. It had a nicely appointed kitchen and a very large bathroom It also had a sitting area with couch and easy chair that made it perfect for entertaining my daughter and her boyfriend. . the staff was excellent. Any thing we asked for was taken care of quickly and professionally. The only negative I have is the continental breakfast was nothing special. There are numerous excellent restaurants close to the hotel so that really wasn't an issue. We definitely plan on staying here again on our next visit to Seattle.

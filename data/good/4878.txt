My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay with Hotel Opera Roma. All the staff were so helpful and friendly. They were there to serve our every need. They arranged the transfers to and from the airport for a very reasonable cost and even opened the breakfast area early for us on two monrings to help us out. The location is very convenient to the train station and not too far to walk to the sites in ancient Rome. We enjoyed getting the exercise walking to most of the tourist attractions. The rooms are small, but clean and well cared for. My only complaints would be that the beds and pillows are pretty hard, and the outside street noise is considerable. We used earplugs, so we got a decent nights sleep. They have free internet in the lobby, but it is extremely slow and the keyboards need to be replaced. We would recommend this hotel to others who want to be near the train station. Great service goes a long way toward a relaxing and hassle-free stay.

We stumbled across this hotel in a web search and now are totally addicted and cannot wait to go back. Because of flight delays we did not arrive at the hotel until midnight and had to check out at 7 am. The room was spectacular - feeling very much like an old NY apartment. Wonderful beds and linens that make it nearly impossible to get out of bed. The staff is warm and friendly. Don't expect grandeur - expect something that is a find. This is not the Westin or W, but has the same feel - just on a very small scale. Highly recommended for those who want to get away from the mass market scene.

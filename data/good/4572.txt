I loved the KBH. TheY coordinated my wedding on the sand. It came with the Minister, hula dancer, photographer, prints & fresh flower leis. We had the ocean front room on the 1st floor & walked right out from our patio onto the lawn & just a sidewalk away from the sand. The staff was wonderful. They gave us champagne on arrival since we were getting married & then on the day of the wedding they gave us another large bottle & chocolate covered strawberries. The buffet breakfast was simple & easy, nice way to start a day. The Tiki Terrace restaurant served incredible food & I bought some great stuff in the gift shop. The valet guys couldn't be any cooler. I read a few reviews about the hotel being outdated but I didn't think so at all. I went over to the Sheraton next door & it was almost too stale & blank. Too modern without a lot of personality plus there were tons of kids there which I didn't want on my honeymoon so the KBH was perfect for us. There were a few older kids but that was it. We had the "Island Romance" package which included the car, daily breakfast, a dinner at the Tiki Terrace, a picnic lunch is a backpack that you keep which is awesome. It came with plates, silverware, glasses, napkins, table cloth, cheese knife, cutting board, bottle of wine with an opener & all the food inside. We took it on our road to Hana trip & it really came in handy. We also got 2 bottles of water every day & an excursion. We chose the Luau at the Hyatt & that's the only thing I would have done differently. It just wasn't our speed. Too much waiting in lines & the food wasn't that great. Also a lot of kids & parents on stage learning to hula dance. It was cute but not for our honeymoon. I would choose the surfing lessons or dinner cruise next time. All in all it was fabulous & I didn't want to come home!

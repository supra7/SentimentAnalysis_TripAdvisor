We stayed at the KBH for 9 nites, Feb. 6 thru Feb. 15th, 2007. The location and beach are perfect. The grounds are authentic and lovely. The pool is non-heated ,so can it be a little cool for some people. Snorkeling and all activities are right here. Our room was in the Molokai wing. It had a lovely view, with turn down service and cookies on the pillow. We were given breakfast buffet tickets for our complete stay and totally enjoyed the meals. There was everything you could want, and enough to make sandwiches for later in the day. Recommend taking a short trip into Lahaina to "Canoes" for the happy hour and best sushi-type appetizers around. Lovely view and the appetizers make a great meal. All in all, this hotel is great place to stay, relax and enjoy. Don't need a car.

The hotel itself is great. They even gave us a double room upgrade and a bottle of champagne for being honeymooners! The grounds are beautiful, adorned with a dozen or so exotic birds and the pool is huge with a cool design. Our only complaint was the beach. Unlike the 100-yard-deep, white sand beach we enjoyed on the Big Island, the beach here averaged 10 feet deep and was angled sharply toward the water. It was just enough to lay down. Also, the beach (or maybe it was just the water) smelled awful. The only other negative was that everything we did (the drive to Hana, snorkeling, the bike ride down the volcano) are all 30-60 min from Lahaina. Next time I think we'd stay father south.

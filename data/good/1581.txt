The Andra was comparable in location/style to several Kimpton properties in Seattle but better priced. Four restaurants within eyesight of the front door + more within blocks = very convenient. The staff were very helpful when Seattle was hit by a rare snowstorm and we had to do some juggling of our reservations. We stayed twice over a 10-day period and the first room was pretty snug and on a noisy street, but the second was much roomier and quieter.

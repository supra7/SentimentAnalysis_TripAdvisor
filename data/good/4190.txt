Just finished a 7 night stay in the Ocean Suite (5/9-5/16). We stayed here last year with our 3 and 5 year old (in a regular partial ocean view room), and once again we had a great stay. I've stayed at this hotel several times, and can tell you that the majority of the reivews here on TA are accurate. In short, the standard rooms are a bit dated (popcorn ceilings and gold door knobs), but the beds are excellent, TV's are flatscreens, and bathrooms are fairly updated (small, but granite). The beach is just OK,;you are better off heading North (either walking along the trail, or taking the free Trolley up to Black Rock beach at the Sheraton). The pools, however, are excellent. The hotel website does not do the kids pool justice. It's great for young kids; its a walk-in with a sand bottom, has mutliple places for the kids to sit and play, and has a waterslide (one for kids, and one for adults too!). The hotel staff are excellent. Every afternoon, they came by the kids pool with Otter Pops (popsicles) for the kids, and cold towels for the adults. Also, (and I stay at a lot of Hyatts), this property has the nicest Regency Club I've experienced, both in terms of food & drink offerings, as well as service. Stay here with your family, and I'm certain you will be happy (unless you are one of those people on TA that complain about resort fees, and will be surprised that your beer at the pool bar costs more than it would at the grocery store). Thanks again, Hyatt!

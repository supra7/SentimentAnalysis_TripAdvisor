Hotel Opera Roma is staffed by friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful people. The hotel has an historic feel, but is fully refurbished, comfortable and very clean. If wanting to stay in the vicinity of the train station and its relative proximity to sites in the city, this hotel cannot be beat for quality, comfort and value. My fiance and I really enjoyed our stay. You will too.

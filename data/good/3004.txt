This hotel is everything one would expect in a Hilton; clean well-appointed room, good in-hotel restaurant, and extremely helpful staff. The one knock on it is the fact that the walk from the parking garage to the front desk is really long (longest I've ever experienced). Not a big deal, obviously, but I'd advise dropping your bags off and checking in, then going to park the car. Other than that, a top-notch property.

As many other reviewers have stated, the room is quite small, but the design is fresh & hip!! The location within the city could not be better! Staff was very friendly & helpful. One negative is that all available space w/in the room was taken up by the mini-fridge & the very expensive snacks - would've been nice to have a little storage instead as we stayed 3 nights. The beds were comfy and the rooms/bathrooms were very clean. Shower was in a separate room, which was also quite small, but a great shower with quality fixtures/finishes! Made it nice for 2 people trying to get ready at the same time 'cuz there's no way 2 people would fit in the bathroom!! We'd def. stay there again!!

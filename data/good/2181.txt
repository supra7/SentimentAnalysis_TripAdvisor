A little gem in the heart of Rome, I was so pleased i found this little place, it is bookmarked for future trips. the hotel is a 10 min walk from the bus stops at Largo Argentina, walk down Via Arenula then right at Via Degli Specchi Campo San Salvatore is on the left, look for the brass sign of the hotel. The room was average size, larger than I imagined very basic but clean, bathroom small but also spotless. Staff very friendly, breakfst is delivered to the room on time, basic but nice coffee, and service with a smile. For the price paid the Domus Ester was perfect for me in the heart of Rome, will certainly stay again Campo dei Fiori is a 5 minute walk, visiting the early morning market is a must

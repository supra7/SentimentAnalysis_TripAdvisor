After reading the past reviews I was a little apprehensive on what to expect of this hotel... I booked a basic queen room through wotif.com for myself, partner and lil one, for just over $100 usd.. On arrival we asked for a free upgrade as we had heard that the rooms were on the smallish side, they obliged and gave us a king business room on the 7th floor. The room was good, big enough for us all and all of our luggage. The bed was super comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping at all... The bathroom was a tad small but it didn't really bother us too much!! The location is fantastic and you can walk to all the major attractions in the city - which was great for us as we only had a short time to see everything. The free drinks from 5-7pm was also a bonus!! I'd definitely stay here again if in seattle!! .

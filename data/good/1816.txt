For value, location and old world charm, I consider this hotel to be a good value. Service was good both at the valet, concierge and in the bar/restaurant. Particularly noteworthy service was provided by John and Kody, and there is a fireside sitting lounge where live jazz acts played while we were there. The common areas are warm and adorned with rich woods typical of the turn of the century era that this hotel was built in. We would definitely stay here again when back in the Seattle area.

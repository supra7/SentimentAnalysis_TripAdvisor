Arrived late on a Friday night. Check in was quick and painless. Very friendly and informative front desk staff. Room on the club floor with nice views. Standard sized room and bath. Sweet bed and linens. Safe, two bottles of water and a minibar is provided. Nice flat screen TV with a great channel selection is standard. The club is nice with nice views and a continental breakfast. Lots of fruits, bread, pastries, yogurt, oatmeal, hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes, mozzarella and specialty coffees. Evening canaps are nice with two hot dishes and fresh vegetable platter and drinks for purchase. I found it odd that we had to sign bills of $0 when visiting the club. Of course the tip line on the bill was there, so it felt more like the staff was asking for tips. It was a bit uncomfortable and redundant as the lounge requires a key to enter. The gym is nice. It's on the 35th floor and the pool and jacuzzi are there as well. 8 treadmills, 8 ellipticals, 6 bikes, dumbbells to 50 lbs, many machines and mats are available. The gym is open with key 24 hours. Pool is open to 11 pm. Location is smack in the middle of downtown. Lots of shops, restaurants. The last station on the light rail from the airport is a block away. The monorail is also nearby. Overall, very nice. Look forward to coming back sometime.

After our Alaska seven day cruise, we decided to spend two days in Seattle site seeing. We stayed at the Roosevelt and were very pleased with the hotel, staff, and location. The rooms were very comfortable with flat screen TV and a small sink area. And yes, only one elevator was working - no big deal. The location is something else. It's right in front of a very high end shopping mall with restaurants and a movie complex. It's walking distance from Pike's Market and many other interesting places and shops. You can even take the monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) just a few block away.

This hotel has sprung up over the last few years since my last convention visit to San Diego. It's quite nice and modern, with quite reasonably-sized rooms. The bathroom counter was very spacious (always annoying when there's not enough room for your toiletries). Perhaps the only negative was the somewhat less than luxurious shower spray. Not that it was a drip or insufficient (and I'm all for water conservation), but it seemed just a litle on the narrow or weakish side given the room in the tub/shower (with the amply curved "american-style" shower rod). But it was workable. I declined the extra $20/night for a "view" room of the bay and downtown, but my view from an upper floor was fine (down to the pool and spa area, the Dole shipping facility next door, water, and the bridge to Coronado). I had been expecting a wall or alley view... The location was great. Just on the "far side" of the convention center (bascially crossing the street from one end and you're there), across the street and tracks from Petco stadium and 10 min to the Gaslamp district etc. It takes 15-20 min to walk the length of the convention center to get to the Marriot Marquis and Manchester Hyatt on the other side. Being on the edge of the downtown/convention area zone, it was the perfect balance of convenience, but also less hectic. And whoever thought of putting bumps on a bar of soap and labeling it a "massage bar" is a marketing genius...

I stayed here three nights on business and found the hotel to be friendly, charming and very old world. Granted, it seemed a bit threadbare in places. But the staff was more than accommodating, and the location was perfect to access the Pike Place market, Nordstrom's and many top-flight restaurants. Specifically, my room was a cozy queen, just right for a person traveling alone. It was decorated in classic traditional furniture and fabrics. The bathroom was tight, with a modern shower head, but an old-fashoned tub and pedestal sink. The toiletries were good, but the bathroom -- while spotless -- could have used some updating. The classic TV cabinet contained a modern Vizio TV. The fitness area was outstanding, though small, equipped with two modern treadmills, a stair-stepper and an exercise bike. Internet service was free and powerful -- always a plus. Another plus was the restaurant and a separate cafe-bar under the same roof -- one on each side of the lobby. The food was excellent, ranging from BLT sandwiches to pepper scallops. Moreover, the wine was reasonably priced by the glass. I would agree with the reviews that grumble about the thin walls. I could hear someone's cell phone ringing and faint voices next door to my room. But fortunately, it wasn't loud enough to disturb -- just to distract. All in all, I considered it a good value for the heart of the city, and substantially less expensive than the towering Westin just around the corner.

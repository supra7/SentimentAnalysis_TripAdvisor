The location is excellent: Close to the airport (they provide a fee shuttle), close to the Southcenter Mall, close to Boeing, even a commuter train station in the back yard. So be prepared to hear the trains go by day and night, if you have a room facing north. Large suite, full cooked-to order- breakfast, free drinks at the nightly managers reception, pool, sauna are still included, but the parking lot and the Wifi do not come free any more. Also prices are no more a bargain. But still a lot of real luxury compared to an old-fashioned 5 Star hotel.

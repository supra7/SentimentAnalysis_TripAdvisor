Stayed here 1 night for business. Typical, hip W hotel vibe in lobby and in rooms. As a Starwood Platinum member, I was upgraded to a suite which had a huge living room area and large jacuzzi tub in the bathtub among other extras. Always nice when a hotel goes the extra mile for loyal guests! Location is great for downtown business trips. Would recommend this place for a young couple or group of friends, but not necessarily families.

Great location, minor problem but enjoyable stay.... We stayed 4 nights at this hotel. We loved the location of the hotel. Easy access to city rail and it is the middle op hip neighbourhood with lots great restaurants, delli kind food stores. In the hotel room there is kitchenette with everything you need to cook breakfast or warm up delicious food from local dellis. The bed is comfy and we had inner courtyard room without nice view but very quiet. Rooms are on smaller side but not so small as mentioned in the earlier reviews. The bathroom was indeed quite small but we managed to shower and shave there;) The hotel staff is very friendlyThe only problem we had was mini bar charges incuring twice for the things we did not take. But on the other hand, reception corrected that right away.I did not like though the fact that they charge you for WIFI. Come on, it is 21st age, even some big business chain hotels changing their policy and provide internet free of charge ( or as a part of their total service) and to my opinion, smaller, boutique hotels really should have it available without any extra cost.I would definately return to this hotel if WIFI is free of charge. This is actually the only reason I am not giving excellent rate for this hotel

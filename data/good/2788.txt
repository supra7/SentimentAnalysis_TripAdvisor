I stayed at the Doubletree for 2 nights, at a priceline price of $41 per night. This was my second time staying at the hotel, so I knew what to expect, and everything was as expected. I remembered from my last stay that (especially when booking through priceline?) there was a very long walk to the room. At check-in I was offered a handicapped room closer to the lobby, but after looking at the room, I decided that it wasn't really an appropriate room for a non-handicapped person (shower hose was about waist high, closet rails were also low). So I was given a room in the wing farthest from the lobby. On my first walk to the room, I got lost, and ended up outside, then back inside, and walking up and down stairs several times. On later excursions back and forth, I figured out a more efficient route. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Good assortment of TV channels. Comfortable bed. Room service was available late, but the after 10PM options weren't very tasty. A nice touch is that the hotel has several exercise rooms, so there's one nearby when you want to work out. Nice equipment too. The hotel is close to the airport, and the light rail system that runs to the city means that you can get into the city for less than $3. The biggest negative is that they don't award Hilton Honors points if you're staying through priceline, even for things like room service. I'd definitely stay there again, especially with the priceline rate.

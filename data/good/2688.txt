Reading the previous reviews did help to appropriately set our expectations. Yes the elevator is slow, and yes the rooms are smaller than what we typically expect now. I will say that the room was comfortable for 2 adults, but would be cramped if you're a family of 3+. If you these are minor things to you, then you're stay will be great. The perks were the location (6 blocks straight down from the market). The shopping is a block or two away as well. Also, the Westlake Center (light-rail train and buses) is 2 blocks away, which gets you anywhere you want to go ... including a $2.50 trip from the airport. Also, the room was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Internet is free, but only available in the lobby (not in the room). If you want luxury, this is not your hotel ... but if you're going for a cheaper alternative that's downtown this is a good option for you. Also of note, Von's Restaurant connected with the hotel is great for dinner/drinks.

Let me start off by saying that we stayed here for free... I was a little apprehensive about staying here because we read some neutral reviews. But the property was beautiful, rooms were nice, the pool is great, and it made for a lovely romantic vacation. There is not much of a beach, so if you are looking for great sunbathing in the sand, you might want to look further north to the Westin or Marriott. But there are always seats by the pool... which is a lot of fun. Watch out for the $10 drinks though. Our bar tab got pretty big after a few days. We did not eat at all of the restaurants, but there was one that we loved called Cascades. It had great food, great service and great sushi! This was a nice hotel. I would recommend to any couple looking to relax and spend some time together. I hope this was helpful.

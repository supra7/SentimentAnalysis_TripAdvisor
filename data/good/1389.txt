2 girlfriends went to seattle for a weekend to celebrate a retirement. bought the room on priceline for $125 and after taxes about $150. valet parking was STEEP --$35 !!!! but considering the location of the hotel, it was in the heart of all the shopping! asked for a room in union tower ..only room left was a handicap room with 2 queenbeds so that was fine...only catch with a handicap room is that there is NO tub but with a large shower with a seat...it worked out fine for us because we didn't want to bathe but rather shower. room had small flat screen LG tv, new faucets and great beds. room even had 5 pouches of starbucks coffee and tazo tea which were handy ! the only thing is that there was no bar/lounge in the hotel other than a very tiny deli. the lobby was huge and very nice and the hotel is so central that every block was in the heart of the shopping. nike town is just next door and pacific place mall/nordstroms were just one block away. walking to pike market took only 10min so you can't beat the location. the only complaint i have is the very expensive parking...$35..i think that is probably a few bucks higher than the fairmont. my girlfriend and i just left the car with valet and never touched it until we checked out. we walked everywhere and even came back to the hotel room to drop off packages from shopping twice in a day...so no big deal...had a bottle of wine which we purchased from wal mart and had our own happy hour in the room. great...would definitely return to sheraton.

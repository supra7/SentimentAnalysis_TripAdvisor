My girlfriend and I are University students from Vancouver and wanted to getaway for a couple of days in Seattle. We were looking to stay at a good-quality, reasonable and comfortable hotel in downtown Seattle near Pike Place market. With Hotel Max, we got exactly that. We went online 3 weeks before our trip which allowed us to book for 2 nights at a reasonable price of $139 per night. The artwork at Hotel Max is very unique and nothing like I have seen before. Even though I know nothing about art, I found that the artwork really suits the vibe of the hotel as it appears to cater to a younger crowd. The room was comfortable and has everything you need including a good-sized shower and a wide-screen TV. I loved how we could choose our own pillows and have them brought up to us. Overall, a highly recommended hotel that I will stay at again the next time I visit Seattle.

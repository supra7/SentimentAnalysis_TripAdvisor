Not sure what everyone else is complaining about, I suppose you never hear good, just the bad about hotels... We stayed at the Westin Seattle for the weekend pretty much without any problems. Our room was on the 35th floor in the South tower and had an excellent view of the city. The check in was very fast and same with the valet service, so no problems there. Staff was courteous and friendly, despite the overwhelming amount of traffic within the hotel due to an auction that was held this weekend. No problems whatsoever.

I stay at W hotels all of the time, this is my second stay at the Seattle W, and it's decent. Nothing out of the ordinary, exactly what you would expect from a W. The bed and linens were SUPERBLY soft and comfortable. And I, of course, love the Bliss amenities. Here's the "but"....I love the Soapy Sap (shower gel). I use a ton of it. I shower several times a day. Who cares? I'm on vacation, I want lots of towels and lots of shower gel. When I called to ask some more, on my last morning there, the "Whatever Whenever" person told me there would be a CHARGE for extra amenities "since you're checking out today." Really? You want to charge me for shower gel? If somebody wants too much shower gel, just give it to them. It's a luxury hotel. Surely people have asked for more unreasonable things than excessive amounts of shower gel. I was quite put-off by it, and because of that, I doubt I'll stay here again. As a Starwood loyal member, I may as well go to the cheaper Westin a few blocks away. I would also note that their turn-down service is kind of useless...they come around in the afternoon, not long after they do regular housekeeping. If you are the kind of traveler who spends late afternoon in the room, getting ready for dinner and a night out, you won't get turn-down service, because they'll show up at like 5pm. Really, they should come in the evening when you're already out...like 8pm 9pm. But I guess that's why this property is only considered a "Level 4" when most Ws are considered Level 5. $37/night parking, trying to avoid having nighttime housekeeping staff, and CHARGING PEOPLE FOR EXTRA SHOWER GEL = Cheap tightwads run the place.

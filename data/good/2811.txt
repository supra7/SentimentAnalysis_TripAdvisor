The DoubleTree was convenient to the airport, even though we were part of group travel, the DoubleTree had an airport shuttle. This is a multi story well thought out hotel. There were elevators, gift shop, restaurant and lots of other dining choices just across the street. You could safely cross the street at the light and crosswalk and find your self at a diner or several other restaurants. The hotel staff was courteous and very helpful with our questions. Our room was large and very comfortable. Even though we were there for just one night we would recommend this hotel for multiple night say if you are visiting the Seattle, WA area. We cannot comment on the value, as our price was included in our group travel, so Iwe're sure it was a group or discounted rate.

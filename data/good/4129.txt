This is our third stay at the HR Maui, and we enjoyed ourselves this time as much as in previous stays. I would love to give it a 5, but a few little things showed that they aren't quite up to the Four Seasons/Fairmount level. That's not a big criticism, because they don't pretend to be a 5-star resort. They are a 4-star resort, and do a good job of delivering at that level. Changes from last year: We were told prior to our arrival that the mattresses had been changed out for new ones, but we really didn't notice a difference, either in the bedroom or the sofa bed. We have slept on the Grand Hyatt mattresses in other Hyatt properties, and these were NOT them. They continue to be the only real negative about this property. They now offer a hot egg dish in the Regency Club room at breakfast time. Most of the time, I liked it, and I appreciated being able to start the day off with some protein. A $15 Resort Fee (reduced from $25 due to my Diamond level GP status), which covers several "services" that we didn't plan to use. At all. I resent having to pay for things I don't want, need, or use. But the service was always friendly and competent, and the rest of the grounds was as lovely as it always is. We look forward to returning next year!

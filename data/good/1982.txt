Had a nice time at this centrally located Westin, such a easy breezy walk to all the major attractions. Had a adequate gym, a bit small, but serves its purpose. Facilities were clean, but the rooms are showing some age. I heard that the hotel is due for a big renovation in the next 1-2 years, so I am sure it will be back or even better than its former self. I would definitely return again.

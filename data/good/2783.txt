Appreciated the early checkin to my Miniature Convention held here. Was first told not possible on checking in on day of arrival for early time for room (phoned one week prior to let them know I would be travelling all night and arriving mid morning) but then they were able to accomodate me. Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and spacious. Hotel food was okay but not the best...but the morning brunch was delicious. Beds are very comfortable. Loved the shuttle service! Enjoyed 3 day stay there and would stay again!

Stayed here last week. It was wonderful! My husband & I shared a 2BR/2BA condo with my Mom & Dad. We had unit B100. At first we were disappointed to be near the road & far away from the beach. But our disappointment turned to joy when we saw the inside of the unit. You know how the brochure or online pictures are normally the most beautiful unit & noone actually gets a room that looks like the picture? Well we got it! It was perfectly appointed, clean & modern. The walk from our unit to the beach cabana took less then 10 minutes in flip flops. We did take the golf cart back about half the time & while not required we tipped the driver a couple of bucks for the service. We only swam in one of the 3 pools. The large one on top of the parking garage. The middle pool was a little small & cold and we just never made it to the 3rd one which was actually the closest to us. Pool towels prvided in your room, beach towels at the cabana. The cabana deck was awesome! Loved having a fridge to put our beverages in. The cabana also checks out beach chairs in case the deck is full or the sun isn't on the deck yet. Sun started hitting the deck about 11am. Minor issues that could have been better; need more hangers in the closet, no fan in the bathroom to remove steamy air, tile floor needed mopping & the carpet might need shampooing because our feet or socks got dirty if we weren't wearing shoes inside. Small parking areas near the units fill up fast so you can expect to park in the garage & walk to your unit. Loved eating at Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina. A short 10 min drive South & liked the Times Supermarket about 5 min North better than the Safeway in Lahaina. Also loved picking up the plumeria that fell from the trees to bring back to our unit for decoration.

The rooms have a fresh coat of paint. There is some new art on the walls and you walk on pristine carpets. This is a nice thing. The views are still terrific, with high views of city and sound. The service at this hotel remains one of it's strongest attributes. The people are friendly, quick to help and easy to be around. Ideal conditions for a good stay. It's a relative value given the quality of the stay and the location.

I stayed in this hotel on last September with my parents and brother. It took about 20 minutes from Changi Airport to Balestier Road by taxi. You would find the hotel easily, because it's located in the main street. We had 2 rooms in the first floor. It's very small, and the bathroom also had limited space. You can only sleep and take a shower inside the room. What I like about this hotel is the cleanliness of the room and the friendly staff. When you leave the room on the morning, it was dirty and messy, but when you come back at night, it become clean like the first time you check-in. We had enough sleep quality, because the area is rather quite. The staff was very helpful. It's our first time to go to Singapore, so we asked many things about the street, food, or places to visit. They explained patiently with smile. Near the hotel is 7-11, Balestier Plaza, and also Balestier food market, where you can buy cheap food with good taste (about 3-5 SGD). It opens 24 hours, so don't forget to eat there when you stay in this hotel. There is no MRT station around the area, but the bus station is outside the hotel. Easy access to go anywhere in Singapore.

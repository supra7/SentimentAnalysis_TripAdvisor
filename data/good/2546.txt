Was pleasantly surprised with our room after reading all the comments about the small room sizes. The room wasn't huge, but it was good enough for two people. The furniture and fixtures were nice and modern. The room was quite clean, but could be a little cleaner. the location was great and our room included free wifi and valet parking. The restaurant next door was great. We ate sushi in the evening and had breakfast the next morning. I'd stay here again.

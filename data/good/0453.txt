Relatively good price and central location to major sites (Pike Market, library, symphony, downtown shopping, Pioneer Square, Safeco Field, etc.) We were in a corner room on the 20th floor and had a view of the freeway and downtown (not the best but still better than facing another building!) Our room was quiet, spacious and clean, and the 2 double beds were very comfortable. The room comes with a CD player, and free "welcome" kit with sleeping CD, eye mask, lavender spray and ear plugs. TV was old-fashioned 25" and we had cable, but some channels were fuzzy. We had the hotel's breakfast buffet twice and enjoyed it. At $14.95 per person it was not cheap, but that includes an omlette station and the food was tasty. (There weren't really any other cheap breakfast places close by.) Elevators were really slow! Lobby is smallish and it can get real crowded around check-in/out times. Small gift shop in lobby is open til 10 pm, really convenient for getting snacks, drinks, newspapers, toiletries, etc.

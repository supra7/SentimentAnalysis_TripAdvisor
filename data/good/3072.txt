They've done wonderful job renovating this hotel and their beds are so comfortable! Everything was clean and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We stayed one night for early flight out of SEATAC. Their shuttle service is prompt and quick (it's across the street from the airport). Would recommend to others. What a great stay!

Lindemann's is nice, clean and modern hotel. Its' breakfast is worth of the charge (12,50 eur), however somehow it would have been more expensive to book it in advance than paying it on location. If you are a smoker, the hotel's 1st floor rooms facing to the street are dedicated for you. Just remember when you get out of the shower that the full size windows to the street are transparent both ways. Spacious bathroom was great however it lacked a bidet. The hotel has a wifi for a separate charge, however its limited to one device only which I've never encountered before. All together Lindemann's offers good value to your money.

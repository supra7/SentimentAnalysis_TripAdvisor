Loved our stay-- service was excellent, got upgraded to a suite for a very reasonable price, room was huge and bed was unbelievably comfortable. Only issue was with the temperature in the room-- couldn't ever get it quite warm enough. Shower was lukewarm as well. Not enough to stop me from returning, though!

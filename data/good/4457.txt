Dear Staff at the KBH - My wife and I completely enjoyed out getaway. The staff was pleasant and kind. Many fun activities - we did ukulele lessons, and my wife did the hula lessons. Great snorkeling right off the beach at Black Rock. Great magic show. The Guest Services folks were awesome - and gave us little trinkets to take back to the kids. I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Great sense of family here. Thank you! Steve H. San Antonio, TX

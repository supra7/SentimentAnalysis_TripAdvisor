Stayed one night on a two day trip from OR. Clean and adequate. The woman who checked us in wasn't overly friendly but performed her task. Maybe she was having a long day! Our room had a view of the Space Needle and hotel was within walking distance of other tourist attractions and restaurants. Overall, no complaints!

Very nice intimate all-inclusive for adults. We found the food to be good, especially the French restaurant. However, don't expect 5 star dining. I feel folks are a bit too judgemental on the restaurants, if you want 5 star dining I suggest you don't stay at an all-inclusive. If you want very good dining this will be just fine. The size of the facility is just perfect, again small and intimate. Very nice pool with very helpful staff. The beach, location, staff and rooms are tough to beat.

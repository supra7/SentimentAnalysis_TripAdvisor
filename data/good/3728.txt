We stayed at this hotel a week in March 2010. A very good hotel, clean, 5 minutes easy walk from the subway station Virgen del Cotijo. The staff is very friendly! The hotel has 6 floors with 24 rooms each / floor At ground zero it has the reception, the restaurant and a free Internet poit ! Room is spacious, we had bathroom, Samsung LCD TV, desk, air conditioning, mini bar! The bed is very large and comfortable, even if sometimes squeak! We recommend this hotel, both in terms of price and the conditions offered!

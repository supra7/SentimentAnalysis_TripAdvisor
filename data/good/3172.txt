Our recent stay at the le Crystal Hotel was very enjoyable... the room was comfortable (huge bathroom and indows that opened for fresh air!) and the front desk service was outstanding...extremely helpful and friendly....gave great directions and were very willing to help with any dinner reservations The elevator had issues the weekend we were there and was mildly annoying since we were on the 10th floor but they worked hard to rectify the problem. The 12th floor pool and hot tub could be run better - the staff up there was cold and made you feel unwelcome....also the towels were very small and thin so you really needed two to just dry yourself off. But would highly recommend this hotel - it's in a great location - easy walk to shopping plus the bus stop is right there and the metro is only a couple blocks away as well so very easy to get anywhere.

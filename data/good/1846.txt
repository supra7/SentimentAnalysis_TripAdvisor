We stayed at the Westin a few weeks back and enjoyed our stay. I was amazed at the price of $112 a night, which is cheap for a Westin room in North America!! We had a great view of the city and found the hotel to be in a convenient location. The beds were very comfortable which is my #1 prerequisite for a good hotel room. The staff were friendly and the concierge was helpful.

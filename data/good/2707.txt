Can't say enough positive things about this hotel. It is in a prime location - walking distance to Pike St. Market, Nordstroms, Macy's etc. Our room was spotless - bed was extremely comfortable, staff was helpful and welcoming and the price was great. They offer many specials on their website so be sure to check that out. Canadian chain (Coast Hotels) with a great reputation. Highly recommend!

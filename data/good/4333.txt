Travel agent booked us in the Hyatt for our 35th anniv.We had an oceanview room and a very nice room.No complaints about the room.The beach is very small in front of the pool,you have to walk down it further to lay out.The pool was crowded with most everyone talking on their cell phones and drinking $8 drinks.As per other readers,they 5&dime you for everything($5 bottle water in rm!).We couldn't afford to eat here so went into town every meal and ate 2 meals for what one cost at the Hyatt.Went to Feast at LeLe.Really enjoyed it.Skip the luau at the hotel,it's lame.If you rent a car,take the drive to Hanna.We will go back to Maui but will stay at another hotel.

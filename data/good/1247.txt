I attended a reunion at this hotel and it was surprisingly excellent despite its massive sizeand I really was surprised because I think that this is the largest hotel that I have ever stayed in. The best part was Konoe at check-in whom is one of the few front desk people that has ever made me laugh at check-in. The worse was a domestic beer and a house glass of wine cost $25 at the bar with tip but then again nothing is perfect.

Read thru other review, I wonder what kind of management this Hyatt has? Is it kind of ridiculous to see the customer service only reply to people who praise the hotel and totally ignore and complain and concern of other customer who gave them less than 5 Stars rating. They act like it is the customer's fault to give them a bad review. They do not acknowlege any complain and concern. Through out 1165 reviews, Guest Relations Associate only address 5 Star review only!! It made me wonder during our stay if we bring up some issue, how bad they will treat us?

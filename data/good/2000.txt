We spent the last night of our Washington vacation at the Westin Seattle, we reserved a deluxe city view room in the North Tower. At check- in, we were assigned a room on the 29th floor directly across from the elevator, but it was a quiet weekday stay so the noise did not impact us. View from 2934 did not include the Space Needle, but was gorgeous nonetheless with the cityscape along with Pike Place Market and the water- I could barely sleep even though the bed was divine! Staff were always courteous and friendly, however the room service was hit-or-miss (calamari appetizer was undercooked and rubbery; the chimichurri steak salad with avocado and roasted red bell pepper was quite tasty). Next time we will request a room on a higher floor, but would definitely return, valet fee and all...

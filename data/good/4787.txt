We have stayed in the Maui Eldorado twice and had a great experience both times. Most suites are only a 5 minute (easy) walk to the beach and the pool area is huge and sunny. There are 2 additional pools that we never even used. The Beach Cabana is an added bonus and it's nice to be able to catch a ride with the golf cart shuttle if you are lugging lots of stuff with you. The best thing about the Eldorado is being so close to Whaler's Village without actually being right IN it. We would walk down early every morning when things were quiet and have coffee on the beach. It is much nicer to take quite morning walks in Kaanapali as opposed to Kihei (where I have stayed in the past). The resort is big and the staff are not overly helpful (especially if you rent privately and not through Outrigger). If you're looking for big comfortable suites, lots of amenities and a fabulous beach nearby...this is the place for you.

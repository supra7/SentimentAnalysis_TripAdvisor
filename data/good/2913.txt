Dated Hotel, Needs Work I booked this reservation through Expedia. Once I got to the the hotel, I realized that I made a mistake. The information that Expedia provided me was OLD to say the least. At check in I expressed my discomfort with the entire Expedia experience. The gentleman checking me was extremely nice, offered his help and quickly made my fears subside. I would like to advise others to use a variety of sources and just not Expedia alone to verify the hotel. It seems that they have a problem updating information to there customers. The friendly hotel staff made up for the lack of information and made my stay pleasent. Thanks ONLY to the Incredible service of Mike and Jasmine at the desk. I will be back,but not through Expedia.

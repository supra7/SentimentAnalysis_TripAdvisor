Look, this hotel could stand a makeover. The decor, and especially the carpets, are from 1988. Time to change. Other than that, everything about this hotel is great. The service was fantastic whether you are checking in or at the bar. I'm not sure if it was because I am a Diamond with Hilton or that I'm good looking, but the woman at the front desk called up after I checked in to see if the room was ok. Probably the former. The staff in the hotel give this place a really good vibe and I would and will 100% stay here again. The location can't be beat as it is walking distance to everything you want in Seattle. Oh, there is a rental car company within the hotel, so that makes it perfect for day trips.

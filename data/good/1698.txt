The Edgewater Hotel sits over Puget Sound on piers. It's so relaxing to open your window to the see the water all around you. And nothing's better than having a cocktail while watching the sun set of the Olympic Mountains. The rooms are super nice with fireplace and modern bathrooms. My only complaint is that the hallway is dark - but you don't care once you're in your room. I've also hosted professional workshops at this hotel and this chef makes the BEST conference food of anywhere I've ever been. Delicious!!

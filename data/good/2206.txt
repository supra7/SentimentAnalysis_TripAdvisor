We've stayed at the Watertown, part of their group, but wanted something a little cheaper. After booking our 2 rooms online, I realized that I screwed-up the reservation, and could have gotten a lower rate for the same room. A call to the hotel desk fixed the problem without a fuss. We found the University Inn was a little cheaper than the Watertown, but still a very nice hotel, with nice furnishings in the lobby and the rooms. One of our rooms had a nice view of downtown, one had a view of Mt Rainer. Our rooms were spacious and well maintained. The AC in one room was a little noisier than we would have preferred. We had requested an early check-in, but there were no rooms available. The staff helped store our 7 large bags so we could return later. The free breakfast was slightly above average. The fresh waffles were a big hit. Our room had a good WiFi signal. It was an easy 4 block walk to the university area and it's assortment of pubs and shops. However, walking to that area ensured encounters with vagrants. This is our 3rd visit to Seattle, and the vagrant problem was bad everywhere we went. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the shuttle service was a lifesaver.

This was our 5th 'All-Inclusive' trip to Mexico in the last 10 years and Secrets is certainly close to the top of the list. I can best compare to the Excellence Riveriea Cancun which is of a similar quality. There are pros and cons to each. Food and Wine Better at the Excellence, not always the cooking, but the quality of the ingredients, especially the beef. The house wines are ok at Secrets, but not in the same league as the Excellence, where you also get a whole bottle rather than asking for glass after glass. Having said that - the Beach and Pool service at Secrets is definitely a bonus. At Secrets, all but one restaurant have outside areas for seating as well which we love. Special mention for the Secrets Italian coffee shop. Get your Caps and Lates to go and take to the breakfast restaurant !! Staff/Entertainment Fantastic at both sites but I missed the $20 daily poker tournament at the Excellence Beach/Sea You would have to go a long way to beat Secrets - Simply Beautiful Rooms Pretty similar unless you get a really old room at the Excellence Hotel Excellence is prettier - Secrets is a bit monochome and overly concrete (although looks good at night) Theatre/Shows Secrets is small and shows were ok, but poorly attended. The ROCK show looked great but was too quiet Being Brits we got no real hassle to do the hotel tour and timeshare sell, but plenty of people were whinging about it. If you could mix the 2 hotels together then it would be amazing. My wife preferred Secrets and I leanjust towards Excellence, but they are both damn fine resorts and I would recommend both to anyone

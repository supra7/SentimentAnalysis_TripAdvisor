Great food. Great Service. I took my wife to this hotel and resort for our honeymoon. Let's just say we didn't feel any need to leave the resort. The service at this hotel is impeccable. We were in the preferred club. Carlos took care of us whenever he could. They even serve you ice cream and food while your on the beach. I would really try this hotel and resort. Different restaurants. The Habachi table was the best! The guys really knew how to put on a show. I really should write more but I had such a good time I couldn't remember it all :) CHeck out the pics on facebook. they have their own group. The honeymoon package could be improved. they said we would have exotic fruit waiting for us - all they had was a plate of apples. Not very exotic. If that happens to you, complain to your concierge - they will fix it. The SPA is and was amazing. 24 hrs room service... Preferred club has free wireless internet. Free wireless internet in the lobby too. Lost my blackberry charger, and the concierge let me borrow theirs :) If you're Canadian, I recommend you unlock your cell phone and order a sim card from AT&T. Roaming in mexico only 25 cents a minute! So much to write....

This was our first visit to Maui. We are not frequent travelers, and were happy with our stay at the Hyatt Maui. The setting is beautiful, the hotel grounds are very well kept and cared for. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We did not eat at the hotel other than the Umalu pool bar and restaurant. Food was decent for the price. The beach was clean and pleasant to walk on. Our room was a partial ocean view which lived up to its description. The room was nice and offered plenty of space for the 3 of us. Yes, this place is expensive no denying that. For our needs it was just fine and gave us a lot of pleasant memories.

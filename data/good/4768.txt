It's a great place for an affordable place to stay with simple amenitites. We don't stay in the room too much anyways so it fit us perfectly! Plus: 1)kitchen and fridge - save money on drinks and early morning breakfast 2)roomy bathroom - after a day at the beach you have a good place to wash off 3)walk out decks/patio with view of ocean/golf course,-nice for a morning breakfast or late night star gazing 4)close proximity to public beaches- good access without paying for the price to stay at big resorts 5) washer/dryer- great! they even provide detergent 6) conceirge- expedia guy can book things w/ discounts and specials at the front desk Minus: 1) creepy crawlies: some seen on outdoor patio furniture... 2) not 5 star... but do you really need it if you are gonna explore Maui? This review is bias as we didn't stay elsewhere... but we still liked it!

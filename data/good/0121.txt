Just stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle on 9/12. Very nice quiet corner room (I'm part of Kimpton's Loyalty program, and that is my preferred room type). No view to speak of (looked into an office building), but a very comfy bed, good desk space, window seats, and a huge bathroom. Great perk was the 3 bathrobes hanging in the closet (a long robe made for a LARGE man, and 2 shorter robes more suited for women). Had a great room service experience....food arrived in 20 minutes, and was one of the best chicken sandwiches ever (soaked in lemon juice, and served on a great Ciabatta roll with pesto aioli). Check out was super efficient, and they asked straight away if I needed transportation. When I said I needed a cab to another hotel, they immediately called out to the bellman to have a cab waiting for me, while they completed my check out. A very nice touch. The price of the hotel was my only issue.....everything in Seattle was very expensive for this time period due to a big Microsoft convention and Cruise travelers. All in all, very pleasant stay.

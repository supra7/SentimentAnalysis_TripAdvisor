Stayed here since it had a special hospital rate. Not sure how that is calculated but we didn't get the same rate, but still an okay value. They offered a free shuttle to hospital but anywhere else was about 10-15 bucks for a few blocks or to go to a Mariners game or to one of the popular piers. Located down town and just a few blocks from the Space Needle. A few more blocks to major attractions downtown. The ladies that checked us into the hotel were friendly and gave some good information about hotel and it's resources. The morning managers on the other hand were, not quite rude, but frustrating in trying to get them to give information such as shuttle times, wake up calls and checking out. The room is super small. The dresser drawers couldn't open all the way because the queen bed was occupying the same space. Found a random earring on the dresser. Uses deodorizers so if you're sensitive to extra fragrances it might be difficult but otherwise it was pleasant and not overly perfumey. Overall a fair price for an okay room in a great location I'd stay here again because of price and hotel/ hospital shuttle but am willing to spend a bit more for next time.

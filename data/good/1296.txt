location is great....but... 1. $40 buck valet service 2. $12 buck internet per night factor these in mind when you see the cheap price. Still pretty cheap, but know this going in. Outside of this...hotel is in a great location...service is really good, but I found it a bit noisy. As well, there are no curtains to close, the sun can shine in rather early in the morning. that didn't matter for waking me up as I kept hearing doors banging in the hallway in the morning. Not my favorite choice for a hotel in Seattle, but it was cheap.

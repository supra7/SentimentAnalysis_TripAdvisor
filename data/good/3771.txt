This was our first stay at an adults only resort. We found this facility extremely well maintained and the food was excellent albeit small portions beautifully presented. We were very impressed with the cleanliness, particularly the public areas. Service was almost intrusive, but lovely people. Our one complaint - the only inside cocktail lounge doesn't open until 6:00 P.M. and they play movies at a very loud volume in the same room. Cocktail lounges should be for conversation. This is a beautiful, well maintained resort, maybe a bit too quiet for some.

This resort got fantastic reviews many of which we read on here. Once we got there the resort is older, it's a semi-time share, and there is little/no night life. The rooms are nice, usually looking out on water or the very nice grounds. But they are old. Our balcony was filthy, only because the wood beams and thatch roof was old. Food was good, probably better than average in our 5 years of going to Cancun/Playa Del Carmen. Staff was extremely friendly and cooperative. My guess is many of the reviews are from the "members" who go down there every year the same weeks. The more they fill up the facility and sell more time shares, the less it costs them. I didn't like that and I hated the veiled sales pitches. The beach is very nice. however realize there is a marina literally 100 yrds from the resort beach. Water is very nice and shallow out quite a ways. That is due to the huge black sandbag "whales" which our placed about 200 yds. out to protect the beach. A bit unsightly in my opinion. Very relaxing, very friendly, good food, good liquor selection, great service.

I stayed one night here on business, booked by my company. Overall, it was satisfactory, I arrived late evening, the room on the 17th floor was clean and comfortable, with a great view. The bathroom was a little on the small side, but clean and well equipped. After a good night's sleep I enjoyed an excellent breakfast in the restaurant before checking out. All staff I encountered were friendly and polite.

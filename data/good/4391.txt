I stayed at the Ka'anapali BH from Dec.23 - Jan. 2 and had a great experience. When we first walked into the lobby we were taken aback because it is, as mentioned by others, a bit "dated." However, the hotel is very well taken care of and the style becomes charming. The staff at this hotel were incredibly nice, after a couple of days we developed friendships with the staff and found ourselves to be at-home. The grounds were meticulously maintained and a pleasure. The staff at the Tiki bar were, for the most part, pretty good. Dale is the bomb and a local legend on island. I noticed after a few days that the Tiki Bar is the most popular bar in the hotel area for locals which, to me, says something about the hotel and staff. The breakfest is average at best. If your not getting a package that includes it then I'd eat in Lahaina 5mins away for $15 bucks cheaper. The only complaints I have of the hotel are rather small and I'd imagine other hotels do the same thing. They charge .75 cents to use the telephone, even on local calls. The money wasn't the issue here, I just found this to be a bit petty on their part. However, I'm sure other hotels are doing the same. Another issue I had is they charge a $1.50 per day to use the safe. Of course, it's optional so we just informed the front desk we had no intentions on using it but charges like these could easily be wrapped up into the room charges. Charge people an extra $10 bucks and allow us to use the phone and safe without trying to nickel and dime us. It's convenient, clean, and the staff here are great. I definitetly reccommend staying at this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again.

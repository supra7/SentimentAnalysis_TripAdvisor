After a very bad start in a horrible hotel in Seattle we moved to Mayflower Park hotel and all I can say is that it did not disapoint......lovely hotel, lovely beds, great staff and beautiful building. The room was gorgeous. The food was lovely in the restaurant. the only faults I found was the fact my daughter couldn't go into the bar at all.....she's under 21. I can understand minors not sitting at the bar but they are usually allowed in some part of the bar. Made is awkward to order food during the day. Also the breakfast was a little overpriced. Overall though this hotel will not disapoint.

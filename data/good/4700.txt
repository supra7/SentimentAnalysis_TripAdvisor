Stayed there for a couple of nights, and was very impressed for a hotel in Italy. By my experience, hotels standards here lower than let's say in Portugal or Spain. Nevertheless, quite impressed with this one. It's on a back street, away from the tourist trail, and very quiet. It's 20m walk to rialto, right off the riva biasio boat stop, so perfect for airport taxi drop-off. If I could change anything, would be the rather stiff mattress, provide proper WiFi coverage (not the rubbish 5 hour voucher coupon to poor coverage), and actually have some international tv channels, rather than 20 Italian ones. The shower was amazing, and the breakfast good throughout. The awkward thing about breakfast were the low tables, with couch type chairs. It felt like I was sitting 2 feet away from the table! Despite all these querkyness, I'd definitely return here.

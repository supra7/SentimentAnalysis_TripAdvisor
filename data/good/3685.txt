I spent two nights at the Hilton Garden Inn and overall had a pleasant stay. The room was clean and nicely furnished with comfortable beds and a flat screen TV. As for the bathroom, it was a bit small, but sufficient. I had breakfast at the on-site cafe and enjoyed it. The service was attentive and friendly. The front desk could take a few lessons in service from the staff at the cafe. Front desk service was at best indifferent. I called down to the desk one evening and was greeted by several seconds of hysterical laughter by the front desk attendant. The next day I went downstairs and noted more raucous laughter from the front desk staff. The front desk staff projected an unprofessional image and were less than helpful. Their fun appears to be at the expense of efficient customer service. Given the reasonable rate, nice room, and great location I would stay here again. Hopefully the front desk staff will adopt a more professional and helpful deportment.

We had never been to Venice before and loved the city and found the location of the hotel ideal and easy to find. We bought 72 hour boat passes (33 euros) and managed to travel around the city and islands.We enjoyed Murano and Lido where the film festival is held every September. We regularly jumped on boats and arrived at unplanned destinations for lunch and tea! Our hotel room was on the first floor near the breakfast room but we never heard any noises or got disturbed. The room was large, very comfortable and clean with a super bathroom. The staff were helpful and gave an excellent service. The only thing we found odd was that for a four star hotel there was no bar or restaurant on the premises. The lounge doubled as the breakfast room each morning and each room had a mini bar but there no facilities for making/buying tea/coffee/drinks. There were pleny of local cafes etc where we ate but I missed not being able to make or buy a hot drink.The hotel staff offered to make us coffee but this was not always convenient. I would stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to anyone else. Great holiday and one of the best cities we have ever visited in Europe.

My husband and I booked the "Stress Free" package and stayed at Le Crystal for one night. Our room was a "superior suite" and we was quite lovely. It is obvious that the clientele are discerning and not likely to be staying at your average chain hotel. This is a boutique hotel that offers you very individualized service. Our package included a massage and "banya" treatment at Izba Spa. This unfortunately, is the one area where I feel we were let down. We spent the first 15 minutes of our 1-hour treatment in a sauna (which I don't care for), there was barely enough room for 2 people to lay down as we were instructed to do. After 10 minutes or so, our respective massage therapists entered the room and slapped us with wet oak leaves (presumably to invoke circulation through the body), rubbed us down with a mixture of honey and water, and then took a bucket of ice cold water and poured it on our legs and back. The result here really woke you up! Onto the massage, although the surroundings were peaceful, I would not put my massage in the category of "relaxation", once or twice, I pressure being used was way to much and was quite painful - I receive massage treatment regularly, so I'm accustomed to it. I was also disappointed that there was no time or attention paid to the face or scalp - in my opinion, a scalp massage is a must when doing relaxation therapy of this nature. In the end, I would certainly return to Hotel Le Crystal, but I very likely would not use their spa treatment again.

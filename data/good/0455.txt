I had a good rate at this hotel and had a room on the 24th floor. Great view. The room was nice and clean and I liked the sleep aid, which includes a dvd, lavender spray for your pillows, eyemask and earplugs. I didn't notice any noise but I walked to a baseball game and maybe I was tired! The staff was helpful and very friendly. I stay in Seattle somewhat frequently for business and I would stay here again. Parking is always expensive in Seattle..welcome to the city!!!!!!!!!

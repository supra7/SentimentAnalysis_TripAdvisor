We arrived at 10 pm of a Tuesday; the lobby was very nice and the person at check-in was very nice and kind. There is free wireless internet. The rooms as other reviews said are pretty small, but don't let this scare you, they are not CRAZY small. The bathroom as very nice and the whole room very clean; the bed very comfortable, we slept very well. No noise or problems of any kind. The area was very populated at night, there are tons of bars in East Houston. We just went outside for half hour (it was raining) and had an ice cream one block from the hotel. Best thing: breakfast is included, they have a nice-size buffet. We paid $199 +taxes ($240 tot), not bad for this quality of hotel in NYC; would definitively go back!

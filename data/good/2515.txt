We found the Hotel Max to be a design forward, great hotel in a convenient location and good value for the price. Front desk was cooperative to change our room from one bed to two at check in. Room generous size and very clean and well appointed. Great beds and pillows. Elevators small and valet parking service car delivery was chronically slow. Exorbitant charge for wifi made us go to Starbucks for such. Too, we had no caffeinated coffee in the room which was a bummer when we had a 6 am wake up for a 7:30 flight. When we told the front desk however, the parking charges were removed as a gesture of goodwill, which we found to be very good on the spot problem resolution. We would stay at the Hotel Max again.

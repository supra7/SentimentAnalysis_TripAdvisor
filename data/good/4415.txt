We spent the first week of our honeymoon here and we splurged and went with the Island Romance Package. My husband wasn't totally convinced it would be worth it, but he was really impressed when we actually got there! The package was definitely more worth it than many "honeymoon packages" I had read at other hotels - the picnic basket alone won us over! It was amazing - could've fed a family 4 easily! The hotel had entertainment all the time - there was always music playing, the hula dancers at night were amazing - it was a great hotel! It's also a close drive to Lahaina, where we spent many evenings as there are great shops and restaurants. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel!

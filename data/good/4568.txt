This was my first time to Maui and Hawaii and we could not have picked a better place to stay!. The hotel was only two minutes down the beach boardwalk to Whaler's Village with tons of shops and places to eat. Another two block walk in the other direction is Black Rock where we snorkled every day with green sea turtles and tons of fish. It was amazing! The hotel itself was great. The room could certainly use some updating but it was very clean and quiet and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. We went to the free welcome breakfast the first morning and they entertained us and did about a one hour slide show and explained what to see and do on Maui. Every night there was a free hula and live band show. We had great teriyaki pineapple burgers at the Tiki Shack Restaurant on site. Lahaina is a ten minute drive away with excellent shopping and restaurants - we loved Bubba Gump's Shrimp House. The grounds of the hotel are immaculate with lots of lounge chairs everywhere so you can sit in the shade or sun. The pool is small but clean and we used it a lot. The beach in front of the hotel is awesome but you really do have to be careful of the waves coming in. They will knock you right off your feet and the drop off is very steep very close to shore so be careful with kids and people who don't swim well. On our last day we were sung a goodbye song and given a Kui Kui nut lei which we are to bring back with us on our next trip. I can't wait to go back and stay again.

Comfortable, king bed room with typical Marriott decor & amenities. (love the orange ginger aroma therapy toiletries!). Room was surprisingly quiet even though we were on main floor just around the corner from the lobby, elevator, and bar. Friendly service at front desk. Quick shuttle service to / from airport.

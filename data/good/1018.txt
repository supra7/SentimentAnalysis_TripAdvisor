We stayed at this hotel for one Friday night. The location is excellent for access to Seattle's downtown shopping and attractions. We experienced the best hotel staff I've encountered in years! The front desk (checking in and checking out), room service and maid service. Just outstanding, friendly, helpful people. The rooms are not super large, but plenty big enough for 2 people.

Good location , fast check in although we were simply handed our room key I think it would have been nice if the desk clerk could have said " you are in room so and so floor etc The cd player didn't work lamp next to the bed switch was loose most annoying was the housekeeper knocking on the door at 9am we told her we were checking out at noon then at 11.15 she knocked again same person that was annoying !

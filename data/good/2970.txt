The Marriott Airport Seattle is a reasonable choice in the Sea-Tac area. I paid about $189 per night. The shuttle is generally quick to and from the airport and I encourage its use rather taxi service which can be very spotty in Seattle. My room was in the second floor but in the back of the hotel such that I had a very long walk no matter which way I took to the room. The interior is nice and check in was very quick. Breakfast was good in the restaurant, if not a bit pricey. Drink service in the bar was fine, no complaints. I can imagine that it must get very noisy in the lobby when the crowd is hanging out in the bar. I guess Marriott has a new program where guests are now charged for internet service. Its $9.95 at this hotel, but can be had for free at the business center near the check-in counters. There are two internet PCs and one boarding pass access PC. Personally, the ability to sit in my room and check my personal or work email is nice and I am not sure how many takers will pay extra for the access. And I am hoping not to get nickel and dimed for that. I can offer four stars as the overall quality was good.

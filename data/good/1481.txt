Positives: Very friendly, fast, and helpful desk staff. Reasonable and easy parking (15+ tax). Close to everything Seattle has to offer. Clean, nice and good sized rooms. Convenient restaurant in hotel that serves a good breakfast. Negatives: Noisy street traffic - but this comes with being right in the city. The exterior of the building is pretty rough - the rooms are nicer than you'd expect when you see the outside. You can tell the rooms are older due to some minor things that haven't been updated (closet, furnace) but that's just being nitpicky since they all worked fine. Yes there is a view of a "gentleman's club" but really, who cares? It's just the outside of a building - The strippers keep the strippin' inside.

I actually prefer the W's location to the Four Seasons, the shops are nearer to get to. I also feel that I'm almost outgrowing the W's 'hip' style. There was a party (or after party) every night in the Lobby and the restaurant in the ground floor. The late night parties weren't much of a bother except running into drunk people in the Elevator. True to W's style, the hallways are dimly lit, my companion even commented it might be because they were trying to save on lighting. The room itself were quite fine. We had a higher floor so no noise travelled up, and we weren't disturbed in anyway. The W also offers a free car service to places nearby with their Acura SUV service. The staff for the most part was polite. We checked in late at night and the concierge was helpful in directing us where to go for food, mostly to popular cafe style places. However, we ended up across the street at the Fairmont, they've got a brilliant restaurant, Shuckers. Out of all the staff, there was probably just one single front desk person that was a bit dismissive when we wanted more info (We wanted to get a half day rate since we were going to check out late, I mean, c'mon, we're trying to pay more, so a little service please). Overall, it was a standard stay, I'd recommend it to younger couples and to those that aren't bothered by late nigh social gatherings and occasional drunkard in the elevator (We were there for three nights, and ran into an inebriated person every night). Personally, I felt I was over the age limit of the W. I'm not sure if I'd stay there the next time, the Fairmont looks pretty inviting and is just right next door.

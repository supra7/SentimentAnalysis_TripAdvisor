We just returned from Maui and stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. We were a little nervous coming from the Outrigger Waikiki on Oahu. However, the hotel turned out perfect. We had an oceanview room. We also had the free breakfast buffet at the Ka'anapali Mixed Plate, which was convenient and quite good. The hotel is close to Whaler's Village and Black Rock. We snorkeled daily and went to Whalers for lunch. There is also a Tiki Bar and Tiki Grill which was convenient for drinks and snacks. WHEN we return, we will definatly stay at this hotel again. :)

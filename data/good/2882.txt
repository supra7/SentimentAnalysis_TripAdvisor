My colleagues and I had business near the SEATAC airport and the Hampton Inn was close by. It's walking distance to our meetings locations. The shuttle from the airport was a bit slow, probably due to the volume of travelers and the traffic. But we did arrive and were greeted warmly by the staff at the desk. Check-in was quick and efficient. The rooms were up to the usual Hampton Inn standards - quiet, clean, comfortable bed and good work area in room. The breakfast area was smaller than many Hampton Inns, and it did get a bit crowded - they could do with a bit more space. The selection of itesm was good, enough to satisfy our needs. Overall, we would stay there again..

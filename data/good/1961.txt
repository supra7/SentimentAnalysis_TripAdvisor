Good hotel. Location is excellent, near the subway + monorail, and within walking distance of most attractions. We received a room on a high floor, and there are great views - although the persistent clouds didn't help. Rooms are typical for a Westin, nice, with a good amount of windows to take advantage of the scenery. Internet was extra - free wi-fi in the lobby with a code from the front desk. Everyone at the hotel I dealt with was pleasant.

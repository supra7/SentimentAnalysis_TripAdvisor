This place took me back to the '70s, but it is a nice hotel. The rooms are not fancy, but they are clean. The hotels grounds are beautifully kept, the beach is amazing and the staff is very friendly. The singer/ukulele entertainer on Saturday night was the best I heard on the Kaanapali strip. The restaurant food was good, but the service was a little slow. There seemed to be a lot of retired people. For $200 a night, you can't find a better bargain in Kaanapali.

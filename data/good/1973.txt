I had a seminar to attend, which was happening right at the Westin so it made sense to stay there. I was very nervous after seeing so many bad reviews but I wouldn't let them put you off from staying there. I was in room 3760 with a city view. Maybe I should have changed to the water view but after travelling for 14 hours I was too tired to care. The room was clean and the toilet was nice with a lovely double head shower that was divine. The work station was better than at my office with a great office chair and power points galore. The bed was indeed heavenly. if it wasn't for the jet lag waking me up at silly o'clock I would have enjoyed the best dreams of my life. I could live in that bed it was so good! I ordered room service for breakfast at least 3 times and everything tasted terrific and was of very good quality. You get starbucks coffee on your bedroom complimentary! I also enjoyed a drink at both the restaurant and lobby bars and my big thank you goes to Peter and Hugh who were fantastic. These guys are a great asset to your business - look after them Mr Manager at Westin! I highly recommend the cold water restaurant - had dinner there twice and the food and service were very good. I must say the westin could do with a refurb of its common areas such as the floor corridors and some of public toilets. Oh, how could I forget to mention the location! You can walk everywhere - the needle, the shops, westlake, the market.... the location is spot on. I would stay there again - great service, price, location and BEDS... You can't go wrong with that!

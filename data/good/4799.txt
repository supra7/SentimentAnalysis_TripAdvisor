Very convenient hotel location for seeing the grand mosques, Topkapi, the ancient cistern and other famous sights. The neighborhood is charming but it is the tourist area, so if that bothers you look further. Wonderful accommodating staff, very good breakfast buffet, good, but not great food in their restaurant. Our quiet room had a panoramic view of the Bosporus, however the weird TV setup in our room never worked. No worries we were on holiday anyway. The hotel has a convenient sidewalk cafe for evening drinks and great people watching. The front desk could not have been more helpful. And although the servers were prompt and friendly, a few disparately needed a shower and industrial strength deodorant. I could not even consider arranging a Turkish bath or massage from a host who stank to high heavens! Most of the neighborhood restaurants serving typical Turkish food were very good and reasonable for a main tourist area. For seafood, despite other negative reviews, the nearby BALIKCI SABAHATTIN with its wonderful outdoor terrace was not inexpensive yet it served great seafood with wonderful variety and mostly it was locals who were eating there.

This hotel is nice but extremely big. If you are a HH elite member the breakfast options are a little limited, Starbucks coupon for a coffee and one food item or the hotel buffet for ten dollars. If you have the option stay at the other Hilton across the street, a little smaller, full breakfast and bar.

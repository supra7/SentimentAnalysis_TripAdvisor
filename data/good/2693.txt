Stayed at the Roosevelt for a long weekend. It is an old hotel, rooms have been updated. Great location close to everything in downtown Seattle. Walk to Pike's Place Market, the SAM, etc. short taxi ride to watch a ball game. Rates are reasonable, staff is friendly, lots of people from outside North America met folks from Australia, Germany, etc. The only caution is the elevators, only two and they are painfully slow so be sure you aren't in a hurry to catch a flight or cab.

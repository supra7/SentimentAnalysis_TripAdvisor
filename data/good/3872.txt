I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel during it opening and was quite disappointed so I was apprehensive to stay here again for a conference. The check-in to the hotel was smooth and my initial opinion of the room was positive. The room was average size for San Diego and nicely decorated. Bath was also quite nice. The bed was comfortable and the extra blanket in the room was appreciated. The no so good side were the amenities in the room. The "stylish" and modern trash cans have a tight oval opening and do not accept any type of larger trash. The wash cloths and towels are of extremely poor quality. The first washcloth I used on my face felt like it could have easily been used for exfoliation. And the "free" internet logon was hidden so well that an IT professional would have had problems finding it. I must say that the hotel did correct my billing immediately and pointed me to the obscure field to enter the free internet code into. Room service was good but the server forgot several parts of our order and did not seem to return with them...we did find the missing parts of our dinner in the outside of the hotel room door...not quite sure why she did not even knock to let us know they had been delivered... The hotel location is beautiful and many separate restaurants have been added since the hotel opened. It is very walk-able to the conference center and the San Diego Gaslamp district restaurants and shops. Would I stay here again...probably not.

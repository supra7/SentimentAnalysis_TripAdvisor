7 Days in Maui for Thanksgiving, with my wife and 10 yo son, WOW! This is our second time in Maui, and can't wait to plan our next trip. Brief itinerary of what we did, Zip Lining, Atlantis Submarine ride, Snuba in Molikini crater, Helicopter tour, Paragliding off of Haleakala, 2 Luau's. Briefly must eat at Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahania, great food prices, and locale, locals eat here. Pioneer Inn in Lahania for breakfast, located in the plaza next to the giant Banyan Tree, and the Hula Grill at Whaler,s Village in Kannaapali, for lunch or dinner. To consider avoiding, Zip Lining in Kapalua, overrated, expensive for what you get, not much for views, too much walking uphill. Must do, but not for people afraid of heights, Paragliding off of the volcano, my 10 y.o., did it with me, from 7000ft. could see 5 islands, incredible experience, we can't wait to try again and again, Proflight Paragliding, my wife will consider doing it next time, and she's scared of heights! Now on to the Hyatt Regency in Kaanaapali, not too kid friendly, pool just OK, slide did not work the whole time there, pretty to look at but boring for kids, the so called Game Room, glorified closet, not much there, extremely short on beach frontage, too far a walk from Whaler's Village, a shopping complex with restaurants, like Hula Grill. Also, the resort fee provides free wireless internet, but that wasn't explained to us, so we paid for a wired connection. Room was beautiful, resort is beautiful, but in my view not much to keep kids occupied. I wll definitely stay in Kaanapali again, close to alot, but will try another resort.

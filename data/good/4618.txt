After a rather poor experience in the Upcountry B&B, it was a delight to get to an actual hotel with proper amenities. The grounds are lovely for being an old hotel. We were lucky enough to stay in a building that had been romodeled and our room was spacious and very clean. We were on the third floor of the Lanai building. Smoking rooms just happened to be the 1st and 2nd floors so as your evening breeze came up so did the rancid smoke. Other than this, our room was excellent. Don't leave your sunglasses lying around in your room. The housekeeping staff came into clean and I left. Returned and my glasses were gone and I hadn't taken them with me. If they weren't $100 pair I wouldn't even have worried about it. The nightly entertainment was great. Would have been nice to have more variety but still who can complain it's free. Don't underestimate the Tiki Terrace. The food is INCREDIBLE and Sunday Brunch a must. We will be back but with Cheap Sunglasses.

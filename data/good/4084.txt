Loved the Hyatt Regency Maui with one exception. There's no beach. I had heard/read that the Kaanapali beach area of Maui was one of the best beaches on the island. When I found no beach at the Hyatt, I walked on the beach walk that connects all the hotels in that area and found the beach I was looking for in front of the Sheraton. It was beautiful. The pool area, shops and lobby of the Hyatt are fantastic. The pool area was very crowded all 5 days I was there. The breakfast buffet was very nice (very expensive, but it was included in my package) and I ate at one of the hotel restaurants one night, Japengo, and had an excellent meal. I had a partial ocean view room and it was ok. The bathroom was small and a bit dark. I had a package through Costco Travel that included the room and taxes, breakfast, a car (including taxes) and a $25 per day resort credit which the hotel let me apply to their $25 per day resort fee. The staff at the travel/excursion office were wonderful.

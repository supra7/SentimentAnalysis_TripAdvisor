We just stayed at the Destiny Palms for the first time and we were completely impressed with the customer service. It appears to be a hotel on the rise, a few things still need to be fixed/updated (light switches, AC unit), some appear to have been recently updated (appliances). The bed and pillows were very comfortable and clean. The hotel itself is average (I could take it or leave it) but the customer service was far above average (I would return because of the service). The gentleman whom checked us in was great, the guy who retrieved extra towels for us was very pleasant, the 2 guys cleaning the grounds were friendly, the lady who checked us out was wonderful, and the manager whom was running breakfast was the icing on the cake!!! Kudos to the whole team!!!

I stayed at the Warwick last week to celebrate my birthday. It was a quick visit but my friends and I loved the place. Great views of the city. The beds were extremely comfortable. Hallways reek of cigarettes but our room was fine. Parking is too expensive though. I noticed they leave a Sunday paper at every single door which is nice. I'd definitely stay there again.

Nice hotel, had everything we needed. The hotel is not close to many shops and such, and not in a busy area, but everything you want is walkable. It was close to the water, pike's market, which is all walking distance. The space needle is also walkable (a bit far probably about 25 minutes, but doable). It is on a hill so the walk does get tiring, - we found that we could walk across and then down the hill if going to the water or pike's market area. This place also has a computer in the lobby to print your flight tickets! Was very excited when I saw this amenity! Very convenient!

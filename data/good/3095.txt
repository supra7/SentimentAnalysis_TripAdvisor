wanted to start off that this hotel is always cheaper on Priceline. As a Gold Elite member, I looked at paying regular rate or trying my luck with Priceline, and got it thru p-line. Hotel shuttle took a while to get to the airport, even though on the drive to the hotel I realized I could have just walked there (its literally at the very end of the airport terminal access road). Nice driver though. check-in was quick and easy, the agent even recognized my Gold Elite Status, told me I won't get any points but she would upgrade me because of my status. Was a nice touch! the room accommodations are the Radisson standard, although I swear the TV was a tad on the big side (good thing!). Room was very comfortable and quiet, especially for being on a main road and in front of an airport. Bath felt good, and the bed was comfortable (sleep number). the staff here seemed to enjoy their jobs and showed it.

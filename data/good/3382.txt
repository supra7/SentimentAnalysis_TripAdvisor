We just returned from Secrets Maroma and would definetly return! We normally do not do "all-inclusives" but this resort may have changed our minds about that. The resort itself was very, very nice. Service was very friendly and attentive and the Secrets Entertainment Team was very enthusiastic. The food was good for an all-inclusive - not great - but better than others we have had. We liked the Italian and the Sushi restaurants the best and breakfast at the World Cafe had almost every breakfast food you can imagine. You do have to get up early to get a chair by the pool, but they did seem to be "patrolling" and trying to enforce their rule that the chair can only be reserved for 45 minutes. We used the fitness facility, which was adequate. The beach is beautiful and they do a good job keeping it clean. I think we only saw 1 or 2 vendors on the beach all week. My only real complaint is that I found the bed to be very uncomfortable and it had too few pillows. It was also noisy early in the morning with doors slamming loudly, hearing people in the hallway, etc. The soundproofing could have been better.

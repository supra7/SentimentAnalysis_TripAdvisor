I stayed at the Max early March. Got a good deal on Hotwire for $69/night stayed 5 nights. About a 20min taxi ride from airport....$40. Bleh. I was a late arrival, got in about 12am...... Entering lobby techno music was playing..... Caught me a bit off gaurd, but didnt mind it. Front desk was avaliable and checked me in. Didn't use employees for any directions or suggestions, but did over hear one being so informative to another guest that I take it that each employee would eagerly assist you. My main objective was to check out the area, typical tourist. This hotel is so convienent to everything (walking). RIGHT across the street of Pacific Place, about 10min walk to Pike Place, 15min to the Space Needle, Science Center. Hotel itself is as I would describe retro/grunge/chic.......I was on the 10th floor, corner room.....Kinda had the rocker feel going on. Each door had it's own artwork. My room itself consisted of a King size bed (which was EXTREMELY comfortable). Didn't want to leave the warm room and track out in the 30degree cold. As soon as you walk in you see the bathroom, which was a bit small. The counter in the bathroom is long (stainless steel-ish) but the width is NADA.....couldn't fit much. The Flatscreen tv and desk area was nice. Big Enough to bring up lunch, lay everything out, have your table and watch TV :) Overall though, the rooms are a bit 'space-concious'. Refrig came stocked with liquor, water, even a snack basket.....$3 for a KING SIZED snicker!!!! OUCH! But I was so hungry the morning I arrived I didn't care. ****NOTE for those wanting to stock up on snack there is a BARTELLE DRUGS on or parallel to Olive Way.....About a 5min walk north. All in all I was happy with my stay at the Max.

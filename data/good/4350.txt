We stayed at the Maui Hyatt during Christmas of 2004. We had a beautiful room with an ocean and golf course views (had two balconies). We went to a breakfast/brunch twice at the Swan Court (loved it!), went to the pool daily (it is a very relaxing and beautiful pool, lots of kids though), went to the gym every morning at 6 am Hawaiian time (8 am CA time - easy to wake up :), spent time on the beach near the Hyatt, had dinner at Babba Gumps, Kimo's and Pacifico's (all good places to eat at) - as the Maui Hyatt is close to Lahaina. It is a good place for shopping, dinning, and entertainment. We drove to the Crater and saw the sunset while eating dinner half way down the hill. I really enjoyed the 5-star service and accommodations of the Maui Hyatt. We liked the Drums of the Pacific Luau and the show right there on premises at the Hyatt. Just don't expect unlimited alcohol or great mixed drinks like at other luaus. For some reason, the variety of the drinks wasn't as great as at a previous luau I've been to on Oahu.

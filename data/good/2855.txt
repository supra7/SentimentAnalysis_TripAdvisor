This "airport" hotel was still a 10-15 minutes drive to SEATAC, and I still had to turn in a rental car. That made for an early departure (before the nice breakfast) to catch a 0715 flight. The nearby Westfield Mall was a nice way to kill a few extra hours, with several nice restaurants and food court to eat at.

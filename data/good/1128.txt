Stayed here two nights while attending a conference at the Hyatt, a few blocks away. No problems walking back and forth. Very friendly staff, including in the concierge lounge - able to provide great dining recommendations for all types of cuisine. The lounge is rather small, but good choices in the evening (not open for breakfast). The room was average size, but clean, including the bathroom. The only problem was that the Internet (hard wired only) did not work in my room. I had to host a Webinar that morning, so they immediately sent a maintenance person (after troubleshooting efforts on my part) who verified that it was not working. They moved me to another room in time for my Webinar and sent me a fruit/snack basket with apologies (and didn't charge for the Internet). They really took care of the problem the best ways possible! There is free wireless Internet in the lobby, along with a pay per use business center. The hotel is on the periphery of downtown, but is accessible, especially with the free downtown transit zone. If you are determined to stay at a Hilton, you should like this place. I also recommend you consider the Homewood Suites - Convention Center/Pike Street (see separate review).

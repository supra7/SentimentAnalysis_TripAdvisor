After reading the last 2 reviews I find it hard to believe that I stayed at the same hotel. I've just returned from a trip to Seattle less than 2 wks ago and we stayed at the Westin. In all honesty we had a great room with the most amazing view of the Space Needle and the mountains beyond. There were 3 of us in the room but we felt that there was plenty of space. The rooms was well appointed, decor was modern and up-to-date, the beds were incredibley comfortable, the bathroom was a good size and we found all the staff we encountered very firendly. One of my colleagues lost a camera and the hotel couldn't have been more helpful in assisting her to look for it and in the end they were able to furnish her with a report for her insurance without any problems. The lobby area is nice and big with plenty of seating space. We arrived late and were dealt with speedily and efficiently at reception. The concierge were very helpful with any of our requests for places to eat and how to get around. The hotel is in a great location cose to all the major areas in the city. There are plenty of good restaurants close by and shops plus the free bus around the centre of the city it a great bonus. I would recommend the hotel to friends and if you can request a high floor (we were on the 22nd floor) with a view of space needle, it really was spectacular.

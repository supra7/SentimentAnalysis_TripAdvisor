Stayed here one night before leaving for a cruise Check in was very quick. Staff were pleasant. They put us on the top floor at the end of the hall as per my request for a quiet room on their on-line reservation form. Room was clean and adequate. I did not however like the sleep number bed. To me it feels like I'm just sleeping on an air mattress with padding on the top, and the next day I had a back ache. My husband though, loves the sleep number beds and says they make his back and shoulder feel better the next day. I have tried them twice now and would not want to sleep on one again. Our stay was very peaceful and mostly quiet. We ate dinner next door at the restaurant called 13 Coins. The food was good, but overpriced in my opinion. I don't think I would go back except maybe for drinks and appetizers. I didn't t hink the quality of the food justified the high prices. The following morning the check out was a breeze! They slip a charge slip under your door during the night. You look it over in the morning, and if everything is correct you just call down on the phone and tell them you are leaving. Then you just leave the key in the room and go. Very quick and easy. Overall this was an adequate stay. Nothing exceptional worth noting. I would stay here again if I could get a low rate again (paid $105 for a Saturday night in August) and if they had a room without a sleep number bed.

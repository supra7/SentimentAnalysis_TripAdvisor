I didn't know what to expect going to the Monaco, this was my first Kimpton experience. I had arranged for an airport pickup through the hotel valet but no car arrived. It was easy to take a taxi ($38) and cheaper than the hotel car service would have been. The staff was apologetic and offered a ride back to the airport which I did take advantage of for my return. Other than that, the visit was flawless. Rooms were clean and comfortable, staff was helpful and friendly, food was good. I was celebrating a birthday while there and that was acknowledged with a bottle of champagne which my friends and I enjoyed. Oh, and the goldfish was a nice touch!

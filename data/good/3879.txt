This is a large hotel adjoining the convention center and their rates are surprisingly reasonable. The good - clean, large rooms, fairly soundproof. Front desk is efficient but not particularly friendly. Some bell staff made up for that lack. However, be aware the port side Coronado view rooms overlook a working container port and ships are loaded mostly on Sunday through Tuesday. They are supposed to stop at 10 PM but were going till 2 AM our first night. Bring your earplugs. Although the hotel works well, because of it's size, there can be lines for the elevators, and meal facilities.

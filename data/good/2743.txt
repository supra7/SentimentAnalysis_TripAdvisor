My family and I recently stayed at the Doubletree Seatac overnight enroute to Chicago. We chose it for its proximity to the airport and for the week of parking we needed while vacationing in Illinois. Check-in and check-out were both seamless. The room was big, the beds comfortable. Our park and fly worked out to about $6 a night, and the vehicle was left not far from the entrance to the hotel. The shuttle service got us to the airport effortlessly (it runs every 15 minutes), though coming back we had to wait about 20 minutes. We'll stay at this hotel again, but will taxi back from the airport instead of waiting for the shuttle.

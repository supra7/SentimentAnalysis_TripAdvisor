The resort grounds are beautiful - as is the beach. The service was also excellent. We spent most of our time at the pool and had two issues: First was getting a place to sit. Getting two lounge chairs together was quite an ordeal. You literally had to stake your claim before 8:30 because many guests spread out over several chairs. It was actually funny to watch how possessive the guests were of their "turf". The pool staff tries hard to accommodate everybody, but were not empowered to ask guests to be considerate of others. Resort management should either purchase additional furniture (there is room), or publish rules that can be enforced. The second pool issue was the party atmosphere. We're not exactly Puritans, but the frat party atmosphere at the pool bar was a turn off. One guest even got sick while sitting in the hot tub after a day of doing shots. Not cool... The food was good - not great. The Mexican restaurant was disappointing (food was barely warm) and the buffet for the "Fire and Ice" show was average. The other restaurants and breakfast buffet we very good. We would return to the resort if we got a good price, but will not pay top dollar for the privilege. That said, I would recommend the resort given a few disclaimers.

Two girlfriends and myself booked the Hotel Andra through Expedia. We got a great deal with flights. We were quite pleased with our room. It faced the front of the hotel and we never had any problem with noise. Nice amenities, as others have stated - Frette towels, FACE toiletries, Starbucks coffee. Large closet - great for 3 women with large suitcases and many purchases. Loved the location - a block to Macy's and a little further is Nordstrom etc. The staff were always very friendly. I used the business centre to access e-mail for free. I had my laptop but refused to pay the crazy prices to access internet in the room. We never ate at the hotel, but we did have a few drinks at their bar. Fun atmosphere. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it.

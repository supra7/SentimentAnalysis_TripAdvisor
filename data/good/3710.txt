No real faults with this hotel, we stayed 3 nights at The Stendhal and 3 nights here, while the location of this one is better as far as attractions, the location of the Stendhal is better for trains, so much of a muchness. Slightly smaller rooms, cleanliness the same, breakfast the same just didn't quite have that nice feel of the Stendhal.

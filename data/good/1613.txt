The cost/benefit analysis of the Hotel Andra was skewed for us because we unknowingly had booked for the weekend of the festival parade which goes right along Fourth Avenue in front of the hotel. This annual July event is a huge deal in Seattle, with people lining up along the street in the afternoon. So the good news was that the Italian restaurant next door and its outstanding owner Mauro invited us to return for dinner on their patio to watch the parade, something people book a year in advance. For $200-$250, the Andra would be fabulous, hip, cool, friendly staff, great location. For well over $300 a night when the weekend rates at the brand new Four Seasons start at $285 --- the Andra is overpriced. The rooms are certainly nice enough, and well decorated, although the bathroom is very small and retro. No breakfast is offered. All three nearby restaurants, two next door and across the street, are all excellent. So, if you can get a decent price, I would have no hesitation in recommending the Andra as a very trendy and fun boutique hotel.

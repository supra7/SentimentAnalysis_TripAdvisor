Very nice Sheraton hotel that is near everything downtown. Room was very clean. I believe they just finished a major renovation. The breakfast area was a little small compared to the amount of people this hotel can hold. We waited about 10 minutes for a table. Being this was just an overnite pre-cruise stay I can't really give much more detail. It is only an $8 cab ride to pier 66. Hotel seemed to be very busy on our cruise day. If I ever return to Seattle, I would stay at this hotel again.

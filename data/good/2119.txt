I stayed at the Westin Seattle for a conference being held at the convention center. The hotel was in walking distance from shopping and restaurants. The hotel lobby was very nice and the staff was great. The room was nice but could be renovated for the price. The carpets had stains on the floor. The bed and pillows were amazing. The walls were thin, as I could hear the people next door getting ready. Overall it was a pleasant stay.

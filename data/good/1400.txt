Make sure you request a room in the remodeled tower!! We stayed one night in the old tower and the rooms were very old and tired. The second night they switched us to one of the newer rooms and it was great and very modern. The location of the hotel is perfect...you can walk everywhere. We loved Seattle and would definitely stay here again just in the newer rooms!

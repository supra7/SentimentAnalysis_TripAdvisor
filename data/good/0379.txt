I arrived around noon, 4 hours before my check in time. I just wanted to drop my bag and head out to the city. The check in desk offered me a double room which was ready then, or I could wait for a single King bed. I took the double and dropped my bags in the room. I booked this on Priceline, so I thought I may get treated like less than a customer, but I did not see any of that. The room was on the 25th floor. It was a corner room, with a view south, not of the Space Needle, but a nice view anyway. The 25th floor is a "quite" floor, no kids. Which was nice. The room was nice, clean. I would be glad to stay here again on a future visit. I took the train from the airport ($2.75) and walked a few blocks to the hotel. If you are going to primarily stay in the downtown area, there is no need for a car. Everything is within walking distance. If eating is one of the main reasons for the visit, (it always is for me) the walking helps you feel less guilty. The bar/lounge is on the 2nd floor. Nice little place, too bad it is not on an upper floor, so you can enjoy the view. I went to the bar at the Renaissance Seattle Hotel 2 blocks south and had a few drinks. (28th floor)

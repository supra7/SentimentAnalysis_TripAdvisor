I have stayed at Hotel Max three times and have been happy with each stay. The location is PERFECT! Right downtown! The only thing that I find negative about Hotel Max is how small everything is. The elevator can hardly fit two people plus luggage and the rooms are tiny. But they are very artistic and trendy which helps make up for the size.

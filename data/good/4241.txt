This is a beautiful resort. Setting is absolutely awesome. Most gorgeous lobby I have ever seen. Staff was terrific. Our booking agent failed to properly book our trip, but the assistant manager at the Hyatt went out of her way to make up for the travel agency's mistakes. The pools were wonderful and, although we were there over Thanksgiving, the water never seemed too crowded (although it was difficult to find a chair by the pool, at times.) The pools wind their way through various formations and waterfalls. There is a very long slide that is not terribly steep and accomodates adults, as well as children. There is a beach area in front of the spa, although the water isn't that clear. However, that is true of the entire beachfront strip in this area of Maui. On the downside, the rooms are very small, although decently appointed. Food is overpriced and we had two bad experiences at the Umalu Restaurant: At lunch, our waiter disappeared after taking our order. The hostess was not at all helpful. Another waitperson saw us sitting there forever and eventually grabbed our food for us, which was, by then, ice cold. We decided to return for dinner to give the restaurant a second chance. It was a Thanksgiving buffet and the turkey consisted of a pan of dark meat remnants. It was the most unappetizing Thanksgiving display I have ever seen--and costly. Overall, a good experience at this hotel, but don't expect much from the rooms and avoid Umalu's--unless efforts have been made the improve the service there. Shopping arcade on ground floor was terrific.

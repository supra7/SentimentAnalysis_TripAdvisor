Got a room for 4 on Hotwire. Arrived before 10 am and was immediately given an upgraded room on the top (47th) floor, with a great view of city and water. Asked for and received an additional rollaway bed at no charge. Front desk people were friendly and helpful. Concierge was especially helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. Pool was nice and a decent size. Hot tub was good. Lots to do within walking distance. Light rail to airport was easy.

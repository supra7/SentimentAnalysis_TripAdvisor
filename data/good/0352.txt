Two old ladies, returning from an Alaskan cruise, drove up to the Ace Hotel in a cab. After having wrestled with eight pieces of luggage for several days, they were dumbfounded to see that the hotel is a walkup. No problemo. A couple fellas got the luggage both in and out of the hotel in fine form. The only thing the ladies had to do with their pieces of luggage was sit on them in order to zip them back up. Soooooo......staff was helpful in every regard, rooms were clean and interesting. Thoughtful of the maid to leave the ladies a package of M&Ms instead of the Kama Sutra book and a condom.

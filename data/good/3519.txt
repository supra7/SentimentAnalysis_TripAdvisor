We were in a group of 20 so this review is based on everyone's opinions, rooms were compared Preferred club vs non preferred: Hotel grounds are beautiful. Pool great. Specialty restaurants are so-so: Mexican and French not good, Italian and Japanese good. Buffet pretty good. Preferred Club not worth the extra money. Only differences: private check in (regular check in never had a wait), "upgraded" mini bar- we got a package of M&Ms and a Fanta orange soda (this was seriously the only difference). Alcohol in the mini bar included 2 coronas and 3 small 2 oz bottles of liquors. Private lounge: had snacks (yogurt, nuts) and bar- but never saw anyone there. The site says that PC guests get in first for dining and have a minimal wait if none- this was never followed as we did have to wait and did not seem to matter who you were. Room: very nice. Little privacy- toilet only has a partial door and there is no main door to close to the bathroom, so dont stay here if you are shy about going to the toilet. Jacuzzi tub nice and standard in all rooms. Outdoor soaking tub- took 1.5 hours to fill, not worth the wait. All rooms are the same size, even if you pay hundreds more- so just get the cheapest ocean view. Room service: good and fast Wedding review: Very disorganized. Wedding coordinator awful. Got the wrong menu, then the wrong meals. Had to pay extra $500 for alcohol at the wedding....thought this was all-inclusive and everyone had paid for alcohol with their package? Violinist good. DJ good but only played for an hour. Mexican trio only played for half of cocktail hour then left. Officiant dressed in street clothes and difficult to understand what she was saying. Golf cart 30 mins late picking up bride. Salon- great with hair and makeup.

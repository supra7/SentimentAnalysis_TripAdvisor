This was my first stay at this property and I was not disappointed. Every employee that we encountered took the time to get to know us and make sure we were satisfied. It is obvious that service is their number one priority at this hotel. My husband and I stayed on the Regency Club floor and I was surprised to see that the rooms were a bit "tired". Nevertheless the staff makes you forget about this quickly. The beach area is great and the hotel is located within walking distance of shopping -Whalers Village. The hotel can seem to be overcrowded especially in the pool area. If you have kids or traveling with a large group you may not notice. However if you are a couple looking for some quiet relaxation the pool area may not be your thing.

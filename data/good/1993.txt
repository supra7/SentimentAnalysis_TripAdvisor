I enjoyed my stay at Westin for 3 days. First, its location is convenient. Its just minutes from Pike Place Market, major transportation, and shopping. The room was clean. The front desk and housekeeper were friendly. The concierge was excellent. They helped me to book a tour admission and car rental (with excellent rate) within minutes. I wouldnt mind to go back at all.

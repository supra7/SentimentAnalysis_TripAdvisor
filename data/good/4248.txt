The Hyatt is a huge hotel , the grounds are beautiful and the hotel has a very nice art collection. The rooms are clean and spacious. This is a typical Hawaiian luxury chain hotel, The food is Ok but the restaurants are crowded. The pool is jammed with teenagers , it is not very relaxing to sit at the pool ,everybody is on top of one another, not enough space, make sure you get up early to even find a seat.

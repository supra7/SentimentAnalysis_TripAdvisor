very nice new hotel in a quiet area, not too spacious, very clean and fragrant, for those who don't like big monumental places but with climate and charater, restaurant on the roof, much to choose for brekfest, dirtect conetion to Fiumicno from Stacione Tuscolana (5min.), just near the Metro station Re di Roma, next time in Rome I'll choose CineMusic for sure, just perfect

We stayed here for three nights in August 2011. Our room was clean, spacious and well furnished with a comfortable bed. The hotel is within walking distance to the Pike Street Market, the waterfront and public transport. Staff were attentive at check in and the hotel was more than willing to hold my bag for a couple of hour whilst I killed some time after check out. The lobby area was a nice place to sit and whilst we did not use this facility, the gym did look to have a good selection of fitness equipment. The only complaint I had was the wireless internet. The speed and connection was fine, however it was disappointing that you could only purchase access for one device per session. Connecting a second device will disconnect the other. I have no problem paying for wireless internet, however it would have been nice if we could connect more than one device at a time. During our trip, we stayed in less exclusive hotels that allowed multiple connections on the one access code.

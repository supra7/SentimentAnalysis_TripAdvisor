We've been to the El Dorado before and both times we thought it was what we expected. It's a good value accomodation. There were a few things in the unit that needed a bit of attention (cabinet door in kitchen wasn't working) but they sent around a maintenance man within a day to fix it. They definately need more BBQs though. We were in unit K111 and there is no easy way to get to the pool or BBQs (you have to walk through the parking lot or on the side of the building that has mud). Overall the place is clean and quiet, they have a shuttle to the beach if you don't feel like taking the 5 min. walk. Walking back from Whaler's Village at night can been tricky - there are no lights on the golf course pathway.

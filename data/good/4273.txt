This resort is fabulous, we just returned (11/5-11/12) from a wonderful vacaion at the Hyatt. Make sure to upgrade to an ocean view room and have your breakfast included as the breakfast buffet at Swan Court would be $58 for a couple. Cheaper rooms have cheated views. Our room was nice and clean. The resort is huge and has plenty to see between the wildlife and all the shops on the property. Eating on the resort is a bad idea...$22 cheeseburgers at Casscades. Whaler's Village is walking distance, there are restaurants and shops there. Also Lahaina is 10 mins away. I have come to the conclusion that the people who've ragged on this resort are comparing it to hotel chains like the Ritz, Mandarin, and Four Seasons...it's not that sort of luxury. In fact there are none of these hotel chains on Kannapali Beach. So if this is what you're looking for go elsewhere. The Hyatt Regency is relaxed luxury and I would give it 4 stars. That said it's the niceset property on this beach. I have no idea how anyone could compare the Sheraton with the Hyatt...anywhere for that matter. The Sheraton has it's perks, like quietness and being on at black rock, but that's about it. The Hyatt is big, it's lively, and oftenly attracts large groups. However, we we never disturbed during our romantic stay by children or loudness. We found out that there was a club on the property, in the same tower as we were in and we didn't even know it until we came out at 2:30am for the Sunrise at Haleakala tour. It has the best pool for kids and adults. Always found a chair, but for the best spots get up an save your spots. The chairs are freakishly cloce together, but if you save your spots early you won't have to worry about that. There are flowers everywhere on the property, I always felt like I was following a flower girl. I didn't see any of that on any of the other properties that we toured. It's a gem.

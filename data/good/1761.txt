we stayed @ Edgewater many years ago. This time with Priceline.com, we got a nice room for $ 99, but decided for $ 50 a night to upgrade to a huge, water front/with balcony and chairs, room, well worth it. very tasty breakfast with views of all of Puget Sound and mtns. free shuttle took us/and picked up to convention ctr, restaurants. nice staff. great value! great walks to nearby olympic sculpture garden, restaurants, and nearby pikes street market.

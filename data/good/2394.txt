Overall I had a great time at the W. The room we had was spacious, clean and comfortable. The people working here were nice and the drinks at the bar were awesome. I didn't use the work out room, so I can't comment on it, but I do wish they had a pool. We went over to the Fairmont to use their pool (my parents stayed there). The bed was slightly uncomfortable (a little too firm), but for the most part, we enjoyed our stay.

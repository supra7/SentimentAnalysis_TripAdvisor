I had a very pleasant 3-night stay at the Andra over Memorial Day weekend. The hotel staff was very pleasant and attentive. We had one of the larger rooms with a wet bar and walk-in closet. The beds were super-comfortable and the room was quiet! I think it was a combination of good sound-proofing and conscientious staff, because there wasn't the usual housekeeper noises at 8 a.m.

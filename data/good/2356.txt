The W is known for its exceptional style and service. Other than some troubles with the valet service, the Seattle W does not disappoint. The room was beautifully appointed - comfortable and sleek furnishings with the well known *heavenly bed* standard. The bathroom wasn't quite as exciting as we expected, but the ample assortment of towels and toiletries was great. W is perfectly located for many of the downtown attractions and shopping areas. If you need a short ride, please take advantage of the Acura free ride service while it lasts. The concierge and Acura reps were friendly and fun. The only drawback was the parking situation - I knew in advance it could be spendy to have a car - but $37 plus tips to the valet per day was above my guess. The cost was especially disappointing, when the valet was often too busy to take the car into the garage. A few times they left it sitting in the street while jockeying everything around...not my preferred comfort level on a busy street. Valet staff was incredible and quite courteous, just extremely overworked with a poor setup for a garage. I'd stay at the Seattle W again in a heartbeat, but leave the car somewhere else.

We stayed at the Moore Hotel pre and post cruise to Alaska. We had a suite witha seperate bedroom for our nephew who was traveling with us. It is not the most modern of hotels 100 years old. If you arte into historic this is the plaace. The rooms are clean. It is a bit noisey due to traffic out side. No Air condiationing, but you don't need it. Walking distance to everything including busses to Sea-Tac. Night desk clerk robert, knows all the good spots to see..Would stay there again

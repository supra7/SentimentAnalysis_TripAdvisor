Beautiful beach. Food was very good. Even though the resort was full there were always lounge chairs available. The resort felt half-full, private, upscale and the quality of entertainment was very good ( been to riviera maya 4 times at different resorts). The rooms are nicely appointed, but there is very little privacy in the bathroom. The door and the windows don't block the sound at all. You will hear people walking by your room and even service staff dropping plates few floors below (we were on the 3rd floor). If you aren't very sensitive to occasional noises the resort is perfect. Music at the restaurants is great, low volume,classical masterpieces. Top shelf liquor, including gray goose, ketel one.

When we first checked into the hotel, I knew we were in trouble because several others from a Conference being held at the hotel were checking in at the same time. The woman working the front desk seemed annoyed by everyone and was trying to get through the line as quickly as she could. She put us in a room with 2 double beds, which as a Starwood Preferred Guest member I was less than thrilled about. We went upstairs and our room was fine - clean, good view, decent space - but for an anniversary trip, not exactly the sleeping arrangements one could hope for. We went out to dinner that evening and came back to a quiet lobby and a smiling woman working the front desk. We talked to her about getting a room with a king size bed and she was more than happy to honor our request. We ended up in a large, gorgeous room with a direct view of the Space Needle. From that point on, I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever about the hotel (and to be fair, our smaller, double bed room was nice ... just not what we reserved). Aside from our room, we were thrilled with the jacuzzi and made use of it frequently on some cold February evenings (I just wish parents would realize that it's an indoor, public space and ask their children to behave accordingly). The location of the hotel is stellar - easy walking distance to shopping of all kinds, including Pike Place Market. We wanted to drive to the Olympic Peninsula one day during our trip and there is a great Avis rental car across the street which was extremely convenient. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family and would have no problems staying here again.

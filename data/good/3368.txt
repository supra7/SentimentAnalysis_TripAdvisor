The staff was great, the beach was great, and the room was great. The iguanas, monkeys, and "mexican raccoons" that inhabit the area around the pool and rooms are super cool. Opportunities for the resort: The portion of food they give you is small (true for most international destinations), and how long it actually took to get that food. (45 min and longer). I'm 6'4 225, and I need more food at dinner than they offer. The other problem, and I admit I'm a bit wierd on this one, but I don't drink alcohol or soda. I'm a lemonade, tea kind of guy. These were not options at the resort. While I appreciate a bottle of water, it gets old after 4 straight days. Overall a good experience, but I think it's a one and done destination for me.

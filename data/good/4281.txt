The hotel was amazing and the staff went out of their way to meet our needs and answer questions. The open air lobby with the abundance of plants and birds lent an old world charm that was very relaxing. The gardens were meticuolusly tended and lush. The natural wood used throughout the hotel is rarely found today in newer hotels...it was beautiful. The hotel bars and restaurants were excellent with incomparable views. A major drawback was that the swimming pool was very overcrowded with people that were probably not hotel guests. Guests are supposed to be wearing a wrist band provided by the hotel while at the pool. Not one staff member ever checked ID around the pool to see if people were actually guests. It is not fair to your paying guests to not have access to the pool chairs, etc. We noticed that many people using the pool and surrounding outdoor facilities were not wearing ID wrist bands. One morning while we were waiting for the shuttle bus in front of the hotel, we noticed that people were parking their cars in the hotel lots and exiting directly to the hotel with their beach gear. Even putting aside inconvenience to your guests, isn't this putting guests at risk for pick pocketing or other crimes?

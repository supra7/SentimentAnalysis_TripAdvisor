We usually stay at The Hilton Gaslamp Hotel when in San Diego. When we made reservations, the Gaslamp Hilton was booked. We stayed a few blocks away at The Bayfront. We really liked the hotel. The front desk staff and concierge were very good. Our room was fairly small but clean and nice. The bed was comfortable and we all slept well. the bathroom fixtures were a little stained looking so maybe housekeeping cleaned up quickly before we checked in and missed some things. The views Coronado Island and the Pacific Ocean were fantastic. We had a corner room in which we could see down the coast and out into the Pacific. Gorgeous! As Hilton Diamond members, we were given breakfast vouchers at Starbucks. No hassles and the staff there was quite accommodating. The pool was clean and warm and inviting. The poolside service was a little slow and I felt another wait staff would be beneficial. Overall, I liked the hotel and we will stay again.

After reading reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to go with this hotel... but to be honest I was a bit reluctant. But man am I happy we did! Let me start by admitting I am a hotel snob. So I like to stay at chain hotels. Ones I am familiar with. But in Maui, those hotels are outrageously expensive! This was our honeymoon and we wanted to do other things then just sit in a hotel or at a pool. Spending our budget on a hotel for a week was not my idea of a good time. So we found this hotel and it was way less expensive and it was on the best beach in the area. The pool is small but it does it's job. The grounds are gorgeous. The rooms are older but they're clean! The staff is so nice! Very accomodating. If you want to see Maui and do all the fun stuff there... stay here! The rates are much better and you won't blow your budget!!! One thing though, the food here isn't all that great so you will have to eat off property.

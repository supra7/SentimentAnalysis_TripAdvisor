The rooms are smallish but for a single traveller who only slept in the room it was perfect. The bathrooms were funky if not a little dark, but fit for the purpose. There was breakfast included which was a great spread along with complimentary internet. I was also pleased that there was a gym not too far that did a good rate for hotel guests. The local area had a very cool vibe with lots of cool restuarants and cafes. I have no complaints about this boutique hotel

great location, you are walking distance to anything and everything. Great price with modern clean rooms great service-buffet breakfast is morning is good they serve eggs if you want something hot in the morning. Good to stay as a couple or with a friend but not more than two per room... the rooms are too small for a family. The turkish baths were also great after a long day of sight seeing. I recommend this hotel.

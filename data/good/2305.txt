On your way to the HVP you will pass breathtaking views of Mt Ranier and the Pugent Sound. Another thing you will notice is all the mega-chain hotels that are big and tall enough to offer a great view. You wont find the HVP soaring in the sky like the Crowne Plaza or the Sheraton but that is what makes this boutique hotel one of Seattle's BEST kept secrets!! Upon arrival I was greated by two or three excited and ready to help Bellmen. The hotel itself is a "vintage" 11 story brick structure smack in the heart of the city surrounded by beautiful parks and cute shops and restaurants. The location is the absolute best, about 4 or 5 blocks to anything you would ever want: The waterfront, The market, Pacific Place, The monirail, Public library, and more. I had booked a double-double room but that turned out to be too close to the elevator for comfort. I spoke with the front desk and I was upgraded with a smile to a double-delux. The beds were so comfortable it seemed and if I had never left home. Internet is complimentary and the beautiful high-tech public library is accross the street if you need anything further. I arranged a trip to Boeing Feild through the Hotel and everything was smooth and ontime. No problems with anything, I had a great experience!

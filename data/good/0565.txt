The combination of early jazz playing, the lighting and decor give a great hipster feel when walking into the main lobby. Tuesday nights they have free wine tasting and there is always a friendly person at the front counter. The rooms have a feel of a small flat rather than a hotel room. The close proximity to the bustling lower-Queen Anne neighborhood also contributes to a feel of an apartment rather than a modern, insulated and detached hotel room. Clearly these can also be seen as negatives but for those who enjoy feeling like they are "right there" in a local scene, those folks should enjoy the MarQueen. The amenities like a full refrigerator, a microwave, dishes and a kitchen sink only add to the flexibility of one's stay. There are many local eateries around the corner as well as a large grocery store and banks close by. A main bus stop is just one block away and a short 10 minute ride will get you to the heart of downtown. Our experience with the MarQueen staff was that the doorman was extremely attentive and the rest of the staff very cordial. As you will note from the other reviews here, there isn't an elevator in this hotel and those that have a physical disability or simply don't want to walk stairs, well, you might want to look elsewhere. I would definitely stay at the MarQueen again.

We showed up without reservations on Black Friday to spend the weekend shopping and visting with friends. We had friends that we knew would be checking in at this hotel later in the day, but none of us had ever stayed there before. We walked in at 5 in the morning and ask about the possibilities of getting a room. The front desk staff had us all squared away and even got us in the room net door to our friends all with in 1/2 an hour, if it even took that long. We even had additional friends meeting up with us the next day and between both rooms we had several cars. Parking cost were very reasonable. Noting threw this staff off. They were always prepared. The hotel rooms may be a bit dated and the bathroom doesn't have a lot of useable counter space, but the place is extremely clean, comfortable, and is extremely convenient for walking to the stores in downtown Seattle, Pike's Market. We had planned to go to Jazz Alley and knew that it was in the general area, but were very pleased to find it was just a walk across the street! The restaurant has good food and a great staff. I plan to stay here the next time I come to Seattle. It has no frills, butit has it's perks all of which are worth the no frills, with it being so conveniently located and so reasonable priced, with a wonderful staff that I would recommend it and will myself be back to stay.

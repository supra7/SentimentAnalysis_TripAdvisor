I want to love the W, all of them. The W Seattle is a beautiful hotel. Beautiful design, trendy lobby, cool bar, great rooms, fantastic location. But I do have some issues. The only smile from we saw on a staff member was the woman who checked us in and one of the valets. Everyone else seemed so grumpy and unhappy. This might be petty, but where are you supposed to hang your used towel? We stayed 4 nights and they never replenished the soap/shampoo. $13 for a gin & tonic. We were booked here for a week, which started over a very busy weekend in Seattle (all hotels in the area were very expensive). The problem is that we were booked at the very expensive rate for the whole week. I went online and saw that I could book the room for Mon-Thur for 40% of the rate we were paying. I went to the desk and asked them to adjust the rate for those nights. They flat out refused, period, no negotiating. Fine, that's not a problem, we just checked out. Sure we had to pack up and move to another equally nice hotel, but a small price to pay. Took the huge savings and spent the money at some of the wonderful restaurants that Seattle has to offer.

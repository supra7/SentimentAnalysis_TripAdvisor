Had a stay with friend at this hotel for 4 nights. We asked for rooms at the front side of the hotel, because the back side is looking at the (noisy) restaurant area. Rooms can be small, so ask for a more larger room. Quality of the rooms is good and they are clean. Breakfast is of a good quality. We had a pleasant stay there. The location is great. A lot of restaurants around the corner. The main shopping area is only a block away and so is the Tunel subway to the city (to the Galata bridge where you can take a street car to Aya Sofia etc).

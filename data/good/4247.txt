We stayed at the Hyatt Maui from 9/22-9/28 for our honeymoon and had a wonderful time. We both thought the hotel was very nice, however, once we traveled to the Grand Hyatt in Kauai we realized the Hyatt Maui is a good hotel, but not as great as the Hyatt in Kauai. The rooms were very nice and spacious. Though we did have a problem with our AC (we had to be moved, to a free upgraded ocean view room!) we didn't let that bother us. Both rooms we stayed in were great and we never had any other issues. My wife loved the lotions and such that they provided. The grounds are very nice and in September they are not crowded at all. We always got good spots at the pool, no matter when we went down to get them. We got to taste the new poolside restaurant which was very good. Some prices are inflated here, but that is to be expected in the resorts, if you walk to Whalers Village you will find things much cheaper, especially drinks.

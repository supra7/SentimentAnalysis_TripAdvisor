Was in Seattle for business during a week when there was an enormous international convention which completely overwhelmed the city. However, the staff at the W really gave it their all to try to accomodate all their guests and their needs. When the hotel is full, the public facilities (restaurant, bar and public seating areas) are inadequate, but again, the staff ran around trying to keep people happy. I had a corner room which was lovely and a nice escape from the crowds downstairs and on the street. It wasn't my first choice for a hotel (too big and young crowd), but the only one where I could obtain a reservation. I doubt I will return, but the staff really deserves some recognition of the incredible job they did recently. As with many high end hotels, you are nickel-dimed with internet charges. If the Marriott can provide internet for free why not these hotels?

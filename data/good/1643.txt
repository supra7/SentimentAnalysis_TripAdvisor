I have recently returned from the Hotel Andra and can say that I was pleased with my experience. The room we had was lovely and the people who served the hotel were very accomodating. We had breakfast @ Lola twice and the food was absolutely delicious! The location of the Hotel is perfect. I would stay there again!

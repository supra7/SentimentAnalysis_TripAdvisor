I just got back from six days at the Hyatt Regency Maui. The hotel offers a friendly helpful staff, beautiful grounds, loads of amenities and a great pool. I was impressed with the service and cleanliness of the rooms, grounds and pool. The pool and hot tub are open 24 hours. The hotel even has a Hertz desk onsite. The great thing about this hotel is that it is in walking distance of an outdoor mall. I enjoyed my stay here the only drawback was the beach which ( as other reviewers pointed out) is not as nice as if you stayed further down the beach. In front of the Hyatt the beach is rocky and the water is brown but if you like to walk along the beach like I do you can find blue water and wider beach in front of the Westin. If you have never been to a Luau go to the one at the Hyatt but its not something I would do twice. The night I went to the Luau it was a beautiful warm night but the previous night it poured. As one reviewer pointed out the Hyatt will continue with the Luau even if it rains. From my room I could see people sitting in raincoats in the pouring rain (not a drizzle) the night before and I know they had to be miserable. I had read lots of reviews prior to picking the Hyatt and I was still torn between the Hyatt and the Grand Wailea so I paid for one night stay there as well. I can tell you there is no comparison to the Hyatt when it comes to staff and service. The Grand Wailea is grand and the rooms and bathrooms are nicer but the pool water was murky and the lounge chairs need cleaning and the food was more expensive than the Hyatt which was pretty expensive. I prefer the Hyatt. I would stay at the Hyatt again or try the Westin next time which looked very nice.

What a great trip, I am late writing this review. My wife and I stayed at the hotel on January 1&2 checked out on the third. Hotel location was very good and afforded us the opportunity to walk around downtown Seattle without a care, thats the nice thing about being on a mini vacation. We spent a bit of time in the Lounge on the top floor of the Hotel, what a view! Service was fine and the wine was nice. On Saturday night we made a reservation through the concierge with "Purple" what a great evening, I would recommend this restaurant and a flight of wine. Knowledgeable staff and great service. The concierge made several recommendations to us and each one was as good as the last, we were recognized when we needed to speak with him and we were treated royally, I will go back to this hotel if only for the Concierge.

We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Maui the first week of May. Once again, wonderful service, great room, great everything! I can't understand why some nitpick this hotel. As for those who are dissatisfied with the partial ocean view rooms, you need to request the Napili tower if you want a good partial o/v. I too wouldn't want to overlook the cemetery, so stay away from the Lahaina tower. We always request either the atrium tower or the Napili. On our last stay we were on a Priceline deal, so we already had a pretty good deal going of $185 per night. While checking in, the front desk informed us that we were in a golf/mountain room [they upgraded us automatically again, for the 5th time] so we inquired about upgrading to a deluxe ocean room in the atrium tower, so we paid an additional $80 per night to upgrade to this fantastic room. Ordinarily we don't pay for upgrades, but because we got such a great deal to begin with, the overall price of $265 per night for a deluxe ocean room was an excellent deal, especially since that room would have cost us $450 had we booked directly with Hyatt or $400 per night via any other package deal. For us, that made the trip special. We were on the 19th floor and the bathroom was even a little nicer, with extra storage and drawers. Housekeeping was prompt every day. The new pool bar/restaurant Umalu was a disappointment, but only because they increased their prices exhorbitantly. We loved the old pool snack bar/restaurant much more. Due to the price gouging, we went off-campus every day to CJ's Comfort Zone and brought our food back to the hotel, or we went next door to the Marriott and brought back food from their snack bar. Other than that minor flaw, the trip was perfect.

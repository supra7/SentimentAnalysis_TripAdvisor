We stayed there for one night when we had to change our plans and fly into Rome because of the Volcano. It is a short cab ride, or moderate walk from Termini station, if you take the Metro line there is a stop actually 1 block from the hotel, which we found out later. The pics on here and Venere.com don't do it justice, its much nicer and in better condition. The breakfast was good, better than other places we stayed, with cereal, granola, yogurt, eggs, pastries, and cappuccino made to order. The room had plenty of space for the two of us, even had a little balcony onto the quite street (quiet for Rome that is). The location was great, as I said there is a Metro station close by, Trevi Fountain was an easy walk, and the Colosseum was maybe 10 min away on foot. All in all, a great place to have as home base. We wanted to stay there again when we decided to go back to Rome, but the weekend rates were out of our range. Will definitely try to book it when I go back to Rome, because I AM going back to Rome!!

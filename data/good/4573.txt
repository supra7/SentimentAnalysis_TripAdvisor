Overall good experience at KBH. Great location between Black Rock and Whaler's Village. Pool is very accomodating for young children with 40% of pool 2-3 ft deep. Check in was okay, had to wait till 3:30pm. Clean rooms, grounds, friendly and helpful staff. Rooms: Had ocean front room 5th floor in Kaua'i wing. Great view of sunsets, better sunsets on the beach. Clean room with basic hawaiian decor. Double beds for parents and both kids (2 and 5). Balcony was great to relax on. Grounds were well kept. Beach towels are located at the Trilogy shacks. The Tiki bar/grill had general bar food with drinks that are reallly strong!! Plenty of lounge chairs and room at the pool. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Kids programs included a Passport program that encourages kids to visit different venues and activities to receive a gifts. Must do the orientation morning breakfast and lei ceremony at your checkout date. Great information and part of becoming KBH ohana. Mixed Plate restaurant was good with some local food on Thu and breakfast was good with variety of foods. Not fancy, just good, decent breakfast. Nightly ground activities with free shows of hula and music. Access is easy to Whaler's Village, just walk on the boardwalk . 5-10 min walk. Overall would stay there again. Not too fancy as some of the other hotels, but the aloha spirit certainly makes up for it at the KBH.

My husband and I just returned from a 5 night stay at Secrets Meroma Beach In Riviera Maya last night. The hotel itself was beautiful despite the rugged long dirt road that brings you into the hotel. The staff are very accomadating and welcoming. We booked the "preferred" club which was an upgrade which gave us a private room to check in and out of and computer access as well as tv viewing and some snacks and a bar. Nothing too smashing there though. Thats about all you get for being a preferred guest. We also booked a swim out room which was a waste because the water was freezing .The sun never saw the water based on how the building was facing. We did meet the people next door who decided to move to a different building where the sun was and they said their swimout was actually warm. The restaurants were nice, the waiters were friendly. The food was better at some than at others. The Italian was especially great! The mosquitos were awful! The bug repellant didnt work! Some of the entertainment was good but most of it was very amatuer and actually bad. Overall I would say the beach was beautiful as well as the resort itself. The people were very friendly and welcoming. We did see the stray dogs on the beach, they were sweet and we too were feeding them. We also saw people with nooses trying to catch them but we were told they were bringing them to a shelter to save them to be adopted. I sure hope what we were told was the truth! I am actually sick over what I read in the last review and hope that Secrets would not be so cruel! I now wish I would have inquired more about the dogs while I was there.

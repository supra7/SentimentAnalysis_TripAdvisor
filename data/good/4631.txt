If you read any bad reports about this place,forget them!! Just spent 9 nights of bliss in this wonderful location.The hotel isnt the most modern but its very well kept by the friendly staff who never stop working. This was the best place to have a honeymoon or even get married.Lahaina is just 15mins in a taxi and well worth a visit. If your after late night partying go to Ibiza(Spain) Mr & Mrs Senior (Yorkshire,England)

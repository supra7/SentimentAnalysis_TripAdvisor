We had a very enjoyable 6 night stay at The Westin in October 2011. The hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance of all the downtown attractions in Seattle. Theres a large drugstore right across the street, a rental car location opposite and the Monorail for the Space Needle departs from the nearby Westlake Center. The 5th Avenue Corner Caf situated in the hotel is a convenient place to grab breakfast with a good range of options at a reasonable price. We had an outstanding view from our Grand View room which was clean and tidy. The dcor in the room as well as the rest of the hotel could do with updating but it didnt detract from our stay. The beds were comfortable, theres an in-room safe but unfortunately you have to pay to use the fridge. There are 3 computers which you can make use of in the lobby but at a charge of $7.95 for 15 minutes! On our previous visit we stayed at the Grand Hyatt but The Westin is a superior option.

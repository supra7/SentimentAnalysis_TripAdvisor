This is a good value hotel in the trendy Queen Anne district of Seattle. The rooms are large and spacious, ours had a kitchen and lounge ( left over from when the building used to be apartments I believe ). The hotel has lots of character, unlike the bland appearance of the big chains. The staff were friendly and helpful, the doorman happily got us a taxi first thing in the morning before we set off. The hotel is surrounded by a few coffee shops, bars and restaurants, which was nice at it saved going back into town in the evening. A nice hotel in a nice part of town, we had a very enjoyable stay.

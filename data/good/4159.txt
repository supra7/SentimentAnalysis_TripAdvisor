The Hyatt Regency is a nice large hotel right on the beach. The grounds are beautiful and it has a great pool area for both adults and kids. The children's section has a sandbox, spray park and waterslide...very entertaining and family friendly. The rooms were kept very clean and were fairly spacious. However, the balconies were so small. There was hardly room for two chairs. Overall it's a very nice hotel, but I'm not sure if its quite worth their regular price of over $300 a night. Go if you can get a discount.

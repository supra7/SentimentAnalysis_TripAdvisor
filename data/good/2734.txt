Stayed in the high-rise portion. Room was spacious and clean. Nice size bath. Ate at on-site bar/restaurant which was good. Staff asked family with small child to move to restaurant portion which was the right thing to do. Lobby has PC with printer to check in to airline and print boarding pass. Printer didn't work but able to check in for flight. Complimentary shuttle nice although couldn't fit everyone on a Sunday mid-AM!

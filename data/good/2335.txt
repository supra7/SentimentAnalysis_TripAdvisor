The W hotel in Seattle is really well located, within walking distance of pikes place and various other tourist attractions. The hotel staff are friendly, the vibe is slightly posh and the hotel has an old money feel to it. The bar in the lounge area serves fantastic cocktails and a nice touch is the drinks in the lobby area that are free.

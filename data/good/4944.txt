We had a very nice 4 day stay at the Le Reve! We knew about the quirks (rocky beach below the water-line) and the rough road - so were not surprised by this. The sand on the beach where you relax was super soft and we did not bother with shoes on our walks up and down the beach. The room was comfortable and clean and we loved not having a tv. The restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was awesome. We liked it being adults only, and we found the staff attentive but not overwhelming.

I would recommend this clean, modern (if a little basic) hotel. The staff were wonderful especially with my young son and a special thanks to Laarni and Ginger. The room had an LCD TV on the wall and a dvd player which suprised me but no window. This was fine but only because I had an Ipod so I could know what time it was. If this is a problem just ask for a room with a window. Great location for the underground and lots of little local food stalls nearby where u can eat for a few bucks.

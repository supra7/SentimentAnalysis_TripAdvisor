The hotel has amazing staff throughout and consistently. Rooms are generous size and well decorated. Loved the Bliss soaps and lotions and lush bath towels. The low light is annoying if you are someone who likes well lit rooms and Ambient light in hallways is depressingly dim. Lots of attention to detail to make guests comfortable and the $4o parking fee made easier to tolerate by friendly staff. For a special weekend or over night this is a great spot.

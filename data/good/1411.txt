I managed to get a renovated room which was very nice. It was clean and nicely furnished. They do charge for internet access which was a bit cheesy but seems to be par for the course at more expensive hotels. The hotel has a nice location downtown with easy access to whatever you need downtown. This is a non-smoking hotel which is different from most Sheratons as I understand. One guest who was next to me as I was checking in was rather livid when she learned this. The concierge desk on the first floor is helpful. There is a book with menus for the surrounding restaurants and a phone to make reservations on your own. This was convenient as the concierge seemed to be pretty busy most of the evening. The breakfast in the hotel was very good and if you want to shell out the money, its worth it. No complaints, this is a very nice hotel. I am dinging down one star for the lack of free internet access.

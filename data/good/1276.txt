Booked 3 rooms here for a multi-generational family trip. They were able to get us all on the same floor, which was extremely convenient for us. Pros: - excellent location, lots to see and do in walking distance - friendly staff - fitness center and indoor swimming pool are really nice Cons: - beds are doubles instead of queens and a little too soft - no free wifi and parking is ridic, but these are true of many downtown hotels Overall a solid hotel. Would recommend it for tourists who care about proximity to sights and shopping.

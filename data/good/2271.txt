Everything at the Hotel Vintage Park seems well thought-out. I appreciated the full-size, top-qualty toiletries and the attention to being "green." Nice flat-screen TV and quick, delicious room service dinners. Desk staff were helpful and resourceful. Enjoyed the afternoon "Arnold Palmer" beverages in the lobby as well as the evening wine tastings. While you are staying here, be sure to walk across the street to take in the fabulous spaces of the Central Seattle Public Library. My only criticism is that the elevator call button was not working on our floor one morning, and staff failed to post a notice advising guests that it was out of order and suggesting they call down to the front desk so they elevator could be sent up. Pretty annoying when I was trying to catch a scheduled bus departure. Did I mention free wi-fi, too? That's always a plus.

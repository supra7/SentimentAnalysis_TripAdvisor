I booked my entire trip through TRAVELOCITY...big mistake. TRAVELOCITY takes your money up front. They do not give you a detail billng until you ask for it. Then when you ask for it, it is incorrect. When I first booked I was only booking my flght and of course they said they could save you money by booking all together..BIG SCAM. Upon my arrival to the Hilton Seattle Airport Conference hotel I was told that the hotel did not have any rooms.WHAT....I paid for it through TRAVELOCITY two weeks earlier. They took all my money up front and you are saying you do not have my room!!! APPALLING. I have had to chase down my money for the first nights stay though the Hilton, and several e mails and telephone calls to TRAVELOCITY. SCUM=TRAVELOCITY....They agreed to credit my card 105 dollars for a room that was over 200 dollars a night...sent me a BOGAS receipt stating that my airline ticket was 658 when it was only 431.The Hilton did not help me recover my money. Do not book with the HILTON SEATTLE AIRPORT. The rooms are wonderful. The way they handle reservations is ridicuous. P.S. What ever you do...DO NOT BOOK YOUR TRAVEL through TRAVELOCITY. If you owe someone money..they take it....if TRAVELOCITY OWES you money...THEY KEEP it and tell you your refund will be credited in 7-10 business days and then do not give you what they really owe you!!!

My husband and I stayed at the Domina Home Ca' Zusto for the first 2 days of our honeymoon in Italy. We do travel a lot around the world and are used to high standards in terms of accomodations. We found the hotel to be very clean, boutique like and with very helpful staff. The breakfast was varied and there was very good free wi-fi connection in the rooms. The room was a little small but the matrimonial bed was actually that and not 2 singles stuck together... It was a few minutes walking distance of Piazza San Marco, which was perfect. We had peace and quiet where we were and only 5 min away was all of the action of Venice. We would definitely recommend it to couples of all ages and even for business travelers.

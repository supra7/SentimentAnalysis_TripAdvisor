Seattle airport is a little painful. It has unpredictable security lines, it's very crowded, and often the flights come and go very early or very late. So it's nice to stay real close, and I often do. I've stayed at the Hilton, the Radisson & the Hampton. They are all fine, but this Doubletree is the best. It is very large. The bar is unusually nice and the breakfast (my favorite: eggs benedict) was as I like it. Good internet, and very quick 24 hour airport shuttle. The rooms are definitely 3-star -- very clean and comfortable, just not luxurious.

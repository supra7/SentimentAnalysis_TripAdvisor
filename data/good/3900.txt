We were in room 2215, which is in the middle of the floor facing North, It did have a nice view West to Point Loma and the ball park to the East with nice city view in between. Late night drinks on the deck outside was nice, the appetizers were just OK and next time I will most likely skip them. HATE paying $27 per day parking but that is standard now a days.

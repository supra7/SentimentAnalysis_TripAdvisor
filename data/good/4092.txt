Hyatt Maui is a 4 star hotel but their concierge service doesn't live up to this level. I asked which spot on the way of road to Hana was the scene of the movie Jurassic Park and got the answer: I don't know, you tell me if you found out. I found, from google, the place is called Garden of Eden. My wife wanted to know the shopping place in the vicinity of Hyatt. The concierge staff recommended Canary Mall and Whaler but missed the most important one - Front St. The bathroom fixtures are so old and loose, need to be replaced. Expect the free parking is difficult in the evening and the valet service costs $18/day.

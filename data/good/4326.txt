Just returned from a one week stay at the Hyatt Regency. Maui was wonderful and I can't wait to return. The hotel was very nice with one execption: if you're going for a honeymoon or quiet get-away, this is not the hotel for you. It is extremely family-friendly which for us meant spending our vacation with children everywhere. We had screaming children next door to us, surrounding us at the pool, at the restaurants, at the SPA!!! - it was impossible to get away from them at this resort. Anyway, the resort itself was very nice - the landscaping, pools, restaurants, staff and rooms were excellent. I would go back if I had children along. Maui is pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. Be sure to get the "Maui Revealed" book as it gives excellent tips and advice. The book was our Maui Bible. Snorkel at Black Rock and grab some Pizza and BJ's in Lahaina. Enjoy the beaches and sun! I miss them already!!

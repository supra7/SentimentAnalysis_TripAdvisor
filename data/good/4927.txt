after a conference stay in expensive hotel 2 colleagues and I wanted a cheaper option. All the other hotels I could find at this budget had many terrible reviews amonst the good reviews. So, anxious prior to arrival, especiialy when taxi driver said there was no hotel at this address. Fortunately we had already driven past it on a previous excursion and knew it was there. Another anxious few minutes waiting to be buzzed in, door a bit temperamental and traffic noise drowns out the buzzing sound. Then the narow staircase up. More anxiety as nobody at reception for several minutes. Then the 1st of several very pleasant and helpful receptionists arrived. We said we were going to the oratory and he printed out instructions for the bus route. The place is clean and well-kept. The suite had a closed bedroom with a double bed and balcony. Living room had sofa bed which had seen better days. TV and wifi worked fine. Kitchen fine. 24hr grocery store below and supermarket 30 seconds walk away. Location fine. I would be happy to bring my wife and kids here in the unlikely event that I would ever want to vist montreal again.

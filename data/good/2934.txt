We, my family of four, have used this hotel as a stop over for many years. Traveling in from the east coast with another 4 or 5 hours of travel after we land, we find this the perfect place to stop and rest. The hotel is beautifully designed. Pool is one of the best. The service is always excellent and the food quality stays high even in room service. The good points: 1) great shuttle to/from airport. 2) car rental next door (very good deal minus airport tax). The money you save on a day of car rental pays for the room alone.

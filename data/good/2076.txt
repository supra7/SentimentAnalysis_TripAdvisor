We travel to Seattle 4 times a year and usually stay at the Hyatt Grand. It's true that the Westin isn't as posh as the Hyatt Grand, in terms of interior design but we loved it anyway. What made it exceptional was the accomodating staff. Particulary the front desk clerk Hillary who sent chocolate fondue with strawberries up to my daughter for her 13 birthday. We had an great view from our room, everything was clean and functioned well, the pool was a treat and the location couldn't be better. The beds were luxurious. We have no complaints and we now prefer the Westin to the Hyatt Grand. It's the people!!!

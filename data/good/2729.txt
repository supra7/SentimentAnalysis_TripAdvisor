Although this trip was for a very sad occasion. The staff were accommodating. They allowed us a early, early check in to a large top floor outer room with two extremely comfortable queen beds. We flew Alaska air and this hotel was maximum 10 min. walk from airport to lobby. The new light rail was 1 1/2 blocks away and a 25 min. trip to downtown Seattle. The food was good both in the Restaurant and the breakfast cafe and the portions large. (Being a Californian I'm used to big white plates with bird scraps.) This hotel and staff made a hard trip very easy. Thanks to all.

Stayed here for 4 nights on a recent business trip. The hotel was well maintained and clean. The rooms are pretty good size with a good internet connection. The breakfast was very limited, mbut there is a cafe right next to the hotel. There is free on site parking, the lot is a little tight. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would stay here again.

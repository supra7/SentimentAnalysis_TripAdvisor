I thought for sure this place would suck, but it was actually quite nice and very safe. Just 4 blocks from the center of Madrid, staff was very friendly and the rooms were very clean. Noise was an issue at times, but not as bad as I thought it would be (tip: bring ear plugs if sensitive to noise). All in all it was pretty cool and I got to meet some other travelers there which is what staying at a hostal is all about right?

The Moore Hotel is an older building, yet scrupulously cleaned and maintained. The staff were very helpful and courteous. The prices were great. However, its chief advantage is its location. At the corner of 2nd St. and Virgininia, it is only two blocks from Pike Place Mkt! It is also within easy walking distance of the Convention Center area. One block either way puts you on major city bus lines to connect to the stadiums to the south, or the Space Needle to the north. Airport transportation via the Shuttle Express vans drops you off/picks you up at the door of the moore for a great price. Two cruise lines dock at the waterfront directly below the Moore, but HAL and RCL dock closer to the Pioneer Square area. We stayed two nights pre-cruise, and two nights post-cruise at the Moore and felt it was a bargain. I would advist to request the upper floors, as street noise was noticeable in our room on the fourth floor. Also be aware that there is no air conditioning, but this was not a problem at all during our stay in August, 2006. If you want luxury and pampering this is not the place for you. However, for a clean room at a great price and in a great location, the Moore is the place. I would definitely stay there again.

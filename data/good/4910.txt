We really enjoyed our stay here! Nice rooms, clean, good sized. Friendly and courteous staff. Free internet (even offered us a free mini-computer to use in our room). Nice breakfast. Quiet street, short walk to Termini Station. Close to shopping and very well situated to see the sights of the historic centre. Offered a shuttle for 14 euros/per person, a deal when the direct train to Fiumicino is 11 euros/per person. Would definately go back.

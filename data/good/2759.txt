After 2 weeks around the pacific northwest, we were lucky enough to spend our last night here. Finally, a spotlessly clean, spacious hotel! Next time, i would consider staying here and taking the light rail downtown, it was that much better than other hotels. Beautiful woodwork and large restaurant too. Free computers with Internet in the lobby.

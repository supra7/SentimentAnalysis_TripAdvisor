This was my first visit to Cancun. If this will be your first trip, be warned that when you arrive at the airport, keep walking until you see the transportation to your hotel which will be OUTSIDE of the airport. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were transferred to the preferred lounge where we officially checked into the hotel. We were handed warm towels and a glass of champagne. When the check in was complete, we were escorted to our room. Not sure what happened with our reservation. I had requested a swim out suite and was pleasantly surprised when we were booked into the honeymoon swim-out suite. It was nicer than my house (living room, kitchenette, two plasma tvs, two bathrooms, shower for two and whirlpool bath.) I've been to St. Barth, BVI, etc. and this was the nicest beach that I had ever seen. Unfortunately, the scene at the beach for lounge chairs in competitive. We had to get up early (7ish) to get a front row lounge (yes, having a beach view was important to me). I had never been to an all-inclusive before. I enjoyed the food/drinks at the beach, around the pool and the World Cafe, but found the food at the other restaurants a bit different than what I'm used to; however, the food was still enjoyable. The beach waitstaff was a bit rude. I was reprimanded for putting shrimp tails in a glass and when I asked for Dos Equis, the waiter was rude in telling me that they didn't have this beer and then detailed the resorts beverage contracts.

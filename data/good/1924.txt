[3.5 Stars] The short story: it's was just an okay hotel with an amazing staff /// From the moment we walked into our room we had problems that the staff worked vigorously to fix. Without getting to specific about my problems on the visit, I think a major renovation would be necessary to have this hotel operate with class in the coming years, as the infrastructure is showing much age. Overall, I would supposed it's a nice place if you're on a business trip and want to use it just to sleep in, but it needs some work.

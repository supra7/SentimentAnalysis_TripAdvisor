Overall, this place was pretty damn good. I stayed on the club level room, and enjoyed their free goodies every morning. The bed was so damn comfortable, it blew my mind. I need to ship that thing with me wherever I travel for business. However, the lines for the front desk, were always very very long. It's a huge place I suppose and there is always a large amount of traffic flowing either way. Craziness. Also my card kept demagnetizing and/or my club lounge access kept getting booted off their computer. So I had to go to the front desk a whole bunch, ended up cutting the queue a few times as well.

Comfy pillowtop mattress and new bedding. Clean. Stayed 2 nights and no issues with airport noise even though next to SEA-TAC taxiways. My only complaint is the bath countertop is small and designed for very short people. Bonus is the window on 3rd floor opened for fresh air. Reliable Hilton high-speed internet. Neighborhood is a little dicey for solo female diner but a short drive to Redondo Beach for dinner at Salty's solved the problem. Front desk made reservation and provided driving directions. Redondo Beach beachside boardwalk is popular with walkers of all ages. Salty's also has an oudoor carry-out window for budget diners.

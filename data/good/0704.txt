The Moore is not fancy, but is very functional. The location is great, the rooms clean, the staff very helpful, and the rooms are large. We had no problem with the location and the homeless--no worse than the rest of Seattle. It is within easy walking distance of almost all tourist attractions. And--it has 100 year old character. It's not some sterile, cookie cutter hotel.

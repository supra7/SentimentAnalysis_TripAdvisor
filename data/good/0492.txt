The I@QA is a well-run budget hotel right next to Seattle Center and in the heart of lower Queen Anne. My girlfriend and I stayed there two years ago for Thanksgiving (being held at a friends house down the street), and when we decided to go to Bumbershoot this year we stayed a second time. Both were week-long stays. Keep in mind that this is budget accomodation- in this case that means no elevator or bell staff, and rooms that are older and could probably use a new coat of paint and upgraded plumbing. Accepting that this is the case (and knowing beofrehand what the rooms are like), I could not fault anything about our stay. The rooms were kept very clean, the common areas are charming and the courtyard (as mentioned by others) is kept very lush and inviting. They must have a good gardener on staff! The kitchenette is always appreciated, if for nothing else than the mini-fridge for our beer and left-overs. The desk staff were helpful and efficient, and we felt very safe both in our room and in the neighborhood. We will stay at the I@QA again for sure- the price is right and the location is amazing.

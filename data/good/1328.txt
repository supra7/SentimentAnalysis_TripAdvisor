Beautiful hotel in a great location. Close to many attractions! It is a very large hotel geared for the business people. I sometimes felt swallowed in all the busyness of the hotel but the staff was very freindly and helpful. The bed was comfortable and room was quiet. I was never bothered by outside noise.

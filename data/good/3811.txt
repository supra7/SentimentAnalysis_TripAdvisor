Overall we enjoyed our experience and had a lovely vacation. Our room was fantastic (swim-up), the pools were well kept, the property was quiet despite the marina and some construction, and the staff was very pleasant. The food was good but not outstanding. Make sure you ask for a topper on your drinks. In addition, the service was SLOW SLOW SLOW and the portions were SMALL. The service at the restaurants was our biggest complaint and the main reason we most likely will not return. In addition, the food at dinner was not that good (minus the Asian restaurant). We tipped from day one and even that did not seem to help with service. In fact, we felt that the more we tipped the worse the service! In sum, if the service at the restaurants had been better we would be returning as we loved the room, the size of the resort and the beautiful property.

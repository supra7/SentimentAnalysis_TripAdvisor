Based on reviews here at Trip Advisor, the Hilton at 6th and University was not my first choice when I looking for a hotel in downtown Seattle. My sister and I had booked a short 4-day Pacific Northwest cruise originating in Seattle, and wanted to use my free Hilton Honors room certificates for pre and post cruise overnight stays. When I went to make room reservations, I found out that the Hilton was about the only hotel in downtown Seattle where I could use the certificates and get a room with two beds. It all worked out for the best. The Hilton turned out to be comfortable and accommodating, and was within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Westlake Center, and the Transit Tunnel. The rooms were small, which Ive found to be typical of downtown hotels in big cities, but clean and well stocked. A breakfast buffet (approx. $13) was served every morning on the top floor with a view of the bay. The front desk staff, bellmen, and concierge were very friendly and helpful. We had a few problems with the room we stayed in pre-cruise. The toilet had a small leak at the top near the handle where you flush, and the thermostat didnt seem to work. We had to turn the temperature down to 64 degrees before we could get the humidity out of the room. The 2 lampshades/light fixtures between the beds were askew and we couldnt get them to stay upright. The lamp near the window had a similar problem and was bent. I reported the problems when we checked out the next morning. I would have reported the toilet leak and the thermostat problem the night before, but I got in late after a 4-hour flight and just wanted to go to sleep. The room we received post-cruise had no problems whatsoever. If you fly to Seattle and want to stay at the Hilton, I recommend taking the Grey Line Downtown Airporter that runs about every 20 minutes and drops you off and picks you up at the front door of the hotel. A round trip ticket only cost $25, as compared to $32 each way for a taxi.

My husband and I recently spent 4 days and 5 nights at this beautiful resort. I won't repeat all the glowing reviews written about the property because they are all true. Our stay was near perfect until day two when we obsevered a topless female on the beach. By the next morning there were two other topless women walking freely about. We decided to move to the pool to avoid the nudity. As we were leaving the pool to return to our swim-up room,two of the topless ladies were in the swim-up. We were disappointed that nudity was allowed on the beach because it is a private beach, but we were shocked that it was allowed inside the resort!! We would expect that the resort be responsible enough to inform its vistors that attire is optional. For this reason, we will not return to El Dorado Maroma.

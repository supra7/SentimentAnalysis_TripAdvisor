My family and I just returned from a week at KBH. I have to admit that we had some trepidation about the hotel, having read some of the negative reviews. But my concerns were put to rest as soon as we got there. We had a very nice oceanview room - it was comfortable, absolutely clean, and perfect for what we needed (who spends a lot of time in the room in Hawaii??). The view from the balcony was spectacular. Here's the deal. If you're looking for a luxury hotel, pampered service, a big pool with slides and waterfalls, KBH is not for you. This is not a luxury hotel. We've stayed in four star hotels and like them very much, But for this vacation we chose to go the more Authentic Hawaiian route. KBH is comfortable, welcoming, has a great beach, and is close to great snorkeling at Black Rock. The staff was friendly and accomodating.The hotel was full, but never felt crowded, as the grounds are large and pretty and there was always a place to sit and relax. The restaurants are ok, not special. What is different here is that, if you desire, you will get an authentic Hawaiian experience, lessons in Hawaiian culture, hula lessons, lei making, etc, all "on the house". You pay extra for parking, in room safe, chairs on the beach (which you don't really need as you can sit on the lawn close to the beach for free), etc, but when you consider the value of the room price, I didn't find these extras bothersome. Overall, I thought this was a great value and a really enjoyable place to stay.

I had some medical appointments at Virginia Mason Medical Center in downtown Seattle. My first appointment was at 7:20 a.m. so I decided to stay at the Hilton the night before to avoid having to deal with the crush of morning commute traffic. It turned out to be a good decision. If you can walk to the hospital, this is an especially good place to stay. Out the front door, it's one block over and four blocks up the hill to Lindemann Pavilion, where you need to stop and check in (for the hospital). A note of caution, for patients who can't handle hills, it's best to take a cab or find some other way to get up there. Even so, it would be a very short cab ride so the fare would be low. The good news for walkers is, it's all downhill when you are done at Virginia Mason! Wife and I really enjoyed the Hilton. One of our favorite places, The Brooklyn Seafood, Steak, and Oyster House, is four blocks down the hill from the hotel. We had to stagger back up the hill to the Hilton after having consumed a memorable meal, but it was worth it! The hotel was fine, it seemed there were staffpersons everywhere just waiting to help you with questions, etc. Very helpful and courteous. Our room was clean and quiet, though as noted elsewhere the bathroom seemed a bit small. We received our HHonors amenities and even a champagne and chocolate gift in honor of our wedding anniversary. I highly recommend this hotel.

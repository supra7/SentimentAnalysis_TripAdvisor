We stayed at Destiny Palms for 14 nights and we had an amazing time. The Pool is beautiful, the hotel is well organized, Continental Breakfast was very nice (always on time and properly stocked), the laundry room a plus, the lobby is very nice too. The rooms are appointed nicely; flat screen TV, hair dryer, microwave, and refrigerator (more that what you get at any hotel, regardless of the rating) everything looks new, in excellent working order. The BEDS were AMAZING, they were comparable to the Ready? To the Ritz Carlton & Four Seasons Hotel... Yes... You read it correctly, we have been to many high-end hotels 4/5 star hotels and were out ALL day long and would look forward to coming back to our beds. Lastly, the STAFF You cannot ask for a better hotel staff; From the housekeeping staff to the front desk staff... Excellent! Everyone was very professional, willing to assist, and genuinely sincere and pleasant. Our favorite staff member was Chuck, the Resort Manager... He went above and beyond our expectations, He had a knack for anticipating our needs and our wants... He made our stay all the more memorable. We would and will return to the Destiny Palms Hotel on our next family vacation to Orlando!

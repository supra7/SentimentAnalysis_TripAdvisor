We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for shopping and a Seahawks game. The hotel is within walking distance of Pikes Place, Shopping and public transportation. We were warmly greeted by staff and enjoyed the meal that we had there the first night. The restaurant staff was awesome and the food was the best I've ever had! Our room was on the 9th floor (smoking) with a fabulous view of the Space Needle. Expect to hear normal city noise while staying downtown. We didn't really mind it at all. The lobby and the restaurant we beautiful. There are 3 elevators so it is a quick trip going up. The bellhops are attentive and eager to help. The room was nice, not high quality, but nice. We had everything that we needed and it was clean. The small balcony was nice to have and the floor to ceiling windows allowed us to fully enjoy the view. We were very comfortable in this hotel. The stay was mostly nice except for the last night when the room next to us got rowdy. The hotel staff took care of the situation and compensated us in the morning. My only suggestion would be to add microwaves to the rooms so that a person can reheat their leftovers and coffee. I will stay there again and look forward to another visit!

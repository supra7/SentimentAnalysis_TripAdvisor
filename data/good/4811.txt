We wanted a budget hotel for an short stopover near the metro an the airport and not to far from the city and it does the trick! LOCATION: The hotel was a literally 5 minutes walk from the "Union Square" metro station which was very convenient for travelling to and from the airport in approx. 15 minutes. it is located in the 19th al rigga road and very easy to find from the metro station (there a maps everywhere which tells you where you actually are). You can explore the city very easy because the "Union Square" metro station is also the intersection of the two metro lines. You need approx. 15 minutes to the airport and approx. 25 to burj kalifa/dubai mall. The creek is reachable by food in 10-15 minutes and you can take a water bus from there to the old- or gold souk. ROOM Check in was efficient, we got room 101 right next to the elevator but noise was not an issue. The room looks exactly like the pictures show it, only the TV is replaced by a gigantic flat screen. The bathroom (with bathtub) looks a bit used and could be cleaner, but water pressure was good, toiletries provided and towels where clean so nothing to complain for the price paid. The fridge was not plugged in and i took me some time to figure out which light switch actually switches the light off without switching another on but i finally got it! Free Wifi in the rooms if needed. Breakfast wasn`t included so can`t comment. FAZIT: We paid 40 euro/night and got a well located hotel for our purpose (short stopover) and you cant expect more for the money paid in regarding hotels quite pricy Dubai!

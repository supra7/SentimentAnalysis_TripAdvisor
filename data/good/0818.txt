Spent four days at the Moore, and it delivered what I needed: safe, clean lodging. I went for the absolute cheapest rooms at this, the absolute cheapest place to stay in Seattle (short of a flophouse). The $45-a-night room with no bathroom was fine: spacious, quiet, and sanitary. TV and sink in the room were an unexpected extra at these rock-bottom prices. The shared bathroom just down the hallway presented no problems, and housekeeping kept it clean enough. And of course, you can't beat the location -- two blocks from Pikes place, walking distance to just about everything. Parking isn't provided by the hotel, but there's plenty of parking lots/garages within one block. The garage across the street is pricey and atmospherically gothic, but convenient -- it allows overnight parking and doesn't demand that you show up at 7 am to renew your parking as most other lots do; note that it closes at 10 pm, though. Hint: on-street parking is free all day Sunday.

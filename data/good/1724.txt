Used a coupon for hotel stay otherwise rates would have been too high. Lobby unique and cozy. Rooms rustic cozy decorated. Rooms with partial view looked at a pier so splurge for the full ocean view room to get view. Bed mattress was hard. No tubin bathroom.. Front desk staff and valet staff very friendly. Restaurant and lounge worth a visit. Liked chess and checker tables in lounge area but pieces missing (little children). Unique decorating theme. House keeping staff ,l aundry and cleaning carts seen in the halls everytime we left the room. Dirty dishes from room service not frequently picked up and left in the hall ways. Just reaching a 4 star quality but not a favorite of Seattle. Would only return if specials offered on room rates. Valet parking is the only option and a cash grab at $34 per day. Room next to us had little children and as a result we found it noisy. Not for families. Good for business or if seeing a Seattle event.

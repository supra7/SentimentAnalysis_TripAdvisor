Just returned from the Hyatt Regency Maui. We are a family with two boys (10 and 14) Had a great time. Setting and pool are wonderful. Rooms could use a little updating but beds were very comfortable. (both here and at Hilton Hawaiian Village - best hotel beds ever!) Oceanfront views spectacular. The hotel was of a very comfortable size. We could let our 10 year old have a fair amount of freedom which he loved. Staff fantastic except for valet parking which was slow. Kids don't miss the secret hiding place inside an underwater hole in the grotto. The other kids who are already there will show you. Breakfast at Swan Court very good. Dinner at Italian restaurant excellent. Haleakala great - take the sunrise tour through the hotel, you do not want to drive this road yourself! Do not recommend fishing if you have kids. You might get the catch of your life but more likely you will catch nothing. Apparently that is the nature of fishing in Hawaii. Ulalena also very good. Tour of the Stars also very interesting.

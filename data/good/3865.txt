The Hilton Bayfront is beautiful! Great location on waterfront with views of Coronado Bridge and marinas. A bit of a walk from Gaslamp District, but directly across from Petco Park. The room was typical for a good hotel, but staff was just "doing their job". No one went out of their way to make us feel welcome, give us any extra information or travel advice. No one offered extra towels, umbrellas (yes, it actually poured the day we were there!!). Concierge was curt, answered our question by pulling out a map and circling a location--no advice, no conversation, no extra help. This is not acceptable in a 4 star hotel!!! There are so many great hotels in San Diego that I would choose another one before I stayed here again. Disappointing because they have a beautiful location and building. Staff needs to be improved.

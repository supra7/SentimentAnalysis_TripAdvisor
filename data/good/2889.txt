The hotel is just a five minute drive to Seattle airport. Overall the property is one of the better Hampton Inns. No charge for parking unlike the Holiday Inn down the street where I stayed the last time. Thought I would have a sleepless night from jet engine noises due to close proximity of hotel to airport, but that was not the case. I did however check-in late and depart early so perhaps the airport has landing/takeoff restrictions. Noticed hallway had smell of cigarette smoke but not in room. Breakfast starts at 5:00 a.m. and is included in rate, but hotel also close to a variety of restaurants.

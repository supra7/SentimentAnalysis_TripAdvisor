We stayed in room 274. We came for my nephew's wedding, which was held on the grounds right in front of the ocean. I, and many of my family members, really liked the free classes. I learned alot about Hawaiian culture (the story telling class), and we were fortunate that Hawaiian steel guitar events coincided with our stay. I give the hotel alot of credit for investing in their employees (they attend Hawaiian culture classes), and it is evident that they are treated well. I really liked having a fridge in the room, so we didn't have to eat breakfast out. One small tip -- if you need hair conditioner, bring it. They provide "shampoo/conditioner" (all in one), but it really only functions as shampoo. We took the "Trilogy" snorkle/sail cruise, and it was fantastic. It departs from a kiosk right on the Kaanapali property. The food was excellent (cinnamon rolls for breakfast, BBQ chicken for lunch) and they gave just the right amount of guidance for an excellent snorkle experience. We also did a zip line experience which was fun, but if you want to do it, I would advise bringing shorts and a T-shirt that you don't particularly care about. The hills that you climb to get to the zip lines are quite dusty and the dirt is red, and doesn't wash out of clothes. I made the mistake of wearing newly purchased clothes. The Kaanapali appears to have alot more built in activities than the other resorts, the grounds have more dimension. The pool is open from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm. I wish it opened at 7:00 am, so that I could take a dip before there was sun on the pool. I found the sun to be much more intense than I could have imagined. I put on 45 sun block and covered my body as much as I could, but I still walked away with a nasty burn. The hotel appears to be one of the best values in Hawaii. It's not a 5 star resort, but it's warm and we found it fulfilling.

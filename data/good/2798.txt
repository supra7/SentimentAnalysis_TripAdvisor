Stayed here several times in the past on business, just spent a night on my own with a good Priceline rate. Incidentally, the local room taxes are about a 30% markup of the Priceline rate, but it's still a good deal for a 3 star hotel. Rooms were clean, beds were very comfortable with nice pillows and linens. I didn't have any issues with noise, despite the fact I was in a ground floor room in one of the many sprawling "wings". TV is a good sized HD plat panel with Direct TV satellite service. Shuttle van was prompt and on time. Service was very friendly and courteous. My only complaint is the stiff charge for internet service ($12.95) for in room ethernet (no wireless in the rooms). The lobby has free internet and I camped out there for awhile with my laptop with some other rebellious types. The lobby is very cozy with a couple fireplaces, cozy couches and private areas, so it wasn't so bad. Like the hotel. Would stay here again.

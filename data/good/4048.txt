We stayed here for our honeymoon for 6 nights. We had a great time here. There is plenty to do in the surrounding areas. We had breakfast included with our package. Food was good, but there were hundreds of little birds swarming around the restaurant every day. Gross. We had dinner at Japengo and the food, service, and view were amazing! There was construction going on that really didn't affect us at all, but it would have been nice to be forewarned of this. Self parking lot spots are fit for a mini cooper and not much else. We had a partial ocean view room that was not worth the extra money. I would skip it or get a full ocean view next time. Pool bar is awesome and so is the waterslide. We spent the remainder of our honeymoon in Wailea and Kaanapali was much more fun.

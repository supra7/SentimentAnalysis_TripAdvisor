My husband and two young adult kids enjoyed ourselves at the Hyatt. The grounds are beautiful. The pool is spectacular. The fitness center is great. Terrific access to the beach. Excellent but pricey food. Convenient shops on property. The best of all is the service. The staff is great, warm and accommodating. The things that weren't so great were....the rooms need an overhaul. They aren't terrible, just a little tired. One night we found a big roach in our room. YUCK! There was a plumbing problem and when the people upstairs ran their water our toilet gained water. The wifi is expensive and it is iffy at best...slow and often crashes. The beds are comfortable, but the linens are cheap. The bathroom is small, but doable. The construction they were doing is distracting, although understandable. Overall a very nice stay and the good points well outweighed the negatives....however if we would have seen one more roach that might have changed. I hope they keep that under control. Yes, i know that you are in the tropics, but when you pay that much for a hotel, the BETTER have a good pest control system in place.

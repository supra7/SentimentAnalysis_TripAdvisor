A very serviceminded staff helped us from the moment we stepped in to the hotel. I liked that they asked us how much we've had payed for the taxi from the airport to be sure that we had gotten a fair price. Some of the staff spoke little or non english but did what they could to try to help us before fetching english-speaking colleagues. The room (standard twin) was big and had a nice big shower. We ordered room service that came quick (although the menu wasn't the best, more options would have been great). Breakfast was all in all good, a big seleccion of cheese. Not the greatest for someone who like me likes to exercise and eat healthy, but being so close to Istikalstreet and all the good restaurants and coffes this was nothing that bothered us. Our room was just above some kind of nightclub so at night there were a lot of loud music, but this we only thought added to the feeling of being in a big city. But I can imagine if you travel with children or suffer from migrane, this would be considered as disturbing. We are happy with our choise and would definitly stay at Pera Tulip again.

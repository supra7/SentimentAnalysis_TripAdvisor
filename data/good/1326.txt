My husband and I went out to Seattle to attend a college graduation. We have been to Seattle before and stayed in another hotel, but found the Sheraton to be much nicer. Overall, we had a great experience. Everything was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. There were only two slight issues we encountered. First, when we checked in which was late at night (around midnight) my husband and I were assigned a room with double beds which was not a big deal at all, except that my husband had called the day before to tell them we would be checking in late and would like a room with a king. The front desk person quickly resolved this for us though and we were in our new room quickly. The only other thing we didn't love was the pool area. It was very busy with kids splashing around, even at 10pm when my husband and I went to use the hot tub. Not really the fault of the hotel, but still it was slightly annoying to have kids splashing in your face. Otherwise, I would highly, highly recommend staying in this hotel!!! If we go to Seattle we will definitely be back.

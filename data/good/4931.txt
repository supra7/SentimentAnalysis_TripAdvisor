The unit was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in Room 8. It was early June, people were wearing sweaters and jackets and we were so hot in the unit we were having difficulty sleeping. We opened the windows but they had no screens so had to deal with bugs. We called down to report the problem and someone came right up to look into it and had us close the windows and turn on the A/C. This really bothered my environmental conscience and it was still too hot. They offered to move us for one night but given the stairs issue we declined. We met the people in the next room to ours on the same floor and they didn't have that problem at all! It bothered us a great deal to spend upwards of $150.00 a night for 3 almost sleepless nights. Aside from that it was a great place.

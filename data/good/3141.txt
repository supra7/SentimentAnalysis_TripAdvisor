My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights, and it was a very nice stay. Took the bus directly from the airport to the hotel where the stop was right outside the hotel. Their U and S bahns were very easy to use and there was a stop about a 5min walk away (although bullowstrasse was closed for renovation, but the next closest stop was just ~10min. further). Hotel can sell you passes to use the public transportation (we bought day passes when we needed them). Hotel itself had excellent staff that spoke English and were super helpful. Rooms were very clean and had plenty of space for 2 people (compared to other hotels we stayed at in Europe). Soap/shampoo combo is from a liquid dispenser in shower. Wasn't a problem for me. Breakfast buffet was great, although very different from the U.S. Lots of cold meats and cheeses, bread, cereals, yogurt and fruit. The area it is in is still a little run down, not the prettiest, but it was great in the hotel itself and I think it was a good value. If you want to be in a fancier area, you'll be paying more. Also, since I live in a city and walk a lot, we walked quite a bit if we didn't want to take the bahn. Sights were not down the street though. It was easy for us to get around, but if you don't like to walk or take the bahn/bus/etc then you might want to look into other places. Wifi is a requirement for me, and it worked fine. I had read it was $10 for 3 days, but I didn't pay anything extra, might have been the package I bought though. Things we visited: Reichstag (parliament building), Brandenburg gate, victory tower, zoo, olympic stadium. Berlin was very nice! The locals were very helpful and friendly.

I stayed at this hotel as my flight arrived very late at night. I actually used Priceline and got it for a great price. I was thinking I would get a bad room, next to an elevator in the furthest wing from the front desk. We were on the 4th floor of the tower. The rooms were very roomy, comfortable queen beds, 2 sinks, very quiet. There is no WiFi in the room, but it is available down in the coffee shop/lounge area. We really were only there overnight so I can't comment on much else. However, I certainly would recommend the hotel to any one who wants a hotel that is close to the airport. They have a shuttle which runs continuously to the airport.

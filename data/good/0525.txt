Stayed here while family member was having surgery. Our room was charming, furniture fit the era of the hotel, very nice room, front desk staff were very helpful. You cannot stay here if you are expecting a flat screen TV and a spa tub, but instead stay here for a great location (right in downtown Seattle) and charming amenities. Attached restaurant offered great food at an affordable price. I would recommend this hotel highly.

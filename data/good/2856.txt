My friends and I stayed at this hotel for 6 days starting August 31. The hotel was quiet and the shuttle service was great for people like me who used the Light Rail to get downtown. There was a nice selection for breakfast, but they had 1 toaster for the entire breakfast crowd and the one side didn't work well. During the weekend it got crowded - there was a youth soccer tournament happening near by. The staff tried their best to accommodate the breakfast crowd, but people still waited online for at least 30 minutes for the buffet food. The omelet line took a lot longer. There were very few plates and utensils and there were too many people confined in a small area. I almost walked out b/c it was so difficult to get around, nevermind find a seat. I saw quite a few people grab what food/drink they could and go back to their room. My room was on the 6th floor and was quiet except when the soccer kids were running past my door or yelling to the balconies below. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. Greg, the shuttle driver, gave us great tips and restaurant recommendations. The managers reception was a nice touch. Overall the stay was good, but the chaos at breakfast would make me think twice about staying there again.

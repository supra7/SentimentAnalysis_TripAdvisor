Seattle offers a traveler many options for food and fun. It has ample hotels of various styles and accommodations. We stayed at the Queen Inn in the Queen Anne District. It was not as advertised but it was quaint, clean and historic. The neighborhood is the attraction with restaurants, shopping and evening entertainment within walking distance. Public transportation in Seattle is a myriad of stops, but it gets you where you need to go and cheap. We took two buses out to Woodinville and visited the Chateau St. Michelle Winery. It was so worth the trip. I recommend the Red Hook Brewery (5 five-ounce pours of great beer). In Seattle, Pike Street Market is everything the hype says it is. Food of all kinds and fresher than fresh. Flowers in abundance and more beautiful than you may have seen outside of English gardens. We were there for three days and went each day. So much to explore and prices that are reasonable. The most attractive part of Seattle is the people. They were hospitable and friendly, welcoming you into their homes and their lives. It was like visiting your home town. I love Seattle!

We enjoyed the overall experience with this resort. Our room was in need of updating, and very small. The bathroom was a big disappointment as it was not bigger than a small closet. The views were nice, and the bed was very comfortable. The restaurants were spendy but the food was good. The pool was crowded but not uncomfortable. The spa was excellent. We were not inconvienced by the construction at all. There were times when the line for the breakfast buffet was long, but it seemed to move fast. The location was not the best for the beach. Our overall experience was above average.

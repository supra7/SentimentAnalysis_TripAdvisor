My stay was perfect in every respect except for two concerns. I prefer a low temperature for sleeping. As I was unable to open the window, I did turn on the blower on the ventilation system. However, the room temperature was still above what I desired. If AC could be provided year around, that would be wonderful. I have no idea whether plates and silverware are obtainable from the front desk, as I didn't ask. However, I was given take-out menus from various restaurants and ordered food from one of these. I happened to have a plastic fork in my belongings - otherwise, I would have not had a method for consuming my food.

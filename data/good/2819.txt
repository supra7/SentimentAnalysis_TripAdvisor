I stayed here for a week in June, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. For an airport hotel, it was surprisingly quiet, rooms were extremely comfortable and well prepared, and the staff were all extremely helpful and courteous. The only drawback was that the restaurant was a little on the pricey side for breakfast, but there are many places nearby to eat. A great hotel that I would happily stay again in.

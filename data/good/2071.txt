We stayed at the Westin Seattle for two nights (September 20th and 21st) before boarding a four-day Pacific Northwest cruise with Celebrity Cruises. The Westin Seattle is perfectly located. It's very close to all the fancy shopping malls and stores in downtown Seattle. Its also a short walk away from the famous Pikes Market. As for getting over to Seattle's Space Needle, the monorail station is right outside the hotel and the views from our hotel room on the 34th floor were just magnificent. Overall, it's a very nice hotel, but it shows signs of age, such as in the doors, carpeting and television set that was provided with our room. As for service... well, that's still debatable. On our first morning, we woke up late and left our room at approximately 11:00 AM. Before leaving, I removed the "Don't Disturb" door handle sign and placed it on the bathroom counter. When we returned later in the afternoon at approximately 5:30 PM, we discovered the cleaning staff had left a small card inserted into the electronic door lock on our door. The card apologized for not being able to service our room because we had apparently left the "Don't Disturb" sign on our door. Funny, there was no "Don't Disturb" sign on the door handle when we returned, just the card from the service staff. So what "Don't Disturb" sign were they referring to????? It was left on the b bathroom counter. Personally, I believe that whoever was working that morning just ran out of time or they were just plain lazy since it was so late in the morning when we left. Therefore, the more than likely decided they didn't have time to service our room and instead left the courtesy card, which sucks when you consider I paid $578 for two-nights at this particular hotel. However, when I brought this to the attention of management, they promptly had the room serviced with an apology. Overall, we would stay at the Westin Seattle again because of its close proximity to all the main activities in downtown Seattle.

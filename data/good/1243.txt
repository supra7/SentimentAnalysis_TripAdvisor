I will preface this post by saying that I live in the Seattle area and wanted an inexpensive (but nice) hotel to stay one night in with my family...we were attending the annual Seafair parade. I booked this hotel via Hotwire and got it for $94/night which was a steal as this is a 4 star hotel. The hotel itself was beautiful, non smoking, clean and dead center in the middle of town...I was thrilled with all of that. The only negatives were that having booked on hotwire I was not able to get a rollaway and the two beds were not queen size but rather a larger double...but we managed. The other disappointing factor was the parking fee...it totaled $43 for one night which I feel is outrageous. Other than those two issues this hotel was fabulous and we were treated well even though we had booked via hotwire. I would definitley go back and would recommend to others.

This hotel was definitely true to its initial billing. It fosters its Hawaiian roots with live music and dance. It also has a great staff. From the maintanance workers to the the guest agents, everyone is quick to shoot over a smile, a "good morning" or a proverbial "Mahalo!". We definitely plan on coming back in the near future. On the flipside, if I had one complaint it was that Room 131 of the hotel's north end is extremely loud and should be converted to an exercise room. The room is right next to the unit's staircase (there is no elevator) and at all hours of the day you hear people 'checking out of their hotel', so to speak. You hear boom, boom, boom as people bounce their suitcases down the staircase. But, we're from L.A. so noise isn't all that new to us. We just didn't want it during our 8-day honeymoon stay. Mahalo!

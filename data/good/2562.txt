Our first time to Seattle with two young kids. We were expecting to be in a much smaller room but were pleasantly surprised. We were able to setup the crib (Pack/Play) and our daughter's small air mattress and still have room to move around. Hospitality was just okay. Nothing bad but nothing spectacular. Location is great; 10-15 minute walk to the market, 5 minute walk to the monorail. Sushi at Red Fin was fantastic! Neighborhood felt safe but kind of dead - not much going on in the immediate vicinity which could be good - had to walk a few blocks to get to anything.

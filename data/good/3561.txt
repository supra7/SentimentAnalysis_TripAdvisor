My husband and I went for a long weekend and read all the reviews first - we've never done all inclusive and were a bit hesitant. So many good reviews and the short duration helped make the decision for this resort. To the point - we had a very, very nice stay. This resort is so clean and immaculate you could seriously eat off the floor or pool deck. Spotless. Attention to detail. Darn good drinks. Food was good - maybe not the sushi so much. Or the room service pizza. But if you're smart and stick to the local cuisine, you'll be in for quite a treat. Ask for huevos rancheros instead of the omelette for breakfast.... What I wished someone had said in their reviews but didn't is this: yes, the beach is long, white and fabulous, BUT there is NO snorkeling from the beach. They have the swimming area roped off and way out beyond that is a beautiful reef with lots of great snorkeling (we took a kayak out there and saw it). The reef is the reason the beach here is so great and not washed away like in Cancun. But unless you take a dive boat out there, you won't be seeing any pretty fish. So we booked a dive trip through the on site Aqua World and were herded like cattle for a day - but we did have a nice wall and reef dive. All in all, a great 5 days, but I sure don't think we could do an AI for more than that. If you like AI, then I'm sure it'll be an even greater experience. Oh, and don't forget to enjoy the guacamole making and the tequila tasting - YUM!

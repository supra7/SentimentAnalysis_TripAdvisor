Facilities are great - in the room and the property itself. Unfortunately when we stayed there was major road works on Stewart Street - steam rollers @ 3am. Not the hotels fault at all - but Camomile tea and ear plugs weren't the answer - scotch would have been better. Great location as mentioned, Space Needle up the road, Pikes down the road, shopping around the corner. Red Fin was delicious and had great mood lighting. As mentioned - Shuttle is half a block away at the Westin. Great little French Tapas style restaurant up the road towards Pike Market. Aveda bath products in the room - nice.

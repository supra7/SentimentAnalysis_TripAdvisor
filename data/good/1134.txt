Yes there is some construction going on and one of the elevators was being rebuilt, but from arrival to check in and then to the room, no issues noted. Friendly employees were the norm. We visited the concierge bar upstairs and the lobby bar downstairs and had nothing but friendly, mostly efficient service. It DID take a bit for the four of us to get our bloody marys and mimosas with breakfast in the morning. I wouldn't worry about the negative comments keeping you from staying here; the hotel is centrally located, reasonably priced and is all in all a very comfortable place to stay.

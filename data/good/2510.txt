Overall it was a very cool place. The rooms are pretty small but the hotel has cool decor. We arrived to a room that wasn't cleaned or made up from the last guest. Dirty towels on the floor, bed wasn't made, coffee in the cups. They sent a cleaning crew up immediately and took care of it. They also gave us the room for free which was great and what we would expect from a hotel that costs 200.00 USD a night. Therefore, we were happy and more than understanding of the mistake. It was in a great location. A pleasant stay and the staff was really helpful with our luggage when we showed up a bit early to site see. The cleaning crew also made a point to ship a pair of shoes we forgot, although we paid for shipping, we did get the shoes returned which was important.

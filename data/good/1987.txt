The Westin Seattle is a unique hotel, with its two distinctive, circular towers that can be picked out in any downtown Seattle photo. The hotel is a bustle of activity with a nice mix of business and personal travelers. The hotel does a great job of customer service and getting people where they need to be. Even though I was a Priceline customer, I was offered a higher floor room when I requested one. The hotel common areas, while busy, were not loud or boisterous. I found the service at the lobby level lounge to be quick and efficient. My room was on the 26th floor of North Tower (which I recommend if you have a choice). It was extremely quiet and relaxing. The room was comfortable and nicely appointed. The bathroom was not large, but did not feel cramped. I enjoyed my one night stay at the Seattle Westin. A couple words of caution. The hotel is starting to show a little wear and tear; small things like scuff marks on the walls, dings on the wood trim around the doors, tears in the carpeting, etc. These may be small deals or big ones depending on your expectations. Also, the elevators are quite slow, especially if you are waiting for one or on one during peak usage. The Westin is located on the northern edge of downtown Seattle proper. A couple of the surrounding areas can get a little sketchy the later into the night it gets; mainly the area north of the hotel.

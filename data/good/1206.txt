i went with my girl friends for Halloween weekend and stayed there for 2 nights. We got the hotel through priceline and didn't know what hotel we got until we paid for it. The location is great for the hotel. Everything is near by the hotel. It was easy to walk everywhere without having to drive around town. From restaurants, to shopping malls and lots of shopping near by. Even Pike place is only a 10 minute walk. Space needle was only a $12 cab ride from the hotel. The restaurant on top of the space needle was super nice and had a pricy menu but it was good. Room service was great. The food came in a reasonable time and I have tried the appetizers as well as entree. And the food wasn't that bad. There were a few things that I weren't so pleased with. One was the bathroom. It was super small. 2 girls getting ready was difficult let alone there were 4 of us. I had friends that stayed at other hotels near by the same weekend and their bathroom was non comparable to ours because theirs was so much bigger and nicer. The walls between rooms were thin. I can always hear if my neighbors were using their bathroom or if they were moving around. Another disappointment was that there was no free wi-fi in hotel rooms. Only in their lobbies. You had to pay $21 per day for it. I thought that was ridiculous since I've had previously stayed at a 3.5 star hotel and internet was free and I assumed a 4 star hotel would have the same services. Valet parking was expensive. But very convenient.

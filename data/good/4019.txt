I loved this hotel, I stayed at room 1001, the room was overlooking Gezi Park, which had a small cafe on the corner. I highly recommend this hotel for Istanbul first timers, for its strategic location, only 2 minutes walk to Istiklal and taksim. Breakfast buffet was nice as well. I also LOVED their shower. Only thing i didn't like about the hotel is that they don't provide an ironer, you have to use their laundry service, which was a little bit expensive.

Across the street from PETCO park, 5 min walk to SD's Gaslamp, 15min to SAN Airport... perfect location and that's only the start of describing this hotel. Breakfast buffet and the gym are the best I have seen anywhere in the US from Hilton. Staff is very attentive. The pool is incredible and has a huge TV at one end. Rooms are very quiet and seem brand new every time I stay. At least 10 trips there so far.

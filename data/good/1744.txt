The Edgewater's location can't be beat. Literally right ON the water and 5 minute (uphill) walk to Pike Place Market, its tough to get better. The incredible location notwithstanding, there are a few things you need to know. First off - you need to book rooms that overlook the water. We stayed in a premium room (no deck) overlooking the water which was great...you could hear the water lapping up against the building at night which was very peaceful BUT the other half of the hotel (with decks) overlook an ugly parking lot view....not too nice. Also, make sure you know the following before you go; the hotel has NO pool, hot tub, steam room. Also, the gift shop closes very early so if you need any toiletries, etc...make sure to bring them with you or be aware of the early closing, it makes for a very inconveinent first night if not. I dont understand why they dont stay open later as it would not be that expensive for them to do so. The valet parking is a whopping $33 per day (on top of the already expenseive rooms) so be aware of that if you bring a car. The rooms are good, clean, and unique and it makes for a good stay but the stay is more unique/romantic, than "deluxe" so make sure that's what you're in the mood for. If you want to go for a great dinner (away from the tacky tourist dining in the near vicinity)....take the 15 minute cab ride to Ray's Boathouse in Ballard. One of the best dining experiences/location/service that we've had in years! We cant rave enough about Ray's.

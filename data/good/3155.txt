I feel it's only fair to offer a review as I am so influenced by them myself... can't book anything without the Tripadvisor seal of approval. Stayed at Lindemann's for a short break last week. The hotel is just as you would expect from a boutique urban venue - clean lines, understated, efficient, no fuss. It looks great, minimalist chic, lovely and clean, still new enough to show no wear & tear, all shiny and squeeky, comfy bed (though hate that two singles for double thing!), fabulous stylish bathroom, really great helpful reception staff and the whole place very peaceful and private - didn't even see another guest or room staff at all. Great. The only quibble is it just cuts tiny corners - so no mini bar, no in room safe. Nice touch sweets on the pillow - but only for one night - same with complimentary toiletries (which no-one ever really bothered about till the liquid restrictions when flying... these days we actually have to use them!!) there on check -in, but never replenished throughout the stay. To be fair we never called down and asked for more - I'm sure they would have been forthcoming, but shouldn't have to bother. This is not an expensive hotel - but it's not a budget one either - the look & feel & staff are certainly what you would expect from a hotel of this price and rating, but there are hints of budget about the feel of the place.

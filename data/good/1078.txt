We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. It was a Friday,Saturday nite, I got it for $65 a nite on priceline. Wasnt sure what to expect, but the desk was as accomodating as it could be, rooms were clean. We had originally asked for a room facing away from the freeway as we would be sleeping in the day time. They did not have one avail, but gave us a freeway facing room on the 23rd floor. It was fairly quiet as long as you had the window closed tightly. Woke up every day to a news paper at our door. The thing that I was not prepared for was the $23 a night parking fee in the parking garage. Very low ceilings. Would not be albe to park there if you had an suv. Overall it was a pleasant experience.

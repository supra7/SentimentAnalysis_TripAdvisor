I stayed here for just one night in order to catch a morning flight out of SEA. I found a AAA special rate so it was a good value. As a Marriott Rewards elite member I was given a room on the Concierge floor. The room was standard (good) Marriott in good shape and comfortable. The TV had a good selection of channels and quite a few were in hi-def. The wired internet speed was pretty good. Since I was car-less I ate in the restaurant and it was pretty good. The hotel has a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes to the airport. It is about 2-3 blocks to get to the light rail station that can take you to downtown Seattle. One strange detail is that the pool is in an atrium in the middle of the hotel and as a result the atrium stays very humid. This hotel is a good choice if you need to be near the airport and can get it for a decent rate.

We returned to the Eldorado for the first time in 20 years last summer. Rarely do things stay the same but this place has. The staff were helpful and friendly, the accommodation is good value and the beach to our mind is one of the best in the world. This is the place to go to relax. The complex is quiet and low key. The pools may be basic but how often can you go to a place and get a whole pool to yourself. The units are spacious and airy, yes they do vary in quality so do your research. The only area of improvement could have been a really thorough cleaning of our unit half way through our stay. As we were there 17 days the bathroom mirrors and sinks could have done with a really thorough clean, same with the kitchen. Having said that I could have asked and I am confident it would have been done, the housekeeping did a great job of keeping us well supplied with towels and amenities. We recommend using the farmers markets for fresh produce and the 'Fish Market' north of the Eldorado in a strip mall just past 'Times" supermarket. Goofy Foot surf school in Lahainia did a great job getting this family surfing for the first time and we would do it again. The snorkeling at Black Rock closest to the cabana (not the Sheraton side) is good and not crowded, we often saw turtles. Gazebos near Napilli beach is great for breakfast but get there early or you will be waiting a long time. Special thanks to Ruby and MaryAnn who helped with our bookings and were always so kind and helpful. We will undoubtedly be back again. Williams family (Portland OR)

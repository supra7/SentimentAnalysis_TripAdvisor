We were greeted by the most friendly receptionist I have ever encountered. She was very helpful and efficient. Our kids loved the pet goldfish in our room. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The restaurant was great too and we looked forward to our breakfast every morning. The location is handy to the attractions of Seattle. We took the bus to Museum of Flight without a problem. Pike markets are an easy walk from hotel. The only downside is the walls are a bit thin and we could here a barking dog on occasion - coming from Australia we are not used to dogs in hotels. I would stay here again. Almost forgot my husband and I enjoyed the complimentary wine at the end of the day.

I recently returned from 5 nights at KBH. The staff are just wonderful! We chose to use the valet parking and were greeted with a smile daily by Bobby! He was always helpful in answering any questions we had. You can't stay here without visiting the Tiki Bar where you will meet Tom and Dale. These guys are fixtures at the KBH! Thanks guys, for always remembering our names and treating us like we've been friends forever! Thanks also to Roy who gave us a nice tour of the hotel and the gift bag filled with treats. I loved the KBH bag! It came in very handy for our many shopping excursions! This resort is in a perfect location and the grounds are immaculate. The rooms were pretty decent size with a coffee maker and a frig to keep our soda and beer cold! My one and only complaint is that it was always quite late in the day before housekeeping would come. More times than not, the housekeeper would leave behind half full cups of water that were sitting on the night stand, or on the table on the patio. My friend and I are both smokers, so would empty the astray into a bag, so as not to stink up the room. That bag was left outside on the patio and not removed. If you're planning on a luau, you simply MUST do the luau at The Westin....just down the beach from KBH. The show is amazing and the food is to DIE for!! All in all this is a great resort and I would reccomened it in a heartbeat....and I usually do!

We booked this hotel months in advance via Hotwire. We needed four rooms, and got them for $103 per night, for a pre-cruise stay. This hotel was listed as a 3 1/2 star boutique hotel, which I would say is exactly what we got. We arrived before 1pm from the East Coast, and were very happy that we had no problems checking in that early. All eight of us loved the Hotel Max! Yes, the rooms are small, especially the bathrooms, but it's great preparation for the cruise bathrooms. This hotel has character! From the guys standing out front, to the front desk, they're young and friendly. Artwork throughout the hotel is unique and sexy. The bed was comfortable, and we got a kick out of the extra amenities in the room. (not that we used them...perhaps, if we hadn't stayed up so late in the hotel restaurant for late-night happy hour :) ) This hotel reminded me of unique boutique hotels I've stayed at in San Francisco and New York. It is NOT for anyone wanting a cookie-cutter hotel experience. The location, by the way, is PERFECT. Less than a $10 cab-ride to Pier 66 and the boarding of our cruise. An easy walk to Pike's. It's very close to the Westin, and Il Fornaio (great Italian restaurant, if you're hungry for Italian). We actually went back to the Hotel Max after our cruise to take a few pictures, as we had failed to do so when we were actually staying there.

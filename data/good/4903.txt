The hotel and rooms were very clean. The staff was very helpfull and friendly. The room was not a triple room, what we ordered, but a double with a third bed, so very small. The breakfastroom was to small for all the guests, so you had to wait. But, I would go back! There was no streetnoise ans the location was perfect.

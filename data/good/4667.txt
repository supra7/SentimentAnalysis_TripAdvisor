We stayed here in April. I never saw one bug in our room the entire time. It was great to have a washer and dryer and although the beach is narrow it is right there. We loved the resteraunt there and went there twice to eat. We also ordered pizza from the shopping center across the street for the kids and it was great. The pools are great but this is definately a family place. We saw a lot of families and met some nice people. We had no probelms with the staff at all, they were all very nice and helpful. The two pools were great but we spent most of our time at the smaller one. My husband went scuba diving right there on the beach and saw more turltles there then he did at "Turtle Town". The beach is narrow but it is nice to snorkle and lay out. We spent most of our time at other beaches or the pool. The made service was good, our room was cleaned every day. We met people who go back there all the time. This is not on the trendy "Kaanapli Beach", but we didn't mind. In fact we liked it because there were not nearly as many people walking around. The grounds are beautiful. We loved Maui and if we go back we will return here.

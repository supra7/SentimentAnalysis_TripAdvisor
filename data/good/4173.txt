We stayed the first two nights of our honeymoon here, and because of that we got a complimentary bottle of champagne. The staff was friendly and everything was very clean. Every view was beautiful! The beach was only a short walk past the pool. The pool had waterfalls you can swim under and a very fun water slide. The only problem is that the pool area was always crowded, so finding two lounge chairs next to each other sometime took a second. The beach was amazing, there was a grass bank right next to it, so if you didn't want to lay in the sand you could lay in the shade of the palms in the grass. You do have to watch out for the coral though. The food and drinks were great but its a resort so you pay the price for it. This hotel also host one of the most popular luaus on Maui. It was convenient to go to, good entertainment, and great food, but you have to get there early because the line gets pretty long. The concierge at this hotel helped us plan all of our activities on the island. Also, the lobby has parrots, flamingos, and penguins!

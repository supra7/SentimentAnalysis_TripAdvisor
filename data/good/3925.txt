This is our second time staying at this hotel and I would do it again. We stayed here for Comic Con and it's a pleasure again. We were able to get the full experience of Comic Con plus celebrity walk-throughs and it was great. I appreciated the early morning burritos and coffee for $4 while on our way to stand in line. Easy grab-and-go. I loved the room and it's room. Comic Con gives away a lot of junk and there's room to put it all. There was always warm/hot water right away and great water pressure. The housekeeper was not as good as last time by not changing our sheets timely and that's why I gave it a "very good" rating and not excellent. All in all, for the week we stayed, it was easily accessible, had all the necessities we needed and if we needed more, they readily complied and it was a pleasant place to stay for a very hectic week.

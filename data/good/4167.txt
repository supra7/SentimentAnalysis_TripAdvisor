We stayed at this property for five nights and were very pleased. The staff, service and food quality were excellent. The public spaces are beautiful and well maintained and the rooms very clean. There isn't much beach here and in some spots erosion is occuring. You will need to suntan in the pool area which does get crowded, but we never had a problem finding a spot. We would suggest getting a room rate with the breakfast package as otherwise breakfast will run you about $30 per person and there really aren't many options within walking or driving distance. We rated this hotel low on the rooms as ours was ocean front and the furniture was showing it's wear and the bathroom was very small and dimly lit.. We somewhat anticipated this as it is an old property. However, during our stay they turned the water off for a few hours one day on our floor in order to begin renovation work on the floor above. So if we go back in fvie years it may look different! There is a very nice promenade at the Hyatt that takes you all the way down past other properties and finally to Whaler's Village where there are many shops, restaurants and a food court. The promenade is right along the beach and is nice to walk at night with all the lights and tikis from the many properties and restaurants. Lahaina is a 20 minute drive away, but be prepared for traffic as the road is under construction.

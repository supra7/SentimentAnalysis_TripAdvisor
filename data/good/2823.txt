We stayed at this lovely hotel for a convention. Service was amazing. The housekeeping staff got the rooms down reasonably early. The Concierge was more than helpful. She headed us in the correct direction for a wonderful dinner at Salty's in Redondo Beach. Even gave us free dessert coupons! The restaurant in the hotel was reasonably priced and the food was very good. Our view from our balcony was Mt. Rainier. The halls got a little noisy with people visiting but we understand that. The only glitch was a missed wake up call the first morning, but we were still on East coast time so we were up.

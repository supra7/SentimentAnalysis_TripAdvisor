My husband and I live on Maui and were looking for a reasonable place to stay for our anniversary. They gave us a kamaaina rate - something that is becoming more scarce as the years go by, and were friendly and accomodating upon check in. Our room wasn't ready until 2pm (check-in is 3:30pm), but we were able to use the pool and facilities until it was ready. Then surprise! they provided us with an ocean view room at no extra charge. Their nightly hula show was fun and we enjoyed having burgers outside (a full menu is available) and having drinks at the Tiki bar - our entire evening came to $100. This hotel is right next door to the Sheraton Resort and black rock in Kaanapali, with a gorgeous beach. The hotel itself is looking rundown, but they are in the middle of renovating, so that won't be the case for long, and they certainly keep everything neat and clean. I would consider this a great choice for couples and families, who want to enjoy beautiful Maui, but don't want to pay resort prices. And, if you want to visit the resort, well they''re right next door.

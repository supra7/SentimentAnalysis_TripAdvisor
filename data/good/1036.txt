We just had a great stay at the Renaissance Seattle Hotel. Every interaction with the staff there was extremely positive. The place was clean, comfortable and relaxed. I was very impressed. We have stayed there several times over the last 15 years and this time was a major improvement in the staff quality and friendliness and the appearance and comfort of the hotel. It has always been a great location. Martin

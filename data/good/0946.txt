If you are traveling on a budget and want the best location and the nicest room possible for around a $100, this is the place. It is an older, but well maintained hotel, that is within walking distance of Pike's Place Market (about 1/2 mile one way). It is located across the street from the new Seattle Central Library. You can park your car and not use it again until you are ready to check out. An advantage in a city that has serious traffic and parking problems. The competition in this price range is mostly cheap hotel chains such as Comfort Inn that are mostly located on freeway onramps, where you need to drive to everything. Note: The Pacific Plaza Hotel does not have its own parking lot but does have an agreement with the attached parking garage for a discount price for its customers ($18 per day as of 10/05).

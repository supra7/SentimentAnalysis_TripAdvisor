We loved the Ka'anapali so much we're planning another stay. It isn't the newest or most modern hotel, but the hawaiian hopitality there can't be beat. Very clean rooms. The nightly bands and hula dancers under the moon were my favorite part. Ahhh, nothing beats those hawaiian nights! If you cant have a full ocean view, their garden views are the next best thing, nothing to complain about!

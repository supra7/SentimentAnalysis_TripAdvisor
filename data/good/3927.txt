We stayed 4 nights in a port/Coronado room with breakfast included. The hotel was packed for the July 4th weekend, but our room was surprisingly quiet and comfortable. It.certainly was not the most luxurious of accommodations, but the location was great for Gaslamp Quarter exploring, and it could not have been more ideal for the fabulous Big Bay Boom fireworks celebration. We were impressed with the variety (if not the organization) of the included breakfast buffet in the Vela restaurant. We paid $11 each night for a $50 breakfast buffet for two, and it was well worth the frustration of dealing with the unruly children of clueless enabling parents. While wireless was not included in our package and parking charges are exorbitant all over San Diego, we felt that the Hilton Bayfront provided good value and service.

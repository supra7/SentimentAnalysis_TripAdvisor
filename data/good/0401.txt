Stayed at this excellent example of the old style Crown Plaza wit all th ebell and whistles in Seattle to attend my nieces wedding. We were greeted warmly at the desk by a knowledgeble clerk. Our room was in a corner on an upper floor with magnificent view of the city. Comfortable king bed with multiple pillows. Each evening they left sleep masks, ear plugs and nice liitle suprises. I used the fitness center which was well appointed with chilled towles. A nice touch. The resturant for breakfast was a little small and the buffet left a lot to be desired. HOwever they quickly explained they would make anything to order and our omlets were excellent. Only downside which I found was normal for Seattle, parking. $40 a day seemed a little steep but the service was impeccable. Easy walk to resturants, Pike Street Market and downtwon shopping. A very nice expereince.

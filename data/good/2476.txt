I recently stayed for one night at Hotel Max in Seattle and while it was a very quick visit it was enough time to be impressed. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful. When I wrote to say we would be arriving late they were quick to write back saying as long as we got there by 3am everything would be fine. If you are looking for a spacious room with plenty of space to walk around  this is not the hotel for you. The room was small but the bed was very comfortable. The shower was also very small and much like a closet  so not the best of you have issues with claustrophobia. I agree with the other review that the room was cold when we arrived. But, it's small and it doesn't take much time to heat it up with the heater provided. The location of the hotel is perfect if you like to walk around as it is close to the market and a lot of good restaurants and shopping. We left our luggage and our car parked at the hotel after we checked out so we could spend the day in Seattle and that was no problem at all.

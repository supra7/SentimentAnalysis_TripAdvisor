The Maui Eldorado was the perfect destination for us as young honeymooners. On a tight budget, but determined to enjoy Maui, we found this gem. The Eldorado is on the quiet side of Black Rock. It feels very private and the beach is great. Most of the restaurants and nightlife are on the other side of Black Rock in Whalers Village and in Old Lahaina, but it's easy enough to get to if you have a car. Our room was very nice, clean and certainly luxurious to us newlyweds.

We stayed at a lower unit on the B group and found accomodations very fine. The staff was extremely helpful and allowed us to leave a couple of suitcases wih them while we were in Lanai at another resort. I thought that was a great signal that they were very accomodating. The staff recommended a couple of great local deli's and a great dinner spot called Leilanis on the Beach. The snorkeling at Black rock was great and going from the private beact to the Sheraton was a wonderful swim. Seeing 4 Sea Turtles was an unexpected treat. All in all it was very worth the money spent,

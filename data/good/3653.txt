My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on a pre xmas shopping break in November 2009 and found it to be a really good choice, the rooms are very small as per some of the other reviews, and as a result storage space is practically nil, and the free WiFi isn't really worth bothering with because it keeps dropping out. However they are the only negatives of the hotel, the location is great for access to Soho, Noho & Greenwich village on foot, while the uptown madness is also only a short ride away on the F V subway line or by foot also. I noted one of the other reviewers complained about the price, saying he was paying near 250 a night, I'd also be insensed if I was paying that much but we picked the East Houston for economy and location, paying only 130 a night and to that end we feel we got what we paid for. Rooms are clean and the shower room, while having one glass wall which isn't ideal, is a reasonable size. Decor is attractive while being unremarkable, in the flock wall papered style favoured by 'boutique' hotel proprietors. There is an iPod docking stereo in the bedroom and bulgari toileteries in the bathroom. Most importantly the room was clean and the the bed comfortable, even if you may be disturbed by the traffic and street life outside, but you'd have to expect that from a city that never sleeps.

We traveled to Secrets Maroma July 16th until the 22nd. Everything was great! The staff was very friendly and always willing to help! Everything was very clean and tidy. We really enjoyed the room, however the whole bathtub curtain thing was a little weird because it left no privacy. But we're married, so not a big deal. We have stayed at Dreams in Cabo before, and I think Secrets was very similar as far as food/beverages. We never had a bad food experience at any of the restaurants. Hitmitsu habachi was by far our favorite meal! I would deinfitely recommend it! The only bad thing that I would have to say would have been the mosqitoes. Clearly that is not something the hotel could help, they had spray and wipes available everywhere. I don't know if it was just the time of year that we were there or if is like that all the time, but I recommend taking some OFF with you. Other than that it was great and I can't wait to go back.

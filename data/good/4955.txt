We stayed here for four nights after touring the Yucatan peninsula. We splashed out on a bungalow, and were pleased that we did - it's really nice to wake up and look out of bed through the french doors straight at the beach and the sea beyond. I can imagine that the garden rooms, which are immediately behind and which have no view at all, would be pretty disappointing. But note that the private plunge pool is very small and not very private. The place was almost empty when we stayed there - one night, there was just one other couple staying. So the service was very personal, very friendly, and we had the grounds almost to ourselves. The food is not cheap, and because of the locations it is quite difficult to go elsewhere. But the chef is very good, and the menu is quite extensive, so you would have no difficulty eating off it for a few days. A number of contributors have commented on the location. It is hard to find so ask for directions in advance, and/or follow the sign for Azul Fives, which is a large resort next door - just about to open when we were at Le Reve. The beach is relatively quiet in front of Le Reve, but there are large resorts nearby, so expect some 'gawpers' walking up and down the beach. Overall, it was a pleasant, relaxing place to stay for a few days.

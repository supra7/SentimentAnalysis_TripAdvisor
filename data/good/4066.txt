I have been a travel agent for almost 3 years, have lived in California all my life, and have NEVER been to Hawaii. When I was invited to come experience Hawaii I jumped at the chance! I stayed 2 nights in the most amazing Ocean View room... Lahaina tower, overlooking the amazing gardens and out to the ocean and the island of Lanai! WOW!!! I slept most nights with patio door open and the amazing breeze and sounds of Hawaii were incredible! The hotel is just finishing some incredible upgrades and I it is looking amazing! I walked around the property a lot while I was there, as well as walked down the oceanfront sidewalk that goes on for miles! I experienced my first Maui sunset (the water turned lavender... amazing!) and just enjoyed the serenity that falls on you when there! I definately recommend the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa, and would be happy to help anyone who is interested in staying in Maui! Debi King dk Cruise And Travel (dot com)

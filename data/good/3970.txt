My husband and I recently had free flights to San Diego so we were primarily looking for a reasonably priced hotel since it was such a last-minute trip. We booked the Hilton Bayfront because we found a good deal online and were pleasantly surprised to find that we experienced just as much luxury and ambience (if not more) than other hotels nearby with higher prices. The perks were the hotel's proximity to the trolley, Petco Park, the marina and the Gaslamp District. We rented a convertible at the airport so that we could sightsee at our own pace. It was extremely convenient that we could drop our rental car right off at the Hilton Bayfront's Hertz counter. This was a great way to save on parking since I heard it was pretty expensive. Our favorite part of the room was the beds... we slept so well during our stay! The Hilton Bayfront is a great spot for young couples who want to experience luxury while vacationing, but don't want to spend an arm and a leg doing so.

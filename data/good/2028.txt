The pros are in the title: good location, pretty good service. When we arrived, our room stank of stale smoke; we marched right back downstairs to ask for another room, which we were given - no problem. Unfortunately, that night we had to deal with raucous football fans (visiting team) partying right next door until 4 am; the next morning, we asked for yet another room, which we were given. I found the front desk staff to be helpful despite all these problems. Other cons: old hotel, long wait for elevators, old bathrooms. Overall, I would probably stay here again because of the value (got a great deal on Hotwire) and location, but my guess is that there are better hotels in Seattle.

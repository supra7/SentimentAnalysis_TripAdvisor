After reading some of the reviews on here, I was pleasantly surprised. There is, in fact, air conditioning in the rooms, so do not fear. If you go in winter, there is also a little faux fireplace. Service was friendly. The valet parking is speedy, given the lot is directly on the property about 15 feet from the entrance. This makes me wonder if it really *needs* to be valet, but the service was good nonetheless. There is a great gift shop in the lobby, as well as a spectacular view and a piano. Although the room was on the small side, the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was nice, but it only had a shower, if that is of concern. In my opinion, the city view is as nice as the water view.

A wonderful historic hotel located within close walking distance to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and other attractions. The hotel has a wonderful cozy restaurant which proved a lifesaver after we were too ahem tired from our day of wineries and slept through our Palisades dinner reservations. The staff is funny and helpful, we especially loved our singing valet. The hotel is historic without being musty and tired, although be prepared to wait for the super slow and quite small elevators. However, it what was a real perk this room has ample outlets!!! And even provides a powerstrip. Also free wifi. Parking is a little steep but no more so than other hotels in the area and you get in and out privileges.

My wife, and I have been "escaping" the OC maddness by making weekend runs to San Diego for several years now. We used to stay at various hotels, like the US Grant, the Westins, Emerald Plaza & Horton Plaza, and on ocassion at the Hilton Bayfront. We finally stopped changing hotels, because of the beds at the Hilton. They are really comfortable, and when I want to relax I need a great bed. It is also nice that all the rooms have a nice view of the bay, on one side the Coronado Bridge or the other the Aircraft Carrier Midway. We never eat at the Hilton, as 5th Street & the gas lamp are a short 10 minute walk from the hotel. We make reservations through Expedia, or Travelocity, and the per night cost is usually around $160.00 night during the off season. The Hilton is a nice place, I will be back there in January.

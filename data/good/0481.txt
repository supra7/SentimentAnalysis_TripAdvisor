After reading some of the really nasty comments on TripAdvior, I was a little hesitant about bringing my family back to the Queen Anne, but I couldn't have been more pleased. We've stayed several times in the past ten years and this visit was no different from the others. A clean room with a kitchen and tons of storage space is so welcome when traveling with kids and doing back to school shopping. Yes, the beds are old and the pillows could be newer, but there are plenty of them and more if you ask the desk. I love the old fashioned bathrooms with comfy little tubs, the great toiletries, the beautiful courtyard, and the location, location, location just steps away from shops, restaurants, buses (we took the 18 all the way to Safeco Field and it stops near the hotel coming and going) and the post office. We fill up the 'fridge, breakfast in the room and hit the shops and sights by 10am, returning late in the day to watch a little TV before dinner or change to play in the Seattle Center fountain.The big closets are great for drying clothes and storing new purchases, but there is also a spotless laundry on site which we always make use of. Yes, this is budget lodging, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it for its price point and lots of things right.

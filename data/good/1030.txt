We recently stayed at this hotel for 1 night. The room and bathroom was very clean and nicely furnished. The connoisseur was very helpful and gave us many suggestions for good places to eat. The only draw backs were that the walls are thin (you can hear your neighbours if they speak loudly), there is free WiFi only in the lobby and valet parking is expensive, but you can find free street parking.

I stayed here for a week and thought that the Hilton was very good. I had a 17th floor room overlooking the bay. It was a beautiful view. The staff were professional, friendly, and outgoing. From check-in to Housekeeping to the Hilton people who staff the Starbucks, all were consistently helpful and friendly. The room was large and clean. The only "dings" I'd give it are (1) the tub plug was stuck in the down position and the handle of the plug had broken off. I kept the water flowing by jamming a pen under the plug. One call to the front desk and the problem was fixed, (2) no laundry bag in the room. Again, one note to Housekeeping and they left two, and (3) no executive lounge. For Hilton Honors gold members, they gave coupons for the Starbucks and for a "tasting plate" at the bar/lounge. I didn't try the tasting plate but enjoyed the Starbucks coupons (any food and any beverage item). If you're looking for an inexpensive, casual meal, The Tin Fish across the street next to the Omni hotel is very good. A cod fish taco and side of coleslaw cost less than $5 and was enough for dinner. The coleslaw is vinegar-based which makes it refreshing. The hotel is approximately 15 minutes from the airport and immediately adjacent to the convention center. I'd stay here again for the beautiful views and nice people.

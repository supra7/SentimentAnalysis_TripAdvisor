We recently reutrned from a week at this resort. It was a good value because we booked the Apple Vacations Secrets 6 Apple Square Deal. The food was very good, bordering on excellent at times. The room was very nice althoguh our first room had some issues. That led to a realtively sleepless first night. But we were switched the next morning to a beautiful room with a lovely view. The service was was very good at the restaurants, at the beach and the pool. The rooms were made very clean each day. One issue was on several occasions we requested soemthing for our room from housekeeping and the items never arrived. The beach was beautiful and very clean. Depending on how full the resort was, you needed to go early in the morning to claim chairs at the pool or the beach. The vacation also was a good value since not only was the food good and unlimted, but the resort had all of the top-shelf alcohol that you could ask for. And there was never an issue getting a drink no matter where you were on the grounds. The entertainment was largely better than expected. The hypnotist was particularly amusing and the "circus" show, while hardly reminiscent of traditional cirucus performances, did demonstarte some pretty impressive feats of fitness. All-in-all a very well-run value-packed resort.

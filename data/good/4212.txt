I was very happy with the hotel as a whole. Great location right on the beach, shops in the hotel (very helpful), nice pool and chairs, real coffee downstairs. The concierge was helpful and more than pleasant. However, the rest of the staff was typical and this was disappointing since I have found the customer service at other Hyatts to be exceptional. I rated this very good mainly because of it's location and setting.

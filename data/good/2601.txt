I stayed at the Hotel Max with my mother for one night while visiting Seattle. Overall we had a great experience. The rooms are very well appointed, although we did notice that the room and hallways smelled a bit of stale cigarette smoke, even though the property is completely non-smoking. The staff at the Max were most helpful and very accommodating. They had great suggestions and were friendly and genuine. The hotel is very well located, within walking distance to everything downtown Seattle has to offer. We booked a package rate that included parking and breakfast in the adjacent restaurant. It was worth including parking in the rate, but I would not recommend the restaurant for breakfast.

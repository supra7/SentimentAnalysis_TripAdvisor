I stayed at this hotel with my husband and two small children, from May 2nd through May 5th. We were there so my husband could attend a meeting at the Convention Center. I really have no complaints. Our room was big and clean. We were on the 19th floor and had no problems with noise. They are still renovating so the lobby is small. However, it is clean and still very nice looking. Based on previous reviews I had some concern about staying at this hotel. I had no reason to worry. If you can enjoy a hotel without a large lobby, then don't worry about the renovations. What I want to convey to others considering this hotel is don't worry about choosing this hotel. It is nice and clean and is in a great location with tons of places to eat all around. I don't understand why a previous reviewer said there were few options. The shopping in the area is amazing. I lived in San Francisco for ten years so I know what a great downtown area is like and this is a great location. Easy walk to Pikes Market. My only suggestion to those traveling with small children, if you want a small fridge, the hotel charges $30 a day. I rented a fridge and microwave and bedrails from a local baby equipment rental company. The company delivers the equipment to the hotel and picks it up when you are finished. I believe they charged $30 per week for the fridge.

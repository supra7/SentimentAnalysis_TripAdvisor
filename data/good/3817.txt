The hotel was beautiful. It met my six requirements: adults only, white sand, swim up pool bar, lazy river pool, less than 100 rooms, and all inclusive. It met my friend's requirement: deep sea fishing right next door. Actually he was quite happy to see people fishing right on the beach and he was sad he didn't bring his own fishing pole. Anyway, the hotel was beautiful, the meals were delicious - especially the Japanese restaurant. The fried rice was the best I have ever had in my life. The employees were friendly and kind. The "amenities" (towel animals and aroma therapy and fruit in the room) were not always consistent but that's ok. The landscaping to include flowers, fountains and driftwood were beautiful and the gourmet food displays were not only beautiful, but delicious as well, the rolled towels, lunches on the beach, everything was beautiful. I have hundreds of pictures if somebody wants to email me at gaski@aol.com. I would only like to warn people to avoid the "exotic" travel club presentation. It is a vacation club and is only a 50% off FUTURE stays at their hotels or any other destinations worldwide. You are simply paying the other 50% up front and not really getting any discount. I made the mistake of joining and then immediately changed my mind. It has been a nightmare to get this off my credit card and they STILL have not taken it off my credit card despite repeated emails and even after I gave them the COLLECT number to my credit card company numerous times, to cancel the transaction. I would never join the exotic travel club, but I would go to El Dorado Maroma any day of the week and I will go back there again.

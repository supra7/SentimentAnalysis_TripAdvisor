You can't actually swim at the beach in front of this beautifully designed hotel because the foreshore is coral and rock. A walk down the beach means a view of chicken wire fences or huge resorts - there are far prettier stretches of beach further south. At such an expensive venue we should not have had to listen to elevator music from the bar or landscaping equipment at 8 a.m. The food is fancy but not very good quality and fairly expensive. And the place is much too hard to find - needs a more visible sign.

At checkin the front desk staff upgraded our room stating it would be more comfortable for us. What a pleasant surprise! My wife and i were traveling with our 6yr old, soon to be 7, granddaughter to celebrate her birthday in Seattle. We had a wonderful tme visiting the Space Needle and Pike Street market both within walking distance. Although the rooms are small and we ran short of hot water for the third shower in the morning (mine)the rooms are very well appointed and the bedding ranks at the top as the most comfortable we have slept in.Thank you Max for the upgrade in our accomodation.

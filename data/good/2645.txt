I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Normally I stay at the W hotel in Seattle. This was a great hotel. More light, friendlier staff and also close to the downtown shops. I liked the design of the lobby, the fact that every room door has its own photography and name. Also had dinner and breakfast in the hotel's hotel: The Red Fin. This was very good for a hotel restaurant. I booked for a rate of just under 100USD/night. I would definitly come back again.

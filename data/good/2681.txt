We came down to Seattle from Vancouver for the weekend. The concierge at the hotel was very helpful in arranging a great tour of the city and Puget Sound. Pike's Market and great shopping were within easy wallking distance from the hotel. The room did not have a view but was very attractive and comfortable. Wi Fi was not free in the room but was available for free in the lobby which had plenty of seating and complimentarly coffee in in the morning. We loved the bar at the hotel and went there for a bit each night. Our favorite discoveries in dining were the Cheesecake Factory across the street as well as Pike's Chowder and the Pink Door found in the market's alley's. Serious Pie had delicious pizza and was also walking distance in a different direction. We also enjoyed some great brews at Pike's Pub near the market. We found the hotel to be excellent accomodation for the purpose of our visit.

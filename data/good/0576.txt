My husband and I stayed here one weekend Feb 24-26,2012 for a 2 night,3 day stay. I was impressed most with the location, very close to lots of shopping, restaurants and even reasonable walking distance to the piers. The rooms were clean,nicely decorated with an old world charm. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because parking was $35/ a night plus tip, which was not told to us in advanced. In my opinion this is outrageous and with really no other parking options available in the downtown Seattle area near the hotel you are pretty much stuck paying it, just wish parking price was clearly advertised beforehand.

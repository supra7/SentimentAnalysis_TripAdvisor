We had a very nice stay in this lovely, comfortable, swanky hotel. The location is superb...didn't need our car once. The service was good. The room was spacious with a nice sitting area and flat screen tv, a very luxurious bed and the bathroom was lovely. Unfortunately, we were either overcharged or mischarged twice (one we found three days after we left) so watch your credit card statements. The staff took care of the problem right away, so that is good. I would definitely stay here again. Oh! Avoid their garage...way too expensive. Park in the garage behind the hotel on 5th instead.

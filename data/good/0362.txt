My favorite hotel in Seattle, I have been staying for 10 years. It is because I dont like change and also because it feels like home. I get nice upgrade everytime, the upper floors have great view of the city and priority club louge is great as well. Nice location, close to the piers and downtown as we as easy entry/exit to I5. The hotel feels dated and little run down, rooms are older design, but nice, large and clean. The elevators are slow which is a major issue on busy mornings. Breakfast room has no personality. I am still a fan:)

Attending SC11 conference in Seattle. Had hotel room downtown but had to give it up (long story); only hotel available was this one. Not disappointed at all. The staff are very friendly and quite helpful. Although this is primarily a "one-night stand" hotel, where most guests are simply here to be close to the airport, we were here for about a week. The hotel is quiet even though it is right across from the entrance to the airport. There may be better suites available, but ours did not have a microfridge or a microwave, so staying here for a week meant buying a small cheap cooler for cold stuff and asking the kitchen staff to warm up leftovers. It's certainly convenient to the airport but it's also a quick trip up I-5 to the city of Seattle. It's also very handicapped-friendly, an important point for my spouse, who is disabled and uses a mobility scooter. Wish I'd brought a swim suit for the pool. SleepNumber bed didn't bug me after the first night, when I figured out which number I liked best. Housekeeping staff simply outstanding - great job, ladies!

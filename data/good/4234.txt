Beautiful and scenic entrance and lobby area.Great service and pleasant staff to meet and greet on arrival.It was very late when we got there and we were made to feel that it did not matter we were well treated from the start with pleasant smiles,it was great to finally reach!!! From the morning the staff called us by our names;which made us feel extra special. Wonderful!! is the only way to describe the way the Chief Chef , Swan Court manager and staff , Umalu manager and staff,and events manager and staff made our stay. Thank You for a wonderful stay!!

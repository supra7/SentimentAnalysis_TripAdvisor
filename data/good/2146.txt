This location at the space needle and the monorail station was very convenient for a quick visit to Seattle. In one afternoon we managed to visit the space needle, downtown Seattle and the aquarium. Very convenient location. Rooms need a bit of work especially the carpet. Fantastic breakfast for our family. Great value.

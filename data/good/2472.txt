I need to give this hotel a good rating because it was clean, attractive and convenient. However, it wasn't for us. It was a little to "cold" and I don't mean the temperature. With exception of the valet guys, who were very friendly, everyone else acted as if they were doing us a favor by being there. We prefer a little warmer and cozy setting so we won't be back. Now the Willows Lodge...that is a great place!!!!!

There is a lot that is fantastic about Inn at the Market. If you're on a pleasure/vacation trip, you cannot beat the location - on the edge of the market but still quiet and relaxing once you're in your room. The staff is fantastic - everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful above and beyond normal niceness. The room we had was quite large and our view of the Sound was absolutely dreamy. Worth noting though, our room had very few outlets which were in awkward places for charging devices (computers, cell phones, etc). And there is no desk in the room. The most inconvenient and impactful problem though was that our room (704) was very close to the exhaust fan of the restaurant below. So, it smelled intensely like eggs (breakfast) and then steak (lunch/dinner) the entire time the restaurant was open. This seems like something the hotel should be aware of and should really correct, especially for being one of the upgraded water-view rooms.

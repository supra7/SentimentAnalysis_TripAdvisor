Our flight from the east coast arrived late, so we decided to take a room close to the airport rather than trek into town. It was great to walk over to the hotel, and in the morning after we checked out we walked to the new light rail train stop, a few blocks away. The room was very decent and clean. The toilet paper was a little rough, but that is such a minor complaint. Breakfast was just OK. My waffle was a bit undercooked. The staff members that we met were very friendly and efficient. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

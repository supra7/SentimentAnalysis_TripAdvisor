We booked a room at the Boutique Hotel Trevi in March 2010. The Room we had was very cute and clean and even had a small terrace overlooking the rooftops of Roman buildings, which was nice to relax on. The Hotel is in a prime location, very central, by the trevi fountain and when my wife and i first arrived we were worried that it would be too loud (it is on a main street to the Trevi fountain and tons of tourists and party travelers seemed to be passing by as we entered). We were very pleasantly surprised to find that the rooms were actually quite quiet. The rooms were clean, and the staff was very friendly and obliging. the only thing I would say is that the beds are a little harder than i am used to, but we slept well anyway (could be from exhaustion, but still counts) Thank you to everyone at the BHT!

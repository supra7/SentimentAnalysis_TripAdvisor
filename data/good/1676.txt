This hotel is in a great location. It is within walking distance to Pike Place Market and many other tourist spots. We got a waterfront room and the views were amazing. The shuttle was great, my husband used it everyday. Our room was nice, you can tell the hotel is a bit older of you look closely, but it was still very nice. The walls were a bit thin, we could hear our neighbors and the people in the hall quite clearly. Overall, a great stay. We really liked having the gas fireplace in the room!

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It is beautifully appointed, very contemporary, and airy. The view from our room was stunning looking over the water to Coronado -- one morning there was even a rainbow. Our room was fairly large and it seemed to be pretty soundproofed. The hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants and stores. The only negative is that if you have a car, you have to pay to park in the hotel garage and it is a bit pricey. There are no other options for parking a car from what we could tell.

We just came back from a long weekend in Montreal and stayed at the Parc Suites based on TripAdvisor ratings. And I'm glad I listened because this was an absolute top value! I cannot imagine getting a warmer welcome anywhere else. From the moment we got there we got the most hospitable service from the owner who went above and beyond from personally making sure we parked in the right spot to ensuring we had a good stay. The location is central. The rooms are very clean without being sterile. The kitchen is a great feature and the beds are so very very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again without a second thought when I go back to Montreal. The only thing I would caution anyone against is that the hotel does not have an elevator. So, depending on what room you're assigned, you may have to navigate up to 3 flights of stairs.

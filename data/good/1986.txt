The Westin is within walking distance of many touristy sites. The view from the room- toward the Space Needle and Puget sound was breathtaking- try requesting a higher floor when you book. The room was okay, looked a bit "tired" but the easy access to the sights was worth it! Beware the parking fee is steep! We took the light rail, $2.50 per person one way, from the airport and the station is across the street from the hotel as is the monorail station to take you to the Space Needle. It is a 15 min walk to Pike Place Market, 25 to the waterfront but it is all up hill back, thank goodness for those taxi cabs! I rode the "Ducks" attraction with my 29 yr old son and we both enjoyed it! That also is within walking distance from the hotel. We had dinner at The Crab Pot and Elliots Oyster House, oh the fresh seafood.... We also had lunch at the Space Needle..pricey but.once in a lifetime experience. I actually took a picture of my entree as it was so beautifully presented! I VERY much enjoyed this trip.

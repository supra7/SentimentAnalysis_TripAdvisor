The University Inn is set in the relative peace of the University District (U of Washington.) It is a great place to come home to after seeing the sights of Seattle. Their free shuttle makes it very easy to get to the major sights of Seattle. The shuttle drivers are exceptionally friendly and make good tour guides. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Also, a great complimentary breakfast is provided. It is easy to come back to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, relax for awhile and then walk up the street to the restaurant area and have a choice of a variety of menus. The UWashington campus is a short walk away with its very good Burke Museum and lovely campus. We had a very pleasant stay here and we highly recommend staying here. We definitely will stay at the University Inn if we visit Seattle again.

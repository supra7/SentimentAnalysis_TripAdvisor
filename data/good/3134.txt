I stayed this hotel for 10 days, and I think it was very nice. The hotel location is near to Grand Bazaar, old mosques ... but it's a little noisy at night. The breakfast is very good; they serve some traditional turkey meals for breakfast too. There was a notebook in lobby with internet access. The room is small but very clean and tidy and the staffs are very kind. I think it is acceptable as a 3 star hotel.

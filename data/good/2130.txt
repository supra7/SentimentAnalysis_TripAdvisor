My wife and I stayed at the Westin for two evenings on part of our honeymoon. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Westin and would definitely go back. We stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the sound and downtown. Being on the 29th floor was nice to be able to see the overall surroundings Seattle has to offer. The elevator could use a little work as it was shaky and felt as if you were in a freight elevator. The pool area was fairly nice, however hard to get to. The hotel also has a nice little cafe for morning juice and danish. The staff at the Westin were very courteous and helpful during our stay. The hotel is located right in the heart of downtown and makes it easy for tourists to see a lot and still be close to the hotel. We went to Pike Place Market and it was only about a 10 minute walk. We loved it, also don't let the prices fool you, you can always get a deal if you shop around. If you want a regular King bed(heavenly, which is nice!) and a nice view you can most always get a better deal than the $210 posted on TripAdvisor. We only paid $149 a night, a steal!

I stayed at this hotel prior to my Alaskan cruise. It was ok. It is located in downtown Seattle . It's within walking distance of the public library, Benihana and even the pike place market. The rooms were a tad bit small and I expected a little more of a wine themed hotel. They did have a complimentary tasting at night however you weren't able to buy any of the wine's that were being showcased. That was disappointing. I would stay here again however I think the next time I visit Seattle I'm going to stay closer to the shopping. There is a major hotel district in downtown right near the nordstrom headquarters.

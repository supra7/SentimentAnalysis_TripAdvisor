My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Maui for the first part of our Hawaii honeymoon vacation. Like everyone else we were a little hesitant in choosing the Hyatt due to all the complaints about the rooms. But it seems like all the hotels in Ka'anapali has some letdowns like the sheraton with roaches and westin with all the kids. So we settled for the hyatt since we're not too picky when it comes to decor and upgrades. And we weren't disappointed at all. it's true the room decor looks old and feels old. and yes, the bathroom is small with the toilet and tub in a small room together. but everything else about the hyatt was great. Great service. check-in was a breeze. they gave us a coupon for a champagne, a photo book, and even moved us to a room with a better view. Great lobby, atrium, pool, and common areas. lots of different animals here...from a large koi pond, white and black swans, flamingos, talking parrots, and even penguins. it was nice to take a stroll around the hotel to check out everything. also, the pool was huge with a fun water slide for adults. and what's great is that the kid's pool is on the other side so the adults dont have to deal with kids running around and stuff. the breakfast buffet at swan court was great. made to order omelets, pancakes, toast, fresh fruits, fresh juices, bread, etc. i dont think it's worth it if you have to pay about $30pp. but it definitely was a great start to each morning. however, if you want to visit ka'anapali beach, you'll have to walk 10-15 mins north 'cause there definitely isnt any beach in front of the hyatt. and plus the water isnt as great as near the sheraton. also, free self-parking spots (there are two lots i believe) are sometimes hard to find. we always found a spot but it's definitely limited at certain times of the day. overall, if you dont really care that the rooms are old and dated, i'd recommend the hyatt cause of everything else.

We spent one night here with a 14 and 11 year old. Rooms were clean, pool was clean general hotel was clean. Front desk made great suggestions on how to get to the Mariners game. They drop us at the rapid transit station and we took the train. 20 minutes later we are at the ballpark. Picked up after the game at the same spot awesone..... Morning breakfast was really busy they need more waffle machines and mare room but the staff worked real hard at trying to keep up with the rush of breakfast eaters. Quiet, could not tell untill outside that there was an airport right there. Would recomend for sure

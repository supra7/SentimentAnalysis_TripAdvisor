We stayed at the Sorrento for a wedding that was taking place on the 7th floor. We had a junior suite. It was small for a suite, but very quaint. Since this is an older hotel , everything seemed small. However, it was still beautiful. The bed was great. Everything was super clean. The concierge staff was great. We parked at the hotel and our car was always ready when we needed it. No negatives other than a charge for the restaurant was posted to our bill even though we never entered the restaurant. However, they promptly removed it.

My husband and I stayed at KBH for 6 nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel staff were truly wonderful. They were so nice and friendly. Our room was very nice for the money, except for the bathroom, it was older and needed some updating , and the toilet made this terrible noise each time we flushed. I regret that we did not bother to change our room though, we were just so happy to be there and we didnt't feel like lugging all of our things around again. The location of this hotel had to be the best on Kaanapali Beach. The beach was big and the water was nice and calm. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It is a great value, and we would certainly stay there again.

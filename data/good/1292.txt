We got a good rate of $83 on hotwire and felt we were pretty lucky to have gotten the Sheraton . It is in a really great location being in the midst of all of the great shopping, next door to the convention center and only 5 level blocks to Pike. We took review suggestions and requested a corner room in the Union Street Tower. We were offered this upgrade for an additional $20 . The room was newly renovated, bright and clean and maybe slighly larger than a standard room. We were on the 14th floor and the view was of rooftops and backs of buidlings but you may get better if you request a higher floor. The parking is a bit expensive even for Seattle so prepare for it. After reading mixed reviews about the cost I called the hotel and they told me $33.49. What they did NOT tell me was that there is a $7.51 parking TAX in addition. (Not really very honest if you ask me) The garage at 7th and Pike, that other reviewers mention, does not sound much less expensive but it is after you add in the extra tax and the valet tip (s ). For one night of parking plus tip we spent $45. The happy hour at the Daily Grill (3-6 daily) was great with both food and drink specials. We got there at 3 with a group of 10 and had to scrap for the last few seats so get there early. Little stuff aside, I would absolutely stay here again. I have other favorites in Seattle but I also paid more too. The Sheraton is a good value , very nice and very clean.

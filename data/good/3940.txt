Stayed here recently for a conference in the hotel proper which was quite convenient (the convention center was right next door though and would also be convenient if the conference was that large). The room was nice - we had a room on a high floor overlooking the bay which was gorgeous. There were three of us staying in the room and it was quite comfortable. The conference space was great - loads of comfortable places to go and sit down between sessions, have a chat with colleagues, etc. Most notable was the staff - the concierge staff was AMAZING!!! One of the best I've ever worked with. They saved us money, time, and energy - directed us to delicious food and fun things to do. Always, always helpful!!

The Edgewater is literally in the middle of everything "Seattle". It is walking distance, even considering the hilly landscape" from just about anything you want to see in this great city. Aside from location the hotel has a restaurant and bar with magnificent views of Elliott Bay. The room we stayed in was a little cramped with all the furniture, but was warm and rustic with a sitting area near the fireplace and a comfortable bed. The bathroom was spacious and appeared newly renovated.

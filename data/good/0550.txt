I've stayed here twice, both times the staff were fantastic. Were on a budget, so we loved the full kitchen. We used it for breakfast in the mornings, and the occasional snack. My family walked to the attractions, and the restaurants across the street were great. ( surprisingly kid friendly too!) This is an OLD hotel, but beautiful and full of charm. The Wifi reception wasn't great, but it's free. I would definitely stay here again.

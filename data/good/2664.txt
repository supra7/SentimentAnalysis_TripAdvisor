... and its not a cheap one! The Roosevelt hotel is located in downtown Seattle, which means you can walk from here to practically every major landmark in this beautiful Pacific Northwest city. Whether you want to walk to Pike place or to the Space Needle, the Roosevelt Hotel is a great option. Elegant foyer, cozy rooms just across the street from Barns and Noble, which, if you come from abroad, is always a treat! The only think lacking here is a restaurant of its own that holds up to the reputation of the hotel. The pub around the corner, which is accessible through the lobby, is ok, but just ok. Filled with Americana and levers from beer barrels, the place offers a small variety of items for breakfast. Having lunch there, is just not worthy; go to the Market and have sea food, lots of it! Expensive but I didn't spend a single dime on public transportation or gas. Just parked in and walked around. Location, location, location.

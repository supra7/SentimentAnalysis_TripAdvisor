We just returned from a week at the new Secrets Maroma Beach. It is an adults only all inclusive resort. It was my first trip to the Cancun area. My wife had been there once before. Overall we had a pleasant stay. We obtained a reasonable package rate from a travel agent - probably because the hotel is just getting started. The hotel has only been open three months so there are a few things that haven't been finished, like the road leading into the hotel. It was awful. A one-way dirt road full of pot holes. The beach is very nice and well maintained. We had very good beverage and food service while we soaked in the sun. The weather proved to be a lot nicer than the forecast. It rained off and on but the sun always came out a few minutes later. Actually the rain and clouds helped keep the heat down, but the humidity up. There are seven restaurants at the resort. Most seemed to serve the same food that are called different names. They have an excellent flank steak that is on the menu as a flank steak, rib eye, and a couple of names I couldn't pronounce. The food service at all the restaurants was very good. I did not have any one meal that impressed me. The food was OK just not 5 star. The mosquitoes were quite bad. The hotel is surrounded by waterfilled mango patches. I smashed several of the little bloodsuckers that were full of someone else's blood. This level of mosquitos may be common to the area and the environment for most of the hotels along the strip are the same. Be sure and take along bug replellent. The prices at the hotel for any purchases were very high and they use a less friendly 10-1 exchange rate. At tube of lip gloss cost $6.50 US. We took three day trips. The Olympia travel service has staff located in the hotel and were very helpful getting us to/from the airport and arranging for our day trips. The Mayan ruins are very impressive. Overall I think Maroma Beach rates well for the price and it's all new which is nice.

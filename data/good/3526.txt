I really would like to rate this higher than a four...but there is no way on TA to do so. Truly, the service is fantastic..."my pleasure" was the response we heard over and over...smiles and hola greetings were used by everyone on the staff. This friendly attitude greatly enhanced our stay. The extras that Secrets Maroma provided also made our stay special. Every day at the pool servers would come around with fantastic tacos, chicken and beef on skewers, pizza, fruit sticks, homemade ice cream, popsicles and great little pastry all on elegant platters. The restaurants were all good and again great service was provided. Our only complaint with the resort was relatively minor...but it caused us to not be able to say the stay was perfect. The landscaping in the main building was lovely...however, the middle of the resort was the poorest I have seen in the Riviera Maya. Weeds as tall as three feet were along the walkways and there was little effort to make the ground covering attractive with color. Unlike other resorts that I have visited in the Maya, I never saw groundkeepers working in any of the gardens...just by the beach where they were planting palms. It is very odd that so much care would be spent in making the rooms so lovely, then not bothering to do basic landscaping. The size and the amount of weeds showed months of neglect. The other area that we felt was lacking at SM is the pool. Bridges between the two pools would have made the area flow smoothly. As it was, folks were getting out of the main pool and walking the 20 feet over to the infinity pool to go swimming. We have been to other resorts where the pools were connected and it worked well. Would we go back to SM? Yes! We had a fantastic time, met some great people and were treated like kings!

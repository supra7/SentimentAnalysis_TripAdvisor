The staff were freindly, cheerful and helpful all the time. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. Well done housekeeping!!! The food great, with something for everyone. I would come back anytime, and have and will continue to recommend the hotel to anyone thinking of going to Mexico. Thank you for helping to make our holiday special.

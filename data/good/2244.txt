Our trip to Seattle was magical for the Christmas spirit. The hotel is intimate and super clean. The staff were very helpful and attentive (what we've come to expect from Kimpton). The lobby is very small for the evening wine tasting but certainly gives you the opportunity to meet other travellers. The room was luxurious and very comfortable. The beds were a treat! The location is in walking distance to all the downtown stores, Pike's Market and Benroya Hall. It is far enough away to offer quiet though. The cost was a little on the pricey side for the stay however. Seattle is a great city to visit and the people are very friendly.

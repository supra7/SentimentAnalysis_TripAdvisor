Often times saying airport hotel has a connotation to a certain bare minimum room close to the airport but this hotel is more than that. Overall I would say its an average Marriott, well-kept considering it seems like the typical 80s style layout etc. The northwest feel is nice with public areas with post and beams is nice and more than just a boxy hotel. The pool area would be great for families but not so much for adults traveling alone unless later in the evening but since its in the middle of the hotel everyone has to walk by and many rooms overlook the interior courtyard. The rooms are nice, textbook Marriott with furnishings and comfy bed however the bathrooms are tiny and barely room to move around in. Location for the airport is great with shuttles or a short 3 min drive. Hotel parking is fair based on cost and location and valet is a little more and prob worth it for convenience. All in all an average Marriott but I would say a great option for an airport hotel.

Most of the previous positive reviews of this hotel are on the money. The people are super nice, the location is incredible, the grounds are gorgeous and the beach is one of the best I've ever been on in my life. Sure, the hallways and stairwells (we were on the second floor) could use some sprucing up, but that is the only negative I can report on. They don't gouge you are the Tiki Bar/Grill, the food at the outdoor cafe and Mixed Plate buffet was very good, and you can't help but be in a good mood when you are there. In fact, you almost have to be looking for a reason to be disappointed with something if such trivial matters as the condition of the hallways "ruins" your time in Ka'anapali. Considering the price, especially compared to the neighboring hotels, this is a great choice for anyone who doesn't need max luxury at every turn. A very nice, simple, comfortable property.

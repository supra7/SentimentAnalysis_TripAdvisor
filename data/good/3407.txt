The hotel was very nice. It was pretty good size property. The beaches were absolutely stunning! The best I have seen so far. The service was good. Was not impressed by the food at all. This was my first time at an all inclusive property so I was expecting a lot, maybe too much! The selection was ok, but just the quality of the food was nothing to be desired. For the money I paid and the hoopla that I heard about this resort, I expected more. The best food that we had on the property was from room service and the grill during the daytime. Restaurants - so so! The actual room itself was very nice. Very plush and roomy.

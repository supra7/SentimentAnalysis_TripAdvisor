There are quite a few good things about this hotel. It is so nice to have a suite with a separate sitting area. When the kids go to sleep you still have the option to stay up awhile. The nightly manager's reception is a wonderful way to start the evening. And the made to order breakfast is second to none. I was blown away by the offerings at breakfast, ie omlettes, bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, and much more. Only one criticism would be that they could upgrade the facilities. They also have a problem with beatles. I understand that they fly in through the windows. Still, kinda yucky. I would still absolutely recommend this to any families for a nice getaway.

We are Starwood owners and use our points several times a year to "tour the big city" for a weekend and take in a game or a show downtown. Our "go-to" has always been the Westin...that may change! We had tickets for Wicked at the Paramount last week-end and couldn't get cash and points at the Westin so opted for the Sheraton...hadn't been there since the completion of the constuction, it was a mess then. Wow! What a great stay! The rooms are huge and the beds are wonderful. We were on the 17th floor in the new tower. Lovely "downtown" view...do miss the water views from the Westin. Ate at the Daily Grill 3 times, ya gotta try the Cobb omelette. And who else has Idaho Trout on the dinner menu in Seattle.. .it was done to perfection! Loved the central location and 2 nights with grown kids is always a treat! The Palomino just across the street is also worth a mention, Morton's is also just a block away. The staff was terrific, yup think we will be back!

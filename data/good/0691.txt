We spent a night at the Mayflower Park in August. The service was great and everyone was very attentive and very accommodating. We requested a room upgrade, but the hotel was full. However, the front desk clerk gave us coupons for free drinks and appetizers in the lounge. The lounge was great and so were the free drinks and appetizers. The room was really small and the bathroom was tiny, but this is an older hotel. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but it looked really good for this range hotel - lots of newer equipment, tvs and magazines to make it less tedious, and the air conditioning worked. We'd definitely consider staying at this hotel again.

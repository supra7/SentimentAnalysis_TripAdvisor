As the resort just opened I was expecting some kinks. The biggest problem I had was the food. They tried very hard to make the restaurants gourmet and they are not. The wait staff although extremely nice had a very hard time communicating and dinner service ran 2 to 3 hours - way way too long. Don't get me wrong we didn't starve. Breakfast buffet was fine, lunch buffet inconsistant and dinner just so, so. It also, took forever to get our luggage and our building conceirge had a problem communicating. I realize I am in their country, however, when you have a conceirge that is there for mostly english speaking guests they need to understand if not speak fluently. We also, wound up getting our own ice after waiting an hour for it. Our room was beautiful, the beach is beautiful, the entertainment staff around the pool area are fantastic and friendly no problem communicating at all. I had a massage in a temporary space and it was wonderful. The spa was not complete or was the Asian restaurant opened. I don't know that I would book a wedding just yet. Give them some time to fine tune the operation. You may want to try Capri for a wedding they seemed to have all the kinks worked out there. Also, Capri does a fantastic superbowl night. I spoke with many travel agents that visited Silversands and they were not happy.

i must say that the service was just perfect, I was staying with my wife in building 24 room 2437 for 4 days, our concierge was Janik and He gave us an excellent service every day, the food in the restaurants was good enough for me, the pool area and drinks excellent, the only bad thing was that we asked for a romantic dinner at the beach and that was really bad, for $200 US dlls we get to eat at the beach waiting a lot of time, cold food, one of the lobsters had something wrong, i dont know what but that was not a good expierience at all. everything else was OK

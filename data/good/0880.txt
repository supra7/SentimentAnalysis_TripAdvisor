This hotel was perfect for a girls shopping trip in Seattle. The price was great, especially for the location - the rooms are small, however if you don't plan on spending much time in them, it shouldn't be a problem. The beds were comfortable, more so than the average hotel room. The only downside is you can hear everything happening in the hallway, so if you attempt to sleep in you'll be woken by a vacuum at 8 a.m. Luckily the other guests staying here were respectful, and we rarely heard them. The staff were friendly and constantly helpful, they allowed us to check in early before we hit the stores. Parking was right next door to the hotel, and only $21 - which I think is a good deal for downtown seattle. I'm suprised travellers are shocked that they must pay for parking at a hotel - it's pretty standard in large cities where parking is at a premium.

Stayed here recently for just one night. Arrived very early and was shown my room immediately; no need to stow my bags for 4 hours and come back hoping to get into my room. In by noon, and much appreciated. It is a boutique hotel that likes to keep the hallways pretty dark. That is o.k with me, but I could see it being a bit uncomfortable for some. Anyway, room was a great corner room, bath amenities were great, work station very spacious. One gripe, and this is it. $14.95 for internet. There is an equally lovely boutique hotel across the street that serves up free internet. Heck, there are coffee shops on the same street that have free internet. $14.95 just seems to me like a little bit of gouging. Other than the sticker shock of the internet, it was a terrific stay; everyone I dealt with courteous and helpful. I would stay again.

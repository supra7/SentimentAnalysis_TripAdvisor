Great location and nice room. Complaints were the sleep number bed was just ok not great. Also... we have a young child and had to valet our own luggage inside as the bell boy was not around. Then once the saw us, helped and off course wanted a tip. Little tacky. Good airport shuttle service and free newspapers in the lobby.

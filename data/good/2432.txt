If you like great design hotels, the W Seattle is for you! The location is good, only a few flocks from many of the downtown sites. I was lucky enough to get a corner room, they are quite large, very comfortable (the bed and linen are fantastic), with great views and a pleasant feel, also the bathroom was large. The lobby is beautiful with sofas, books, and great design. If you stay on weekends there is a DJ at the bar, it's one of the fashion place in Seattle. However if the concierge service is good, the staff at the reception was not so great. They even add a parking fee to my bill (quite funny when you're travelling without a car). With nicer people at the reception I would give 5 stars to the W Seattle.

We had a great time in the most Hawaiian hotel in Maui. They really treat you like family. They offer free activities for kids & adults, giving kids small gifts and a hawaiian name, which they loverd. We got a great rate on Hotels.com so the value was exceptional. The beach had a surf advisory so it was recommended not to go in the water but we ended up going toward black rock where it was somewhat calmer and where snorkeling is awesome. I went diving to Molokini and ended up seeing pretty much the same thing as at black rock. There were 2 giant green sea turtles, unicornfish, trompetfish, wrasses, butterflyfish, etc..., right off the beach. The hotel also has a small fridge which was a god-sent for stocking liquids. There is a nightly free hula show with music, and the whaler's shopping center is walking distance. I recommend looking first for cheap souvenirs at ABC stores and then for what you don't find there, go to other stores which are much more pricey.

The resort service was absolutely one of the best!!! The resort entertainment staff was alot of fun and really got the the party going. Nightly entertainment was one of the things we really enjoyed. Most resorts that we have been to have horrible entertainment. The rooms were spectacular. Very small resort so all the rooms were close or a short walk to any place you wanted to go on the property. Towels were left on all lounge chairs for you at all times and handed out on the way to the beach. The beach was absolutely beautiful!!! You truely did not have to lift a finger at this resort. Wait service at the beach and pool for food and drinks. That was amazing!!! The resort is not the most beautiful visually that we have every been, but very warm. The staff did their very best to take care of all your needs, know matter what the request. That was very impressive. I would not recommend the premier club. The added cost of the trip is not worth it!!!! The food was great!!! I do not recommend eatting steak when away because it's not like in the states. That is my thought so of course we were not big on the steak house. All the other resturants were fabulous. I would highly recommend this resort to honeymooners. Alot of the people staying at this resort are young couples. Don't forget you are paying for this service they give you and it doesn't come cheap!!!! So, if you are looking to save cash and this resort is not in your budget, There are alot of other resorts just as nice, but less the little added perks. Another I would recommend is the Grand Palladium White Sands Cabana Suites for an awsome honeymoon. (The resort is just not as catering) Upgrading rooms at other resorts can still save you alot and you will still have a blast. AI is the only way to go for me. The resort is not everything, it's the area and what you make of it. We have been traveling a great deal and all resort are give and take something.

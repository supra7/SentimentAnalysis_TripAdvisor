I chose the hotel because of the website's purported style: funky and fun, and it delivered. Upside: Front desk staff were helpful; they helped us change dates without a problem. Then they actually suggsted switching packages on check-in to be more beneficial to us. To other reviewers who complain about parking, I would suggest they choose a package with it included (we did). On checkout, she was very helpful with restaurant charges at the end. Housekeeping were pleasant and helpful. Per other reviews: I would ask people to consider that iI is a small boutique hotel, and you pay for that feel (and correspondingly pay a lower price relative to the big hotels): so one should not expect immediate staff for every call. The hotel is small, but they use colour and humour to capitalize on what they have, from room keys, to signage, to door decor. Red Fin Restaurant staff were great: in the a.m. there is no latte machine but we brought one in with our breakfast and they were more than gracious. Breakfast was just right. Food in the evening was good, happy hour lively and great value: we did not have dinner, because of other obligations elsewhere, but appetizers were great. Downside: the rooms are small, we have stayed in London hotel rooms that were larger! The bathroom shower is miniscule. For a one or two night stay, it is fine, not a problem. For longer stays, it would make for cranky bedmates.

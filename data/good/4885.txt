First, we were not booked this hotel while we were staying in Roma. Upon our arrival at Sonya Hotel, Roma, where the reception persuaded us to stay their group hotel (Hotel Opera Roma). Owing to our booking a triple room, I knew there was no room for triple in this hotel. This hotel only has Twin/Double rooms. An extra bed would be set up for three. We refused it. Afterward, we had an argument with the reception of Sonya Hotel. To avoid our unpleasant, we moved to this hotel with the assistance of Mr. Litu (staff of Hotel Opera Roma). To be honest, this hotels room is not suitable for triple. It is a little bit of tiny and we could not open our suitcase on the floor. On the next morning, Mr. Reza (staff) approached us when we were taking our breakfast. As he knew our unpleasant, he told us a bigger room would be arranged for change. After breakfast, he showed me a suite. To my surprise, it was a great offer which we unexpected. No additional charge would be added. After we did sights in town, our luggage has been already moved in the suite. The Opera Roma offers a high level of comfort and privacy. The imposing classical facade, the finely furnished, modern accommodation make for a truly elegant atmosphere. The suite boast a spacious Jacuzzi. The interior of the hotel is wonderful, the rooms were probably the best we stayed in whilst in Italy. Spacious, clean, very nicely decorated and comfortable. Start our mornings on a rich buffet breakfast comprising savory foods and homemade cakes and pastries, and indulge in free coffee or tea directly in our room. It's just a 10 minute walk from the train station and tube station which is really convenient for train/tube connections. Although the area is not the best as it's close to the train station, we felt quite safe. Staff were very welcoming and courteous, especially, Mr. LITU and REZA. I'd recommend staying here and would stay again!

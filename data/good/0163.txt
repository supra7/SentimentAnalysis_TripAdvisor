The hotel is located near the Westlake shopping area; easy access to the light rail from the airport and the monorail to the Space Needle. The front desk staff were very nice, though there was only one person at the desk when we checked in and she was on the phone trying to help a disgruntled guest who wanted to change rooms though they were sold out for the night. They did give us an upgrade and a room with a fabulous view of the Space Needle. The beds were very comfortable. They stored our luggage all day while we went sightseeing. The only problem was that we had no hand towels in our bathroom when we arrived. That night we called housekeeping and they brought some right up. I would definitely stay here again if I stay in Seattle

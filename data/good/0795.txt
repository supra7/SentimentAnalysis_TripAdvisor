The Moore is nothing fancy, but it provides clean, spacious accomodations within spitting distance of Pike Place Market. Folks could complain about the decor, and rightfully so--the lobby and hallways are drab, the rooms are on the dim side--but it is a budget hotel after all, right? The furniture and carpet in our room looked newish, the beds and bathroom were clean, and I'm not sure what more you can ask for at the price. Speaking of which, prices are reasonable, with few rooms topping $100. We had a double queen room for Memorial Day weekend and paid only $92 per night. Rooms a few blocks away at the Westin and other similar chains were easily double that. Lobby staff was helpful and friendly, and there is a large, secure room for storing luggage after you've checked out. The crowd at the attached bar /restaurant was sparse, and the place put off a slightly depressing vibe. For a good breakast, hit the Crumpet Shop at the market or the Crocodile Cafe a few blocks up on 2nd. Overall, the Moore is a good budget option right near the market, waterfront, ferries, downtown buildings (check out the public library), and bus lines to all the neighborhoods. Can't say we'd want to stay in Belltown again (a bit sketchy at times--safe, but sketchy), but we'd definitely stay at the Moore if we did.

We had a 10 day stay at the Hyatt Regency in Maui. It was absolutely beautiful. The weather was great. When we arrived they had over booked the hotel so we were upgraded to an oceanview suite it was lovely. We had to pay a little more but it was nice. The restaurant Spats was very good we ate there a few times. We went into the town of Lahaina to eat lots of great restaurants and shopping. Down the beach past some of the resorts there was a shopping area there is a restaurant there called the Hula Grill it had great goat cheese pizza. The buffet was very good in the resort The rooms were clean but a little outdated. The beds were amazing. The only real complaint that we had was that the beach wasn't very good and they wanted $40 a day for chairs I thought this terrible considering what you already pay for the rooms. We took a helicopter tour of the island it was well worth the money. We had an amazing catamaran snorkle day book with Trilogy it was a first class operation. They also served a great BBQ lunch. It was a great 10 days I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Sandy Toronto

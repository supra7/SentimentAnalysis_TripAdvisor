The wife and I really liked our stay. I too was nervous about the room size, but not overly concerned, as we have stayed in small European hotels. Our solo room was fine - queen or king bed that was ultrasoft and comfortable with many pillows, there was decent leg room around both sides, and the bathroom was small but ample enough for one person at a time. Service was great, and the business center was helpful, but there are only 2 computers, so plan accordingly. Small gym on the 2nd floor. The only negative was our TV image was kind of dark and the volume was different for each channel. It worked well enough we dealt with it, but if you're planning a night inside for movies, check your TV first.

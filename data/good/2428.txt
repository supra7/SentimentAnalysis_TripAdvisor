Went away on a girls weekend and stayed at the W..wasn't sure how it would be, but ended up loving it! I typically play it safe by booking at a Fairmont, Four Seasons etc., but now I'm totally converted. I will absolutely consider the W wherever i go on future adult getaways. The cost of the room was minimal and the room was large (corner King suite), actually they upgraded me for free to this room now that i recall. Ipod dock was a nice touch. Loved the cool vibe of the hotel once you come through the doors, from the lighting to the decor, very hip and sexy - just makes you feel more stylin' to be there. Yes the lighting in the halls was dark, but i must say i loved it even though i got turned around almost every time i stepped off the elevator - oh well i was on vacation. That was another plus, hip elevator music - refreshing. Lot's of activity in the Lobby at night, DJ spinning..etc very cool. Staff all young, so much so i wasn't sure i could count on getting my wakeup call, but it came right on time. Room service was fine, cereal not covered up with anything which i found odd - for sanitary reasons it should have been. a few minor glitches with service, but always attended to promptly so no complaints. I actually missed the feel of the hotel when i got home, will plan another trip to Seattle just to stay there again and get back to that relaxed cool vibe..(especially for the price). I would not recommend it for a family getaway, but definitely for adults and if you like hip cool places you will be very happy here. If not stick to the Fairmont etc.

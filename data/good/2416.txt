My wife and I had never visited Seattle. We took our two young daughters and stayed 4 nights at the W Hotel. What a great pick...it is located in the center of "downtown", and is within easy walking distance of shopping and dining. When we arrived, the valet was right there to help unload our luggage from the rental car, and made us feel very welcome right away. Much appreciated when you are trying to wrangle two excited young children while trying to check in! The staff at the front desk were busy with other guests, but took time out to acknowledge us and let us know it would be just a minute or two. When they did get to us, they were friendly, and interested in not only checking us in, but in finding out the purpose of our visit. The young lady made a couple of sightseeing suggestions (the Seattle Aquarium, and a ride on a ferry boat across the Puget Sound, which was fantastic). We checked into our room and were pleased with the updated decor. The beds were comfortable, though a little small. We were even impressed with the maid service. Anyone traveling with children knows that keeping the room picked up is a bit of a chore. The maid organized items on the bathroom counter, nicely folded discarded clothes and placed them on end of the bed. We truly enjoyed the hospitality of the staff at this hotel, as well as the updated decor and the beautiful location in Seattle.

I booked this hotel through Hotwire for a great rate, as I was only staying one night and wasn't really picky about the details of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to have gotten the Doubletree! This hotel is by far one of the nicest (if not the nicest) airport hotel at Sea-Tac. The facility is a tower plus several small buildings surrounding a swimming pool and hot tub. One of the buildings backs onto a small lake, and there's almost a park-like atmosphere around the hotel. I arrived at a very very busy hotel, as the weather was bad and there were several flights either cancelled or delayed. Check-in was fast, and professional - and they give you warm chocolate chip cookies upon arrival! My room was spacious, very clean, and comfortable - especially after a treacherous drive down from Vancouver. My only complaint about the room was that the drain on my tub was VERY slow (to the point of being completely clogged), so I was showering in a puddle the entire time. The bed was fantastic. I went for dinner in the lounge/restaurant - that was extremely busy due to the weather cancellations - my server was very professional albeit personable and friendly! She made a great dinner suggestion for me, and as I was dining alone - I ended up sharing my table with a couple lovely Alaska Airlines flight attendants who were also "stuck" at the hotel. Check out was quick and easy, and I think they gave me more cookies! The shuttle driver to the airport was professional and courteous! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who is looking for nice accommodations either before or after a flight, or for anyone that needs to stay in the South Seattle area.

I was at the Roosevelt for a 1 night stay August 30 with my 10 year old and my Mother. We booked a 2 bed double on the hotel website for the same price as quoted by Priceline and other hotel resellers. Our room was a good size with two windows over looking the corner of 7th and Pine. The staff was friendly and the service was quick and efficient. The Valet was OUTSTANDING, I had called the parking lots next to the Hotel and they wanted $2 to $5 more for 24 hour parking so of course I stayed with the Roosevel Valet and am very happy with my decision. I've noticed in all the reviews that the guests that have complained have all booked via resellers (ie; Priceline). Maybe the lesson for them is, booked direct with the hotel if you want the best service? If I was the Management in the Hotel I would also bump those who did not book directly with the Hotel. I will absolutely return again, the location was wonderful, and the hotel was easy to access from the highway. The only thing that I have to say that is that the elevators were slow (1 was broken) and the only ice/beverage machines were on the 2nd floor but that certainly wont keep me from going back.

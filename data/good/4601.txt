We were very pleased with the service. Our bed was turned down each night with island cookies placed on our pillows. The leaving ceremony was a great touch. I priced the lei given and it was around $10 if I had bought it at Hilo Hatties. The Tiki Bar was great as well as the breakfast. The only negative comment that I left on the comment card was that it was in need of some redecorating. I would make sure my friends are aware of this before they booked the hotel.

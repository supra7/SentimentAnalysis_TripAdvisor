We got the Seattle Weston thru Priceline at $125 per nite for 3 nites in September. The room was fine: good size with a couch, desk, good size bath with all the amenities. It did have a Murphy bed which was a surprise; a bit soft but it was fine. We wonder whether Priceline rooms are a bit less quality but it was fine. It was room 2050 and very quiet. We needed a few things from housekeeping and they were right there. Front desk and lobby area was bustling. It is large hotel used for cruisers and conventioneers. The pool area on the 5th floor was a nice getaway and quite clean; we used it on one of the afternoons. The hotel is centrally located to everything and we walked to Pikes Market a few times a day. For what we paid we were quite happy as rates on-line were $200+.

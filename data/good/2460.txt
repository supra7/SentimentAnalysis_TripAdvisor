I have stayed at this hotel at least 5 times over the last 2 years and have never been disappointed. The customer service is excellent, the rooms are spacious and I absolutely love the decor. There is an ambiance when you walk into the lobby which words cannot describe. Candles burning everywhere, comfy sofas, music oozing you into quiet contentment. Highly recommended for professionals & single couples.

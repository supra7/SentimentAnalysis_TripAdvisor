After much hesitation we booked for the second time at Maui Eldorado in Feb 2006. Last stay was Feb 2004 in E105. That room was dark, dingy, damp and outdated. We booked for Feb 2006 through Great Hawaii Vacations after being assured this was a nice place to stay. When making the reservation, they added comments to my booking that we were returning guests requesting a 2nd floor "updated" studio room. When I arrived, we were upgraded for some reason to a a 2nd floor one-bedroom which was fantastic (Room B203). The room was huge with a large lanai overlooking the pool and golf course. It was updated, clean, bright, and contained two queen beds, a sofa bed, large bathroom with a very large shower, and a nice kitchen containing all the things we needed. We were very pleasantly surprised. After our own experience and reviewing comments on this site, it seems that Maui Eldorado has a mixed bag to offer. The parking is $5 per day and there was a small charge if you wanted to use the safe. There were still issues with having enough parking, but they assured us if we couldn't find a spot, we could just call security and they would help us. Although we only had a little interaction with the staff, they were pleasant and helpful.

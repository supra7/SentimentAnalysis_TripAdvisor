The location is great. The rooms & beds were good. We enjoyed the two bath rooms, but the room and decor are a little tired. General view was just okay, but sitting on one of the beds, we had a beautiful sliver view of the Space Needle. The rate for our package was absolutely fantastic, which included tickets to the Gauguin exhibit. The staff was fine, but didn't seem especially happy to help us. I would only choose this hotel again over one of the many great ones in Seattle if the rate was right.

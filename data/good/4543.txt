We visited Maui and stayed with family at a timeshare but planned to spend one night away from the kids to celebrate our anniversary. After reading reviews here, I booked the one night at this hotel and we had a great time. We didn't have a big budget so I booked a garden view, which looked pretty and when we checked in, we learned we were upgraded to an ocean front room. We were on the 2nd floor of the Molokai building with such a beautiful view. And a room that was huge. We spent almost 4 hours just laying on lounge chairs on the lawn area outside our room...all the sounds of the beach but with shade and no sand. The best part was sleeping with the window open and hearing the sound of the ocean all night. We really wished we could have asked to extend our stay, but we needed to return to the rest of our family. One thing the room needed- for a room that had a king bed, plus a sofa that converted to a bed, plus another room with a full size bed, it should have had a mini fridge. Since the room could fit a family, a fridge would be a must. Very friendly staff and a good central location- family joined us the next day for fun on the beach.

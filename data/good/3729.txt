I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights whilst atending a conference. The hotel is modern (don't expect too much in the way of style) and situated in a quietish part of the city. It is relatively easliy reachable using the excellent Metro system, but quite a long way from the centre of Madrid. My room was comfortable and well set-up for business users. The (wired) internet worked fine. However the aircon was barely up to the task - and this was in October so I don't know what it would have been like in the summer. The breakfast buffet was OK with a decent variety of dishes on offer. Overall, good value for money

After a nightmare at another hotel, I stayed here while in town to visit my grandmother who was ill in the hospital. Upon arrival the lobby was very clean and even smelled nice. The front desk clerk was extremely busy and since I also work for a Quality Inn and Suites, I know how crazy things can get so just because the guest service agent couldn't jump up for me I wouldn't find it to be a cause for complaint. The hotel is older though it seems some rennovations have been made or are currently in the works. My room was small but clean, no hairs in the bathroom which is a huge plus for most travelers. The beds were comfortable, wifi was fast, overall the room was well maintained. The General Manager pulled me into conversation and was very nice and professional. He seemed genuine when asking me about how my stay was and that was before he knew I worked for another Choice Hotel, so that is another plus. After hearing some not so nice things about this property from travelers, I can say honestly that my experience was good and I suggest that people find out for themselves as I did. I would stay here again!

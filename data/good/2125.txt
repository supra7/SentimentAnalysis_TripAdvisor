We recently stayed at the Westin Seattle in the south tower. Our room was spacious and had a very nice view of the water and the space needle (in between two other buildings, but it was still a good view). The beds were super comfortable. The bathroom was small, but that was because of the big bathtub! We were there with our two small children (4 and 2) and they loved the bathtub, the big tv that swivels, and all the pillows. The pool was perfect for families with children--it does not have a deep end. I didn't like having to go through the lobby and back up another elevator to get to the north tower where the pool is, but otherwise the pool was a great amenity. Westin has a Kids Club thing so our children were given bags when we checked in with a hat, postcard kit, and a few other small items--which they thought was so exciting. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.

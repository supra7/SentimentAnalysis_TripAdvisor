I stayed at the Comfort Suites for one night only during a business trip. The hotel is very clean and all staff I came in contact with were extremely pleasant and helpful. The room was clean, the bed comfortable. We had lunch on the outdoor patio off the dining room area. Food was ok. There is an odd, rather strong odor when first walking into the hotel, I suspect from the kitchen although it doesn't smell in the hallways or in the room. The basic complimentary breakfast was welcomed and good. The soap and shampoo provided are not particularly special. The business center in the lobby was really helpful so my co-workers and I were happy to have that accessible. The only downside here is that the hotel is on the opposite side of the Lucas Oil Stadium so not an easy walk to all the restaurants downtown.

Stayed two nights in early March and have absolutely no complaints. Awesome location to everything downtown, minutes away from Pike Place Market and the waterfront. Impeccably clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Flat screen TV in the room. My girlfriend used the internet, so I cannot comment on that, but she didn't complain about it. Rooms were very quiet, it seemed we were the only ones there.

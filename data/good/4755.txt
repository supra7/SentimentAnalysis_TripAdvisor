If you want to stay cheaply in expensive Maui, are not overly particular and don't care that you have a 15 minute walk through the resort to the ocean, this may be the place for you. First, the hotel staff were very accommodating. They upgraded my room from a studio to a one bedroom and I rented it through an opaque site. We saw another couple come in who had been delayed in arriving by a late flight and the hotel staff did not charge them for their missed night of stay. Our room was definitely dated, especially the kitchen and a little worn around the edges. The rooms appear to be individually owner and I imagine the accommodations could vary largely. These rooms were however huge with all kinds of storage space. They had large patios over looking gardens or the golf course, both of which were lovely. The pool areas were nice and well kept. Their private cabana on the ocean was nicely equipped but seemed to fill up early with people saving chairs and tables, but not utilizing them. One complaint I would have is that the railing in the cabana is so high that you have trouble seeing the ocean when sun bathing. Overall, if I was doing Maui "on the Cheap" I would definitely consider staying here.

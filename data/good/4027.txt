FYI, don't book here through Orbitz if you feel like you might to change your room before you go. If you call the Hyatt directly, they'll tell you they can't because you booked through Orbitz. You call Orbitz, and they say they have to call the Hyatt to see about your change. Really? Anyway, after being there 3 days we finally got to change to a better room than the 2nd floor room above the patio rooms with the screaming children and barely any ocean view, some "Deluxe Ocean View Room" that was. The area in which the Hyatt is in is perfect, Kaanapali is a great place to be, the weather is very favorable there. I probably would come here again but do my booking differently, the resort is very pretty with many things to do.

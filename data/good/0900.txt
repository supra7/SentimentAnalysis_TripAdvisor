I wanted a hotel that was reasonable in price, located in downtown, clean, and offered self parking at a reasonable rate rather than valet parking which I refuse to use primarely because I don't want some stranger driving my vehicle and I'm not lazy enough to require someone else to park my car for me. I got all of those things at the Executive Hotel Pacific. The room was small but comfortable. We were upgraded to a king room when I had reserved a queen which was a nice surprise and I'm guessing doesn't happen everytime. Parking was nearby, easy in and out, and cheap compared to other hotels I had called. I'll stay there again if I ever need to go to the city.

Just stayed four nights in a penthouse room and couldn't be happier. Since we were just exploring the city every day and night, we didn't need a full-service hotel. We didn't eat there or even need to call down to the front desk for anything, so I can't speak to the service. But the property itself is great. Very new, very clean -- funky design touches without being weird. Highly recommend the penthouse units. It had a couch and two separate wall-mounted TVs. The terrace is spacious and features a great little sitting area that makes for nice sunset happy hours. Bathroom was stylish and spotless. The price was right as we paid about US$150 per night in the middle of summer. Location isn't right next to any transit but a five-minute walk from three different lines. Walk to Brandenberg Gate is about 30 minutes. Walk to Wittenberg Platz is about 20 minutes. Neighborhoods immediately to the west have lots of great shops and restaurants.

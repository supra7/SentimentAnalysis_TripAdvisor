Secrets Maroma Beach was just wonderful! Room was very comfortable although they have the enegy saving system that shuts off your AC when you leave. But all in all a great vacation. Staff and service was above average and food was good too! Only negative is do not go to this area to do allot of scuba diving...save that for Cozumel.

Pros: If you're looking to spend a few days in the sun or a long weekend away, this is the place for you. The pool area is incredible, including a fabulous pool bar, and there is no shortage of friendly staff available to assist you with frozen cocktails or food (daily Mexican buffet at noon, outdoor dining nearby and carving stations wheeled by on occasion). The white sand beach also lived up to our high expectations, and they have a little bar under a thatch roof hut with swings for seats. During our visit in July, it wasn't difficult to find chairs or umbrellas necessary for relaxing and escaping the sun. It only rained one day during our trip, but it down poured from morning until night. They offered games (ping pong under a different thatch roof hut for something to do during the foul weather, and pool volleyball was fun on sunny days). I also took a few of the yoga classes available in the morning and they were great for an active person looking to take a breather from a more rigorous fitness routine. We weren't that interested in the nightlife, but there were things to do if that's your scene. The rooms were beautiful and we had a nice experience with our swimout. No issues and the A/C was ice cold. Cons: If you're a "foodie" this probably isn't the place for you. You could survive on the Mexican, but the food available for room service and in the themed restaurants are sub par at best. The daily breakfast at the World Cafe offered decent options, and as I mentioned before, the Mexican buffet and the restaurant by the pool were decent. The food is the main reason why I suggest this as a perfect 3-5 getaway in the sun. Anything longer than that for a person who likes to cook or dine out might be a bit much. Enjoy!

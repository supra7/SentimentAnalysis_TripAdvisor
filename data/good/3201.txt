Loved, loved, loved this hotel! The location is perfect -- a block from shopping on St. Catherine's and 3 to 4 blocks from the Peel metro station. For the tech-savvy/intrigued, your room key powers the room. Loved the wetbar w/ microwave and mini-fridge. The wireless internet was unavailable most of my stay; however, the computers downstairs did the job. The staff was very accommodating; however, be sure to press the "Do not Disturb" button before going to bed --housekeeping rang my doorbell 3 times (before 10am) the first morning! The frontdesk staff was very helpful. I had trouble unlocking the safe and they sent a technician up in 5 min who resolved the issue. I had an early flight out and the valets/bellboys ensured a cab was waiting to take me to the airport. Le Crystal is a wonderful hotel and I will definitely stay there again!

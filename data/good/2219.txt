I visited this hotel on a college search trip with my daughter and her best friend. This was a great place and a great value. We felt safe, there was free parking and we were able to take their free shuttle down to the waterfront to see the sights. The room was small, but comfortable and clean and the free breakfast saved us some money as well. I am now on their mailing list and they send me special rates. I am planning to go again next month with my next daughter.

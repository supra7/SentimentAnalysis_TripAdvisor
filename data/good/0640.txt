I've stayed at many hotels in Seattle, including the Olympic, the Sorrento, and the Inn at the Market. Although perhaps not as elegant as the others, the Mayflower Park was a terrific place to stay. The room was a large corner queen with lots of windows and light. The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and welcoming. There were nice touches such as a good Speakman shower head and excellent storage in the room. The restaurant was lovely for breakfast, again with great service. And the location cannot be beat for shopping -- steps from Nordstrom and Macy's -- lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby. Finally, the price was right. In all, a great stay. Thanks!

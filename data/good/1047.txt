Hotel is convienently located downtown. Walking distance to Pike's market, the Wharf and to Qwest Field or Safeco Field. Rooms are nice and clean. Nice open lounge area downstairs that serves Starbucks ($). Staff very friendly and helpful. Had an issue with the fridge in the room and it was fixed right away. If you can get a room on the other side of the hotel from the highway, it is less noisy. Would stay here again.

Ok, here are a few comments about the last reviews and my stay. I just spent one night at the Warwick in Seattle. Location: very good. Staff: helpful and professional Room: nice mattress. High floor and away from elevator as requested. It is true that the heater is a bit noisy. Parking is expensive (almost $20/night) so is the restaurant Margaux although they do offer a 15% discount to the guests of the hotel. I whish the internet connection was free like in so many other hotels nowadays. Lobby is normally sized. Nice and well decorated. Why do you need something bigger? Didn't try the pool or the gym but my overall impression is good and I would recommend this hotel.

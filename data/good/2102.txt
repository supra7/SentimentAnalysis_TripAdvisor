Cold pool and expensive parking put a damper on our recent 3 night stay. Staff was nice. I thought I would park on the street but you have to continually buy parking passes (2 hr intervals) and overnight parking would mean I wake up at 6 am. Leave car and bathing suite elsewhere. Otherwise, nice rooms and great view in north tower facing north of Needle and bay. Close to Pike's market, shopping and monorail stop.

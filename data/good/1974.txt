We were in room 2959. After booking on Priceline for Sat/Sun night ($75/night) we still ended up getting a high floor king room. We were even able to check in at 10:00AM even though they were "full". Strongly recommend this hotel as we walked everywhere from the Space Needle to Pike's Place, to a brunch cruise, to the Underground Tour, Belltown for a night out, and even to the Mariners game (that's a long walk though!). We did cab it round trip to avoid renting a car. Probably could've taken public transportation each way but we got lazy on that front. Asian man (sorry, can't remember his name) at the concierge desk was very helpful. Older dark haired woman, not so much. Fitness center was nice, don't quite understand the 2nd fitness room with bikes and other misc equipment up a few stairs from the main one. Internet was $9.95 a day but pretty speedy. Definitely recommend the short walk to Top Pot Donuts, so good! Overall, definitely recommend. We didn't find it to be old at all but maybe it's a nature of the floor we stayed on.

The Pera Tulip is a great hotel with very helpful, informative and friendly staff who speak great English, Beatics and Kubilay on reception were especially helpful. The hotel is in a great area of Istanbul, surrounded by lively bars, restaurants and clubs - this means you are literally in the heart of most of the night life of Istanbul. As a result some of the rooms can be noisy so if you are planning on early nights (pre 3am ish) a room on the top floors at the back would be a good request, otherwise if you can sleep through anything, like me, or are out a lot then all rooms are great. The Turkish bath, mini pool, bubble pool and sauna where an excellent benefit to have at the base of the hotel and were all really quiet when I used them. The room was lovely, modern, contained everything you needed with a comfy bed and great bathroom. Would certainly recommend this hotel, provided you take note of the noise - although would imagine if you want quiet and early nights this wouldn't be your preffered area to stay in and you may be in the old town etc....

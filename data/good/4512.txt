We stayed at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel in February in one of the ocean front rooms and it was great! The Humpback Whales could be seen from our Lanai from early in the morning until late afternoon. The breakfast buffet at their Tiki Restaurant was very good and we ate there every morning. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and happy to talk with you and give you directions or whatever you need. We have stayed at this hotel before and will stay here again!

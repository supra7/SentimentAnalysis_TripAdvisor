My family and I just returned from an 8 night stay at this resort. While there we toured many of the other hotels on Ka'anapali Beach. We were extremely pleased with our choice. The Hyatt had the biggest and most diverse swimming pools (with plenty of room and attractions for both adults and young children), extensive and beautiful gardens with sculptures, breath-taking lobby and the greatest diversity of shops. It is too bad that it's beach was so narrow although the landscaped area immediately in front of the sand was large, beautiful and well tended by the wait staff. We stayed on the top floor (Regency Area) and enjoyed the amenities and staff of the Regency Room. They were exceptional in every way. Throughout the hotel and its shops, all the staff was pleasant, cheerful and eager to please. The beds were the most comfortable of any I have ever slept in across America and Europe. One note: the concierges in the lobby are Expedia employees. The hotel's activity staff is located down the hall in the midst of the shops.

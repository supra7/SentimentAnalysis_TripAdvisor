Stayed 4 night at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel and loved it. We can't wait to go back. Their beach is beautiful, and the location is great. An easy walk to Whalers Village for shopping and eating. The staff is extremely friendly and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. The only thing to be aware of, is that our room was on the 3rd floor (great ocean view), but there was no elevator. Not to much of a hassle for us, but it would have been nice to have known ahead of time.

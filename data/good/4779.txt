My wife and our 9 month old baby stayed here. It was spacious (we had an upstairs loft and semi-separate 1 bedroom) suite. the views were fantastic (partial ocean view) and it was a nice quiet place. the decor wa somewhat dated, but relatively clean, although my wife wouldn't sit on the wicker furniture. There is great maid-service daily (so you don't have to make the bed!). the kitchen was adequately stocked with utensils etc. In-suite laundry is nice when traveling with a baby. Parking was not a problem. there is wireless internet, but only at the lobby and the swimming pool (this was actually good because you dont' spend time working while you're in the suite!). Overall, it was a good place with a relatively good deal (we paid ~$260/night). Nice short walk to the beach which was a beautiful and quiet slice of paradise.

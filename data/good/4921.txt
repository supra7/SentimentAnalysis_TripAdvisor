During April, I had four separate stays at this hotel and this means I had the opportunity to view four of the eight rooms available; three of these were genuine 'suites', i.e. separate living room and kitchen to the bedroom. The three suites all offered a good amount of space for two adults. Room No. 1 is not actually a suite, just a bedroom and separate shower/loo. Beds are very comfortable - OK, more impressive than what Sheraton state about theirs! I cannot remember their slogan but found the beds at Parc Suites to be superb. Some of the furnishings are a little tired but, possibly, these will be replaced at the same time as the new extension - yes, the hotel is increasing in size this year! Besides the owner (Mr Demirdogan), three other staff were seen on reception and all very pleasant. Parc Suites is two blocks from the nearest Metro (Place des Arts) and in a reasonably central position but then Montreal is not that large anyway. If you like walking, it is a good location for 'the mountain', for Mordecai Richler's streets named in his novels, for McGill University campus and so on.

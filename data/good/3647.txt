This is on the Lower East Side. I booked a double room because I read the rooms were small - they are! We had two twin beds a few inches apart, a small desk and a long hook that served as a closet. You pretty much live out of your suitcase. However the bathroom was beautiful and there's a flat screen TV, The hotel is small and staff were very helpful. The rate of $210/night before tax included a very good breakfast buffet and free internet access in the dining room, and a great rooftop deck with views of the NY skyline. We went up every evening. There are a few restaurants nearby, it's a 10 minute walk to the East Village and about 15 minutes to Greenwich village and there's a subway stop a block away. There's also a big Whole Foods Market down the street for snacks, which was great for evenings on the roof.

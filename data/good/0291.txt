I don't have a lot to add to the other reviews as we only stayed for one night. Just wanted to say our room was a good size, the location is wonderful and we loved the roof deck. I went up early in the morning to work and it was sunny and crisp and a fantastic way to begin the day. Definitely a great place to stay in Seattle.

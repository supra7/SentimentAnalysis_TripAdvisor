We had a nice stay here. It was our third choce as our top two were booked - we waited to long to book. Breakfast was adequate but of our 3 mornings there only once did they refill the scrambled eggs and for a breakfast that runs 3 hours at 9 am re filling eggs should be standard. Modern decor. Didn't expect the circus colors of the walls. Not traditional Venetian decorating. Hated the bathroom. Obviously designed by a man. Not place to dry a towel or place your toiletries. Why is this an issue in so many hotels?? Is a shelf or a towel bar too much to ask. Not even a shelf in the shower for soap/shampoo/razor??I get form but a little function goes a long way towards enhancing a hotel experience. Easy to reach - Riva de Biasio stop on the vaporetto. Take a left off that make a right at the wall. Hotel is on your right at the small tree out front. Easy location with bags. Also easy to get to Burano/Murano/Torecello - take the 52 from Rivio de Biaso stop to Fondamente Nuova then the 42 to Murano or Burano. From Burano then an easy transfer to the #12 vaporetto to Torcello. A 45 minute trip vs an hour + a half plus if you leave from San Marco and take the LN to Punta Sabbion and then transfer again. Room was clean & hotel was well maintained. I would recommend.

If you're traveling on a budget in Puerto Rico, this is a good choice. Large, clean rooms. One block from the lovely main square in Mayaguez. This hotel used to be a convent for the nearby church. The biggest disadvantage we found was that the rooms (we stayed in 2 different rooms) did not have windows, so there was no opportunity to get natural light into the room. The hotel offers free continental breakfast, but it just consists of cereal, toast, small muffins and juice/coffee/milk. Instead, take a 2-block walk to find the Ricomini bakery which is recommended in some travel books.

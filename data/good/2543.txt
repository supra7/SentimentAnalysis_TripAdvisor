I had stayed at this hotel several years ago (when it was the Vance) and knew it was convenient for the Convention Center so I chose it again. Now as the Max it has been thoroughly updated and art-themed but retains an individual character that you don't get in larger 'chain' hotels. The room I had was a little on the small side but perfectly adequate if you're spending most of your time out in the city as I was. The modernisation means that all the equipment is new and works efficiently.

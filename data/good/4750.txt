Room: We were in a lower unit, 1 bed with kitchen. We loved it! Updated unit, right next to a small pool, nice large patio doors with seating outside. Cleanliness: Room very clean. The small pool outside our doors looked slightly murky for half the time we were there, but they did service it daily. We mentioned it to the staff. The other pools were clear. The housekeeper we had was really nice and left us alone as we requested. We just wanted fresh towels and were provided them when we asked, Service: This is hard. At the end of our stay we forgot some medication in a cup in a cabinet...we had already checked out. After practically begging the desk attendent to check for it she called the manager on duty who did go and get the cup and brought it out to us. That was very nice of him, and the contents were VERY important to my partner. When we signed in I wish that the staff would have given us a run-down on different transportation options and the schedule for those, where to go and such. We eventually figured it out since we saw the green trolley go by on several of our walks. If you stay here, get the schedule from the front desk and use this mode. It's free (just tip the driver) and it's really fun. If you miss the pickup time, you may find it better to begin the walk. I somehow misunderstood and thought the ElDorado provided transport to Whalers Village, but apparently they do not. They do however go to the beach below the golf course. My partner was able to get a ride from ElDorado to the Whalers on one occasion, but the next time we asked they dropped us off at the top of the hill which was just silly. If you do walk, it's not THAT bad. Just walk down the hill along the street. Our first attempt to walk was down along the golf course and we ended up walking through other hotels to eventually come out on Kaanapalli Beach. Nice walk, but long. Enjoy your stay here!! We did and now that we "know the ropes" we would definately stay here again.

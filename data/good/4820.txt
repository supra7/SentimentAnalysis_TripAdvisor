Having stayed in Singapore so many times already, it was a case of let's try somewhere different, so we found ourselves at Fragrance Hotel, Imperial. The Hotel is about a 5 minute walk from Lavender MRT. It's in abit of a residential area so there isn't really that much choice of eating close by, but a quick bus journey solved that. Check in was efficient and everything in order with our reservation. The room was quite big, and had a fridge and very powerful shower. The Air con was arctic but fortunately we were able to adjust it to a more suitable level. This particular hotel provides breakfast, it's a very basic affair and after the third day was boring, but welcome never the less. There is a roof top swimming pool, but it was under repair when we were there so we couldn't use it. I would probably stay here again.

I stayed at the hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. The hotel is mere steps away from the Convention Center. Staff is very helpful and it is an extremely busy hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. If you like seafood, make sure you go to Blue Acre, which is about two blocks away. The food was terriific.

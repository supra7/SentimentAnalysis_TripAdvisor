Lovely indoor pool area, looks like a lodge. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, very comfortable and spacious, with minimal noise from outside (you could hear planes, but only if you really listened for them). The breakfast buffet was good value with great coffee (Starbucks), but the omelet chef did not have the slightest clue as to what he was doing. I got more of a scramble than an omelet, and he might have put all of three spinach leaves in the whole thing, which cooked down to nothing. I booked a "cars eat free" package which included parking and a $25 gas card - if they still have this deal it is worth it. Overall a very good experience.

Tulip Pera was a nice surprise.. the room was actually better in real than in the picture, specially for the jacuzzi in the room.. but that is only a start.. If you want to enjoy a full spa threatment after a day in istanbul, the hotel has got everything you need.. sauna, steam bath & turkish bath.. the personnel is very professional and gentle.. service very good and if after that you have no energy to go out anymore, you can taste room service and enjoy your room... marble, wood and velvet are at touch.. nice decoration with light in the staircase.. when i went there i stayed at the top floor and there was actually a water leakage from the roof, but i'm sure is now well repaired. Enjoy istanbul, rest at the tulip pera.. ! P.s. the hotel is not very big, but the service, including the breakfast let you enjoy turkish food..

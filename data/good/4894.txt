The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the subway, and is just off one of the main streets through Rome. Lots of good value restaurants close by. Within walking distance of lots of sights, and only a 20 minute walk to the Colloseum. Hotel was very clean and staff are very friendly and hellpful. We would definately stay here again.

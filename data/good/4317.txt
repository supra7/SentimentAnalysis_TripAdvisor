We thought the resort was absolutely beautiful. The grounds and pools areas are lush and well tended, and the are perfect for both romantic vacations and family vacations. The resort was very well kept up and the staff seemed unbobtrusive yet accomodationg. The rooms were nice, and clean. For the price I'd expect the bathrooms to be a little more luxuious, but again, they were completely clean. On Maui there are many choices but I'd have to say that the Hyatt is one of the best and we weren't dissapointed. We will definately return.

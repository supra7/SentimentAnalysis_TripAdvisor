This hotel was everything we expected. We wanted something low-key and not part of a chain, but with atmosphere and friendly service. The Inn is close to 2 markets and the rooms have kitchenettes, making life easy for those who like to come-and-go as they please and don't always want to eat out. Location is perfect for the Space Needle and surrounding museums, even the walk to Pike's Market was not too far to manage. We did not want to rent a car and did not have to. We even lucked out and got to share a cab both ways to the airport!

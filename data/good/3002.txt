I have stayed in nearly every major chain hotel in the Renton/Tacoma area of Seattle. I have skipped around mostly trying to find a quiet hotel that is clean, has consistent service and a fitness center larger than a shoebox. I stayed at the Airport Hilton a couple of weeks ago for three nights on a business trip. The entry and lobby area look newer and are nice. I was unfortunately sent to the back of the hotel (and I mean the very back) which was a haul every time I went to my room. The back part of the hotel looks older and while it was quiet, I would ask not to be put back there again. Self-park is also a very inconvenient walk so just plan to pay for valet or give yourself 5 minutes to walk to your car. The rooms themselves are clean and comfortable (I always like Hilton's beds) and as I mentioned already, almost blissfully quiet at least in my area of timbuktu. I ordered room service my last day for breakfast and it was very good; overpriced but I expect that. Service overall was good. It wasn't "over-the-top" fussy but they were there if you asked. The fitness room is AWESOME. It is truly a large space with multiple cardio machines and weight machines. I was happy to have space to do free weights without having someone 2 inches from me and available floor to roll out a mat and do core work, etc. I will be headed back again this coming week so I'll update if there is anything new or interesting.

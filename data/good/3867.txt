Our room was very clean, but only average size and amenities also average. What made our room was the breathtaking view of the water provided by our window on the 27th floor facing the water. Well worth the upgrade to have this every morning and evening. The location was also excellent for its proximity to the great restaurants and sights. My husband was attending a conference in the hotel and I had no problem occupying my time with walking to everything I needed!

The room was excellent, the food was wonderful. The bars & pool was well beyond what we expected. Paulo at the pool went way beyond his job to see that we enjoyed our stay. Rosie the Conciege went over and above her job to see that everything was acceptable. I went to the jewlelry store on Sat. 11-28-09 and saw a necklace and pendant I really liked. They needed to get a longer chain and we were GUARANTEED that it would be ready Sunday evening after 5:00. We stopped in before dinner and they assured us it would be ready. After dinner we stopped back we were told it would be there for sure by 9:00, the manager came out to talk to us and said he would call our room at 9:00. We were departing Monday but he assured us again I would have my necklace. WE had to get up early, and at 10:30 the manager of the store called and said it was there. We refused it since we were already sleeping. When we went to Dinner on Sunday night 11-29-09, to the Italian restaurant we were seated promptly. There were 4 of us in our group and we had Roberto as our waiter, he was very friendly at first so we tipped him 40.00 (USD). After that he informed us we were too loud, we asked another couple in the same room if we were bothering them and they said we weren't. We met them on our first day and hung around with them several times. When Roberto returned we asked who said we were too loud and he said someone in the other dining room, the 2 guys went in to see who complained and to Appoligize and no one said the heard anything. We then informed the Head waiter and he talked to Roberto, we fee lif we spend our hard earned money on our vaction we should be able to laugh. Our travel agent was with us and she was not happy about these 2 incidences, we have traveled all over with this couple and have never experienced this ever.

After reading many reviews on TA, booked one double room for one night in July 2008. Wanted to be near the Inner Harbor and within walking distance to sites. This HGI in Harbor East was great. Room was very nice (similar to other HGI's that I've stayed in). Nice beds, nice bedding, flat screen tv, microwave, fridge. Small bathroom but nice. Room 1109 was very quiet, even with all of the Legg Mason construction outside. Breakfast buffet was good. Pantry store in lobby was useful with two kids. Parking is self-park around the block but was easy to get to the hotel lobby with the luggage. Not too bad. $25 was paid when we left the garage. We didn't use the car during our stay. We walked to Fell's Point which was very fun. So many restaurants and bars. Many on the water. Took the water taxi back to Harbor East via Harbor Place and Rusty Scupper stops. HIghly recommend the water taxi. Fun and a wonderful view! Only complaint was that the lowest temp the programmable thermometer could be set to was 65 degrees and there's no exhaust fan in the bathroom. So, after 4 showers, the room was VERY HUMID. Never felt cold.

So!!!! if your looking for a well run conveniently located(accross street from excellent shopping and 10 minute walk to pike market) very safe environment, this is the place..... clean friendly comfort. The only issue we had was the parking(it's a long story). I hate to write such a good review as the price might go up for our next trip there but they earned it. Remember to sort out your parking first.

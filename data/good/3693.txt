For our last night in Rome, we searched to find, a Hotel, that would be suitable for my partner and I, but one that would also be suitable for our family, including three grown-up grand-childrten, who would want to 'Enjoy the night-life' of Rome. We couldn't believe our luck, to find this Hotel, so near the Trevi Fountain, and so walkable to all the delights of Rome. We had booked dinner at La Scalelta, and we walked there and back. The staff were very helpful, and courteous, and met every request willingly. The breakfast was a bit disappointing, and there wasn't a vegetarian option, or gluten free, however, we were towards the end, and perhaps the staff, in dining room, may have been a bit more cheerful and obliging if we'd arrived at the start. The breakfast room decor could do with a bit of a make-over as well. They minded our luggage on the Sunday, and my partner left all his computer cables etc., in our room, and the cleaner gave them to one of my family, who was last to leave. We would definitely return to this little gem, in the very heart of Rome.

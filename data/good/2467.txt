My wife and I stayed at the W for three nights last weekend. This was my first stay at a W. I decided to stay here based on the location and the fact that I was able to get a corner "spectacular" room for about $250/nt. The lobby is dark and full of "younger" guests and visitors. This did not bother us although we being 57 yrs old did not spend alot time there except for using their complimentary wireless internet. Our room had a spectacular view of the harbor and Mt Rainer. We thought it reminded us of a small NYC apartment with a hallway entrance into the main part of the room. They pride themselved on the whenever-wherever system, which means if you want something ask for it. We had to ask for Qtips and shower cap and they arrived quickly with no problem. The bathroom id not luxurious but still nice. The breakfast at the restaurant was very good with tipical hotel prices. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel.

We arrived towards the end of Aug. Check in was a bit of a problem as the people in our room were not leaving on time. We went to lunch and went back a couple of hours later. We were told they still were not leaving and we would have had to wait a couple of hours. This would have put us getting into the room around 4 to 5 pm. We complained and were put into a different room. (They could hold us up, but not go to the people in the room and ask them nicely to leave?). We felt the person who checked us in had quite an attitude. After that everything else was wonderful. We had a terrific time and would definately go back. Even with the glitches, it was very nice. SERVICE: Terrific, FOOD: Terrific - although the lights were not totally on in the Bordeaux Rest so we had to read the menu by flashlight, ROOMS: Very nice. But the Jacuzzi tub had light brown to yellow water and the shower water was not hot at all. Just lukewarm BEACH: One of the nicest, but not enough palapas. All pool and beach chairs with shade are claimed by 9 am. ENTERTAINMENT: Very good. So if you go into it with an open mind, it is a wonderful place to stay for a relaxing vacation. It has a Zen quality to it. Music out of the speakers is very soothing.

Very nice hotel. The area isn't special, but the hotel is located near three different U-bahn or S-bahnstations, which makes it a good starting point for exploring the city. It is quite modern, without frills; has really modern, spacious and clean rooms and a fantastic breakfast buffet. Staff is efficient and friendly. In short: great for a short and comfortable trip.

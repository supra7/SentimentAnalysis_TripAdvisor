The hotel is really new, it has a very modern design, is very clean, the breakfast is fantastic, they serve a very good capucino, great service from the staff and the reception is very helpfull. The location is ok, not really something to see around there but its about 200m (3min. walk) to the metro station and the center of rome its only 2 or 3 stops away. You also have a free wired internet connection in your room and a lcd tv. The aircondition was working good to. The only negative thing is that the room is a bit small but it wasnt so important for me since the bathroom was spacious. A great stay in Rome!

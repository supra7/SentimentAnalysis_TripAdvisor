My husband and I visited Secrets for six nights in December. The first night we met a couple at dinner who commented that they were going to leave the next evening after staying for the week. Everything they said about their stay was very positive, except they mentioned there was a lot of plastic floating in the ocean. My husband and I spent the first couple of days at the beach, and while we really enjoyed the beautiful sand, the great hospitality, and the blue water, we did see various plastic items floating in the water while we were swimming. Secrets did do a good job of keeping their beachfront clean, but a few days later, we headed south down the beach for a romantic walk and, frankly, I wish we hadn't. Once we left the Secrets beachfront, there was a steady trail of plastic litter all along the beach. Not just a few plastic things, but hundreds of plastic items that had washed up. You name it, and it was probably there: flip flops, plastic bottles, plastic toys, etc., etc., While I understand Secrets can't control what's floating in the ocean and washing up on the beach, I found it really disturbing, disgusting and hard to get out of my mind. Other than that, everything others have written is true: the staff, the food, the rooms, the pools and overall setting are all top notch. It was just sad to see all the plastic on the beach outside the immediate area and know that it was all washing up from the ocean.

Just got back today (Nov 28th). We stayed for a week and we loved the Hyatt. I was also concerned about the construction and it was not a big deal now. The hotel is older and needs some work but it still is very very nice. If MINOR paint chip and wall scuffs will bother you, then go somewhere else. Our room wasn't an upgrade but it was big enough for 2 adults and 2 children (Needs more dresser drawers). The pool was fantastic and we had no problems finding a chair, but they do go fast. The parking was a bit tight and the cars are wedged into the spaces. The restaurants were good, but if you have a problem with small birds flying all around you, don't eat at the breakfast buffet. Also, If you like varity and unless it is included with your room package it probably isn't worth the money. Mostly the same food is served every day, with just a few changes. The concerige desk was very helpful with arranging all the activites we wanted. And everyone was very friendly. We would go back again.

We returned from three weeks in our 50th state, and one of our most enjoyable portion was the stay at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. We were greeted warmly upon our arrival from Oahu, upgraded our room to a first-floor ocean view which really made our stay more enjoyable, and then we relaxed. The staff was friendly, the service good. Prices are higher throughout the Hawaiian Islands than on the mainland, but KBH was not out of line. Being on the beach, we took advantage of the beach walk that runs along the shoreline between the hotels, condos, and Whaler's Village. Extending almost 1 mile, we were able to leave our car parked and walk to most dinners, most shopping, and just for exercise. When we checked out, the staff give you a "going away" present of Kukui leis - and offer to add another nut when you come back to see them again. We would definitely do so.

The best location possible, in my opinion. Right on the marketplace. a short walk to the waterfront and the ferry terminal. Restaurants are close by and the bus system downtown is free! You just can't beat the location. The staff was attentive and professional and he room was spotless with a bed that was fantastic. I would recommend the Inn to any one traveling to Seattle for the first time.

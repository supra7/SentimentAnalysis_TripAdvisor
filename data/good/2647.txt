Stayed at Max for four nights feb-mar 06. It's a nice little hotel with an excellent location near downtown Seattle and the congress center. Overall the look & feel of the place is really nice, if you like hip/modern/artsy. Since it has been renovated quite recently everything is new and clean and rooms have nice flat screen TV's etc. The air conditioning / heater was really loud, not something I'm used to. Had to keep it off while I was in the room, which resulted in a freezing coldness. Luckily the bed was super comfy with very warm covers, so I slept very well. :) Stayed for the 1st night on 2nd floor, that was a bit noisy, then I was offered a room higher up 8th floor, which was exactly the same room, except no street noise and a nice view of the seattle space needle! Some of the staff did not seem overly professional, but some of them were very nice. I ate three times at the Red Fin restaurant that is located downstairs, maybe I made bad choices but it wasn't anything special. Seemed quite busy during evenings, nevertheless. Took some long morning walks to Capitol Hill and found some really good funky breakfast places. :) Rooms are small, I would not stay here with a big family, but alone it was allright, maybe with a bf/gf also. There is WLAN that you can buy but I found plenty of free open WLAN coverage in the room that worked just as well. So save your money. For the price (115USD+tax per night) it was very very good. It's not super luxurious but it has a nice vibe and really worked for me!

If you are not too fussed about staying in 5 star and on the beach, then these apartments are great. On my visit it was paid for so couldn't complain too much. The apartments are very spacious and have comfortable bed, kitchen bathroom with separate toilet aswell. Flatscreen tvs in lounge and bedroom. The gym is adequate and the pool was nice and warm. The indian restaurante is fantastic with good authentic indian food (made by indian chefs) Overall a nice accommodation.

When we first got to the hotel for our eight day vacation, we weren't sure what to expect. The hotel is somewhat dated and the lobby is small and uninviting. The ladies at check were very helpful and friendly. Our room was suppose to be ocean front with a king bed. But when we got there it had twin beds and after calling the front desk, they were fully? booked and we couldn't move for two days and the only room was on the smoking floor. Once the room was corrected, the balance of the week was wonderful. Even though the hotel is a bit dated, the grounds and surrounding areas were kept very clean. The staff were extremely helpful. One thing that bothers me is they charge for everything, parking, internet, local calls, beach chairs and umbrellas. In comparison to the other hotels in the area, this is by far the best in value for your dollar and by far the best beach. This is Hawaii so expect to pay top dollar for everything. We ate at Hulas Bar and Grill and at Leonai's which are owned by the same people. It was interesting that the Mai Tais at Hulas Grill were $1.50 more than at Leonai's but serve in the same mug. All in all we would recommend this hotel.

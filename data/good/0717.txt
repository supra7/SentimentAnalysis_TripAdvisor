I almost hate to give this one away because I want to save this spot for my friends, family and even myself! The Moore Hotel in downtown Seattle is a GREAT DEAL! It is a few blocks from the Pike Place market, all the hip clubs and restaurants in Belltown, and also within walking distance of the Seattle Art Museum, Symphony Hall, etc. Granted, the place isn't fancy, but it doesn't need to be. The bed was comfortable, the room was good sized, and our room was quiet and clean. What more do you need? Remember to ask about the reduced parking deal for a secure garage nearby.

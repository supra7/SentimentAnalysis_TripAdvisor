Great hotel in Belltown! Staff went out of their way to be helpful, rooms clean and adequate size. Pool and hot tub were clean and water was heated in pool. The shuttle to cruise dock for $6 pp was a great benefit. Would stay here again and plan to book next year for another cruise. BTW, great complimentary breakfast with "make your own Brlgian waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries,etc. Food was fresh and presented well.

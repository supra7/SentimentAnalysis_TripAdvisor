Great place to stay that makes guest feel comfortable for a low cost. I went down with friends and we each stayed at different hotels along Kaanapali to compare. Our room was the smallest of all the hotels spaces, but we were the only couple with out any complaints and that paid the least!! We felt at home and did not want to leave! We will be back in Maui again and plan on being welcomed back at the KBH! Mahalo!

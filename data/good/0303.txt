We stayed at the Inn at the Market in Seattle during the second week of August and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel's location (literally) next to Pike Place Market is ideal! You can walk around the market to explore yet still walk around the city quite easily. The hotel is a bit on the expensive side, but really has a lot of qualities that make it very desirable. The rooftop terrace is awesome! The rooms sometimes have a weird arrangement (i.e. TV was at the side of the bed, so you had to lay on the bed sideways to watch). But overall the rooms were very nice with comfortable bedding, updated furniture, complimentary in-room internet access. The guest service was also excellent. Our check-in/check-out was pleasant and quick. The bell staff, valet parking staff, and housekeeping were always very helpful, timely, and accomodating. They also have a complimentary car service that can drop off/pick up for intown locations. Overall, we had a great stay and would certainly stay at this property again while visiting Seattle.

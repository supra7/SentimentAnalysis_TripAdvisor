We stayed for a couple of nights. Hotel had lots of character and charm. Nice location away from downtown, but close enough to walk to Seattle Center and monorail. Front desk and Doorman are very nice and helpful. Accommodations a little dated, but the price is reasonable and it gives the hotel it's charm. Drawbacks - no elevator. Definitely, would consider this hotel again.

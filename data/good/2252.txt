We stayed here for 3 nights end of July first of August. This is a lovely hotel. We did have problems with the water pressure in our room for the first two mornings. It was literally a small cool stream. On the second morning they worked on it while we were out and fixed it. The hotel accommodated us by comping one of our nights. Nicely done. Good points: our room was lovely and the bed was heavenly! The wine hour and lobby beverages are nice touches. Areas of improvement: the fitness room was a little small, and warm. It could really use a fan! And the staff should wait their turn to ride the elevators and not barge in on the guests.

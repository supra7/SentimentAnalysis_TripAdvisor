We stayed here for four day over the Christmas holiday last year. It was a great experience for us. I don't understand why people complain about the $450 price tag when there are rooms for $250 that are great. Loved the staff...very helpful. It is a beautiful hotel, the lobby is amazing! It's a great place to snuggle up by the fire and drink the complementary apple cider or play one of the many board games they offer. Check out our pictures...

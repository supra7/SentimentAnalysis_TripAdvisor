Stayed at the hotel during the CA Democratic Convention (2/10/12 - 2/12/12) and the hotel was pretty much sold out that weekend, with delegates, electeds, staff, and others. The view from the high floor, bayview room is excellent. The service and rooms are what you would expect of a hilton property. Nothing stands out in particular except that its nice Hilton now has the new Peter Thomas Roth amenities in the bathroom, which is a lot better than the previous line of no name products. The restaurants, as others have mentioned are a little overpriced. The Fox Sports Bar which is on the lower level, is pretty decent and packed but closes earlier than expected on the weekends. The lobby bar has last call at 1am, even if its packed, which is surprising. Overall, your best bet is to explore restaurants in other parts of downtown San Diego, and if its outside the gaslamp quarter, you can always share a cab. The hotel website and some tripadvisor reviews are misleading. The hotel is close to the gaslamp quarter but be aware it is a hike, especially if you're short on time. You need to calculate at least 15min each way unless you plan on jogging across the bridge and over to the heart of the gaslamp quarter. Some folks I know would just cab it over (approx $5), especially if time is a factor and/or if you have challenges walking distances. The hotel is a brisk 10 min walk to the convention center and there were shuttles to/from the hotel, during the convention, which ran infrquently, since this tends to be one of the closest hotels. Overall, it's a nice hotel, good customer service and a convenient location. It's also a quick 10min. cab ride from the downtown Amtrak station, which is a nice alternative if you don't want to drive from the LA area. I would definitely stay here again.

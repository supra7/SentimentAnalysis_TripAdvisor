I visted US on a business trip and stayed in this inn for 20 days.It is a very nice place and the staff were very helpful and friendly.The room service is good.The best part is,it is very close to the shopping area and market place and you can go by walk.Food is good but they can add more varieties as people from different places visit there.It is safe and nice.Best for the price one pays.Next time i visit I will stay here again.

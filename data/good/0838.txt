So I stayed here alone for two nights. Staff was extremely friendly - great with recommendations. They allowed me to check in to my room several hours earlier than check in. The hotel is your typical downtown hotel in a historic building. In other words, pretty small (I had the basic queen room) but it should be enough for two people. Very clean, comfortable bedding. Location: although I thought Downtown Seattle had a surprisingly big city feel to it (it is very built up, great urban planning, great density in buildings) in reality, it isn't that big. That being said, all it means is that this hotel is very central and very walkable to all of the main attractions. One other thing, as mentioned by someone prior to me, the 5-6pm wine hour is really great. Free booze and you get to meet other people! And to the staff member who was planning to move to San Diego, I almost made it all the way to the airport on foot. Well not almost, I walked about 4 miles but the the area started to get a little shifty looking.

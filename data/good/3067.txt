We had an overnight layover and selected this site based on other travelers' comments. It's not the Ritz but it is quite pleasant and the service is excellent. The complex is spacious, nice for getting some breathing room after a long flight. The dining room is expensive but the food was of excellent quality and preparation. There is a well-equipped and decent sized workout room and if the weather is cooperative a large, landscaped outdoor pool. The airport shuttle is on demand and only takes a few minutes between points.

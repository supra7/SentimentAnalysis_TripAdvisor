I am always never disappointed with Sheratons, and liked this one also. The price is good, the rooms are large. For a little extra we got the "club room" feature which gives you free internet and breakfast (and happy hour too I think). We did hear a baby crying and my sisters in another room had an enthusiastic couple in the next room (ahem - not us!). But overall we had a great room, easy check in and out, nice towels and bedding, and friendly service.

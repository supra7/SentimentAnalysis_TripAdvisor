I stayed here two nights and you can't really complain. It's a solid four star stay. The rooms are spacious and kept well, the bathroom in particular was massive compared to what I'm used to. The sheets on the best were a bit starchy but very clean and fresh. The facilites were nice and the staff were all very friendly. The thing this hotel has is location, it has superb access to downtown and shops. I usually stay at the W across the road but this hotel was way better for way less. Definitely recommended.

We were a family of 4 traveling and planning many island activities while on Maui, and we needed 2 rooms for our stay. Decided on this hotel based on a friend's stay a couple of years ago. We basically showered and slept here and relaxed on the beach a couple of afternoons during our 6-night stay, so the proximity to the beach and pool from our ocean-view room was great. The pool was a bit small. The rooms and baths are a bit small for more than 2 people in a room so we were glad we had the 2 adjoining rooms. The rooms and bath were clean and linens were fresh. There was a slight 'beach musty' smell when we first walked in, but I didn't notice it after the first day. It was nice to open the patio door and sit on the lanai (small) early in the morning with coffee. A condo might have been a better option, but we had a good AAA rate which included breakfast, and there was a refrigerator in the room for chilling drinks and snacks. The location is also good as we could take the short walk to Whaler's Village for shopping or eating out. We mostly were on other parts of the island for lunch or dinner and only ate the buffet a few mornings. It was OK but became tiresome after a couple of days. Fruit was always good, and we don't feel we have to eat everything offered on the buffet just because it's there. My grand-daughter ordered a waffle and they happily made one for her. We could also order eggs cooked to order for a small extra charge. Like most everything else in Hawaii, things are expensive (self-parking, internet, etc) so you just have to be prepared for that. We are an active bunch and enjoyed snuba diving, the Haleakala sunrise and biking down the mountain, and zip lines among other things. I could skip the Hana drive again but it is scenic.

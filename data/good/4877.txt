We really enjoyed our stay here! Nice rooms, clean, good sized. Friendly and courteous staff. Free internet . Nice breakfast. Quiet street, short walk to Termini Station. Close to shopping and very well situated to see the sights of the historic centre.We highly recommend this hotel, if we are ever in Rome again we would stay here again.

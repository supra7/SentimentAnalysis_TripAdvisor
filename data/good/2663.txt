Great location for a shopping day and girls night out, everything is within walking distance and easy to get to. Check in was easy, the gentleman at the front desk was not cold but not overly friendly. The room was on the smaller side but clean. Large flat screen TV and toiletries were nice. The only problem we encountered was my fault but not handled in the right manor. I left an item in the room and called shortly after we checked out, and was told that it was not found. I know exactly where I left it and even drove back to the hotel to ask again, nothing turned up. All in all a nice stay, although I would look for an online deal otherwise I feel the price is a bit steep.

My family stayed at the Hyatt Regency from 12/26-12/31/2011. 2nd visit to this same hotel years ago. The grounds are beautiful along with most of the property being well maintained. All of that still looked the same, if not nicer since our last visit to the Hyatt. The only one other thing that remained the same which was not a nice surprise was that the rooms were still very old, popcorn ceilings in the rooms, i and it looked like nothing had been upgraded in many, many years. The rooms are very outdated and the room we were in needed a lot of patch work here and there and just some new up to date bedspreads, beds, pull-out couches, etc. We had to have a roll-away brought up to us because the mattress on the pull-out couch was so old it could not be used. The bathrooms need to be renovated also. The carpets need to be replaced in the room we were in. The help at the front desk was great. If you did not get down to the pool by no later than 8 a.m., you would not be able to get a chair to sit on unless you wandered around and waited for other to leave so you could have their chair.

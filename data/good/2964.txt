We stayed here on our way home from Alaska so that we could easily get to the airport the next morning. It's less than 5 minutes away from Sea-Tac and transportation to and from is quick and easy. We were also surprised to find that you can catch an express shuttle from the hotel to downtown, which makes it very convenient to do some quick site-seeing. Upon returning from seeing a few sites, the lobby, restaurant, and pool were bustling with activity! The pool is very large and in a beautiful atrium area. The bar and restaurant also looked nice, although we didn't eat there. We did, however, get room service and the menu was pretty extensive. Not to mention the food was good and the service was quick. The rooms are very comfortable, particularly the beds. We didn't encounter any problems at all.

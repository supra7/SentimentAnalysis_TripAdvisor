Had been in Seattle for five nights and was flying out at 6am the following morning so opted for the Hampton Inn, partly thanks to frequent stays and benefits at Hilton properties. Cost was a reasonable $103 for the night. Arrived around 4pm and had a nice welcome pack of Oreos, bottles of water and note waiting for me which was decent. At check-in was given password for complimentary internet. Went to dinner with friends at a nearby place. Came back around 10pm and did some ironing before settling into bed. The room itself was a pretty decent size and bed was comfortable. Woke up around 4.15am and took a shower, the toiletries were standard HI affairs and not too bad. Shower was decent and even at 4.45am the breakfast buffet was out in the lobby. I was being fed on my flight so passed on it. The shuttle arrived after about 10mins and didn't wait around for others. Overall not a bad stay, not outstanding...needed more than 6hrs to scope the place out though.

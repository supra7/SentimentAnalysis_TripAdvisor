From check-in to check-out, our experience over three nights was most pleasant and positive despite the hotel being super busy. We could not have been assigned a more panoramic upper floor room to introduce us to Seattle by the highly professional but warmly personable staff. The room itself was spotlessly clean, the beds very comfortable, the robes a delight (as were the linens and towels), and the bathroom amenties (always a gauge of a hotel's real devotion to hospitality) brought a welcome smile. There was also a novel first for us: the presence of a clip on one curtain to ensure a seamless joining. Well done, Crowne Plaza! What further impressed us was being granted a late check-out despite the property being fully booked, our room being actually readied one day in the two hour window we had requested for that day, the restaurant having fine food with engaged servers, the Club Lounge continental breakfast fare was solid but unpretentious, and both of us (marvel of marvels!) were greeted by name after just a few hours on the property. Well done, Crowne Plaza!! The property is well maintained and one gets a feeling of security by the number of staff at all hours of the day and evening. By the way, it is a lovely walk from the hotel to Pike Place Market, central shopping, the nearest Seattle-ubiquitous Starbucks is two blocks, and the delightful water-infused Freeway Park is just across the street. Would we stay there again? You bet. As a matter of fact, our upcoming Alaska cruise will originate now out of Seattle rather than as previously planned out of San Francisco. Thanks, Crowne Plaza!!

We found Boutique Hotel Trevi a comfortable and luxurious hotel, very centrally located on the doorstep of the Trevi fountain. Having read the reviews we were nervous our reservation would be there and to be sure we did reconfirm several days before. When we arrived there was no problem and we were shown immediately to our rooms. The rooms are beautifully furnished in that old world elegance of silk and dark wood. Our room was small by North American standards but big enough for a queen sized bed and a full bath. My girlfriends was much smaller as she had a single. There was a small elevator but as I am claustrophobic I was relieved to see the hotel had central open stairs up to our room. The breakfast room is in the basement and the buffet is quite substantial. What made our visit was the staff. They were all so friendly and accommodating. The front desk gave us advice on restaurants, shopping and generally how to get around Rome and the serving staff at breakfast were very attentive. While there are crowds outside the hotel door( and I mean crowds, the Trevi Fountain is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Rome) the hotel is very quiet inside and we had no problem sleeping. Considering it is a four star hotel we were surprised to find that the hotel does not have wireless net service but does have plug in for your laptop or you can use a very cumbersome tv internet system for which they charge you a daily fee. As we were using i-phones we were disappointed. This was our first visit to Rome and as hotels go this was a good experience.

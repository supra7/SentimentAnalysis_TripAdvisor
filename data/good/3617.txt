Stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach September 12, 2008 through September 17, 2008. Had a first floor suite with a lanai leading to a semi-private pool. Room accomodations were nearly flawless with the exception of a couple late appearences by housekeeping to make the bed. Flat panel television. Plenty of closet/drawer space. Double sinks. Large shower and jacuzzi tub for two. The refrigerator was always stocked with soda, beer and snacks (No additional cost!). Would rate the room 9 out of 10. Beach area was beautiful with a bar and waiter service to your lounge chair. Daily Lunch BBQ on the beach also. Pool area was fabulous with a swim up bar. Usually plenty of lounge chairs available even if you arrived late. Service was average to above average in the restaurants but the food was very good. We were a party of 9 and our dinner took, on average, 2-1/2 hours from start to finish. The Japenese restaurant was still not open which was dissappointing. The resestaurant by the pool, Seaside Grill, was our favorite. Overall, we were quite pleased with the resort, given what we paid. In approximately 6-12 months, the resort will be perfect. It still has minor issues to work out. The foliage is new, therefore, the facility lacks the tropical feel that plants bring. Also, it is quiet at night...not much night life. But if you are looking to spend some time in a spa-like facility, you will enjoy this resort. We would like to revisit it in a few years to see its progress.

The hotel was a great positive surprise, as reading other reviews I didn't know what to expect. It was in the most amazing location, and the red entrance was fancy and promising :) The hotel staff was very helpful and gave great tips on how to get around and even what areas to avoid at night! The room was nice, although some of the designer's decisions might be quastionable. However, the bed was amazing, probably one of the best hotel beds i have ever experienced! The shower had a slightly weird smell, but that did not keep us from spending way too ling time in it due to an amazing experience - the shower was truly great! The location of the hotel was amazing, definately something to recommend to people who want to be at the most trendy spot in Barcelona. Great names like Chanel, Luis Vuitton and Armani were just next to the amazing buildings of Gaudi. A must-see even for those who have little inerest in architecture. And for those that like sightseeing by the bus - the City Sightseeing bus stops right outside the hotel. All in all, a great hotel experience.

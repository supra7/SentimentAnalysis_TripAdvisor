Beautiful beach!! The best I've seen in Mexico. A little disappointed with the "partial ocean view room" because we had NO ocean view at all, and the front office was unwilling to help us change rooms because they were at 100% occupancy. So - we paid for a POV room, but didn't get it. Otherwise, great trip. All the service staff were friendly. Spa was great - really relaxing massage. Also, beware of the time share 'sell' - they tell you a 90-minute talk/tour will get you $200 spa credit. But our talk/tour ended up being closer to 3 hours. Disappointing.

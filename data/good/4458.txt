There are no water slides for the kiddies, but it is situated on the beach next to the Whaler which is much pricier and just south of the Sheraton at black rock (great snorkeling area). Staff was very helpful, especially since this happened during the predicted tsunami. The grounds are spacious, our room with a partial ocean view had a great balcony overlooking the ocean and a large open space for lounging, strolling on the paths, or swimming in their pools, eating at the economical and casual Tikki or drinking at their outdoor bar. They also have a restaurant on site. They offer informative discussions on Hawaiin culture, crafts including lei making to guests along with other activities daily. If you want the bells and whistles of a 4 or 5 star, this probably isn't it, but if you want comfort and the beauty of Maui that won't break the bank, this is your place. And a word about service. We forgot a bag in the garage. They found it, contacted us and had it taxied to us just before our flight left. That was incredible.

We stayed for 2 nights after getting a bargain price through Priceline. We checked in pretty early but the reception staff were very helpful. The room was very spacious but we were in one which could have done with a bit of modernising - was perfectly clean and comfortable though! Limited free internet in the lobby, very popular with tour groups and conveniently on the Airporter bus route. Best thing of all about this hotel is the location - 4mins walk from Pike Place, and right in the heart of the shopping area! Fantastic!

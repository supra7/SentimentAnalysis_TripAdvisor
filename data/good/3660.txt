This Hilton Hotel shares the same entrance and reception desk with Homestead Suites. I had a King Evolution Room with a king-sized bed on the 9th floor and a great eastern view of a huge garden area on the 8th floor (nice trick, eh?). Apparently the roof of the building below was converted into a nice walking/sitting area with grass and stone walkways, etc. The flat-screen TV in the room was great with the HD channels available for NADA (free is always good) and the bathroom was large and modern with a roomy glass-door shower. Im not a fan of the TempurPedic mattress or similar style. Give me a nice over-stuffed coil-spring mattress. There also was a mini-fridge, a microwave and a coffee maker. The hotel has a bar/grill called the Great American Grill and a business room that has 3 free PCs and printers with internet access and a copier and fax machine. This hotel is east of the inner harbor area (Piers 3,4,5 & 6) on the other side of these little walking bridges connected to the various Piers that allow you to cross over by the tip of the pier without going to the top of the pier (E. Pratt St.) and back down. Pier 5 has a hotel and a McCormick & Schmicks along with a small lighthouse. Pier 4 has a Hard Rock, Dicks Last Resort, Houllihans and more restaurants. The next bridge will take you to the Baltimore Aquarium and Harborplace. The free Charm City Circulator orange-line bus stops at the rotary by the Hilton Hotels and goes right by the Inner harbor area before crossing over the Light-Rail transit line tracks that can take you to and from the BWI Airport for $1.60 each way.

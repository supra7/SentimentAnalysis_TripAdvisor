Very nice stay here for business. Highlight was restaurant recommendation for Brooklyn four blocks away. Oyster and wine flights...best calamari ever...amazing. Hotel has nice accommodations and amenities - especially for women business travelers. Liked the decor and the friendly service. Felt like a boutique hotel experience. Will stay here again.

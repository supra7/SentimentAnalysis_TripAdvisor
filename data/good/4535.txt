This hotel isn't the most posh and plush on the beach, but it is the best! The staff works very hard to make each guest's stay comfortable and memorable. The place needs some updating, but you can't beat the service and the location. It is within walking distance of Whaler's Village for shopping and restaurants and the Maui Bus Stop. We stayed in an oceanfront room. The view was gorgeous and the sunsets spectacular. You can save a little money and book an ocean view. The paved walkway along the beach is ideal for an early morning or evening stroll.

The KBH is a smaller property, but very comfortable. Our room overlooked the garden and the ocean. You can hear the evening music from your lanai and hear the ocean waves along with a gentle breeze. Cookies on your pillow is also a nice touch. The rooms are clean and generally have all you need including a little fridge and sofa. Breakfast at the Tiki Restaurant is a little better than the Mixed Plate. At the Tiki Restaurant you can have eggs and pancakes prepared just the way you like them along with a full buffet. The food choices at the Mixed Plate are about the same, but it's an indoor restaurant while the Tiki has its tables outside overlooking a nice garden area of the hotel. If you have a tourist activity the hotel will prepare a box lunch, which is gteat for hiking or downhill biking. Can't comment on dinner as we were out doing things and generally didn't get back until later. The hotel is only a short walk from the shops at Whaler Village and is nice in the morning since you are right on the beach. The pool is nice and great for an evening swim. The hotel has a small outdoor bar that is always busy. Our drinks were fine. The staff is really helpful with anything you need as far as activities and questions. Check-in is never long no matter what hour your long flight gets in. Be sure to participate in the lei ceremony before you head home. You get a Kukui nut Lei and the story about it with nice music. Makes you want to come back soon. The only bad thing is I don't like to pay for parking at any hotel, It's $9 a day and a bit more for valet parking. I guess for Hawaii, that's not too bad. I don't know if the other hotels do the same, but I would guess they do. This is our 6th return trip to this hotel and next year we will be staying here again. When you find a place you like, why change.

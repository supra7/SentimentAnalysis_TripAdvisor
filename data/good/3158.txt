Lindemanns is clean, modern, well-decorated, comfortable, and offers great service. The only drawback is the location; its easy to get to the center and all the sights by metro, but its a bit of a walk if you want to go on foot. Still, the neighborhood is fine (residential) and a couple of metro tickets is a very small price to pay in exchange for the value and quality of the hotel.

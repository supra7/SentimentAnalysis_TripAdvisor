We are big walkers so this hotel was a great option for us. Walking distance to shops, restaurants, Pine Street Market, Pioneer Square, and Seattle Ferry Term. We even walked to Seattle Center & the International District (during daytime hours). Our room was clean and very comfortable; well appointed - 2 queens beds, 31 inch flat screen TV, desk, chair with ottoman, side table, fridge, etc. Beds were great and the view from our bedroom was really beautiful. A big bonus was to have Aveda shampoo and body products, too. We are Plat. members so had free internet, etc. We had access to club lounge for breakfast, afternoon apps/drinks and a nice evening dessert bar. The club offers a very friendly and efficient concierge who was a perfect resource for everything from tours, restaurants and transportation tips. We would stay here again!

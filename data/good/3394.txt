Overall a very impressive resort. On the plus side: very beautiful, well mantained. Food probably the best I have had on any resort or cruise. The beach is amazing. Lots of activities. The music around the pool does not carry to the rooms so that's it extremely quiet and relaxing. Quite a few restaurants and you do not need reservations for any of them. A few of the downsides: Service occassionally below par. One day housekeeping forgot to come clean the room. Several times, personnel disregarded the do not disturb light and still knocked and tried to enter. For a five star resort that's surprising. There's an in the room jacuzzi type bath. Once filled with water, I realized the water was fairly yellowish. Something of a turn off. When the grounds get watered by the automatic sprinklers there's a pretty bad smell. May be they are using rain water or recycyling used water which is a good thing but the smell was significant. FInally, a few days before departure, I woke up feeling itchy. There were a number of clustered bites on my skin (in an area not accessible to mosquitoes). Prior to that I had a bite mark on the leg which I ascribed to mosquitoes. My concern is of course for bed bugs and the fear of bringing them home. I don't know if that's what they were but on the flight home I happened to read the article in Time magazine about bed bugs and the feature of clustering. It did have a significant impact on the vacation.

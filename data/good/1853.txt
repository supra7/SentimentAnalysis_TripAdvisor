I've been here for a two nights business meeting and I liked this hotel. Not a new one but its round shape is particular and kind of a sign of Seattle downtown. My room was not a sea view one and I guess the upper floor ones do have really scenic view of the bay or the lake. The business service is excellent and working here is fine, there's everything you need and is walking distance from the main shops downtown too. Not a fancy hotel but a good relaxed business one though

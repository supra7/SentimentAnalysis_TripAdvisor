This hotel is a bit run down, but it's clean and very conveniently located. Free WiFi Internet! Relatively inexpensive. Unusually efficient desk made check-in and check-out a breeze. Two problems: 1. The two elevators are slow so wait times can be significant. 2. Official check-in time is 4:00 PM, so that a room was not available for a check-in at noon.

We stayed one night prior to our Alaskan cruise. We got a pre cruise special of $114 for 4 adults so the price was right. The room was pretty basic - 2 beds with a bathroom. The view out the back wasn't so great, but the view from the hallway was the Space Needle. It was an easy walk to the needle and a quick trip on the monorail to the Pike Street Market. They had internet access so we could check email and the breakfast in the morning has a very nice big selection. Get there early, as later in the morning we noticed the room was packed. There's a Walgreen's just down the street for anything you've forgotten. We'd definitely stay here again as it's close and convenient to everything downtwon.

We spent two nights at Le Crystal. It was ideally located 1 block from the Bell Center. We had a one bedroom suite. Lovely. Clean. Beautiful bathroom. There is a little kitchenette. Strange not to have a toaster or regular coffee maker. Awesome expresso maker. Staff was outstanding. I lost my cellphone and two people got on the phone, called the places I had been and left messages of where to call if it was found. It was! All of the staff was so pleasant, concierge front desk, maintenance and housekeeping. Would definitely stay there again.

Service was excellent throughout the resort - bars, beach, restaurants, concierge. Beach is best I've been to on the East side of Mexico. Spa was amazing - a must try while you are there. Food was good, top-self liquors and the tequilla tasting class was great - learned a lot! Lots of activities and entertainment. Catered mainly to honeymooners while we were there. Would not recommend for singles - at least in the month of June.

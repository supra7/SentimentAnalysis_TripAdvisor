The hotel is a boutique hotel small but charming. The decor is very nice - the doors have different art which makes it look like a hall of paintings versus hall of plain hotel room doors. I must say that the room was VERY small. I had a King bed room and to my surprise there was no dresser in the room to put my clothes. There are only two very tiny drawers by the mini bar. The bathroom has a stand up shower and is super small, if you have a belly then you will feel uncomfy. I had to try super hard for my face not to touch the wall when I was reaching around to wash my back. It was a nice location if you like to shop there are two malls a couple of block away. There is an outdoor monorail that for 2.50 takes you to the space needle and EMP museum - the ride is only about 6 minutes. Seattle is small and you can walk to pretty much everything or take a can for a couple of bucks. Most of the time you need to call for a cab so make sure you get a number from the front desk.

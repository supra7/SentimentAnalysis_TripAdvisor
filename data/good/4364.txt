Im somewhat neutral at this point. Yes I definately agree that they nickel and dime you to death. It seems there was an extra fee for EVERYTHING. $15 a day mandadory resort fee. $10 valet parking fee because you cant find parking in the self area. And yes the beach did suck. It has rocks and stones and the tide is always in. When the tide is out, the beach area is barely 10-20 feet. On the plus side, the pools are great, especially the baby one with the slide. my 4.5 year old loved that. The location is good too as you are near to other hotels and other restaurants. We ate at Spats and I guess because we had a child with us, we were lumped in what I would call a child zone with children screaming and crying and generally acting out. We only saw the waiter once and the dinner came to $160. Very disappointing. We booked the sunset cruise and it turned out it was a miscalculation on their part and the boat was actually booked for a wedding. So in fairness they did refund our money and comped us the trip for another day but our entire day had been structured around this trip and had been ruined. Our deluxe view did indeed have a view of the ocean, however it also overlooked the pool. We were in the Atrium Tower It was a little noisy at times. We had no sunset view. Only the Napili Tower had a sunset view. Overall we had a great trip to Maui. I was a little disappointed with the hotel but all in all we had a good time.

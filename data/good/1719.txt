We were very impressed staying at the Edgewater! I had some reservations after reading mixed reviews, but overall we were quite satisfied! We booked the 2 nights through the Expedia Unpublished Rate deal so it was quite affordably priced. We opted to park in the public parkade across the street (entrance on the corner of Alaskan Way and Wall Street). It was $42 total for 2 nights versus the hotel's $34 a night valet (plus tips), although it does not have in and out privileges like valet does. The washroom was definitely the highlight of the room! Quite modern looking and luxurious. The shower was quite spacious because of the open alcove making it great for 2 people! Towels, shampoo, conditioner were very nice! We were on the cityside close to the lobby entrance. Most likely you will keep your windows closed on this side - there are frequent trains through the night that can be quite loud as well as people picking up cars from valet or entering/leaving the lobby talking loudly. However, with your window closed the room is well insulated and we slept fine. The most disappointing feature of the room was the small television as the hotel website pictures show large flat-screens rather than the dated ones hiding in the top shelf of the wardrobe. Hopefully these will be updated as they are not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel room. One other point of critique is that the towels weren't laundered daily. I thought that would be a given at a 4 star hotel.

My wife and I where on our way to Canada for the winter Olympics and decided to rest in Seattle because we where driving all night from California. There was a lot of traffic getting to the hotel because of it's close location to the University. Initially I was a little worried because Travelodge hotels are usually run down or worst...filled w/ prostitutes and drugs as of my experience in a Travelodge in Tennessee. But the reviews led me to try again. As we arrived, the location is situated across the street from a huge mall and in a well kept neighborhood. The building had a more modern architectual look to it and very nice colors. The clerk name Zaira was very helpful....service compared to a more luxury hotel. She helped us w/ all types of tourist questions and was not even annoyed...which can happen a lot. As we proceeded to our room, there is a security door for guest only, which is very safe. The room it self had great space and very clean, looked recently remodeled. Everything was functional and in order. The only problems I had was that the walls are very thin, the bed was a little out of shape and it took 10 mins for the hot water to come out...ironically being that they want you to reuse towels to save water? Also the Manager SHIRLEY was very nice to us as we asked her questions during the evening. The breakfast was juice, oatmeal, muffins, two types of cereal (both nasty), and fruit. Luckily all food products were individually wrapped or sealed because the clerk had a vicious cold (coughing, and spitting mucous) when I was IFO the door. I would highly recommend this place.

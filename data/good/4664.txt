Our trip to this hotel was great!!! We stayed 6/11-6/19. There was one problem though. We were supposed to have a King size Ocean Front room, but were given a room with double beds. When we complained, 'the Manager (Doyle was his name, although I don't think he really was a Manager)', didn't seem very sympathetic. He said that although they hold the type of room, they dont hold the size (it didnt make much sense to me either). He did offer to move us once a room opened up with a King bed, two days later (which happened to be on a smoking floor, even though we requested non-smoking. Although not happy, we realized that was the best he was going to do and took him up on it. The room with the double beds had a very tiny shower, whereas the King rooms shower and bathroom overall was much bigger. After that first negative experience was over though, the rest of the staff, from the Bellmen to the Maids were great. They were always very courteous and willing to help. The hotel was a little run down, but not to the point where we were like eewwww. The food at the Tiki Gill was good and the Tiki Terrace restaurant was ok. Not a lot of variety and a little pricey. The free breakfast every morning was good. I know some reviewers complained, but I found it to be pretty good. Ive also read some reviews about people complaining about the pool. They do only have 1 pool, and its not Olympic sized, but I also found that to be ok. It was never overly crowded and clean. The location of this hotel is second to none. You just cant beat it. Bottom line..This is definitely not a luxury hotel by any means, but they treat you pretty good and make you feel welcome (at least most of them do).

The hotel was great, but it is about 30 miles from the airport. You have to pay for your own shuttle service, which is about $60-$70 each way. It's well worth it though once you get there, because it has balcony views overlooking the ocean which is only 50ft away. The service and hospitality was great, and it's easy to get directions or information about anything to do or anyplace to go. The rooms were really nice, but they don't have bathtubs in the regular rooms. There is lots to do nearby, and it's all fun. The prices in Maui in general are a bit high, but we felt the expanse was definitely worth paying for how picturesque, relaxing, and fun it is.

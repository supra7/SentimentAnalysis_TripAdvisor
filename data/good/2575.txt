Stayed one night but was treated as if the visit was longer. Great service from the desk personnel. They gave me a room on the 10th floor with a great view with windows in two corners. The room size was fine, I don't spend too much time in there anyway. The room was very clean with all the amenities. The location was very good, two blocks to the tram and the mall. Pike's Market and the Space Needle were also within walking distance. Will definately stay here again.

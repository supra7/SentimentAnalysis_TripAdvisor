We're the platum member w/ access to concierge lounge. They expect you to tip them b/c they'll just hand you a receipt that asks for your room # and tip amount, even if you're just there to get a cup of coffee while sitting down. All servers are reasonable except the only female there. She threw away all of our baby food even after we specifically tell her that we'll be right back, after a quick trip to our room. She hides the paper coffee cups in the kitchen so you have to ask her for them, hence, tip her for the coffee. Everything else @ the hotel is great! Location is close to Gap, H&M, Pike Market, etc. Parking is horrible due to location. Even street parking is harder to find here than some other hotels, such is the Westin that's close by.

Stayed 2 nights at this hotel dropping my daughter off at college. You can't be any closer to the airport, it's literally a 3-minute walk from the arrival terminal, and of course they have a shuttle. Room was fine with all expected amenities. Slightly stale smell in the hallway but not in the room. Hotel service was fine throughout. I didn't have a chance to use the restaurant but did order some late-night fries from the bartender and they were very good. I'm not impressed with the sleep-number bed. Mine only partially worked, I really think that they get an awful lot of abuse as every new guest plays with them, so they probably aren't designed for that much use. I did have a problem receiving a parking ticket from their private service, but it was an oversight on the hotel's part and they fixed it with a sincere apology, which is good enough for me. All in all, no problems, nice staff, and a great location. Ordinary hotel beds would probably be a better choice for this hotel.

Went to Seattle for the weekend and stayed at Hotel Monaco. Location was great. Staff very friendly & helpful. Good place to take kids. They had a welcome bag for our little guy upon arrival and a gold fish named "Karen" in our room. He loved it! The hotel decor was great! Very oppulent. We stayed in the Monte Carlo suite. It was spacious and comfortable. We chose the suite so that we could relax without disturbing our son once he went to sleep. The two rooms are seperated by a big curtain. It worked. Was not soundproof but baby did not wake up, so it served its purpose. Turn down service in the evening & choclates in the room. On the flip side there were a few things: the hotel plumbing was very noisy. Everytime someone ran water/ flushed a toilet you could hear the pipes in the walls screaming away. the hotel taxes were really high. $50/night on a $340/night room. (included continentail breakfast with this price. Breakfast was good. But quite small (coffee, oj & croissant) Lack of hot water when showering. I had a bath 1 night & a shower another time. Both times I was only able to have a luke warm temperature. Not the case for my husbands showers. They were hot. Perhpas it was bad timing, but that isn't something I expect from a hotel as usually the hot water is limitless. Overall, I would stay again at this hotel. The negatives were minor and the plus' were great!

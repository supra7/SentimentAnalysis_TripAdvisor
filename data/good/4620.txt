The hotel staff was amazing. The only problem we had was when we checked in we were told one price & when we checked out they tried charging us $200 more. Completely unexceptable. The manager was very rude emplying we were lying That is the only reason they didn't get an excellent score becuase everything else was great. Thank you again. Sarah from Oahu

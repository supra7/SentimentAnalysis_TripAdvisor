Pros- FANTASTIC beach...nice pool. Depending on who was working that day, service varied. Fernando on the beach was by far the best! Room design nice... night shows entertaining...nice people...drinks good , esp the tea time coffees (ask for the premium liquors- they have it!) Cons- AC in rooms not very powerful, guarenteed room upgrade not honored, visible debris in room whirlpool water, food so-so, and we found that the room service food was actually of better quality than the restaurants. Interesting experience that people visiting should know.- after feeling very sick and losing hearing after my first day at the pool, I found a medical office at the resort on day 4 of our trip. There was an extreme communication barrier yet he diagnosed me w/ a severe ear infection & in urgent need of antibiotics. Dr charged me $250 (cash only!) for medicine coming from a pharmacy scooter delivery man. Upon returning to the states, my ear infection was gone though I was feeling very sick. My doctor told me I was overprescribed 4 antiobiotics and a shot, and had liver damage.

Stayed 3 nights on business and was pleasantly surprised. I only booked for one night thinking I might not stay given the reviews but wound up staying all 3 nights. It is just an avg. hilton, but it has a very good location and seems very reasonably priced and thus the 4 out of 5 given good value for a slightly above avg. large city Hilton. Rooms & baths were not overly small as some indicated, but again avg. The views varied greatly. The city w/ water view is what you want on a high floor. As others indicated, the breakfast on the top floor is very good and the top floor is the lounge in the evening which was significantly better than the avg. Hilton Honors Lounge. I would recommend this property particularly for HHonors members. The Homewood suites are bit further away although one is right down on the water but the water is a nice 5-8 minute walk from here. It is uphill on the way back if that is an issue.

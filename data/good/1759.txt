We had only a one night stay, but it was a lovely room and a great location. We were able to walk to Pike Place in 10 mins. along the water for shopping and dinner. Our room was small, with a "city view", but cozy and comfortable. The shower was the best part! Fits two people with a really cool shower head tall enough for my husband. He was impressed. The $30 price tag for parking is utterly ridiculous. We parked on the street for free (it was Sunday). And they charge $10 for wifi. Ugh, I hate that. The bar and restaurant were hopping, but we didn't eat or drink there. Very pretty view. Lobby was nice too.

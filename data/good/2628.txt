Based on reviews on this site, I decided to give this hotel a try. They were friendly and helpful from start to finish. I decided to call them to book, and was able to get a better rate than any published internet specials. I had a "Queen of Art" room -- it would be small for two people, but the bed was good and the work area was very nice. Everything was very clean. They have a few "groovy" touches, such as a menu of pillows you can order and lots of interesting art everywhere. I felt the soundproofing could have been better, but luckily my chatty neighbor did not talk on the phone all night or watch loud TV, so it wasn't a big issue in the end. The air conditioner would have probably drowned him out anyway.

I have stayed in different hotels (ranging from the great to terrible) in Seattle over the last 25 years. This one is memorable for the following reasons: -TAKES YOU BACK IN TIME: It was built in the early 20th century (1917?) and retains some of the charm from those early days. Photos of early Seattle and its leaders line the hallways. Some of the floors are creaky, but to me that just adds to the ambiance of an old hotel. The room we stayed in had a small kitchen and living room area, and could have been someone's apartment in years past. -LOCATION PART 1: You are within walking distance to Key Arena. You don't have to fight traffic going home from a Sonics game or a concert. You can go to the Space Needle and eat at some pretty decent restaurants in the area. -LOCATION PART 2: Kerry Park. This is close to the hotel, and the best site in town for photographing the Emerald City. When you see the postcards of Seattle, this is where many of those shots are taken. It's on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill, located at the corner of 2nd Avenue W. and W. Highland Drive. -PRICE: For Seattle, the price is a bargain. The only negative thing that stands out is the parking. You can drive around the block again and again and possibly find a space, but I suspect it may be easier to take advantage of the valet.

We recently stayed at this property. To our surprise we were put in a newly renovated condo so everything was nice and new. This property is located ajacient to a Golf course and back from the beach a bit. However this was no problem as it took only about 3 - 5 mins to walk or you could get one of those carts thingies to drop you down there. The property also had a Cabana at the beach for guests use. We had our room serviced each day which was nice. Room was well appointed with full kitchen plus Laundry facilities. Great to keep costs down as eating out is expensive on Maui. We had a Garden View Condo which gave us views of the Golf course. Luckily no balls found there way in our direction!!! Must be better golfers on Maui ????? One disappointing feature was the indiffernce of some of the staff. We encountered this in Hawaii a lot. Of particular annoyance was the charging for parking. We have stayed in lots of Apartment / Condos and Parking has always been included in room rate.

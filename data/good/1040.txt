We had a great stay. Went with a group of 11 year old boys to go to a Sounders game. Everything was excellent. The rooms were fine. Recently done over. Very clean. Excellent housekeeping during our stay. The beds were comfortable and we all commented on how well we slept, save for one of our party due to a bit of noise through the adjoining doors of the neighbouring room. The swimming pool on the 28th floor was a hit; great view! We ate in the Lobby Lounge and in Maxwells. Both times the food was good, tasty, served quickly and the service was great. There are some disadvantages to this property, like there are at most hotels throughout the world. A little bit of research will help you in the long run. The underground parking lot is not great. It's low. It's expensive (but all parking in Seattle is IMHO) and yes there is a lack of space to pull in to drop your bags. But it is all doable. We did it, everyone else in our group did it but you just need to be a bit flexible. The I-5 side is noisier. Request a room on the other side facing the water. Get a room without an adjoining door. I couldn't disagree more with breakerm's review in regards to location though. We were very impressed with how close it was to everything. Fair enough you need to be reasonably mobile but we walked from the hotel to Pike Place Market to REI to Space Needle and back then went to the Sounder's soccer game. All this with kids. We all commented on how convenient the location was. Qwest and Safeco Fields are a reasonably close walk away. If you want free WIFI, go across the street to the Public Library and they have wireless in the building. So all in all we all enjoyed staying here. The parking is not brilliant but the beds, housekeeping, food, service and location are great. Know a bit about the hotel beforehand and you'll end up having a great experience there like we did!

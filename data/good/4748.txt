The Outrigger was nice. We had no problems with checkin the staff was very courteou s and accomodating. They picked us up outsideour room and took us to the Cabana within 5 minutes of each time we called and they returned to bring us back at the specified time. This was our first trip to Hawaii and it was superb. Of all the places we've travelled this is the first where we are immediately ready to return as soon as possible if not sooner. The natural beauty was sometimes a tear jerker for me. The Road to Hana was so beautiful. Had I had a magic marker I would have written on every one of those DO NOT PASS signs, "AS IF I WOULD". It was a beautiful experience and can't wait to go back.

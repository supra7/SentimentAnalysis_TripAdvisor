The location of this hotel was perfect for our art-get-away weekend. The valet was at the door waiting for our Jeep, and the clerk at the counter had our room information ready for us before we approached the count. The room was a little on the small side, but staying in the room was not our goal. When we did return to the room after a lot of walking to see the art museum and downtown seattle, we found a very clean room waiting for us to retire. The only down fall of the stay was the behaviors of other guests, a little on the noisey side. We will stay there again. They took very good care of us. Thank you!

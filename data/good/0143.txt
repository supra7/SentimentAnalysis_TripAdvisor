We frequent this hotel when we visit Seattle. Always offers great value for downtown Seattle. Staff are friendly, rooms are comfortable and clean and location is very convenient. We also enjoy the city views and indoor pool and hot tub. Complimentary computer asccess in business center is also a plus.

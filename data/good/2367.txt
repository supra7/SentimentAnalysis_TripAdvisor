I stayed here last week for three nights for a work event and I'm really happy they booked this location (versus the last company offsite). I arrived at 11 p.m. and was greeted warmly and professionally at the front desk. I was a bit overwhelmed when I walked in because the vibe is a whole lot hipper than I'm used to. The first thing I tweeted was that I'm just not cool enough to stay there. Showing my Starwood Preferred Guest card to the gentleman checking me in I was given a better room, which I always appreciate. I have a king size bed at home; I do not want to sleep in a double regardless of where I am. Getting off the elevators I had a bit of a hard time finding my room because the lighting situation is quite ... intimate. Getting to the room, I was very pleased. Beautiful crisp white linens, great window seat, lots of task lighting if I needed it. One of the ways I rate hotels is if the room is better than what I have at home. On that level, I was really pleased with the bathtub. A lot of hotels - yes, even those four star properties - put really shower, standard issue tubs in their bathrooms. I have no idea why. Not so with the W. After a long day of work and travel I was able to take a nice, hot relaxing bath in a deep tub that wasn't overly aggressive about draining for my safety. I also really enjoyed the Bliss bath products as I had forgotten my Lush face wash at home. The one thing I would have appreciated about the room was if the iPod docking stations had been updated to charge iPhones. Unfortunately they didn't so I had to crawl behind a side table to plug my charger in. That said, overall, I really enjoyed the hotel. I also enjoyed the space used for our work event and that the WiFi there was free (unfortunately it was $40 for my stay in my room). If I was going to Seattle for pleasure, I'd probably go back to the Alexis Hotel or Inn at the Market, but if someone told me they'd booked the W I'd tell them they were in for a good stay.

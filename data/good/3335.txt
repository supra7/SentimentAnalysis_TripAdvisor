My husband and I spent 5 days at Secrets Riviera with a destination wedding group. I was really nervous about going to the resort prior to the trip because of some of the reviews I read on trip advisor. I now wonder if some of those reviews were "planted" because we had a really good time. The service was excellent, the room was very clean, the beach area and pool area were nice, the air conditioning in our room was great, and all the rooms are non-smoking. If you want to hang out with friends, lounge in the pool, and drink lots of drinks (my favorite was the Dirty Monkey) this resort is a great choice. Bring some nice clothes along with your beach cover-ups- guests dress for dinner and the restaurants open for dinner are nice. I highly recommend the spa, it's one of the best. Make sure if you book spa treatments to go at least an hour early to enjoy the water treatments included with all spa treatments. Yoga classes would have been nice (the staff said they offered classes but none were offered while I was there) and I wish there had been more fresh vegetables and vegetarian options. After the first day, I stopped ordering off the menus and just asked what they could make vegetariano and my meals became much better - the omnivores in our group loved the food, especially the cerviche at the beach front grill. ** If you must bring your computer, bring a dsl cord (no wireless in rooms).

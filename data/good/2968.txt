stayed here one night on business. I selected this hotel simply because the workshop that I was attending was held there. Seemed expensive, at ~$250/night, so I'd shop around if I were returning to the area. The hotel is about one mile from the airport, so very convenient in that regard. A complimentary shuttle runs every 15 minutes, and this is also a plus. My room (and based on what I saw, the other standard rooms) was not very big, but was well-appointed: luxurious king bed, chest of drawers, armchair with footstool, desk with work chair, Starbucks in-room coffee. The bathroom and amenities were nice. The room was clean and reasonably quiet. I did not bring my laptop, so can't comment on the internet connection, however, there is a business center with 2 computer stations where travelers can check email, etc, no charge. There is also a kiosk especially for doing airline web check-in so you can print your boarding pass, a nice touch. The hotel has an atrium, where the pool and jacuzzis are located. It is quite nice, with trees. The fitness room was better than I encounter at most hotels. They had a selection of cardio equipment: bikes, treadmills, elliptical trainers, plus some weight machines and free weights. There is a somewhat pricey cafe in the hotel. I had breakfast and lunch there. The food and service were good. There does not seem to be any other place to eat within walking distance. The staff were nice and courteous. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a business traveler.

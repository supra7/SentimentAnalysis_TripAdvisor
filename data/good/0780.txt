I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions when I have had to work so late I did not feel like commuting home. It is a very basic hotel but it is far and away the least expensive you will find in downtown Seattle by a hefty margin. I have always requested the European Rooms (Shared Batchroom) because they are even less expensive and I have always got what I expected, a Clean bed and a no-frills room. The shared bathrooms are clean if you get up early, but wait until after 9am and its bit messy. My only recomendation is that you request a room on the backside (alley) or a top floor room, as the street will get a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights. As for the neighborhood, it's no less or more safe after dark than any other downtown location. It is also close to Pike Market.

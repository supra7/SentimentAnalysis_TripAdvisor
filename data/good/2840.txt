We got a great rate through Priceline. They rate it as 3-stars and we would agree. The hotel is right on "rental car return boulevard" so it was real easy to take our car back. The hotel charges for parking, but if you are taking your car back after check-in, they will validate your ticket and not cost a thing to stay for a short period. Check-in was easy and the room was huge. We have never stayed in a Doubletree before, but certainly will in the future.

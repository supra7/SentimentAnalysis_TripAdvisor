I spent my last nights here. This is a great hotel that is not as expensive as nearby resorts. It is convenient to Lahaina and Honolua Bay. I was very pleased with my room, which was garden view but I could still see the ocean in the distance. The room was large with a settee and king bed and a nice, large balcony. Although I didn't spend much time in the room, it was nice to return from a day of traveling to a comfy bed with lots of pillows. The room has a fridge, safe, coffee maker, and ceiling fan! The hotel differentiates itself from other resorts in the area by offering complementary Hawaiian activities such as lei making and hula dancing. I got to take advantage of the new Hawaiian language class where I learned how to correctly pronounce Hawaiian letters and words (wish I could've taken that class my first day in Maui!). The hotel is also right on the boardwalk leading to Whale Village which has nice shops and restaurants. Only downside -- parking is $9/day and Internet is an extra $10/day. However, the hotel does not charge a resort fee, which is a pretty penny at the surrounding resorts. If you plan on sightseeing the island more than relaxing on the beach, I'd recommended staying at this hotel rather than the Hyatt or Westin or another resort. Save on that resort fee and use it to put more gas in your rental!

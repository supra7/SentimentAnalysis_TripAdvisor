landed this hotel on Priceline for $125.00 for the night. My gal pal and I flew over from Victoria on a floatplane.(Kenmore Air) what a blast! we had a smooth ride and then we were less than 10 min to our hotel. We were warmly received- clean and nicely appointed room. We were a quick walk down hill to Pikes Market and great shopping(Nordstroms!) Breakfast in the cafe on the second level was excellent, no problem sharing(who needs a 3 egg omelette) overall a terrific experience. There are hotels that are closer to the center and market, but we were so impressed with the service of this hotel- we would return!

Stayed at this hotel for one night before early morning flight.. Perfectly comfortable and clean...excellent location just a few minutes walk from airport main terminal. Most of the other guests were also staying for just the one night too. Hotel has a restaurant , but there are a few alternatives within easy reach . No noise heard from aircraft landing or taking off. General decor a bit bland but for one night ,who's complaining.

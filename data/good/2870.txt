We've been to this hotel more than once and have not had any problems. We have never encountered any staff who couldn't speak English or were rude. Someone mentioned in a previous review that this hotel charges $15 extra a day for babies.This is completely FALSE. Children under 18 are free at all Hilton properties. Perhaps that reviewer accidentally listed their child as an adult when making their reservation, but I can tell you, having stayed there with kids, that there is absolutely no charge for them. Yes, they do charge $8 a day parking but you can leave your car in the lot, take their free shuttle to the airport, and save a lot of money instead of paying over $20 a day at Sea-Tac.

I pre-paid my room about 45 days before I left and felt like I got a great deal. The room was updated and the perfect size for my teenage daughter and myself. The shower was also nice, not too small, and was cleaned every day. The only thing was that the room was a little on the dark side, very small window for sunlight. But that was very minute and we loved the hotel. We would return again!

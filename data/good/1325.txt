The Seattle Sheraton Towers is a great, upsclae choice for the downtown Seattle area. It is connected to Daily Grill Restaurant which is a great brand restaurant for a hotel to have. The fron desk was fine but nothing out of the ordinary though they did grant us a nice room. This is a big hotel with all that comes with it. There were plenty of kids around but depending on the room, it could be a nice getaway place for the weekend. The beds were too soft for my taste but some may like it that way. There is decent mall shopping nearby as well as Anthro, H and M, Gap etc....

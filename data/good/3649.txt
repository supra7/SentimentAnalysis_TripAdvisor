We booked a queen room for $199 a night over the weekend. Conveniently located a couple blocks from the 2nd Ave subway stop. Lots of local restaurants like Schimmel's knishes, Whole Foods grocery, Sugar desserts, Doughnut Plant, Katz, Clinton St Baking Co. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Free breakfast spread in the basement with tables, seating area/TV and a couple computers. Room was a little small (typical for NYC) but nicely decorated. You can hear street noise (typical for NYC) so bring iPod or ear plugs if needed. Bathroom was nice and roomy with shower, no tub. My only complaint - they needed 1 more light in the room, maybe above the desk. There were only the 2 sconces above the bed and it was a little dark at night. The 7th floor outdoor terrace had a great view. Lots of nightlife in the area.

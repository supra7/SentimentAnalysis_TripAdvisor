I stayed at the Warwick Seattle hotel for 4 nights. The best choice I made. Great hotel, very friendly staff. Located in between the Space Needle and downtown Seattle you can not have it better. I highly recommend You to look for the internet specials on their web page. You can save a lot of money. I did and I am very satisfied with my stay.

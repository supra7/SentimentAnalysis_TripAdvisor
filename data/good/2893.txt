We stayed here the night before a cruise and it worked out nicely. The hotel's free shuttle picked us up at the airport, and it seems guests could make arrangements with the driver to pick them up at a nearby restaurant and drop them off at the hotel. Check-in was fast and easy. The room was adequate. Because of the location, we heard airplanes fly by many times and they were loud. We worked out at the fitness center, but it was small and had a treadmill and an elliptical machine. Breakfast was basic. The toaster and waffle maker are plugged into the same outlet, and the circuit breaker kept interrupting the toasting or waffle-making. The only signal that the appliances were ready was a lamp nearby would turn on when power came back. One thing we wish we had time to check out was a lake across the street. It looked like a nice place to walk to and hang out at if you don't have a car and want a nice peaceful morning.

Rooms and rates were perfect. Dining room was excellent, but a little overpriced, however, this is a full service hotel. Front desk personnel were very pleasant and helpful, but a little unprofessional at times. For the dollar, it is a great and convenient location and extremely close to all attractions and the port. I had stayed in this hotel some 15 years ago, and I am glad I returned.

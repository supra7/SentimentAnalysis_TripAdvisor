Hotel was clean, spacious, and very nice. Didn't eat at any of the restaurants - it is San Diego so the weather is always nice for a walk - just across the way is Petco Park and the gaslamp quarter, which is fun to walk around - Gaslamp Pizza is good pizza and at a reasonable price (not easy in this area - 2 slices and a pop for $6). Also within walking distance is the ship museum and the USS Midway. The room was large, and nicely appointed, and clean, with a wonderful view of the bay. 2157 room number. The gym was nice for cardio, they had a lot of floor equipment but I don't know where you would use it. I wish they would give you water bottles in the gym. Overall, very nice hotel.

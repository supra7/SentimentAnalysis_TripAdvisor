We stayed here for 4 nights as part of a wedding group and had a great time. The hotel is quite large but never feels too crowded, except for perhaps the restaurant for breakfast. The rooms are clean, with good beds and all usual amenities. We used the cleaning service that was very efficient. The pool area is pretty big and the times we went there we had no problem getting a seat close to the pool. Also several bars for close to the pool for good snacks and cocktails. We booked a tour through the hotel and the lady at the tourdesk gave us excellent advice and took care of everything for us. Downstairs there is a Macy's and several other shops which was great as we had forgotten a few things and could just buy them there. Location is good too and the drive from the airport to kaanapali is amazing and never gets old. The hotel offers valet parking or self-parking and you can switch it up per day, which is nice if you know that you wont be using the car on a certain day. All-in-all a good hotel, especially if you go with a group of family and/or friends. All-in-all a good hotel

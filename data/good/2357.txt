My boyfriend and I stayed at the W in Seattle on the weekend of August 5, 2011. We stayed in a room with two double beds as they were out of king beds. The W provides amenities from the Bliss brand, which is great. For a double, the room is on the small side. However, they have an upgraded in-room stereo with an iPod charger/player and the decor was well above average. These extras made up for the smaller size. There is a happening bar downstairs, but it is much smaller than I imagined. We went down about 10pm and it was so busy that we ended up walking down the road to the Purple Cafe. All in all, the W is great and I'd recommend it.

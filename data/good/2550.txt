My husband and I stayed at Hotel Max for one night on a quick trip from Portland to see a particular exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum. After checking out of the hotel and spending a few hours at the SAM, I realized I had inadvertently thrown away our return train tickets. I called the hotel and was told the room had already been cleaned and the garbage can emptied. I was dismayed but, hey, what do you do. Thirty minutes later I received a call from the hotel to tell me housekeeping had gone through the trash and found my tickets! I was thrilled but totally surprised when they offered to send a driver to deliver the tickets to me at the SAM - all free of charge. Wow. As a quick side note - I travel a lot for business and let me tell you, regardless of the chain, hotels all look the same after a while. It's refreshing to stay somewhere that actually has a personality. (I do agree, however, the rooms ARE small - but what do you need all that extra space for anyway?)

Hotel Andra is good but not excellent. We had a Lux Suite which is pretty expensive. The main room was spacious and we liked the extra closet space, but still got an incredibly small bathroom. And why no shower gel with the usual toiletries provided? The service is above average - the valets and bell staff were particularly helpful and friendly, the front desk staff extremely pleasant. The hotel was very busy so we weren't made to feel particularly special, but the concierge team had some good advice and was helpful in booking a hire car, spa treatments etc. The location for the shops and the Space Needle is excellent; lots of restaurants are nearby. or it's a short cab ride to most places downtown. I would recommend this as somewhere a bit more modern and interesting than the usual run-of-the-mill chains.

We booked our stay via priceline.com and were very pleased with our accommodations. The location in Downtown Seattle is great, however parking IS expensive at the hotel so keep that in mind. There are nearby parking garages that are slightly less expensive, however you don't have the ability to go in and out. The service was great, the rooms were very clean and trendy. We also loved the fitness room. The only downside we had was our stay was too short and our view was of the neighboring parking garage. Other than that, it was perfect.

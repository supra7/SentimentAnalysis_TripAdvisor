They were very flexible for my very late arrival and flexed my check out time as well. The bathrooms are nice but small and the toilet/shower area felt a little cramped. Still, my view of the Olympic mtns. Was spectacular and the room was in great condition. If you are visiting Seattle, this location is central to most everything.

My first impression was what a beautiful hotel this is and how very nice and helpful the staff is. I still think this. The beds are so comfortable, however in the middle of the night my husband woke to something crawling on him. We turned on the lights and sure enough bed bugs. My husband is in pest control so he knew immediately . We took the bed apart and there was more evidence, so we had our rooms switched and no more problems. We were told that it was the first time, however now I see another review that mentioned it. We checked my daughter and son in law's bed in the morning and even though they didn't have bugs currently, my husband could see the traces that showed there had been. The hotel handled this, but when they were supposed to call hotwire to let them know, they didn't plus had no record, so I had to call the manager and find out what was going on. They comped the rooms so I appreciate the great service, but not the lie about there never being bed bugs before or the fact that the manager didn't call hotwire to take care of this. It is a beautiful hotel, great location and great staff, but be aware and check the bed when you get into a room. I'm going to say yes to recommendation, but with a warning.

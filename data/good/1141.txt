My husband and I were very pleased with our 3-night stay at this Quality Inn, Seattle Center. Couldn't have a better location for getting around Seattle. Also, we were able to walk to restaruants without any problems. Our room and the bathroom were small but clean and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. And we had covered parking. Also, a guest laundry was valuable to us and not available in many motels. The price for Seattle accommodations fit our budget-minded travel requirements very well. Only problem was very poor internet connections. Called about the problem and was told that the hotel was not getting good service from their provider. A little annoying.

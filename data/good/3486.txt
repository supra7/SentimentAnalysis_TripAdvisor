Just returned from a wonderful week at Secrets Maroma. I will start off by saying that my husband and I stayed at their former property, Secrets Excellence, and I must say this was vastly improved. The most noticable change was the food which was decent before but now I would have to say it was extremely good. Very good quality, taste & variety and the waitstaff were so much easier to communicate with. The room was beautiful and the bed was quite comfortable and to my liking - not too soft. The gounds are not quite as attractive as the former property but still quite beautiful. The former property had alot of interesting statues and artwork in amongst the vegetation but this one did not. The beach was wonderful!!! Beautiful soft white sand with crystal clear water - paradise. We never had difficulty finding a palapa but if they added more, it wouldnt hurt. The entertainment staff is not irritating - they ask you to play volleyball once or twice and then leave you alone. I cannot comment on pools, although they were beautiful, I do not go to the ocean to lay by the pool. Excellent service in the restaurants as well as at the beach and the bars. All sit down restaurants except the World Cafe where you eat breakfast, they serve lunch and have dinners on some nights. Our only complaint was the workout room which was small and constantly crowded. All in all, our stay was wonderful and we would definitely go back again!

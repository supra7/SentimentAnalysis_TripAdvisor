Nice new hotel. My room on the 14th floor was nicely furnished and quiet, with a nice view of the city and bay. Minor gripes: it took hot water a long time to reach the sink (but not the shower). In some of the public areas they play what they think is "hip" music, sometimes louder than they should, and it can sometimes be mind-numbingly repetitive. The location is convenient to the convention center and gaslamp district. But walking distances are longer than they look (due to the gigantic scale of the buildings in this area) and the convention center area (which you must traverse to get to the gaslamp district) is quite deserted and desolate at night. The back of the hotel faces a container port and rail yard. I didn't face that way, so I can't comment if there is any noise etc. I tried the buffet breakfast and it was good, but if you pay the full price of $22 it's quite expensive. The main issue is value for money: high room rates plus $14/day internet. And wireless coverage did not extend to some of the hotel's own meeting rooms (the same ones which were also 3G deadspots except for Verizon).

We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a family vacation. The hotel really stepped up and honored an internet rate package that offered via Hilton.com in error ($99/night + free parking +$35/night hotel credit to be used in anyway we liked!). The breakfast buffet is great - kids ate free with adult purchase, I highly recommend. The rooms were comfortable enough and staff was friendly. You have to walk across a bridge over the road to get to the Gaslamp, trolley, or really anything, but that was a minor inconvenience.

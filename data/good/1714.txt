It all comes down to this. Just walk in the front door and take a look out the floor to ceiling windows from your location literally right over the water and ask yourselves if you regret the choice. You won't. There's no hotel right on Elliott Bay in downtown Seattle. The Beatles stayed here for a reason. We're talkin' The Beatles people! Forget the higher rated places with theoretically nicer "amenities" and furnishings and just experience boats going by your window and the foghorns and the feeling of being on the waterfront. Take a loved one here with caution, however. You will be guaranteed to be more in love when you leave.

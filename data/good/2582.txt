We had a king room on the 7th floor. The rooms are not very big but do have lots of storage and a great desk area. The bathrooms are small and the shower even smaller. All the employees we encountered were extremely friendly. Are room faced Steward Street and there was a lot of road noise; but really did not bother us. The beds were extremely comfortable. We will definitely stay again as the location was perfect for us and we did like the style of this hotel. The Red Fin restaurant located in the building was also very good!

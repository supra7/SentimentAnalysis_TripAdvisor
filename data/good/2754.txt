We landed around midnight at the DoubleTree across from SEATAC and arrived to find a 100 travelers packing in the lobby that were going to take a group cruise the next day... Tired and longing to get to bed, we were thinking we would never get into our room... I asked a well dressed man who appeared to be the manager if they had another line for Diamond VIP Hilton Honors members? He walked around the desk and personally escorted me to someone who could help. We were treated very well, they apologized for the busy night, we weren't impatient, just tired, and appreciated the jesture... We got our room, and it was just what we needed, comfortable beds, clean and quiet. The staff made it work, they really did their best and we appreciated them!

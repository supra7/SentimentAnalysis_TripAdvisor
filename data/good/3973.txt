I stayed at the Hilton for one night with my mother who was visiting the area. Great location to walk around the Gas Lamp district and tons of shops/restaurants. The hotel is directly on the water so there is a bit of a breeze but great views of Mission Bay. Plenty of options in the hotel for food, drinks, coffee (Starbucks) and gym. I would definitely stay there again!

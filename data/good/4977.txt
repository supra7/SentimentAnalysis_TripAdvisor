Our trip was actually a business trip.We stayed in Pera Tulip for 4 nights and 5 days!Everything was perfect.Our room was very clean.The staff were very nice specially MURAD! he was our favorite.Very nice and always smiling The location was fantastic but the only problem was the swimming pool!it was really bad i wish that next time this problem will be solved And I'm sure that our next trip to Istanbul we will choose Pera Tulip again

We stayed here with 2 children and overall had a good time. We all enjoyed the free car service (though be warned you can't always get a car) and the room was excellent. However the reason they offer a car service soon became clear - its not as central as you'd expect for a hotel this expensive. All the staff were excellent - especially dealing with the serious matter of a lost teddy bear! Happily found during the search. Breakfast wasn't that good but nothing too wrong with it but again not as good as you'd expect for the money though amazingly in this day not a buffet. As other reviewers mention the public areas are strangely dark. There were also very few facilities (eg swimming pool). I would go back - I think!

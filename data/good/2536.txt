The hotel was just as the pictures showed... loved our room (10th floor).. although it was small.. but the colors and decorating were awesome. Bed was very comfortable with great pillows! Bathroom was smaller stilll ... but it was very cute none the less... I found the staff to be very helpful and polite.. The location was great... have to valet park at $30 a day... We didnt hear any of our neighbors... just the garbage truck at night and the sirens... but you will hear that anywhere there. Overall... it was exactly as I was hoping it would be..

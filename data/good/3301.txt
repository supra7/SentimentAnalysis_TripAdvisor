Stayed at Secrets Maroma Beach with Ocean View 4th floor Building #15 from 11/13 to 11/20. Not nearly as quiet as the same week last year and had to put up with two rude intoxicated honeymooning couples below us in the swim up rooms. The two couples were extremely loud and obnoxious and acted like Spring break kids for three days and nights before my wife and I were finally moved to building #16. Security was called, but this didn't stop the partying from going on day and night below us. My wife and I (50 somethings) could not even sit out on our 4th floor balcony because of the noise and vulgarity from the couples below. You expect this at the pool bar etc., but these couples were totally out of hand. Secrets did accomadate us with the move to building #16, but three days were ruined. Other than the above complaint, everything was outstanding as it was the previous year. The service and friendliness of the staff is excellent and the food was delicious. It's just a shame that a few people who can't handle their liquor have to ruin things for others.

After cancelling a different hotel because of bad reviews,we selected the El Dorado Maroma after reading some great reviews about its beautiful property, great food, service, beach etc. We were met at the door by Gabriel with a cool towel and a warm welcome. We were checked in by personal concierge Edder, who had us on our way to our room in just a few minutes after a brief tour of the hotel property. When we entered our room we were immediately relaxed by the aromatherepy and great infinity pool room. After unpacking we went down to the beach where they were having a cookout featuring tacos and other mexican goodies. The cookouts on the beach everyday featured really fantastic foods from barbeque to tacos to seafood. Everything they grilled was fantastic. The pools were very well kept and the swim up bars were staffed by some of the best bartenders we have ever met. They were always cheerful and would make any drink we requested. We had a very enjoyable night when they had Italian food at Sabores. It was a very enjoyable evening with really great food. We were there with friends celebrating our 30th anniversary and we were treated to dinner on the beach on our last night. Our waiter Robin made our night very enjoyable. Being in Mexico we thought we wouldn't see the Super Bowl but they put on a great Super Bowl party at Rick's Bar. There was more than enough chairs and cabanas to relax in by and on the beach. The staff at the resort from the construction workers to the management were pleasant and helpful and always had a smile on their faces. Some of the most helpful were personal concierges Carmina and Ruth who were very helpful when we ran into just a little glitch, and personal butlers, Jackeline and Catalina who were always there to talk or get anything you needed. We highly recommend this resort to everyone, it was what we expected and more.

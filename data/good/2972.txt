Spent two nights there in Jun. The hotel is very close to the airport and the shuttle runs about every 15 mins and is free. The room was clean with a very comfortable bed and linens. Although somewhat small it was very functional. The lobby seemed very noisy although the room was very quiet. I didn't eat in the restaurant but room service was good and quick. It seemed to take forever to get to my room, they seem to be very spread out.

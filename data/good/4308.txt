We booked our honeymoon through Costco (1 week in the Maui Hyatt and 1 week at the Kauai Hyatt). It was much more affordable than various travel websites and travel agents. Ill defer to all the excellent things mentioned in the other reviews. My main criteria for an excellent room: dark, quiet, comfortable bed. The Hyatt exceeds on all counts. The bed was very scrumptious, with a down or down like comforter. So nice. We had a lovely view of the gardens and the ocean. The room was spacious and clean. Did I mention dark and quiet? In the hall, I could hear whiny kids across the hall, but never in our bedroom. We hit Costco and Kmart coming off the plane and stocked up on bottled water, reef shoes, Hawaiian shirts, PB&J, bread, wine, beer, etc. We drove into Lahina and rented snorkel gear for the week at the first store we saw (Front St on the right). Great guys. Great rates. We kept the gear in the trunk of the rental car all week. We drove and snorkeled all up the coast (Black Rock, Kapaluha Bay, etc), and did a great 4.5 hour trip on the Kaanapali Kai catamaran. This was a great trip up the coast to Honalua Bay, where we saw turtles, squid, Moray Eels and more. We lived by the book Maui Revealed. We got soaked taking the long hike to the Blow Hole. Were amazed at the Olivine Pools. Had a great meal ($$$) at Pacifico. Enjoyed cheap, good Mexican at Cilantro and deep dish pizza at BJs. Did not enjoy some cheap eats in Lahina (Bubba Gump, Cheeseburger in Paradise all smelled like they hadnt been cleaned in 20 years. There is public parking on each end of the Hyatt resort. If the lot near the entrance was full, we found space at the far lot by the Luau facility. We didnt mind the walking. They have gorgeous tennis facilities that no one uses (I did!).

My wife and I stayed here after seeing Les Miserables at nearby 5th Ave theater. The proximity to the theater and its reputation as a nice hotel are the main reasons I chose to stay here. Everyone was friendly and helpful and our room was tidy and clean. I would stay here again as long as I was not parking a car. I was charged $45 for overnight parking even though the rate displayed at the valet and listed on my reservation confirmation from Priceline was $37. Not a huge difference, but it did contribute to my final bill of $298 for a one night stay (Priceline rate was initially $219). A couple of small pet peeves of mine that may or may not matter to other travelers: The shower head was too short. I am only 6ft tall and I had to bend down to get my head wet. The towels were pretty well worn and rough and no better quality than a Holiday Inn Express I recently stayed at. Kudos for a very comfortable bed with nice linens and a nicely stocked minibar.

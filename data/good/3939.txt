I traveled here earlier this month with my husband who was attending a conference at this hotel. It is definately a hotel that caters to the conference crowd and apparently do it very well. The hotel is beautiful. The public areas are contemporary, open and breezy and they flow from one area to the next. Very calm and serene..great background music ( I would have bought a CD) We were on a corner, 23rd floor, room was a little small if I'm being picky but the wrap around windows and the view more than made up for it. We enjoyed watching the boat traffic on the Bay and the loading of the banana boat.We did not feel that it was at all intrusive, but as something unique to the area. The staff that we interacted with were all very helpful. Housekeeping was very friendly, Waitresses in the bar -Odysea - were effecient though a little rushed, they could have used one more waitress to handle the amount of traffic. One little bump was the concierge...we asked about a place to have brunch on Sunday morning. She recommended a hotel downtown. When we arrived it turns out that we needed reservations, they were completely booked an hour before the brunch began, $42.50 per person! So we ate at Richard Walkers instead and were just as happy..walking distance to the Hilton, less expensive, great pancakes. Great location...I was on my own most of the day. It was easy to walk to downtown, shopping at Seaport village, USS Midway, Petco Park, tons of restaurants and shops. It's great just walking and taking in the Bay, boats, etc. The Old town trolley picks up at the Hilton and I was able to get off and on all day at various parts of town...Balboa Park, Little Italy, Old Town, etc. The Hilton provided a lovely atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, in a terrific location. What more could you ask for? Well, an entrance from inside the hotel to Starbucks would be nice...

My now fiance and I recently traveled to Secrets Maroma end of February. The staff is amazing and gracious, the food was very good for an all inclusive and the activities are abundant. My then boyfriend arranged a private romantic dinner for two right on the beach in a bungalow by candlelight. He popped the question on knee right there with the waves crashing in the background and the sea breeze blowing through my hair. Needless to say I cried and said YES! The swim out suite we booked was covered in rose petals, and contained chocolate covered strawberries & champagne. A proposal to DIE FOR! This was all arranged by our concierge under my fiances instruction. The resort itself is a great time. There are bonfires, barbecues a nightclub with a great staff and dj and many activities to keep busy if you don't fancy laying in the sun with cocktails as we did. I would not recommend a wedding here if you are looking for something intimate because everything is done right out in the open with all the guests looking on. The best way to describe this is luxury day camp for adults!

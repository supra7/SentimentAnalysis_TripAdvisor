Wonderful room with a balcony. Our view was slightly limited because of it's location in the hotel (we were in the low #s 208), but the view to the North was lovely. Great shower and bathroom. We loved the fireplace. I was close enough to walk to many of the local attractions like the ferry landing and the Pike Place Market. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

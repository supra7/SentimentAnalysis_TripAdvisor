tI made the mistake of staying in the Sultanamet area of Istanbul on the first part of my trip, in order to be within walking distance of the major sites. However, the Taksim area has a lot more value to offer, and this hotel was well worth the price. Location is great, one block away from the main pedestrian thoroughfare. The hotel itself is fairly modern, flatscreen TVs, coffee maker, iron, etc No problem with cleanliness The staff was polite and helpful. Not superfriendly, but I don't need a new best friend The amenities may have been the best part. Clean gym, great pool and jacuzzi, and a sauna too. Overall, I would definitely stay here again.

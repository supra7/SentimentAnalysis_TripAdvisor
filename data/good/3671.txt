This Hilton Garden Inn was very nice. We had a corner room on the 12th floor, two entire walls were windows that let us look out onto the city scape. The bed was extremely comfortable. The only thing I'd pick on was that there were only 2 pillows each for a king size bed (with no extras in the closet). Not a big deal at all, it was the only downside so that's a good thing! The breakfast at the grill was a little disappointing. For $13/pp you get limited buffet choices and a grill where you can custom order omelets, pancakes, potatoes, etc. I thought they could use more help as we had to get our own juices/coffee for that price. (For the record we get free breakfast b/c we are diamonds members, but if we had paid full price for the breakfast I would have complained to management while I was there.) My husband used the gym and he said it was excellent. There are a ton of treadmills, full weight sets, bikes, classes, etc. It must be a member gym since they charge for water and it was so crowded at 7AM. We stayed at the HGI for a concert at M&T Stadium. It was about a 2mile walk to/from the stadium so it wasn't too far for us. All in all, it was a very nice hotel and we would definitely stay here again.

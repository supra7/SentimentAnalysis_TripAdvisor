I stayed for one night at the Renaissance Marriott in Seattle. My room had a nice view of the city and was a larger corner room. The staff at the front desk and bar were exceptionally polite, courteous and professional. There was a group of 8 of us out for a girls weekend; 2 gals to a room. The hotel was kind enough to make sure each of our rooms had 2 queen size beds and that our rooms were nearby. About the only drawback to the place was that the bathroom didn't have a fan; other than that....no complaints!!

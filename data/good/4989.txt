I stayed in this hotel with my wife for 7 nights, and all I can say is I cant complaint... 1. The hotel offered value for my money. After roaming around Istanbul the whole day, the hotel provided a wonderful place to crash. 2. The breakfast was ok, but me being a vegetarian, there werent much options for me (had to hog on the omelettes/cheese/corn flakes)! We didnt have lunch/dinner in the hotel's restaurant, so dont know the quality of food. 3. There is free wifi (its really fast), which was of great help to research more on our trip. 4. The staff were really helpful, and all our requests were attended to on time. 5. Its located very close to Istiklal street (on the other end though). 6. Even we had the problem with the double bed separating in the middle, but this came only on the last 2 days of our stay and it didnt bother us much. 7. There was no problem with the outside noise on weekend in our room, cos it was facing the back (Room no. 1105). The size of the room was good enough for 2 people, since we were anyway travelling light. 8. We did not check out the fitness center / spa / pool, since we werent in Istanbul for that, so cant comment on it. 9. Also this hotel does not have a currency exchange desk, so the guy at the reception sent us to a Change office on Istiklal street, which was quite far. One tip though, if you are in Istanbul for the first time or mainly for sight-seeing, I would recommend you to stay in Sultanahmet area becos all the sight-seeing things are there. We were spending close to 12-15 liras (one way) for taxi daily to get to Sultanahmet everyday. This hotel is apt if you are more into enjoying the nightlife and shopping at Istiklal street. Lastly, we loved our trip to Istanbul. We were there for our wedding anniversary. Its a wonderful place, really warm people and really good food! Its an experience which you shouldn't miss...

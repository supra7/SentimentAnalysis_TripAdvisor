We stayed for a conference. Great location - easy to access I-5 and Gaslamp District, etc. There are restaurants on site, Starbucks within walking distance, as well as other great restaurants to visit along the pier. However, the internet is NOT great - and the Wifi is less than stellar. The staff was friendly and the valet knew much better, shorter routes than the concierge did. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Would stay again, but mostly for a conference.

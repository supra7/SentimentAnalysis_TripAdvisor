The title about says it. It's sort of no-frills, but if you're fine with that, this is a great place to stay. The design and decor is modern but not in a pretentious way, the room is rather large for a city and fairly well-appointed, and the staff was friendly and helpful. For the price ($99/night), in a city, you can't beat it. We were in one of the rooms that had a common bathroom. If you're worried about that, don't be: there was always at least one free bathroom, and every bathroom was always clean. The one downside: The pillows weren't so great. If you can, bring your own - or maybe find a store and go buy one, especially if you'll be there for more than one night.

I checked in for 4 nights last weekend. We booked a Fabulous room but were upgraded to Cool Corner Suite. The hotel is in the main part of downtown Seattle, close to shopping, great places to eat and a short walk from Pike Place Market. This W is either the 3rd or 4th W hotel built, which was in 1998, so the rooms aren't as "up to date" as the new ones, but they're still great. The only thing that could use a little but of a make-over would be the bathrooms - still very clean and spacious, but not as "cool" as the new W's. The service (front desk, restaurant, bar, room service) was still awesome. Great place to stay in Seattle.

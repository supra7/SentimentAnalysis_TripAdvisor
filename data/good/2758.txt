This is a large hotel located within one mile of SEA. The main building has two restaurants/bar/and a small store. I stayed in the main building on the 12th floor and had a great view of Mount Renier and the surrounding area. My room was located in what I could call the back of the hotel, and there was no traffic/airport noise. My room also had a nice balcony. The food and service at the bar was fine with a selection of local wines and beers. Only negative on the bar is it is very dark and you could not read a paper if you wanted to. The shuttle service to the airport is very popular and was filled to capacity, so I would recommend arriving a few minutes before it departs to insure yourself a seat. The pick up at the airport was slower than I would have liked, but did finally arrive after about a 25 min wait. This property has several out buildings and if you are housed in one of them you will have a short hike to get to the main building. Only negative is the elevators in the main building a pretty slow so it takes a few minutes to get up or down. Near the bar they have three computer stations with a printer (very nice) which makes checking in on line very easy. This is a full service hotel and overall I was very satisfied.

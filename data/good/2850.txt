We had a nice Seattle snow/icestorm that took out power to 300K+ people. After staying home in the cold, we decided to get a hotel room and warm up and charge our toys. I called them on the phone and asked for a executive suite. The girl insisted that all of their rooms were suites. When I got there, we were given a standard suite. That's OK, but I did want the step up. The hotel room was nice, and the service was good. When we went to get dinner, I stopped at the front desk and asked for a couple of extra pillows. They were delivered to our room while we were gone. While using the pool, I almost slipped on the pool deck. I wasn't the only one, I saw several other people almost take a fall. They need to do a different surface in the pool area. When it gets wet, it's downright dangerous. I'm surprised they haven't had a lawsuit yet. My daughter ended up forgetting her watch in the pool area. The following morning during checkout, I asked at the front desk, and thankfully, someone had turned it in. The clerks were very nice when I asked if the watch was turned in. The free breakfast in the morning was good/bad. Since the hotel was crowded, they setup a second serving area for the hot food (pancakes, french toast, sausage/bacon/eggs). Although it was a nice thought, all the food in the second area ended up being cold. If I would have looked harder before getting breakfast, I would have stood in line longer for the hot food. The rest of the food availability was nice. The internet is an extra charge at this hotel, but since I am a Hilton Gold member, that was free. Parking was also an extra charge, and being a Hilton member doesn't help you on that one. I have no idea why they charge for parking. It is nothing special, and they own the lot. I can't think of any obvious reason other than taking an extra $10 from you. If we end up with another lengthy power outage, we would stay here again.

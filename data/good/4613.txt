Just got back from Maui. We stayed at the Kaanapali for our 20th Anniversary and loved it. The property is very clean and the gardens our gorgeous. Nice walk/jog path along the beach and this hotel by far has the best beach area compared to the other hotels on the path. Black rock is to the right of the resort which was awesome snorkeling. Saw lots of fish and turtles every day. The staff was very friendly and the food was very good. Pool was nice size - no waterslides or anything like that but very few people used it when we were there. Everyone heads to the beach. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone on somewhat of a budget. Only thing is to get a ocean view or partial view. It was beautiful sitting out on the lanai everyday watching the ocean. Also some sections are not new. Make sure to request one of the newer rooms. They are slowing upgrading but some sections are not done yet.

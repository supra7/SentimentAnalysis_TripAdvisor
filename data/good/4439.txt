After spending 6 days at the Westin, and having our flight cancelled, we were put up by USAir in the kaanapoli Beach hotel (2 properties away from the Westin) and ended up staying 2 extra nights. The room was well equipped with a refrigerator and safe, but it seemed to be decorated with 70's beach decor and old style TV. The folks seemed helpful and friendly enough. The nightly free luau music was entertaining the first night but got a little old after that. Would recommend if on a budget.

My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the Edgewater (got a great deal on priceline like most people do for this hotel!). I was expecting the worst after reading the reviews, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! Check-in was efficient (not super friendly, but not unfriendly) and our room was on the ground floor. Asides from being on the ground floor, the room was lovely, very nicely appointed, spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous. Lovely and modern and large. The hotel also has a lovely restaurant built over the water. As for the location, I would call this edge of Belltown, and its a bit of a walk to the main area where the shops and restaurants are, but we love to walk so we didnt mind. Also, there are lots of great restaurants in Belltown, just a couple of blocks away from the hotel. You must try the Macrina Cafe for breakfast one day, divine! As for parking, do not pay for the hotels outrageously priced valet, simply park your car in the Diamond parking lot two short blocks away at Vine and Elliot, half the price! The overall value of the hotel is great if you get the right price! We paid $75 us per night. I agree with other reviewers that if I had paid the rack rate of $200+ I would be extremely disappointed, but for $75 I was quite happy.

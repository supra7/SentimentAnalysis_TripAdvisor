The hotel was beautiful but watch out for single steps everywhere. The step in your room is the same color as floor. Your eye just doesn't see it. We had several friends fall. Also the steps in the enterainment area. On the way to the stage there are single steps. People fell everynight! Bsides the steps and mosquitoes, the resort is beautiful and enjoyable.

I stayed in Rome for 3 days in late August, and chose CMH based on the reviews here. I think the reviews are right on target. The hotel is a 4-star in every way but the room size. The rooms are tiny! But that is the only negative there is. The hotel is super clean, nicely decorated and with a lot of ammenities. The staff was really helpful and provided us with maps and directions. The breakfast room is on the 3rd floor and the breakfast itself was very good, a great reason to get out of bed in the morning! Try the gelatto at the piazza near the hotel and if you can afford it and want a gourmet experience dine at Glass Hosteria - there were a few dishes that were truly memorable. And prepare for a lot of walking! Overall I would say that CMH is a very good hotel, especially for the price we payed and there is a solid chance that I would stay there again if I ever returned.

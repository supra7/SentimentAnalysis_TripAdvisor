All things considered, this is a very nice resort and it exceeded my expectations for an all inclusive type of property, and we had no major disappointments. The entire resort was very well maintained and our room was clean. The beach area was clean and it was a nice environment overall. The entire staff was very friendly and always willing to accomodate any of our needs. There were activities every day and night that were offered for entertainment. and two of the five nights that we stayed, they had an outdoor buffet, and a show that followed dinner. The dining options were just about what I expected from an all inclusive resort, generally it was good but not excellent. If you are from a good restaurant town/city, you must understand that these types of resorts will never be able to provide top notch food and dining experiences, like you would get if you were going out to one of you favorite restaurants, no matter what price range or style you are choosing. If you are planning a trip to one of these types and are expecting that top level type of dining, you will be dissapointed, but that is true for every resort destination that I have ever been to. The breakfast buffet was the exception. It had a great variety of food that should satisfy anyone's appetite and it was all very good.

The hotel is nicely decorated and very clean, and has a welcoming atmosphere. It's ideally located to visit Seattle, right there downtown, a 5 min walk to the waterfront. The only criticism I have is the very slow service during breakfast. For a simple continental breakfast at about 30% of the tables occupied we waited for over 20 min. This is IMO not acceptable for a hotel of this standard.

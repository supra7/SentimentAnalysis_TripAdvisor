We changed our reservation to Le Crystal at the last minute, when we heard that Montreal would be over 30 degrees C during our visit. For this reason, the rooftop pool and hot tub were perfect and we were very pleased that we stayed here. The room layouts are attempting to mimic a suite, and while it is nice to have the small fridge and sink, the rooms are quite choppy and broken up, with a very narrow bedroom. One thing I was disappointed in was the bedding - polyester comforters and plasticky mattress covers just don't cut it in a nice hotel these days! That being said, we were very happy with the location which offered us good access to points both north and south. There is a metro station nearby, bus routes to/from the airport, and the major shopping and nightlife areas are easily walkable. There are lots of great areas in Montreal so it can be tough to make a decision on a hotel... Take note that some of the top-rated hotels on trip advisor are on VERY busy streets, so beware - if you're looking for some peace and quite, be careful about properties on St-Denis or in the heart of Old Montreal. PS - if you like Polish food, you MUST check out Stash Cafe in Old Montreal. Simply fabulous.

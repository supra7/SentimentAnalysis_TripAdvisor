Attended a conference at the Renaissance -only 2 blocks away - found Executive Pacific at less than half the cost -- guess what -- loved it -- perfect location - near restaurants, ferry, shopping, transportation -- good service -- comfortable - clean-- friendly -- maybe rooms are a bit small but me and my wife did not spend a lot of time there -- if you want to be in the downtown area and have a budget -- stay here -- you can do the same things as if you stayed at a hotel a block away at 2 or 3 times the price. Good deal!

My husband and I stayed at the Moore Hotel for three nights at the beginning of a two-week vacation. We enjoyed our stay immensely--the staff were very friendly, the bed was comfortable, the room was extremely clean, the hotel is well maintained and it is very close to Pike Market, shopping, the monorail, and the aquarium. We flew into Sea-Tac and took the Link Light Rail to Westlake Station, If I had any complaints at all it would be that there are no coffee makers in the rooms and there is no coffee in the lobby (but we got great coffee, hot tea, and crumpets at the Crumpet Shop in Pike Place Market every morning). Just a note: our room had a clawfoot tub shower, which might be difficult for some people to get in and out of. I cannot comment on parking because we waited until we were leaving Seattle to pick up a rental car. I would definitely stay here again.

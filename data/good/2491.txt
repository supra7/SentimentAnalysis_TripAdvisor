Hotel Max is located very conveniently for sightseeing in Seattle. The people at the front desk were very nice, we got there at 10:30 in the morning and they got us right into our room. The room was very clean, only drawback is the size of the bathroom......very small! The mattresses were through the roof comfortable! I would stay again, we were only there for two nights and only to sleep and shower so the size of the room and bathroom were not a big deal. Pikes Place Market is overwhelming, but well worth the visit. Check out Three Girls Bakery, super good soup and sandwiches. If you're looking for ambience this isn't the place, but if all you want is a great lunch at a reasonable price this is it!

This is a great resort. The beach is absolutely spectacular. The amenities of the property are very good, and the service provided on the beach, by the pools, and in the restaurants was excellent. The rooms are very nicely appointed and clean. Unfortunately, my experience at this great resort was somewhat marred by an experience similiar to a previous review. I, too, had a problem with the front desk. There was a mistake on my reservation and unfortunately for us, the hotel grabbed the opportunity to stick it to us for an extra $1200. No amount of reasoning could get them to budge. They did give us a slight upgrade which moved us up a few buildings closer to the beach. However, this experience just reinforced my beliefs (which were established through living close to the border) that when you are dealing with business/money issues in Mexico, ethics and doing the right thing do not prevail. So, would I recommend this resort? Yes, overall it was wonderful. Just know that going to Mexico, you have to be careful, or you will get screwed.

the hotel is very nice. it is a short walk away from a covered pedestrian bridge/overpass that takes you right to the airport! the room decor is pretty new - new furniture, curtains, lamps, bedding, tv, etc. i loved the bright CFL lights in the bathroom - good for putting on makeup. the only negative is that they charge for parking! so we just took our rental car back to the airport early, and then walked back to the room via that pedestrian overpass.

Having just spent a few nights at The Courtyard By Marriott-Lynnwood (which was good) we were pleasantly surprised at how much more we enjoyed this hotel. We moved there for our last night to be near the airport for our morning flight. the service was above average, very friendly. Sometimes it is the little things that really make a big difference. In the early evening the front desk put out fresh baked cookies (three types) which were delicious. We liked the layout of our room better than at the Marriott, the bathroom had usable shelf space for example. They had a breakfast buffet which was kept well stocked at all times. They had a free shuttle which we took to the airport and the driver who was born in Romania could not have been nicer!

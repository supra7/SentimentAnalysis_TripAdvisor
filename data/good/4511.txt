We just spent 10 fabulous days. We originally booked the Kaanapali beach hotel figuring we wouldn't spend much time in our room. I had read all the reviews and was prepared for the sales pitch to upgrade to the Royal Lahaina. We did upgrade and it was a bit more money but worth every penny. I am only sorry that I had prejudged the resort as a sales scheme, it wasn't. The staff seemed genuine and looked for our best enjoyment with a family of four, two teenagers. The garden suite was huge with a full kitchen and two TV's and two bathrooms and great beds. It allowed us our space so no one got on each others nerves even after 10 days 24/7. The stay was worth every penny and all the staff were great, friendly and personal. We will be back again and again!

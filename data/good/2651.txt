Located in the heart of Seattle, the Roosevelt is in easy walking distance of good restaurants, shopping, and the Convention Center. The staff was welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The elevator requires the room key, which was a nice safety feature I appreciated. While the room I stayed in was smaller, it was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Great shower! I would recommend this hotel to some of the newer giants that surround it.

Aloha! My family and I had just returned from an enjoyable vacation at Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. The staff is very friendly and is alway strives to make your stay the best. The environment of the hotel is very relax and chill. If your looking for a five star hotel, this hotel is probably not that you'll be interested in. They empasize that this hotel is the "most Hawaiian hotel," and i agree with them; during my stay I felt that I have learned a lot about the cultural aspect of the Hawaiian traditions. There is an 'Ohana Fun center and guest services where the hotel provides complimentary Hawaiian activities for no cost (activities such as lei making, hula lessons...). My family and I stayed in the sixth floor in the Maui rooms. The view from the balcony was amazing! The view showed the beautiful garden in the court yard, a glimps of the beach as well as the pool (we were able to see whether or not the pool was busy or not). The view east of the hotel room was spectacular---with many beautiful valleys and the garden around the hotel. The first day we arrived, a rainbow was displayed on the east :) Cons: I would say that security in this hotel is not the best. I feel this way because the entire hotel is not connected to each other. So, in order to get to the lobby you would have to walk outside to get there. And anyone from outside can access the elevators. Another negative aspect is the "complimentary" internet access they said they would provided. I thought that the Wi-Fi would be "complimentary" in the lobby, but I was wrong. There is internet access-- if you pay $9.95 per day or use the computers in the lobby and pay per minute. (But then again we are really there to enjoy Maui and relaxation, not to be glued to the computer. )

Great views, high ceilings, vintage charm. Indie bar called the Nightlight? is attached to lobby. Close to everything. I stay here when attending tradeshows or rock shows. Price range is from $39 - $129 depending on whether you want dorm style shared bathroom/private room or all the way up to a multi-room suite. Very clean, would stay here again. Close to great restaurants, Belltown, shopping. Can't say enough good things about this place.

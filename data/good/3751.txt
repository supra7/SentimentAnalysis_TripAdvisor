Stayed here one night on way back from Bloomington and was extremely pleased with all aspects of the stay. It lived up to the reviews! It was a great value (booked through discount travel website). Check in was quick, friendly and simple. Parking was in an adjacent garage; $10/night. Room was spacious and very clean with king size bed, full size couch, desk and chair, flat panel TV. Bathroom was a good size with great water pressure. Bed was very comfortable, air conditioning worked well and elevators were very fast. The maids were very pleasant and said Good Morning in the hallway which is not often the case, in my experience. The hot tub was open to 11 a.m. which was nice for a relaxing dip after dinner. Only downside (and a very minor one) is the location which is not within close walking distance to downtown. Very convenient to get to from the highway, however, which more than makes up for that (Indy is easy to drive in anyway). Will skip a stay in Bloomington next time I visit Indiana University and stay here instead.

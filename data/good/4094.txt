The Hyatt Regency in Maui was a great price for its amenities - great pools and beach access and location. The rooms are a bit outdated but clean. The staff is incredibly helpful and the food at the restaurants were pretty good but not gourmet standards. For the price we got it for, through a Qantas special, it was a steal of a deal. I did see it advertised online for much more than we paid and am not sure I would pay the prices online for it. You would be able to find more modern furnishings and better food at other places close by for the same price.

The Westin is a nice and convenient hotel. Rooms are large, most with good views,, the staff is friendly, and it is conveniently located in the downtown. This was rated as a 4 star hotel, but I saw no difference from the 3 star Sheraton, Crowne Plaza etc. Based upon fellow travelers, opaque site guests will be given rooms across from the elevator and on the lowest floors. There is a big charge for Internet in the room, but you can use the wireless in the lobby for free if you get the daily password from the front desk. Dont bring a car downtown as parking charges everywhere are outrageous. The airport shuttle bus stops downstairs ($10 round trip), but I think you are better off walking two blocks to the light rail located in the basement of Nordstroms ($2.50 and 30 minutes). It is a 5 block walk to the Convention center and 4 blocks to Pikes market. Busses in the central business district (the hotel is on the edge) are free, but this is a good walking city. With a good rate, this is a nice hotel

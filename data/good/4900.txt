We were originally booked at the Hotel Sonya, but they said it was full and we were going to stay at the Hotel Opera. What a nice hotel. We had a huge room (by European standards) and the bathroom was huge too. The room was always immaculate and the a/c worked well. There was always someone at the front desk no matter how late we came in. Breakfast was nice and convenient. The neighborhood felt very safe. There is a grocery store down the street and its a great area for shopping, but the restaurants werent very good and were very touristy. Be sure to go to the opera. I"m not a huge fan but it was a lot of fun!!

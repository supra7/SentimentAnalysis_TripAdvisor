Kaanapali Beach Hotel is our favorite hotel on any island in Hawaii. Services are excellent with a natural aloha from all the staff at KBH. It is close to everything, including the sensational, ongoing show by numerous whales offshore. It was a thrill to see the whales breaching as we relaxed on the beach. We caught a sunset cruise on the catamaran that stopped on the beach at the hotel and encountered sights we had never seen before as the whales rolled and played around the boat.

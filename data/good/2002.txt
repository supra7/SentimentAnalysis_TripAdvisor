I booked this hotel for a quick weekend shopping trip with my sister. The location is fantastic - we walked everywhere in the downtown core. I did check for bedbugs when we got to the room - we didn't find anything. The mattresses were very comfortable, the room was clean if a bit worn. The bathroom was good (water pressure, hot water). EXCEPT the bathroom had no fan. My sister likes to take long, hot showers, so I had to let it air after before going in to do makeup/hair. I found the staff to be pleasant and very helpful. We had just checked out and I realized I had left my iPod in the room. I ran back and they let me back into the room to get it,. Be warned that the parking is expensive. We did park at the hotel for convienence. The hotel self park was $36 a day. if you book, ask for a room away from the elevators as you can hear people getting on and off the elevator. We did book on Hotwire and I was very happy with the property for the price we paid. I'm not sure I would have booked here full price taking into account the price of parking and the slightly worn look of the room. I admit the location can't be beat though.

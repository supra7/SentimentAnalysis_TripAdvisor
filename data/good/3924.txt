It is a very nice hotel! I was very pleased with all kind of services, rooms, food, location! We really enjoyed our stay. The only thing every room has a down bedding, apperently my son is allergic to down or something else was bagging him, so they mooved us to allergy free room no extra charge in the middle of the night, it was very nice of them. We loved to sit in the hotel's restaurant with a beautiful view, take a walk along the water, stop by lots of little stores and restaurants. They have a very inviting hotel with a style, I like that.

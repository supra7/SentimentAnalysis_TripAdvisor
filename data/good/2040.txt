I stayed two nights at the Westin Seattle, and enjoyed my time there. Our room was very nice and had an amazing view from the 38th floor. There were two double beds, and a floor to ceiling window wall. We also had a nine month old, and concierge quickly offered us a crib, which was very considerate. Very nice staff. You can get free internet in the lobby, but not in the room. The pool was just pretty average. Loved the deck though. Was nice for sun bathing! The location was great! Right down the street from the main shopping area. There is also an amazing restaurant right across the street from the hotel. Sorry to say I don't recall the name.. Anyways, had a great stay at the Westin. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

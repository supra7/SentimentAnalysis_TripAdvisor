We stayed here as part of our honeymoon and really enjoyed our stay. The staff are very friendly and helpful with anything you ask for. I believe altho the hotel isnt a fancy 5 star joint that the welcome and atmosphere make up for it. We had an ocean view room and were very pleased with our view overlooking the gardens and ocean. If you want the perfect view of the ocean you need ocean front room though, dont get confused. We did at another hotel ! But at the KBH our room and view was lovely. The room was a little dated but everything was clean and in working order. Our room was right next to the elevator but we did not think the noise from it was even worth mentioning like some poeple have put on here..I guess it depends on how sensitive your hearing is, we coud hear the 'ting' of the bell just about in the background..but it didnt bother us. The Hawaiian entertainemnt every night was fab, we enjoyed it so much we bought a cd, songs of Maui so we can listen to it at home. We had vouchers for breakfast in the Mixed Plate buffet, now this was OK but not great and you would get fed up if you went every day I thikk. BUT what you can do is use your vouchers to upgrade to the Tika Grill where you can have much more choice, we did that a couple of days and it made all the difference. We organised all our trips out thru the hotel but we did it via email with them about 3 months before we went so I would recommend you do that because things get booked out way in advance such as the Maui hike we went on or the Old Lahaina Lau. Anela in the activity centre made all our reservations with us via email and it was all waiting for us with our itenerary when we arrive. Nice touches due to our honeymoon included champagne and a nice card in our room when we arrived, and chocolates the following day. We enjoyed our stay very mcuh and as long as you are not expecting 5 star granduer then you will enjoy it here.

Stayed here for 6 nights for $100/per all in w/breakfast for 2. New, clean and modern design w/ friendly service. Near U and S-bahn stop four stops from main attractions of Berlin. The intersection around the hotel was a little seedy but 2 blocks in any direction leads to nice areas. Good place to stay for those wanting inexpensive, clean accomodations.

We stayed at the Hyatt Regency (HR) in maui in August 2011. Our spacious oceanfront room was on the top floor with a prime view of the pool area, beach, island of Lanai, and amazing sunsets. Our reservation package included daily breakfast (recommended) ... we enjoyed our breakfasts at the Swan Court, looking out onto the mini-lagoon, watching the swans float by, and taking in the ocean breezes. The hotel's location in Ka'anpali was very convenient. Restaurants, shops at Whaler's Village were accessible via shuttle bus or long walk. Main Street restaurants and shops in Lahaina were a 5 minute drive via car/taxi. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. We regretted not having enough time to visit Molokai and would like to return to the HR Maui during whale migration season (January thru April).

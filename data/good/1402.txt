I only stayed at this hotel for one night, but for the short time I was here I really liked it. This hotel was a really close walk to lots of shops and the Pike Place Market. It was a 5 minute walk to the market. I took the recommendations on here and requested the new tower and was really impressed. The rooms were modern with nice furnishings and very clean! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby was very nice and comfortable. I have not one single complaint about this hotel.

The staff at the Westin Seattle make the lack of the little extras that one expects from an 'up market' hotel bearable. Staying for 3 nights for a conference and paying the special staff rate also makes the extra-charges for every thing from using the in-room fridge to store your own food to the $42 a day to park affordable. I wouldn't choose to stay here if I had to pay full price. The staff though, really are exceptional. They have been not only extremely helpful but genuinely smiling & pleasant to talk to. My situation is a bit unusual as I am sharing a room with a conference participant so my hotel billing requests are not run of the mill. When I asked for help sorting that out, along with the last minute confusions that caused my reservation to be cancelled as a no-show, they not only immediately solved the problem but didn't make me feel like an idiot or a nuisance in the process! My experience at other hotels has not always been the same. Bravo for exceptional customer service!

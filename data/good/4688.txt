My husband & I came here for our 10th anniversary and had a very nice stay. For our anniversary, we got complimentary chocolate covered strawberries & a small bottle of champaign. Each night we came back from dinner to find cookies, flowers or some type of mint on our pillow -- simple, but unexpected. We had an ocean front room which was on the 2nd floor. The room was simple but clean & had a decent sized balcony. The hotel's beachfront was one of the best on Kaanapaali beach and thanks to a beach "sidewalk" we could walk to shopping, eating or whatever. If you want the occasional pampering, you can book appointments next door at the luxery hotel thru the reservation desk. All in all, when we come back we will book here again.

We stayed at SM Feb 20 - 27, 2012. Weather was absolutely perfect every day - a bit too windy to play beach volleyball but otherwise, the weather was great. The facilities are excellent and well maintained. We had a swim out room which was really nice. The beach is incredible. You can't find a nicer beach in Mexico. Food was very good. Had dinner at the Japanese restaurant twice. All of the restaurants were very good. Staff were excellent - very helpful and seemed authentically happy to be there. Overall, everything was excellent, but I only give it 4 stars for a pretty good reason - during 4 of our 7 nights at SM, there was a company event being held at the resort. This "Manpower" group occupied 250 rooms (of the 400) which affected everything at the resort - from simply getting a lounger by the pool, or a drink at the bar, everything was very busy by this group. Some of the folks from Manpower were quite demanding on the staff. We generally found the resort to be a night and day difference between the days Manpower occupied the facility and when they were gone. I think when you pay for your own trip at a relatively expensive resort, vs getting it given to you as a reward, creates a different mindset in terms of respecting the experience. It was unfortunate too because we had an amazing 2 nights before Manpower and after Manpower, but during Manpower, it was not so great. I think SM needs to either reconsider having corporate events at the resort, OR at least inform customers during bookings of such situations. I think had we been informed during our booking, we would probably have elected to book at a different time, OR book somewhere else.

We are staying this week 9/23/07 - 9/29/07. My husband, myself, son (17) and daughter (14). We have a suite with a full ocean view. Simply stated...It is beautiful. The hotel setting is so nice. The staff are very personable and professional. We have read alot of reviews about how dated the hotel is and we were a little abrehensive about staying here as there is construction taking place at this time. Yes, there is construction, but we haven't heard much of anything and it hasn't impacted our stay at all. The hotel is a little dated as far as the interior design in the rooms, but it is clean and well kept. We would stay here again without any hesitation. We walked down to Whaler's Village and saw many of the other hotels in this area. Most of the pools and surrounding areas don't seem to be quite as lush. The pool here at the Hyatt is spectular. We personally have not had any problems getting a lounge chair. Maybe because it's not the high season?! The parking can be a little rough finding, but we have been able to find parking everyday. It is not as big a deal as we thought it would be based on some of the reviews. We hope you stay here and enjoy your stay the way we have

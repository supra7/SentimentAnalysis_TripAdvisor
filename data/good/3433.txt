Secrets is a great resort. The food quality and service was very good. The staff is well trained and they truly pay attention to the small details. They performed their duties with competence and more importantly had a pleasant, friendly demeanor. We enjoyed every meal, especially the Bordeaux Restaurant. We have traveled to many all inclusive resorts, and we felt the resort is second to none in regard to food quality and service. Now for the however. I must agree with the previous post by Chestnut. We were also at the resort during the same time, July 18-26. One group was a small convention. They seemed to be a nice group of people, but still a group. The resort states on their website, "a luxurious and romantic setting". This is impossible when people are creating a noise and some commotion, every group does. Would you expect anything less? One wedding group (wedding on July 24) was very disruptive to the "romantic experience". Their presence made me fell as though I was back at my college fraternity, 20 years ago. Hardly romantic. Next time pay more attention to your behavior, you should be ashamed.

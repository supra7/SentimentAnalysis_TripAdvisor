Again after much deliberating and a wonderful stay in Waikiki, we were pretty excited about relaxing in Maui. We had a private shuttle out to KBH where our driver raved about how friendly the place and the staff were and that they'd know our names by the end of day one. We arrived and well, after hearing things like that and just staying at Hotel Renew where the staff were amazing, we were pretty underwhelmed. The staff were just average, nothing special and no they didn't know our names by the end of day two. In saying that, it wasn't a make or break for the holiday! Rooms were older but still spacious and very comfy. Absolutely loved our view - we booked a partial ocean view and the view was a lovely view of the hotel grounds and out to the ocean. You could sleep with the balcony door open at night and the nicest breeze and ocean sounds would come through the door it was lovely. The hotel grounds were actually my favourite part about the hotel, large gardens where you could pull up a chair under a tree and read all day in peace if you wanted too. Food at the hotel restaurant was average and the little food hut near the pool was over priced and quite frankly the food served there was awful. Not to worry though because Whaler's village was the shortest walk away (I was expecting further...maps!) and Cane and Taro had the beeeeeeeeeeest food, we ate there four nights out of our 8 night stay! I hope this review doesn't sound too negative, but wanted to be honest. It was still a really relaxing stay, the hotel grounds impressed me so much all the other stuff didn't bother me much. I would stay here again but with realistic expectations.

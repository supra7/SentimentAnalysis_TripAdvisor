This is a bit out of date as I stayed here in Jan 2005, but I wanted to say that this hotel takes the cake in Seattle. It's everything you'd expect from a W... great decor, trendy bar/restaurants makes you feel like a celebrity, etc. I was here for 4 months and was always pleased with the staff and service. There's nothing bad I can say about the hotel, and if you are looking into staying at a W, you probably already know what to expect and this is pretty standard for a W, but great for Seattle. The only drawback (I guess i did have something bad to say) is that the gym is small. So if you are a business traveler, you'll have to deal with a functional (yet small) gym.

Apart from having to wait 5 hours for our rooms to be ready, we enjoyed our 2 night stay here, as did other Australians I spoke to. We headed off to the Onion Festival just down the path and had an excellent time while waiting. Had a couple of cheaply priced cockails at the bar and our rooms were ready. Mine was just near a garden wedding, so I was aprehensive, but it turned out to be a fantastic wedding and most house guests participated and applauded when the evening ended! I could have retired, the rooms are very well insulated and quiet indeed. Clean and comfortable but the power points did not work in the bathroom so had to make my coffee in the room, NOT the bathroom. Wondered why my camera battery was flat for the "Road to Hana" Trip!!! The grounds are immaculate, constantly being raked and mown and the pool sparkled. Reception was typically on Hawaiian Time, slow, but friendly as were the porters and housekeeping staff. I enjoyed my stay.

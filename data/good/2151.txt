We stayed one night in this hotel before boarding a cruise. I thought the price at the time was a little high $157.15 inc taxes for the Travelodge, but there wasn't much available. The room had 2 queen size beds, free wifi and the bathroom was clean. The breakfast was great with alot of choice to cater everyones needs. It is about a 10 minute walk into the heart of Seattle town. You can see the space needle from the hotel. We found a great pizza restaurant not far from this hotel, which I would highly recommend called Zeek's Pizzas 419 Denny Way. There is a Walgreens located up the street.

Hotel is very modern. We got a nice suite which was very welcoming. I enjoyed my stay very much. Good breakfast. Friendly staff. Useful mobile phone app (you can call the room service from your Iphone, how cool's that?) I liked the hot tub (cool view when it's dark and very very cold). Not so good dinner in their restaurant. The room cleaning threw away some empty shopping bags which weren't supposed to be removed (I had the receipts in them which I still needed). I recommend the parking garage under the hotel next to Crystal (cheaper). I don't recommend the parking lot en-face (the one who runs it is an imbecile) I recommend this hotel.

We stayed in the Molokai wing on the second floor. The toilet/shower area had a sliding door which (as best as I could tell) could not be locked. The door did not slide very well. There was a loose floor tile in the toilet/shower area. The bathroom sink area was large with a large countertop. I could not find an elevator in our building. The stairs were gently sloped, presumably to make it easier to carry up luggage. The air conditioning was central air (not a window unit) as was very quiet. The room was clean. Our room had a balcony with a garden view. The pool was closed for maintenance/repairs during our visit. The pool is much smaller than the pools at adjacent resorts on this strip. The outdoor dining and tiki bar area were nice, providing a very Hawaiian atmosphere. The breakfast buffet was good - plenty of selection and nearly everything I ate was good. Parking was $9 per day. The garage was convenient but most spaces were narrow. The paved trail along the beach connecting the resorts on the strip was nice.

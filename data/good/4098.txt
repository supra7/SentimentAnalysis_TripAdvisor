The hotel overall is fairly nice and the staff is fairly accommodating. But, don't plan on getting a chair at the pool unless you arrive at 6:30am to save your spot. It's insane! When we first arrived we were in a room on the first floor- which smelled like a basement, and felt like one too. After speaking with the front desk- we were switched to a new room. Much better, and had a view. also- the hotel has almost no parking, which forces you into valet, even if you have paid the $25/day resort fee which should include parking. You then have to tip. Some updates would be nice- it's a little old fashioned in style. Everything is overpriced in Maui- expect to pay for a $20 cheeseburger.

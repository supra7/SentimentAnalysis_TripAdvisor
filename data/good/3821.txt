We just returned from EDM and had a wonderful time! My only regret is that our stay was too short and wish it wouldn't have rained several of the days we were there. We stayed in the older section of the hotel and loved it. At first we were given a room on the first floor that was right beside the pool bar area (rm#106). It didn't have much of a view or any privacy. We asked if there was a 2nd floor room available and they had another room ready within an hour or so. We were very pleased with the view and cleanliness of the room. The maid service was wonderful and we especially loved the turn down service with aromatherapy. All the employees are very friendly and go out of their way to accommodate you. We didn't try room service, but we found the food in the restaurants to be very good. However, a few more options on the menu would be nice. We thought the drinks were a bit light on alcohol, but we weren't there to get drunk so it wasn't a big deal. The drink service on the beach was nonexistent at times, but it isn't far to the pool bar so that wasn't a big deal either. As others have said, an outside bar that remained opened in the evening would be nice. We went to Ricks every night and had a great time. There was live music several nights that was really good. We found the drinks there to have more alcohol in them. The only negative thing about our trip was a group of 3 or 4 couples that were extremely loud and obnoxious. It was impossible to relax by the pool or on the balcony if they were around. Not only were they entirely too loud, but had filthy mouths as well. I can only hope they realize this was not the place for them and will find another place more suited to their kind. All in all, we loved everything about the resort and plan to return. It is extremely romantic and the perfect place if you're looking for some R&R.

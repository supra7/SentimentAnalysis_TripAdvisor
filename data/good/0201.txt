The Warwick is a good mid tier hotel, we like the location, the balcony doors open - fresh air, even though a bit noisy with the firehall a few blocks away. Exceptional food and service in the dinning room , breakfast and dinner. Entertainers in the lounge in the evening add to the enjoyment of sharing some fine spirits. Grocery store accross the street and Dahalia's one block waay. for lunch or dinner, fabulous desserts. Pool area could use an upgrade. The front desk staff need to smile a little, it goes along way, take a clue from the food service staff.

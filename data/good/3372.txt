Wonderful resort. If the resort is busy you will struggle to find pool chairs. Just not enough pool room for all the guests. Without this hitch would return in a heartbeat. Service amazing. Food great. Rooms fabulous. Next trip to this area will be more picky about pools. Aggravation to not know if you may or may not get chairs. Otherwise loved it.

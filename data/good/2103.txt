The Westin Hotel features two circular towers which add character to the hotel. The elevators are fast, the concierge helpful (was able to provide a map of running routes), and the rooms are comfortable. The location is supreme. It is walking distance to all the major downtown attractions and the views from the rooms are very nice. I was attending a conference in the Westin and the hotel was spacious enough so that one wouldnt feel crowded. The pool and jacuzzi are nice, however, the gym/fitness area is slightly cramped and without windows. Overall, this is a very nice hotel with very nice amenities. The only things that would prevent it from being ranked as a premier hotel is the slightly aged rooms and the cramped gym/fitness area.

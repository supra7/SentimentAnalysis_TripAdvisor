We've just returned from out third stay at the KBH. We had enjoyed our first visit so much that we decided to be married there! The wonderful spirit of aloha permeates every aspect of this hotel - it is truly a special place. While not a luxury resort, it's the people - management and staff - and the sense of an experience of the authentic Hawai'i which has brought us back. The excellent location, perfect beach, great snorkeling and the feeling that you're family - ohana - all combine to make this hotel unique in our experience.

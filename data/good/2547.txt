My girlfriend and I came here with another couple and shared a room with two double beds. Just on a weekend trip from Vancouver, we spent most of our time wandering the city and found the hotel more than suited our needs. The staff were nice, rooms very clean, and we got an amazing rate by bidding through Priceline. The only downside was expensive secure overnight parking, so I would recommend finding another parkade (I know there's a cheap one at Pike Street/2nd Ave, about a 10 minute walk). Still, two nights plus secure valet hotel parking and all taxes came to a total of US $180 split between the four of us. Amazing. There weren't extra amenities but who needs a pool or gym during a summer weekend in Seattle?! I can't believe some of the negative reviews I've read about this hotel... don't listen to self-entitled whiners, we found this to be an artsy, comfortable, and very adequate hotel for our basic needs.

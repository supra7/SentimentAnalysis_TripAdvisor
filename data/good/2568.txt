I try to avoid chain hotels b/c they are so cookie cutter. Nobody would ever call Hotel Max a cookie cutter hotel. The hotel's best parts spring form its decorative elements. I really appreciated the art throughout the hotel, but the vertical format images that cover all of the doors were a touch of brilliance. They are all different, stunning, and make it impossible to forget what room you are in. I also enjoyed the finishes in the rooms, with flat screens, high concept bathroom fixtures, and the (somewhat) overrated pillow menu. The lobby was nice with smart counter people (all their recommendations were spot on), interesting coffee table books (I know it sounds stupid, but I was traveling in a group and we spent a lot of time chilling in the lobby), and a super business center with two computers with broadband connections hooked up to a printer (leave your laptop at home). The only problem with the hotel is a typical problem in downtown hotels -- the rooms were super small, particularly in the two bed rooms. If you can live with that, then you should stay at Hotel Max. I don't recommend the hotel restaurant for breakfast, but a couple blocks away are Lola (sit down) and Hot Pot (gourmet donuts). So, don't be afraid to take a stroll.

We stayed as Secrets Maroma 2/12 to 2/19. It was a great trip and venue. All of the positives read elsewhere are accurate. Even though tips are included and the staff does receive an extra compenstation, you should be prepared give the waiters at dinner something extra after each meal. The pool waiters a small tip at the end of the week. They all work very hard to please. The resort is adults only however I found many children more cultured than some of the adults around the pool bar. Now I don't think I'am a prude, I like to drink and have a good time, but I don't get LOUD and impose my conversations I everyone around me. I guess thats a redneck thing. If it gets overbearing just move to another sunny area. Here are a few negatives for Management and Apple to address, as I know they read these reviews. Housekeeping, missed 4 of 7 turn downs hence no clean towels, and 1 am cleaning. Upon arrival I had requested 10 am and 7 pm housekeeping service with the building conceirge. Beach area. The beach lounge chair area was never raked and the lounge chairs streightened out. The dirty drink and food debre was never cleaned up until the drink staff reported to work. Most other resorts take great pride in their beach area, not so here. Rooms. Does not lend well to room service, only 1 chair and desk and a built in bench. This was odd. The light fixture in the bathroom mirrior was directly in my face as I was using the sink, so I had to shift to the right while shaving etc. Get rid of the bench and have a small table and 2 chairs to sit and have your AM coffee. In spite of these few issues this resort is well worth the value. We paid via the Apple Square Deal $1500 pp for a package, at that price this is an excellent value and would return in the future. However, at $3000 pp, this property is over priced and more research would be warrented

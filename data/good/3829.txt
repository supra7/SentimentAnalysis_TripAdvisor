I've just come back after a 4-days stay at this hotel, and I am very pleased. Very affordable room tariffs, our room size was good (2 adults and 2 chidlern in a Executive Quad Lux.). Breakfast was continental, simple - but had all you need to start off on a good days sightseeing. Everything was clean, nice and neat. Holland Road can be a bit noisy, seems like a usual route for Emergency Units, so remember your earplugs if you open the windows at night. We were lucky enough to get a room on the garden side, so the noise did not bother us much. Hotel service is good and staff was very friendly and helpful! To all who complain about the room size; (wake up, this is London!), the location, the noise or anything; you always get what you pay for! This is, in my opinion, a very affordable hotel. You get a clean room and bed, breakfast included, few minutes away from many bus stops or the Underground. Also to take into account, is that Holland Park is only a short walk away, with great opportunities and activities for those with younger children. When I go back to London, I will definately concider this hotel again.

The rooms a bit small, but are comfy and homey! The bathrooms are fairly updated. Free wifi is always a plus in my book! They also serve complimentary tea/coffe/hot chocolate in the mornings in the lobby. Yum! It is within walking distance of various locations, but just a tad bit more North on 5th. But with the beautiful scenery to walk around to, doesn't really make a difference! This hotel is pet friendly also. Parking is a bit high though. However, it is valet and you can call down in advance to have them bring up your car in advance so that it's ready for you when you get downstairs.

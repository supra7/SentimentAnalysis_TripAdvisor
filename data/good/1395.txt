Just returned from the Sheraton in Seattle. I am a travel agent (Journeys Around the World) so try out many hotels each year. I was in Seattle for a conference & it is right next door to the Convention Center, which was very convenient. The hotel is very very nice...beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, nice lobby bar (and very popular) & good restaurant (although pricey). Stayed in the "new" tower & the rooms were very nice with new flat screen tv. And with it being Seattle, there was Starbucks coffee in the room (with real creamer, rather than the powdered stuff!). The location of the hotel is great...Nordstroms is just a block away and Pike Street Market just a short stroll! The hotel was perfect for business or pleasure.

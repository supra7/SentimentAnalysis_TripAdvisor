My husband and I stayed at Secrets Dec 16th-24th, 2011. We stayed in building 16 on the 4th floor and the room and view was amazing. Pros - service was fantastic! - rooms are large - food was well presented and offered many different options - nightly shows were very entertaining and we really enjoyed the Rock of Ages Show - entertainment staff were not too pushy Cons (minor) - cleaning of our room was just ok. We only had turndown service twice. Empty beer bottles were still in the room from previous guests and it stayed in our room for 3 days until we discarded it. - privacy on balcony was not great. We had a tub on the balcony and the canvas side walls seperating the balconies was not enough. - prefered club is supposed to guarantee 3 p.m. check in and we waited until almost 4 p.m. for our room. Other than good room location, the club is not worth the extra cost. All in all, the resort was great and I would recommend it. We booked with WestJet Vacations and they use a 3rd party company called Best Day Travel for transfer service. Best Day gets a 1 star. We waited 3 hrs before leaving the airport and they didn't have us on the list for the return transfer. This of course has nothing to do with the hotel. If we go back, we'll take a taxi to the hotel.

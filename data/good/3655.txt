After years of staying up in mid-town i wanted the cozyness of soho, lower east, village for my last trip to NY. Mixed feelings. The hotel was perfectly situated, walking distance to subway, and shopping, restaurants etc. the room was pretty, very trendy decorated. Bed was quite hard. Breakfast was fabulous (really european with french cheeses and pastries from Balthazars). Internet was via terminals in the breakfast nook, or WIFI. However, the room was (and i admit, i read it) extremely small, even though we asked for a corner room (they are bigger). We were with 2. There is no place to put the suitcase, no place to hang anything. no shelf in the bathroom. If you get out of bed, you have to shuffle/squeeze against the wall to get around the bed. All in all, it was ok, because the location was great, the staff friendly, super clean, nicely decorated and fabulous breakfast. just be prepared to be cramped. oh: note to management: the water leaking all over the floor in the shower is a real bummer.

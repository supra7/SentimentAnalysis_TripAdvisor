We have just returned from a 2 week holiday from SMB and will summarise. Hotel very good,staff execellent especially the animation team the beach is good but not great. The food choices good and the standard of cuisine for an All Inclusive is very good indeed. The only big draw back for us was the hotel was absolutely rammed. Two large corporate events were taking place( i think one was at least 200 guests) destroyed the whole ambience of the place.The hotel facilities were stretched to the limit - some days getting a sun lounger by the pool and beach was impossiblie.The wait times in some of the restuarants was 90 mins.Then to cap it all the noice from the mainly American guests was unbelievable, they were whooping and holloring getting p..... by and in the main pool all day everyday and some of the behaviours were disgraceful. If you are looking for a quiet relaxing break then this hotel is not for you- shame really because it is actually a nice hotel. We have been to better in the Indian Ocean and Asia. Paul from Surrey

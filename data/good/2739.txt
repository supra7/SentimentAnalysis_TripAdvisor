I stayed here because it was close to the airport and is in the Hilton family. The bed was SO comfortable!!! The staff was very friendly and definitely went the extra mile. I think I lucked out with staying in the main tower, as this is a huge complex! I got lost trying to find the coin laundry. The laundry area is nice, though. The washers and dryers have timers on them, so that helps. Room service dinner was okay. Not great, but not bad. Love the cookies at check in! I would recommend returning your rental car and riding back to the hotel on the shuttle as parking is expensive.

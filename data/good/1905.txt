I booked this hotel through Hotwire so I wasn't surprised when the room was placed close to the elevator and ice machine. But I did get a good deal relative to the Westin website. The room was nice and clean with all the amenities. I recommend asking for a King bed if you plan on sharing, the 2 beds in the room were only doubles beds which made it a little cozy. The valet service was very good, unlike other Seattle hotels that make you wait a long time to get your car. If you have AT&T cellular service, good luck. I had to go to the lobby to get more then 1 bar. I would recommend the Westin.

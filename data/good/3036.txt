We stayed here before and after our Alaska cruise last summer. At first we were disappointed that our travel agent had placed us in a hotel so far away from downtown, but the place soon won us over. The in-house restaurant, Spencer's, served us our very first meal in Seattle, and it was a lovely introduction to the area's cuisine. Excellent seafood and steaks. The staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. From the front desk to the bartender (what a hoot they were !) everyone seemed genuinely dedicated to making sure our stay was a nice one. Especially nice was the concierge, who with one phone call made reservations and arranged transportation for the Space Needle and the Sky City restaurant. How nice it was to bypass the long lines and head right for the elevator. It seemed to us that this hotel must have been two different hotels at one time. Our room after our cruise was much different than the first. Much larger, but somewhat older. Didn't really matter, though. Both rooms were very clean and appointed with those marvelous Crabtree and Evelyn bath products. I'd recommend this hotel. I'd also recommend trying the 21 Coins (I think that's it) restaurant just down the street. Also know there is a convenience store within easy walking distance. Thanks to the staff for a very nice stay.

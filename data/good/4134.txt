We spent a week at this resort in the end of April. The location and grounds are magnificent. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food at all of the resturants is good but not cheap, but it is inline with what you would expect for Hawaii. Everything is very clean and well kept and the stay was just a pleasure. The only items keeping us from rating this a five is the rooms could use some slight TLC. Some of the wallpaper seams are loose as an example. We had some issues with the TV reception that was fixed but it took a couple of calls. Our biggest negitive is the size of the pools and the associated pool area. Because this facility can hold the number of people that it can, the chairs in both the pool areas are on top off one another. Our group had 500 people as an example, and at the high times for the pool, there were not enough lounge chairs and the ones they had are literly inches apart. This was not a big deal for us because everyone knew each other. But if I was a family visiting and had to be this close to a group of strangers, it would feel like Coney Island. Dont let this stop you from going. It was the only slight negitive that we had in a very positive stay.

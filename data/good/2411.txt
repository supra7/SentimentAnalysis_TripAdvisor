Booking this Hotel months ago then reading all the negative reviews had us concerned about our upcoming stay. We did not experience any of problems (rude staff, dark rooms, etc). Actually we arrived 5 hours before check in. They met us at the front door and offered to take our luggage up the elevator to the registration desk for us. Although we were early their intent was to let us check into our room if it was available at no additional cost. Because it was not ready, they took our luggage and stored it for the day while we toured the city. When we came back for check it the room was still not ready due to a late check out so they upgraded our room so we would not have to wait and also gave us complimentary drink tickets to use at their bar. Room was great and , for the most part clean, but the blinds were very dusty when we opened them.

Boy, I must have really missed something. I got a great rate at the Westin and thought there must be a catch after reading some of the reivews. The room and view was quite fine, staff was good and helpful to us. Did not eat at the hotel...why would I since there are great restaurants right outside the door? Only negative we had was that we had to trudge across the lobby in our robes in order to take the elevator to the pool. But all in all, we had a very nice stay here.

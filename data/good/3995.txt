This is a fine hotel. Location is excellent not too far from Gaslamp and convention center. Staff is professional and friendly. Restaurant and bar are nicely priced and the food is very good. Rooms are spacious, clean and very confortable. Keep in mind this hotel is new, so everything is still shiny. Internet connection is NOT free! My room had a nice view. The hotel overlooks the water and does have a nice swimming pool but no access to the bay..

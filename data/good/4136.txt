After talking with many people who are regular returning guests of this hotel, it made me wonder why am I late to the party! Probably because I thought Maui to be too touristy but have seen the light. We came over from the Big Island and I was pleasantly surprised how beautiful the hotel is and accomodating the employees are to their patrons. We loved swimming in the pools and walking through the lobby to take in the Hawaiian atmosphere. Gorgeous and well kept gardens and trees. We had access to the Regency Club and the food and drink were nicely displayed in comfortable surroundings and people gathered to share their stories which was fun. Karen, Sandy and Spencer helped me with directions for driving to areas we didn't know and had many suggestions for places to visit and restaurants to dine. They went out of their way to make reservations at restaurants and we felt like they were our private concierges and are professional and caring. We ate at Japengo and I had a huge piece of grilled ahi cooked perfectly and my husband had tuna hand roll and sushi with eel. The tuna roll was fabulous but the sushi needed a bit more eel in it. We also ate at Son'Z for dinner and my piece of coffee rubbed filet was delicious and tender and my husbands filet mignon meatballs with pasta was a generous portion. I felt the Diana Ross show tunes for background music was too edgy for this relaxing place and it distracted from the dinning expereince. Service was excellent in both restaurants. One night the room next to ours had a young group that partied most of the night. Finally, I couldn't take the noise any longer and called the front desk who sent security to the room in a short amount of time. The party noise stopped right then and I heard the young men and women apologizing as they walked down the hallway. Good job. I am planning when I can return to this great hotel!

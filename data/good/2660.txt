We had an excellent deal through TravelZoo for our stay at The Roosevelt but their location and attention to service made it an even better deal. The Roosevelt is in an excellent location downtown, near the bus tunnel and walkable to shopping, restaurants, and the Market. They were very flexible about extending the parking hours, which saved us money. Free computer access is in the lobby and business center. The lobby is a pleasant place to rest between shops. Even without a deal their prices are very reasonable for downtown.

The Moore was exactly what we were looking for--low cost but right in downtown Seattle. The across the street parking lot was expensive--about $18/day--but even when you combine the parking with what we paid for our room, it's still less than any other hotel downtown. From where we were we walked everywhere, even to a Mariner's game. The room was clean and small to medium size. Our room had a view of the public market and the Puget Sound. For some reason half the channels on the TV didn't come in very well. I liked the character of an older hotel. We chose the "bathroom down the hall" option and we never had a problem having to wait to get into the shower, etc. If you are looking for luxury, it's not for you. But if you are looking for a reasonable price combined with the perfect location, the Moore is the best you'll find.

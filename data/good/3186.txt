It was our 3rd year wedding anniversary and the first time away from our baby in over 2 years. We booked one romantic night away from the baby and we were up ALL NIGHT because the air vent (rm 918) hit our faces while we were trying to sleep. I tried to turn off the ventilation but the choices were either low or auto. There was no "off". The vent was facing the ceiling but I think the air hit the ceiling in a perfect trajectory towards the bed. Our one night of hopeful sleep backfired and we picked up our child the next day with the same dark circles under our eyes. Other than that, we found the hotel to be beautiful: loved the shower, the pool and we really loved the hot tub.

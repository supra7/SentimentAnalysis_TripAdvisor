Our family of four recently stayed here while my husband attended a business conference. Having just come from a hotel in Carlsbad, our room (Port/Coronado view) seemed very small in comparison. We were pleased to be placed in a room on the top floor and enjoyed the view of the Coronado Bridge. I would like to point out that the "Port" view is rather unsightly, and is actually a view of the Dole trailers below. It might be worth the extra cost to upgrade your room to a include an alternate view. We enjoyed the location, and the walk over the bridge in the evenings to the Gaslamp District. We valet parked the first two nights, then opted for self-parking the last three nights. We went to the breakfast buffet for two mornings of our stay, and as much as we wanted to enjoy it, we did not. The fruit selections seemed rather tasteless, and the bread/pastry selection was dry each morning. Bacon was limp and undercooked. Overall, very disappointing for $24 per person. We also tried the Fox Sports Grill. Beer selection was good, however, the food we ordered was average at best. My children enjoyed the Sweet Things yogurt shoppe near the Starbucks. We did enjoy the proximity to the Gaslamp District.

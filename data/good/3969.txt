This hotel was clean, nicely appointed (although kindof basic), and comfortable. Best of all, it is located on the water and within walking distance to the Gaslamp district. It's also easy to get to Coronado Island from the hotel. We had an awesome view of the waterfront and of the city. We got a really good price through Expedia. Downsides - don't like the charge for the internet and you have to pay for parking (common in a downtown hotel). Our stay was very pleasant, service was excellent, and especially liked having Starbucks right there in the hotel. Also tried the Fox Sports Bar and Grill and found it reasonably priced and very good!

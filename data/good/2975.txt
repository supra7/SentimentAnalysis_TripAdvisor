This hotel is very nicely renovated with a modern bar and beautiful indoor pool in the treed atrium. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are immaculately clean and the beds are extremely comfortable due to the nice linens and down pillows. My only concern was the expensive parking. It will run you $16 per day which I expect in L.A., but not Seattle. Other than that we had a wonderful stay and good food in the restaurant.

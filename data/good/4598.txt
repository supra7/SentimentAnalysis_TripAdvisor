We stayed at the KBH from July 18th-July25th. We requested a room that had been remodeled. We were given a room in the Maui Wing with a partial ocean view. The room was very nice and plenty of room for 2 adults and a child age 14. The view was of the beautiful gardens, pool, and ocean. The staff at the KBH were just wonderful!! Don't miss the welcome breakfast--you will learn alot about all the things to do on the island and have a very nice buffet breakfast. We were very worried about choosing this hotel after reading some negative reviews. After staying at the KHB for 7 nights, we could not have been happier staying there.The staff is just wonderful and do all possible to make your stay very enjoyable. The free hula show and music every night is great. When we return to Maui, and we will, I will be booking my stay at the KBH again!!!!!

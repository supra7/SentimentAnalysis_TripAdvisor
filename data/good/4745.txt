My husband and I stayed at the Maui Eldorado in April. We stayed in the K building, in an ocean view one bedroom suite. We were just blown away. Hours were spend lazing on the lanai, which had sweeping ocean views from across the golf course The unit was huge, spotless and very nicely furnished and outfitted. I have read negative reviews about aged units, but this was not the case with ours We are returning in December this year with our 3 adult children. Can't wait The beach is to die for, the grounds very beautiful Great place for low maintenance people who prefer to cook on their own lanai, and make their own cocktails to enjoy, as opposed to needing a full service resort with $10 poolside drinks

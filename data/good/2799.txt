This was a great hotel. Close to the airport. They provided a shuttle if you do not have a car. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very nice. The swimming pool looked nice but we didn't get the chance to swim. We had dinner in the bar area. It was good and the staff was attentive. Check in and check out was easy and fast. It was a long ackward walk to our room. You go up stairs, down the elevator and thorugh doors. Odd but we made it. Surprisingly since this was close to the airport, we weren't woken up by any airplanes.

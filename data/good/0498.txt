We stayed twice here in July 08, on either side of a trip to Canada, so experienced two rooms - both comfortable, though one was on a noisy corner of the street. Room rate was $134 inc tax per night while we were there. Small kitchen off main room and walk-in wardrobe/luggage room. Tea/coffee/juice and pastries in lobby. Friendly efficient staff here - there was no problem leaving a large case in their luggage room while away for a week. Close to Seattle Centre with the Space Needle about 10 minutes walk. Hotel shuttle follows various itineraries during the day but the hotel is on bus routes 1,2,13 (to/from 3rd Ave downtown)and 15/18 (from Pike Place along 1st). Met Market is a good store 150 yards from hotel and Chutneys is an Indian restaurant that we can recommend almost next door to hotel.

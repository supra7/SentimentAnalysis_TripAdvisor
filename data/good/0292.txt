Located right by the Pike Place Market, the Inn at the Market is a nice quiet boutique hotel. The staff is very helpful. The lobby is small but nice with a fireplace and lots of free newspapers, apples, and coffee in the morning. Great business center. FREE INTERNET. No gym. My room was HUGE but was a little sparsely furnished although the furniture was very nice and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom was huge and well appointed. Excellent towels and bath products. Water pressure was a little low in the shower. Lots of restaurants nearby. Great breakfast at the little coffee shop in the hotel. Ask for a room overlooking the water!

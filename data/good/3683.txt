Stayed for a week on business. The hotel is very clean and has a deal with a massive well equipped gym on floor two, where all guests can use for free. Beats the tiny gyms most hotels have. Top little pub directly across the road serving good food and good beer. Starbucks right next door for a quick brekkie. All in all a very good hotel especially for the business traveller. Only bad point was the air con in my room was not the best but others in my party had no problems with theirs.

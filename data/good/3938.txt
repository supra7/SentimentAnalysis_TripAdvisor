I was on business but accompanied by my husband. We arrived at the hotel mid day. The room type we had booked was not available so they gave us the option to change room types and check in immediately or wait a couple of hours for the room type we requested. We appreciated being given a choice. My husband asked for restaurant reservations, mentioning that it was our 25th wedding anniversary. A few hours later room service arrivesd at our door with a beautiful tray - champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, and sparking water. The hotel staff included a beautiful note of congratulations. We were completely blown away. The rest of our stay was equally impressive. The staff can't do enough for you and no request is too much to ask. We weren't excited about paying $27 per night to park our car so quickly returned it to the car rental company. Although the hotel is at the end of the strip you can be in Gaslamp in 5 minutes. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to others.

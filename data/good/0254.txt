If you want a good modern hotel close to tons of great restaurants, bars and shops in downtown Seattle, the Inn at the Market would be hard to beat. Caveat: we stayed in a room on the courtyard, so our experience may be different from other parts of the hotel. It was a very pleasant, comfortable room. I am a very light sleeper and the hotel did an excellent job of honoring my request for a quiet room away from elevators etc. It is amazing how many hotels fail in what should be essential: the " good night sleep" department. But even though the hotel is virtually in Pike's place market, it was quiet and relaxing. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but found them to be efficient and pleasant. We were only there one night, but I look forward to coming back and trying a cocktail on their rooftop deck! One important note: the hotel reception is tucked in the courtyard of a small upscale shopping complex and the signs are really easy to miss. If you have the right address, you ARE in the right place; just go into the courtyard.

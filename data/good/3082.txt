We had a long layover from 2PM on Sunday till 9AM Monday. The hotel shuttle picked us up and drove us to the hotel. Even though it was close enough to walk, it was easier to take the shuttle since we were dragging suitcases and golf clubs. The hotel rooms were clean and spacious. The sleep number beds were very comfortable. After dropping our bags off, we walked the 10 mins to the light rail, paid $11 for a day pass for both of us and rode to the Westlake drop, which was a 5 minute walk to Pike's Market. The light rail was easy to navigate, very clean, & cheap (compared to $50 cab fare). The next morning we were able to sleep late since we were right across from the airport. Highly recommend the Radisson and the light rail.

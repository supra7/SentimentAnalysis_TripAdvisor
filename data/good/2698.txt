Room Rate was great, room was fantastic view of bay to the west, saw a spectacular sunset over the mountains& bay. Both rooms had a TV, Bathroom real small but functional.Great location short walk to Pike Place Market and all the stores. Was told not to eat at hotel. Many places close for coffee and meals. Would recommend to solo traveler, small for a couple for more than 2 days.

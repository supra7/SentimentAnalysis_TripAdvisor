My wife and I had a nice 2-night stay here over the weekend. We booked at Priceline.com which accepted our offer of $69/night! You can't beat that price. We love the hotel's location. It is very centrally-located. We were able to walk all over downtown to shops, restaurants and Pike Place. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We didn't have any issues during our stay. Our room was in the North Tower and we had a great view. The room was small, but since we didn't have the kids, it wasn't a big deal. The bed was so comfortable... we slept like babies. The double-shower head wasn't that big a deal really, since the water pressure was so low you needed both heads going to rinse off the soap! We also did not have a bathroom fan. Overall, however, the room was comfy. The only real drawback to our stay was the cost of parking our car. $36 a night for hotel guests seemed a little steep, but it is Seattle after all. We would definitely stay here again.

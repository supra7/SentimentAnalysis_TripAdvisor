I traveled to and from Seattle by Amtrak and used the light rail to and from the airport station and the Doubletree courtesy shuttle to and from the hotel. Check-in and check-out were efficient and I like the chocolate chip cookie when checking in (and every day if you ask for one). I spent two nights. My ground floor room was in a low-rise wing with a view into the parking lot (I kept the drapes closed). The room was large, very well appointed, comfortable and had an attractive decor. I was concerned about being beside the parking lot, noise-wise, but it was quiet. I had only one problem -- the TV remote did not work. I complained the next morning and when I returned there was a note under the remote that it had been repaired, but it still didn't work. I don't watch much TV, so it wasn't much of a problem. The price was excellent -- much cheaper than staying downtown in a hotel of comparable quality. I would return.

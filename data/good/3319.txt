Very quickly: beautiful resort,very good food, very solid selection of drinks etc Tipping is looked for by the staff, honestly they are so nice and helpful it is hard not to tip them. 4 nights was plenty, I started to go a little stir crazy, fundamentally I don't like all inclusives but this is as nice as you can do one They said the resort was 96% full while we were there but it did not fell full at all

This is a 1930's era hotel, so the rooms can be very small, but LOCATION,LOCATION,LOCATION! on the corner of 7th Ave and Pine Street, Pacific Place is directly across the street. Nordstroms #1, the flagship store is out the Pine Street door and two blocks to the left. A lot of Seattle is walkable from this hotel, or just a short cab ride. It's also close to the bus and light rail tunnel (under the Nordstrom store) and the rail now goes to SEA-TAC airport. Pike Place Market is about 5 minutes west, and the water front maybe another 5 minutes beyond the market. Seattle is one of my favorite places to go and I stay at The Roosevelt for business. I'd definitely check availability if I was traveling on my own time. I've never had a bad experience here. I only wish they would upgrade the bed linens, and update the room furniture. The style is of the period for when the hotel was built but is wearing out.

My wife and I stayed 4 nights at the Maui Hyatt Regency and loved it. Staff was courteous and helpful, food was very good and the full ocean room view outstanding. The breakfast buffet was one of the best anywhere, and well worth the price. We were able to land a deal of book 3 get 1 night free, and free breakfast buffet. Room was not huge, but adequate for our needs.

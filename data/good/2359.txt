A bit older as far as W's go, but still quite nice. If you are an SPG member, this is the place you want to go. Westin, a few blocks away is horrible and Sheraton is ok, but if you are using points, Sheraton and W are both 10000 points each. W is easily nicer than Sheraton. The vibe is really nice and the elevators are ridiculously fast...why can't all hotels have elevators as fast as this one?

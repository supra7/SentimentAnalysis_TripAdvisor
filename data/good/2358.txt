A quick trip to Seattle brought me to W Seattle. The first impression was after a very delayed flight. I ended up in the hotel lobby super late and was greeted by the sounds of karaoke. Kind of fun but luckily something I couldn't hear in my room. The front desk workers (and all the staff I encountered) were very friendly and helpful. The hallways were a little dark, but the room itself was great. The beds were VERY comfortable and the room had a great window seat. I could have spent all day curled up on the window seat. I also appreciated the Bliss Spa toiletries provided in the bathroom. The location of the W Hotel can't be beat. The hotel is only a few blocks away from Pike Market and close to plenty of shopping and food. Next door to W Hotel, make sure to stop at the Belle Epicurean for early morning pastries. You won't regret it. The only downside was the fact that you had to pay for WiFi services. It seems unnecessary and disappointing these days to have to pay for WiFi at a hotel. Other than the WiFi issue, I completely enjoyed my stay at the W Hotel.

This hotel has beautiful grounds, open atrium, upscale shops, and a terrific pool. I am glad I booked at a deep discount. The service of the employees is only borderline friendly, and when the highlite of the hotel is clean room service, well, that tell you something. Many reviews complain that this hotel has no beach, but if you are out and about, Maui has so many beaches this is no detraction. The pool, ambiance, and grounds are the best part of our visit to this hotel. Prepare to pay $10 just to use a float device. The staff was only borderline friendly and helpful. The front desk is totally about driving hotel revenue, period. There have also been many comments about the parking here, I found out there are actually two parking lots here you can use to avaid the $20 valet fee per day. The largest parking lot is where employees park, go figure? Parking was always full, and congested. The rooms look like the were decorated in the 90's, not bad mind you, just not the most modern, especially for an expensive hyatt. Room staff was top notch, very clean. Would I stay there again? I think there are better options available.

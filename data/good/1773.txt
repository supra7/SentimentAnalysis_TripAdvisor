The Edgewater is a fine hotel built on a pier over the ocean. The magnificent lobby is built like an upscale north coast fishing lodge. That theme is carried into each guest room. We booked on Priceline and stayed Friday & Saturday night while we walked & shopped downtown. The first night we stayed in a city view room and moved the next day to an ocean view room; though the room furnishings are really no different; it was like moving to a different hotel. The ocean view is simply fabulous. Heres my plus/minus assessment of the Edgewater. +Great location on Alaskan Way; a 3 minute walk to the cruise ship terminal, a 5 minute walk to Pikes Market, a 10 minute walk to the Space Needle or a 15 minute walk to the downtown shopping core. +The rooms are heated with the fireplace and the aura is great. +Flat screen TV (37 in the city view rooms and 42 in the ocean view rooms). +2 comfortable easy chairs to sit by the fire in. +A comfy ottoman fashioned out of wool in the shape of a bear. +Great linens, high thread count sheets make for a good sleep. +A teddy bear in every room +Funky modern bathroom with large walk in, dual head showers. +Homey lobby with inviting chairs to enjoy the fireplaces and ocean view. +Very nice fitness facility with 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, a resistance device, and free weights. +A complimentary business centre with 2 computers and a printer. -Parking is expensive, we paid $31 per day including tax.

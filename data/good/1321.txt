I have stayed at the Sheraton Toronto many times and always been happy. The Sheraton Seattle was just as great! I love the lobbies in both Sheratons...both are open and airy and lots of places to sit, use your computer, have a coffee etc. Even though I got a deal through Hotwire, the person receiving me treated me very well and offered me a King size bed without me even having to ask. A special note that I think this hotel is a really good choice for women travelling alone. It is situated right downtown so you can walk everywhere. I even walked around at night and felt very safe. It is close to the Monorail if you want to go to Seattle Center and it is close to all the shops for great shopping!! I just have to say that I find the people in Seattle so friendly. I don't usually travel alone so I really appreciated how much people helped me out. This includes absolutely exceptional Conceirge service.

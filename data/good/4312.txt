My husband and I celebrated our honeymoon on Maui and Kauai. We stayed at the Hyatt's on both islands. The Maui property, I will agree with another comment, is def not as spectacular as the one on Kauai, however, it is still a beautifully maintained property with a friendly staff and fantastic pool! We also found the bed to be VERY VERY comfortable!! Upon our arrival, we were immediately upgraded to a ocean deluxe room. We looked over the ocean and the pool. I will say the view is great, however, the beach wasn't particularly made for swimmiing. If you walked the 40 yards to the Sheraton or Marriott beach, that was a different story. Plenty of space for all beachgoers on all 3 properties. The food, yes, is a bit overpriced. What do you expect? You're in Hawaii at a giant chain resort. That's par for the course. The breakfast buffett (which was included in our package) was wonderful though. Had something different every morning and for lunch ventured to Lahaina or down the path to Whaler's Village (VERY VERY CONVENIENT AND FUN SPOT) to grab something. No big deal at all. Overall, we were very pleased with the Hyatt. But again, once we saw the property on Kauai, it blew the Maui Hyatt away. However, these are 2 different islands with different cultures and "speeds" so it was nice to have a more "hopping" spot and then retreat to the more calm Kauai.

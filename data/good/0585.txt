At the last minute, my boyfriend and I realized that staying downtown on New Years Eve after dining and hearing music was a way good idea. We recalled staying at the Mayflower about 6 months earlier, when we were drawn to its old world charm and vintage surroundings. We got lucky and scored a Queen sized room on the 11th floor, standard, but well-appointed, with space used wisely, affording us a great view of both a lively neighborhood and the skyline. Last time we were there, my bf got an amazing upgrade to suite, and it was the cats meow; huge, tons of windows. Bed is comfy, bathroom is great. Location is several blocks away from Pike Place Market if you are touring, but as a local, I love this place for its romantic atmosphere as well. Highly recommend!

I was in Seattle for a long weekend for pleasure. The hotel is in a very central part of town. Practically everything is walking distance. This is very nice. Although this is mostly a business hotel, I did not feel overwhelmed from the business type of atmosphere. The staff is helpful. The rooms are comfortable, and above average for a typical room at other large hotel chains even if the bathrooms are a bit dated. Ask to be on a higher floor so you can enjoy the lovely Seattle views. I do not have any negatives to say about this hotel. You get what you pay for. Overall, a nice experience. The big plus is location. Being able to walk throughout downtown is very convenient. And after a long day of sightseeing, coming back to a comfortable room with a nice comfy bed is exactly what you will get.

We booked the romance package direct with the hotel this turned out to be great value, we had an ocean view room on the 6th floor, breakfest included, picnic hamper, massage,1 free activity (we went snorking $200 value) and a dinner at the hotel. A rental car was also included (Dollar Car Rentals), this was not so good lots of extra hidden charges we were 15 minutes late bring the car back after 5 days and they charged us an extra days rental, the car was a mustang old dirty and lots of marks, I paid for the prepaid full tank of gas only to find out it was only half full, staff were inflexible and rude ($450 extra over and above free cost from hotel) other than that I'd highly recommend this hotel one last thing beware of the 3:30pm checkin

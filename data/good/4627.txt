KBH is a fun hotel. Staff is VERY friendly but don't be fooled its an old establishment. So if you're looking for luxury you won't find it here... However, I had a wonderful time at this hotel and I would go back because despite the fact that its old, you feel so comfortable here that your room doesn't matter. Believe me, we then went on to stay in Oahu at the HHV (very VERY upper class hotel) and we wished we'd never left KBH! KBH made me feel welcome from the very first day and the staff are wonderful. They made our honeymoon memorable. When we left Maui we were really sad... oh and the beach here is amazing. We went to Big Beach and it didn't even compare to KBH's beach... plus there is black rock right there for snorkeling. Room is very clean... pillows are not so great and bed kind of uncomfortable BUT its hard to complain when you're having such a great time otherwise. Also, they really do everything to get you oriented on your first day. We were able to do all the excursions we wanted and they had all the information and we never once had any problems. I love KBH! I'd go back again and again...and I will because I loved Maui!

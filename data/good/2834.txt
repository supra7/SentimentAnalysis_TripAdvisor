Stayed for 5 days. Location was right across from the airport so noise can carry a bit. Had a room in the tower. Parking can be tough at night when the lot is full. Had to wait for the elevator a few nights during the conventions and a penthouse party one night. Can seem a bit hectic in the lobby when conventions are going on. Free internet on the computers in the cafe/bar area. Room was clean and comfy. Shower pressure was okay. Overall a nice stay and a great value for the price I got. But avoid the common area when there are exhibitors and such. =)

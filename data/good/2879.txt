We stayed here for one night and used the shuttle to and from the airport. When we called from the airport to be picked up, it took a long time for the shuttle to arrive. Every other hotel and parking shuttle drove by before the Hampton Inn. On our early morning return to the airport, we only had to wait a few minutes. The rooms were clean and we didn't notice any airplane noise. The rooms were decorated in the new Hampton style where the closet, desk, and window are along one wall. If someone is sitting at the desk, it is difficult to reach the closet. Also, the windows have shades instead of curtains so you have to choose privacy or having some light. The breakfast seemed skimpier than most other Hamptons.

Our stay was part of a "night on the town" package that included valet parking and a voucher towards a meal at nearby restaurants and as such represented good value - the hotel frequently has such offers on their website. Access is easy and the valet parking convenient. Check-in was very smooth and professional. For an older, downtown, hotel our room wasn't a bad size with separate sitting area apart from the bed space. Decor was generally in good order and both the bed and linens were of high quality. The room was very quiet even though we were only steps from the elevator, and there was no street noise at all. Slight niggles: some nooks and crannies suggested that cleaning hadn't been quite as thorough as one might hope - dust on top of a few less commonly seen horizontal surfaces. The tea/coffee service was incomplete with several choices of sugar and sweetener but no creamer. The bar was packed to the gills on a Saturday evening and we had no chance to try their martini selection. The food vouchers did not include the hotels own restaurant, so we had breakfast elsewhere and had no chance to try the kitchen. All in all a pleasant and comfortable stay, with a particular nod to helpful and professional desk staff.

One thing that I really appreciate about this hotel is that they don't try and pretend that they're something they're not. They call themselves a hotel rather than a resort and we knew what we were getting. We loved our stay here, especially the quick walk to Whaler's Village where a lot of the action was. Upon check in they could not give us a king bed as requested, but we were able to change rooms the next day and that king bed room was wonderful. We watched whales from our balcony and enjoyed relaxing on our ocean view lanai. The staff was always friendly. We did not use the pool or restaurants, but did take an enjoyable whale watching excursion through Trilogy which conveniently left from the beach of the hotel. It was fun to see the variety local craft sellers in the lobby every morning. There was evening entertainment outside at the hotel in the evenings and quite a few people watching it. If you want more contemporary music, Hula Grill at nearby Whaler's Village has live outdoor music too. Considering the value, we would definitely stay here again especially because of the location. The free welcome breakfast the first day was a nice way to start vacation. I've seen other reviews that mention not being able to get the requested bed configuration as happened to us, if Kaanapali Beach Hotel could solve this problem, they would be unbeatable for ambiance, value and location. We enjoyed great service here and enjoyed the Hawaiian atmosphere!

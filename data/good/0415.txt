I had a great 5 night stay at the CP Seattle. I was attending a conference held in the hotel so my choice of lodging was predefined. My wife and infant son accompanied me and we spent a few days traveling in the area when the business was complete. I would recommend the hotel to anyone, it is close to dining, shopping, and tourist attractions. It is also relatively easy to locate and access from the interstate (the downtown one way streets do make it much more difficult than other cities but any hotel downtown will suffer from this). My only complaint would be for the restaurant staff. I spoke with a gentleman at the front of the restaurant (after waiting a number of minutes for him to acknowledge my presence and that of the other guests who were waiting). He then proceed to tell us that he had not seen us although he had looked our direction several times during our wait. He said he was the only one working the floor (roughly 7:00 pm on a Sunday night). He then proceeded to explain that the guests who were already dining were more important for him to attend to than us.

I can't stress enough that our room was SMALL. Apparently there was a larger room available, but it was on the first floor, which we didn't want. I never saw it. so not sure how it would compare to ours. The hotel is very trendy and has a great location. We stayed for free with credit card points so I can't tell you what kind of value it was, but the staff was incredibly accommodating. We arrived from Hawaii very early in the morning and they were able check us in so we could shower and rest up after our red-eye flight - MUCH appreciated. There was a shower room (literally) and a toilet and sink room. They were small but we're not large people so it worked fine. Plus, we were there to see Seattle, not our room. My only minor gripe was there wasn't much of a place for luggage. Overall the rooms were clean and very modern. We enjoyed our stay.

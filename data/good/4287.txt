Stayed here for 7 days with extended family. Being lovers of all things Hyatt, we naturally chose its premier resort in Maui. We were instantly upgraded upon arrival to an ocean front room. The hotel is vast, and towers are quite a way between each other. There are many shops (pricey) in between though, and a reasonable sundries store in both towers. The rooms are lovely. The bed is unbelievable. Having stayed at 50+ hotels in my life, this is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The balcony is nice, and A/C is powerful. Whilst the bathroom is small, the sink is situated outside on a long stone bench which enables lots of storage and ability to use the sink without interrupting someone's bathroom experience. TV selection is also good. The pool is good,but crowded between 10am and 12pm. From then on, it is easy to find a seat, and people start leaving. Late afternoon is a good time. The pool is amazing- the kids loved it. We enjoyed the swim up bar. Whilst the beach at the Hyatt isn't ideal, walking a bit up the beach will get you a nice spot. The service here is exemplary. Any problem and someone will fix it for you with a smile. They are the authority of the area- especially where to eat in Lahaina Town. It is very expensive, but worth it. Try not dining in the hotel itself for it is expensive. It is, by far, the best hotel in Kaanapali- and also the biggest.

You're not on a sprawling resort with 1000 other guests here, where you feel like you could be in a Vegas hotel but on a beach. This resort is "intimate" and quiet, very clean, with manicured grounds and smiling staff. It is easy to navigate, and easy to get a chair/towel/umbrella/drink on the beach. The room we stayed in was appointed with modern amenities ( Ipod docking station, indoor and outdoor shower, mini-fridge, our own pool). The bathroom was also modern and clean, and I love when the closet lights come on when you open the door. Nice little touch. Because of our package, we also recieved champagne and a fruit plate in our room upon arrival. For the most part the breakfast and lunch staff is accomodating and friendly. As far as "all-inclusives" go, breakfast and lunch were good and they had a nice selection of options. Dinner is where things become a problem. Where I'm giving the resort overall a "Very Good", I'm giving dinner a "Very Bad". They try too hard to be "fancy" with dinner when they should just stick to good flavors and good service. The meals are "artfully" arranged on the plate and are meant to look high-end gourment. When in fact the flavors are "off" or bland, and the service was slow. Our best dinner meal by far was when we left the resort to eat at an Uruguayan place in Puerto Morelos. Dinner aside, they offer a nice variety of activities, and we had a lot of fun fishing and playing beach volleyball.

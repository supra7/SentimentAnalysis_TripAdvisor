This is a very nice hotel, good rates, and very convenient. It has first rate rooms, friendly staff, nice grounds. Although you can call the shuttle from the airport, it is just as fast to walk to the light rail station (departure level in the parking structure) and take the elevator to the street level, and walk half a block to the hotel entrance (on International Blvd). Consider this hotel for your downtown business as well by using the light rail (just across the street from the Hilton). $2.50 fare and 30 minutes. This will enable you to skip the car, extremely high parking rates in the city, and much higher hotel ratesthough you lose the charm of being in the city. You will like this hotel. The downside of this hotel is high fees for Internet and parking

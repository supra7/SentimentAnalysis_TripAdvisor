Rome is very, very expensive so finding a value for money hotel is difficult. If you want somewhere that is clean, tidy, with helpful staff then this hotel is a good compromise. The room we had was pretty small with no outside window, but to be honest we weren't on our honeymoon, so spent most time sightseeing! Free sat TV, free notebook & breakfast not bad either.

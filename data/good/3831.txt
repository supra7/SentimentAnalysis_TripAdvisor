I booked last minute through an online site and snapped up a room at a good rate. My objective was simple. See as much as Rome as I can in 3 days (2 nights). Marta, who runs the B&B was very professional, warm and welcoming. Her high standard of service is the reason why I have rated this 4/5 and not 3/5 (which it otherwise would have been). Marta gave me a map and quickly showed me the lay of the land. She accommodated an early check-in and a late check-out when I left. I spent most of my time waking the streets of Rome and visiting the important places and only came back to the B&B when I wanted to sleep. If you want a hotel to be able to lounge around in, this is not it (and quite frankly, for a comparable price, I can't imagine you will find anything). The good stuff: The rooms are clean. I had my own bathroom with clean towels, new soaps and shampoo. The room had air-con (which was essential on a 40 degree Rome day!). The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. The bad stuff: The air-con was loud. Thankfully I had ear-plugs and so I blocked it out. Plus, I was exhausted from touring so I slept through it. Could be a problem if you are a light sleeper. The lighting in the room was insufficient. There was one small globe which barely lit the room enough to see your things (the bathroom light assisted). If you are old, or unfit, you might want to think about staying somewhere closer to the action (by that, I mean somewhere near the Pantheon or Palazzo Navona). If you are active and fit and enjoy walking, this is a great position. All of Rome's attractions are within walking distance. Say, a 20-25 minute brisk walk will get you to most places in Central Rome. I had a great time and a great trip and I recommend this place for the reasons above.

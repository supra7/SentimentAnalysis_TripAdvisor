We picked this hotel as our base camp for the Seattle marathon. The location is great and it's walking distance to the space needle, market, malls and art museum. As an added bonus take the train from Sea-tac airport to the end of the line and it's a 4 block walk to the hotel. The Hotel is a little dated but clean and comfortable but has sauna, pool, hotub and exercise room. The rates are a steal for downtown. We found the staff to be helpful they even ordered pizza from a restaurant down the street for us. (Bambino's it has awesome wood fired pizza) All thing considered I would stay again.

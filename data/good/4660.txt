We stayed at KBH for one night and really loved it.....yes, parts of it are old, but they are upgrading and we were fortunate enought to have our room upgraded at the desk without even asking and without being charged extra. It was a lovely place to stay and a great value. We would recommend it. Good food and super friendly staff that truly enjoys to work there, making this a great atmoshphere. The grounds were perfect to lay out under a huge tree or in the sun. Aloha!

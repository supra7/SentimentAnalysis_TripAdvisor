Very nice design-hotel. rooms are quite small but location is great for restaurants, bars, museums, galleries, shopping.. even breakfast is included - a small but good and healthy breakfast buffet. very friendly and helpful staff. the only thing I did not like: the dirty breakfast tables. I recommend this hotel!

Great little boutique hotel with a serious original art theme (including in the rooms). Very conveniently located. Be sure to get a street-side room or one above the 6th floor because the heating-cooling mechanics are between the back of the hotel and the garage. My room was quite spacious, despite what I've heard from others. Impeccable housekeeping. If you're just drinking plain coffee, the coffee from the in-room brew-pot is better than Starbucks (most hotel in-room coffee is really, really bad). Be sure to check the hotel's own website before booking a room through one of the mega-sites... I saved $10/night off the "best price" plus got FREE valet parking and wi-fi!

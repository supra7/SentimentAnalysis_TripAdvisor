Full disclosure here, I love the W. I love that it's dark and moody, with tonnes of tea lights and my kind of chill music in the lobby and on a cd in the room. I love the Bliss toiletries, and the fact that the staff will give you an extra body butter or two if you ask nicely (one of the main reasons we keep going back actually - can't get enough Bliss products). I love the beds and the high end sheets. Because I love it all so much, I want the W to be great. So it bugs me when the bathroom isn't quite as clean as it could be when we arrive, and that the rooms are starting to look a bit tired with dings in the paint and on the furniture. And it especially bugs me when the concierge service is unfriendly. This is an expensive hotel, so the Whatever, Whenever service really needs to come with a smile. The front desk reception staff are usually pretty nice, as are the valets, housekeeping and other facilities staff, but the concierges could be reminded that they're there for more than looking cool. We go to Seattle a couple of times a year for a shopping/foodie weekend, and I really hope we keep feeling good about choosing the W for our stay. I really want to keep loving it...but there are other choices.

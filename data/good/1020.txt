We bid $79 for this hotel on Priceline so we got a good value for sure. A lot of people complain about the parking charges, but all of the downtown hotels charge for this. You have to factor it into the price. The room was very comfortable and quiet (we had a city view room) and the Aveda toiletries were a nice touch. Our room did have an adjoining door, and as we had kids with us, we checked with the front desk to see if the room was occupied - it was empty, so it made us feel a bit better about the (fairly minor) noise our kids made. The pool has a beautiful view of the city. Kids loved it! . I did like the coffee bar setup they have in the lounge in the morning. Easy way to grab a Starbucks and a light breakfast. The only downside to this property is that it is a fair walk from the downtown core and Pike Place. We usually stay at the Warwick which is not as luxurious, but has a brilliant location. All in all, great value for the price paid!

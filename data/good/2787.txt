PROS: hotel is very close (across street) from airport shuttles run every 20 minutes and are larger busses - no getting squeezed out of the van rooms were clean and well appointed some decent food options just across the street as an alternative to the hotel restaurants (denny's/jack in box/taco bell/and a daves diner) service personel were excellent - front desk/bellmen/housekeeping were all extremely nice and professional. My young son got sick and threw up all over the bathroom (at night) and someone was there almost immediately to help and did a great job cleaning up. IN the morning needed some extra coffee cups and lady picking up sheets took me to get some from a storage on the next hall - out of her way. nice 24 hour fitness center. use of computer stations in lobby free boarding pass printing in lobby CONS: charged a fee for parking - even for guests, adn they had a large parking lot,. I can understand an inner city hotel with a garage or limited space, but not here restaurants were a bit pricey, which is fine for the air crews who frequent the hotel with their expense accounts. free wi-fi only in lobby

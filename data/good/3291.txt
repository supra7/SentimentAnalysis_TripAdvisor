My wife and i stayed here for a week in April, which was perfectly timed. The resort was very active but the weather was perfect and the resort didn't feel restless. Pros: 1. Adults only resort 2. Great service 3. Good food 4. Rooms are well appointed 5. Outstanding beach Cons: 1. There are birds who will bomb you, your food or your chair at breakfast if you eat outside. 2. Sometimes the resort feels like a LOT of concrete (not a lot of scenery). 3. Birds at breakfast. 4. Room service food leaves something to be desired. 5. Those birds at breakfast. Carry a torch or be prepared to dragon kick birds away from your seat. Tips: 1. Don't go for the Preferred Club. You won't miss it. 2. Absolutely go to the evening entertainment. They are hilarious and you will have a blast as long as you keep an open mind. 3. Get a direct transfer from the airport. You paid a sum to get here; spring for the $40 per person to shave a few hours off your commute. 4. The spa is outstanding. Get a massage. 5. The ziplines are a blast. 6. Get to the beach for a chair by 8:30. 7. Travel in April. Perfect weather, fewer crowds and often a discount. I absolutely recommend this place to couples. Especially bird lovers!

I used gray line as my transprotation from the airport to the hotel, that was good and i also used it for my activities. Giovani was the person who helped me from gray line and he was very helpful and gave me all the options that i needed, i would recommend gray line for activities and Giovani as the representative however make sure you check on the prices of the activites at the hotel itself because i found that i would have got some of the activites a lot cheaper from the hotel itself, especially the scupa diving. A bout the hotel itself, the welcoming was very good. the welcome was with cold towels, champagne and very nice and freindly people. one thing to make sure to do is that if you are a honeymooner, make sure you call the hotel before you arrival with a day to make sure that they prepare everything before you come. in my case they didn't and i had to call so many times for me to get my preveliges the second day. Otherwise food is great, nice service. The Japanese restaurant there suck big time. you have to reserve 2 days in advance and if you are late more than 10 mins you are out of the habachi and you are thrown at a table.

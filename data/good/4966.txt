I was very impressed with my recent stay at The Central Park Hotel. The room was clean, light and comfortable. We were also lucky enough to have a small kitchen with coffee and tea. I was also impressed with the staff, who were very helpful, and the security of the car park. This hotel does exactly what is says on the tin. A great place to stay for the budget traveller or businessman who just needs a comfortable bed for the night. Please do though however take care as you would anywhere else in London at night and walk in groups or with friends if possible. Also check direct with the hotel regarding rates as we found it was cheaper to book direct.

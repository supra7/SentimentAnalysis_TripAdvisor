What a nice place, Room was spotless, everything looked and smelled clean. Staff was pleasant and eager to help. Price was great for a downtown hotel, even got free valet parking when we booked online through "bookit.com". Location was great for dinning, shopping or other entertainment. Would easily recommend to others.

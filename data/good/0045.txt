I have nothing but good things to say about the Monaco. We spent 2 night there before we went on an Alaskan cruise. The hotel is a short walk from the Pike St. Market and just a few blocks in the orher direction from the Ferry Terminal. The rooms are clean and spacious and the service is excellent. They have a complimentary wine tasting in the lobby every evening and you can even get a goldfish delivered to your room to keep you company if you like. The Sazarac Restauraunt is located on the first floor. The food and service is decent and they have a nice happy hour with inexpensive appitizers. I would say if you are flying into Seattle don't bother with a rental car. Valet parking at the Monaco is $35 per night. Take a shuttle in from the airport. The city has a good public transportation system, the busses downtown are free, and cabs are easy to find.

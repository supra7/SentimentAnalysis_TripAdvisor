Just got back from 5 nights at Secrets Maroma. Overall stay was very nice. Having stayed at a couple of Sandal's properties before, I must say that this is a notch up in terms of overall quality. It seems that this recently opened resort has the opening "kinks" worked out. In fact, the service was the best I have ever received at an all inclusive resort - EVERYONE wanted to please! The beach is beautiful, food is good/very good (best I've had in an all inclusive resort). Activities were somewhat limited and entertainment a little weak (the singing in the main bar area was hard to take - most nights hearing some otherwise nice tuned totally butchered!). The rooms/suites were very nice, beds very comfortable and rooms well appointed. Pool area was kind of crowded even without the hotel at 100% capacity.

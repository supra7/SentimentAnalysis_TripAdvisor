Stay here for its beach location on Kaanapali Beach. It is very close to Black Rock where there is great snorkelling and rock jumping, and close to Whaler's Village with shops and restaurants. The beach out in front of the hotel is sandy and great for kids and adults alike. Unlike staying at the Sheraton, where the beach is very crowded since Black Rock is a draw for visitors staying elsewhere the beach at the KBH is not crowded at all. The property is well kept. The hula show was great fun. The restaurants on property are pricey and the food is OK. One restaurant is a buffet and the other is a table service outdoor restaurant with a good view of the nightly hula show. There are lots of "free" things at the KBH. You get a complimentary breakfast one day and a nice Kukui nut lei upon your departure. Beach towel rental is free. They charge you for parking and your in room safe of all things. I would stay here again. The staff and grounds plus the location make it great.

My sister and I just returned from a week stay at the Kaanapali Beach hotel and we found it to be a wonderful experience. We were a little apprehensive due to some reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is older and not "plush" by any means but it filled the bill for us. The grounds were well kept and spacious. There is ample shade in the afternoon to sit under the trees to read and enjoy the wonderful weather. The pool is small, but for a family with small children it is great area to spend the day. The beach is incredible. Lots of sand and no rocks and on most days the water is calm- but there is a undertow, so be careful. The best kept secret is the Tiki bar and may I recommend the Mai Tai's!! My sister and I tried quite a few at the various bars and resturants in Whalers Village and by far the ones at our little Tiki bar ranked the best!!! Our plan included the comp breakfast- now it wouldn't win any culinary awards- but it was filling and tasty. The hotel is located a short walking distance from other resturants and shopping in Whalers Village. The staff was friendly and the evening turn down and cookies were a very nice surprise. I would definetly return again to KBH!

Secrets Maroma is a very appealing all-inclusive resort. The rooms are very nice. The beach is one of the best. The food is good. And the staff is friendly. There are many more positives than negatives and definitely one of the better places to vacation in the Mexican Riviera compared to others I've visited. The resort atmosphere is very relaxed which may be the reason for the slow service. The food is a little inconsistent at the Italian restaurant (Portofino) but has the potential to be very good. Himitsu, the Japanese restaurant has a strong Thai flair to the food; however, is always good. The sushi is wonderful and extremely fresh. I would suggest asking for name brands when ordering drinks. And if you want the strength to be adequate, ask for a double. Although we went to relax as our main goal, the resort shuts down very early. By midnight, mostly everyone has disappeared to their rooms. The only bars that remain open are the lobby and "club." However, they close at 1am. If you want some nightlife, you'll need to take a cab to either Cancun or Playa del Carmen...where the partying doesn't stop until 4 or 5 am. Overall, I wonderful experience and a wonderful resort. I would quickly book another trip.

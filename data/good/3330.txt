My husband, son, daughter in law and myself stayed at maroma on fall break last year. I had been reading about the newest Secrets treasure and could not wait to go. We had been to Secrets silverstand and loved it. This was not our favorite by far. There is so much concrete, not the beautiful gardens, lush foliage that we had grown to love. When you arrive and look out over the resort it is very impressive but it has a ultra modern feeling that does not fir the Mexician resorts feeling I love. When you step into the water at the very beginning on the zero entrance pool, Be Careful, the water is only one inch deep and can really be very hot. The restaurants are upstairs in the main lobby and although there is an elevator it can be a very long wait if it is raining. My husband has had knee surgery and those stairs are impossible for him. The restaurants were above average but not fabulous. The resort is very large and sometimes feels like a super cruise ship. Two days we were unable to find any pool chairs at all. The pool manager was extremely nice and had four chairs brought out from storage, however, one of them would only lie down. They bring wonderful food around the pool area and it is very good and quite a nice gesture. The rooms were nice and we loved the disco, helped close it down every night. The resort is very nice, and most people we talked to loved it. Perhaps it is just not the right fit for us. We like the feel of the resorts where you have some trees and ponds and some shade. We are very glad we went, but will not revisit.

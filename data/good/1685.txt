The Edgewater in Seattle is definitely a place I would stay at again. The reviewer who gave it a "poor" rating, must be in another Edgewater hotel in another town. I almost didn't stay there because of some of the things said by that reviewer. I saw no shabby furniture and no mold. Just exceptionally well done decor carrying out a blend of "Upscale cabin in the woods" and a "modern motif." We stayed in the Family City-View suite which is large enought to sleep 2 teenagers and their grandparents. The kids loved the 2 TV's. The bath had none of the standard cookie cutter hotel fixtures. I personally would like to bring my contractor out and redo my bathroom exactly like it. Everything was scrupulously cleaned. As for the restaurant, I only had breakfast; but it was exceptional. The restaurant has a senic view, top notch staff and they serve the best breakfast I have ever had. Try the crab frittatas. It is pricy and has valet parking, which was expensive. But I will stay again.

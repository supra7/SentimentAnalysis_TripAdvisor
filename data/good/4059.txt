We stayed here in November. We were nervous at first because of all the construction...This was the 2nd time we visited this resort. Once again, the stay was awesome. The construction did not bother us much. My only gripe is a HUGE one. The hotel should have taken the money used to renovate an already beautiful lobby and spent the money to re-do the parking lot. The lot is unsecure with VERY small parking spaces. The last night we were there, someone hit our rental car and busted the tail light. Anyone can park there regardless of whether or not they are staying at the hotel. We called the hotel security and he was very unsymathetic to what happened. Said we could fill out a hit and run police report but that was all they could do...I thought at least they could have given us some sort of credit to offset our bill. It was a terrible way to end our visit to Maui. One day we had to crawl thru the passenger side in order to get into the drivers seat. We also saw many non-hotel visitors at the pool over the weekend. It's a shame that paying customers have to fight for parking and a place at the pool. Overall great stay, but the parking put a sour taste in our mouth...even though it's a beautiful resort, probably won't be back.

My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights during our honeymoon. Seattle is not necessarily to our liking, but this hotel was very nice and was within walking distance of Pike's Place and the waterfront. The room's are a bit trendy for us; we're more steak and potatoes kinda people, but the bed was super comfy. There was a big convention going on during our stay and I get the feeling this hotel is geared more for business travelers than leisure travelers, but the staff was very friendly.

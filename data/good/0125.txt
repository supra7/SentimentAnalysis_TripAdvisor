Great location, walking distance to everything (except the sports fields and the Space Needle but this is a nicer area of town anyway), across street from Seattle's new library. Unique room decor - funky, colorful, assorted patterns, but fun and very comfortable. Aveda toiletries, spacious bathroom counter with room for all your personal stuff. Friendly staff. Parking expensive at $27/day + tips. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent at $8-$11, nearly 1/2 what the W Hotel's restaurant across the street was charging. Room 420 was not a suite but was quite roomy and had everything you'd need. Fitness room has Precor bikes, a treadmill, stair stepper, and free weights - ask for headphones at the front desk before you go down there if you want to hear the TVs mounted at each station. Tulio, a Seattle favorite restaurant, is one block away --try the sweet potato gnocchi for an appetizer and the risotto - both excellent, as was the grilled lamb. Not cheap though - about $100 for 2 with 1/2 bottle wine. This was my first experience booking through Hotwire so was worried we'd get one of the worst rooms, but it was as nice as any I think, except maybe the suites. We paid $130 (Hotwire 4-star rating). If you don't like the big chain hotels, this is an excellent alternative.

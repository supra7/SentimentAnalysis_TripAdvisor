You really can't beat the Hilton heavenly beds and pillows for a good nights sleep. The interior lobby of this hotel is large, open and airy and it is ideally located right beside the convention centre, connected by a unique pedestrian bridge to Petco Centre and the Gaslamp Quarter, right on the Bay. There are even several geocaches hidden within a five minute stroll! The only downsides....rooms a bit small but view from the 30th floor was beautiful through the large clean window, bathroom was plain but spotless, but I sorely missed having free wifi in the rooms. This is an expensive hotel, and charging a steep fee for basic Internet access is unacceptable. Limit the data use per room if you must, but provide a basic free access so patrons can Skype with their families before bed and check their email. Being a member of the Hilton Honours program doesn't even get you free access except in the lobby area, where you need to enter a complicated numerical code each day you connect. A hotel of this quality needs to provide this as a basic service to all guests. Lose the free newspaper and ice machines to cover the cost of in-room access. Competitive hotels are already there.

My husband & I just returned from 2 weeks at SMB, this being our 6th visit to the Secrets Resorts. We are seasoned travellers of the Caribbean for the last 20 years, with Secrets being our favorite. However, during our stay at this hotel, there were 7 large conventions--one as large as 273 delegates. These large convention crowds monopolized the pool, bars & restaurants & by their very nature changed the atmosphere of this "Exclusive Couples Resort". We are so disappointed with this, that we may consider other resorts instead of Secrets. The complex is beautiful. The beach is gorgeous & one of the best in Mexico. The staff was extremely friendly, & went out of their way to help you in any way they could. The food is good & plenty of choices for every meal. The wait staff in all of the restaurants were good. A few that stand out & in our book are top notch are Antonio & Freddy in the Seaside Cafe as well as the hostess Fatima. The bar service around the beach & pool was always very good. Our Concierge, Vianney was always ready to help in any way. We would caution those seeking a romantic couples getaway, that they may be disappointed with this hotel. Before booking in the future, my husband & I will be contacting the hotel to verify if they cater to conventions.

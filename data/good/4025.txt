The hotel is very impressive and grand with it's open lobby. Great location, food was very good and all around service was excellent. The only minor negative was that the room we stayed in was showing it's age with some wear and tear, however it was kept very clean by the staff. Typically areas around the pool are packed by mid morning and instead of fighting the crowd, we opted to renting beach chairs for $5 a day. The beach only had a handful of people on it and you could listen to the surf and watch the whales with your toes in the sand. That beats laying around a pool anyday! I would also advise on making a couple trips into Lahaina for shopping and experiencing some of the great places to eat. While you're there you have to have some Hawaiian shaved ice - it was amazing. Driving the road to Hana was beautiful but plan it taking the entire day. Leave the resort by mid morning or it will get too dark to see all the beauty of your drive. Also make sure to stop and grab your picnic lunch and have some extra water on hand as there literally isn't much along the entire route.

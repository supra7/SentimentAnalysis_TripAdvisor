The hotel is somewhat dated but the rooms are very nice and recently remodeled with new furniture, carpet and bedding. The beds have duvet covers and are very clean. Bathrooms were also part of the remodel with granite countertops and new tile and fixtures. I stayed here for two weeks and got to know the hotel very well. The airport side of the hotel is very loud with aircraft noise throughout the night, I had to change to an inside room to get some sleep. The lobby is very dated and needs to be remodeled. Parking is a real problem, the room key does not allow you access out of the parking lot, so every person must stop at the attendant which causes a huge backup at peak times ($14 for this horrible service). The VIP lounge is nice and the staff is very friendly. The inside pool is heated and huge, nice exercise facility. My two week experience was nice, this would be a great hotel if Marriott would spend some money to update the lobby, bar, restaurant and parking access using a card reader.

I stayed here for two days and one night for a conference. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are beautiful and modern. The location is right on the bay within easy walking distance of the Gaslamp District. Check-in was easy and the staff were very friendly and professional. The rest of the staff I encountered were also very friendly and accommodating. We were provided breakfast and lunch because of the conference and although the food was gorgeously presented, it was sub-par and not very tasty. I know that the hotel had to feed over 600 people at one time which is quite a feat, but the service was choatic and the food was just not very good. The room was a little disappointing because it was small and really nothing special. After spending time in the lobby and conference areas, I was expecting a stellar room, but it was just a nicely decorated, average, hotel room. I felt it was very similar to a Holiday Inn Express room. The bed was very comfortable though. One of my coworkers had a corner view room with two large windows. Although her room was just as small, the view made that room much nicer than the one I was in. I would probably stay here again if the price was right. The service couldn't have been better, the common areas were beautiful, and the location is excellent. However, I was disappointed in the food and the room.

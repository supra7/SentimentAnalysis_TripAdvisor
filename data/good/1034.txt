Stayed here in late September. Nice location, located on top of the hill which gives it great views, especially from the fitness center, 28th floor pool & concierge lounge. Rooms were clean and beds were very comfortable. Parking was a bit expensive ($30.00 for garage parking) otherwise a nice stay.

We stayed at this hotel after a flight from London. The hotel is conveniently close to the airport. We were given a cookie in a bag when we checked in! The rooms were a good size with 2 large beds. There is an outside swimming pool and tub. All in all a very comfortable place and good start to our holiday with an excellent breakfast.

Our 2nd trip to Maui April of 2010. Since we had a positive time in April of 2009 (celebrating our 30th Anniversary) at The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel; we decided to return to the same hotel to celebrate our 31st Anniversary. The staff was very accommodating in helping us book our Luau, Dinner cruise, and our trip to Hana. Our room was very clean & nice and overlooked the gardens & ocean. The buffet brunch offered with our room was awesome! The grounds were very manicured, plus the smell of the Plumeria trees and listening to the ocean waves made our trip very enjoyable. We especially enjoyed our walks on the beach /and the boardwalk/and the great drinks at the TIKI Bar. The hotel staff were very genuine and made us feel a part of their Hawaiian family for the week we stayed in Maui while trying to see & do different things than the last tear visit. What a great way to celebrate our anniversary and relax!

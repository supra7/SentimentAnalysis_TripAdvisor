This hotel was our first stop on our trip through Europe. The hotel is a little bit out of central Rome, so you get to see Italians more than tourists when walking around here! There is a great roundabout up the road at the Re di Roma station up the road with tons of food as well as a decent supermarket to stock up! The Metro train station can get you in to the city of Rome no problem, and tickets are quite cheap. The trains come very often as well, so there's no worry about times to get into the city! Our room was on the first floor, and looked out to... a fire station!!! You'd think it would be horrible, but we never heard a peep from them! The hotel looks very good, but is very shoddily made... The trimming was falling apart, the ceiling in our room had dirt all over it, the shower was mouldy... It is a good deal for money, but don't come to this hotel if you're looking for perfection! The staff were generally good, but we did have a few who looked at us like idiots every time we spoke to them. I would stay there again, but only for the money value!! Oh, and the delicious breakfast!!

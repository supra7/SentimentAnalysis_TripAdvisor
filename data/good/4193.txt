I've stayed at the Hyatt twice over the last five years. The first time, we really enjoyed the amenities (the place is huge), delicious sushi menu at the lobby bar, huge pool, and lovely location on Kaanapali beach. This time around, we enjoyed the property but ran into a few snags that I think need fixing in the short term. Otherwise, I can see this property going downhill. (1) the high-end restaurant and lobby bar with the great sushi is closed. They have a pretty good restaurant by the pool, but who wants to sit there for any special dinner? We're told the restaurant will re-open in 9 months, but, as we were told, "but, then again, you know how these things go." (2) the valet accidentally gave our rental car to another guest, who took off with it for the day. I realize that many rental cars look alike, but this should never happen. Worse, we had to rent another car for the day and a manager promised that we would be reimbursed for that cost. After nearly a month of promises on the phone and email, it took a call to the manager's manager to finally hear that they were processing the refund. Food and service are very important to me when I travel and I'm concerned that the Hyatt needs to work on both of these.

I've seen some reviews on here and while some points are valid some seem quite exaggerated. Great location, great helpful staff, comfy bed, bathroom only had a shower and it was a tight fit in there but the room itself.. while it wasn't spacious it was more than adequate. Two of us fit in a queen room with no problem. Good value for the location.

Stayed one night here after dropping off our daughter at SeaTac. Yes, this property is a little bit older but we felt that it had been kept up very well. Our room was nicely appointed, the bedding was sooooo comfortable (loved the duvet). We had absolutely no complaints. The pool atrium area was awesome. Lots of real foliage and very bright. We enjoyed our swim in the warm water and time in the hot tub. Would definitely stay here again.

My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon at Secrets yesterday. We only had one complaint, but I will start with the positive. We absolutely LOVED the resort. The staff, atmosphere, beach, spa, rooms, and other guests were very friendly. I felt very safe and comfortable the entire time. We had a swim out pool attached to our room which I would highly recommend if you like a little privacy. We shared the pool with 6 or other so rooms, but we seemed to be the only ones to use it which worked out perfectly for us. Our room was clean and comfortable and we really enjoyed the nightly turn down service as it made the room very romantic. The downside. The food was very so so. Like another reviewer said, everything started to taste the same after a day or so. I LOVE to eat all the time and even I found myself nervous about dinner. Just the thought of certain foods they serve still makes me queasy. I recommend if you stay here, just eat the cheeseburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, fries, hash browns, and fried rice, all of which are really good. Also, the fruity fun drinks seemed to be made with water downed alcohol. The cream based drinks, i.e. pina colada, made both my husband and I a little sick and it wasnt due to the booze! Secrets does have Bud Light which seemed to go down way easier. All in all, i would absolutely stay here again. I recommend staying in the Preferred Club area if you can. We stayed in the regular rooms, but we heard the Preferred Club had a few more options available to guests.

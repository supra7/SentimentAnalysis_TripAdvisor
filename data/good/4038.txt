My partner and I loved our stay at the Hyatt. It is a great resort for families or couples. The location was really good, there was good shopping nearby, and it was a short drive to get to other key places on the Island. While the Hyatt beach isnt very good or swimmable  all you have to do is walk along the beach for a few metres and you will find a much better swimming area. We stayed in a secluded and quiet area in Kauai, so we were happy to see that the Hyatt was in a much busier location in Maui surrounded by plenty of restaurants, at the same time it was a short drive to more secluded quiet beaches/areas. Our room was nice and modern, spacious and clean. The only negative was the bathroom, Im really picky about bathrooms and I hate when 4 or 5 start luxury resorts have the shower over the bath and a plastic shower curtain! The Service was good and efficient. The Hyatt grounds are superb, it is like a zoo, there is wildlife everywhere including penguins and parrots that talk! One day a monk seal flopped itself down for the day on the Hyatt beach, that was amazing to see. The pool area is huge and has a swim up bar which is always a cool feature. We attended the Hyatts drums of the Pacific Luau and I would not recommend it. It is far too expensive for what you get. The food is cheap buffet food and while the performances are ok, it is definitely not worth the amount you pay. For half the price you could go to another Luau which would probably be of the same quality. One activity I definitely recommend doing is hiring a car and driving the road to Hana. This was my favourite part of our whole trip to Hawaii  it is absolutely spectacular and the seven sacred pools at the end is well worth the sometimes hair raising drive! Maui was our favourite of the 3 islands we visited, the island is just wonderful!

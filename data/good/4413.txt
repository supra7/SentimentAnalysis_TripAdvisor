I wasn't very impressed with the lobby of this hotel, it was hot and looked outdated (mailboxes and world clocks!) but once we headed up to our room, I was pleasantly surprised! The hotel is older, and therefore, the rooms are larger! We were happy to find queen sized beds in the room (as opposed to the full size ones in Waikiki). The patio is really large - and pretty much all the rooms in the main building have ocean views - across the whale-shaped pool. The location is nice, the room was comfortable, and it was perfect for the amount of time we spent in it. I enjoyed the laid-back atmosphere here too. We rented snorkels and fins from the beach desk for $8/hour and saw sea turtles right off the black rock point. Would definitely say to try that while you're here! We blew a fuse in the room and maintenance was really quick to come and fix it for us, with a smile!

The property was great, centrally located and walking distance to the light rail and Pike Place Market. We had a ton of great restaurants in the area to choose from. The room was a good size, had a pillow and spiritual texts menu. The bathroom was a little small but had a tub and a shower, separate water closet. The electronic key card was of Nirvana and the decor in the hotel was modern. I enjoyed the stay and would stay again next time in Seattle.

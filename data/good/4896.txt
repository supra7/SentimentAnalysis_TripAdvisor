We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Opera Rome very much, we preferred the second room that we were allocated upon our return - we had a split booking 2 days and 3 days. The second room had more space and a larger bathroom too. Nice breakfast, excellent coffee and very friendly staff. The only thing we noticed was the noise level in the breakfast room by the staff clearing away crockery. Other than this, it is an ideally located hotel and very good value for money. I was impressed by the internet service available and the loan of a notebook for our use in the room. I would recommend this hotel and would use it again when we next visit the very beautiful city of Rome.

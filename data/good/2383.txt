I have to agree on the Fiji five-dollar water. I was thirsty, ready to drink it thinking it was free, and it said five bucks on it! Now, come on, wouldn't that be a nice gesture to greet a guest after they've checked in! Now, there is water in the lobby laced with cucumbers and such during the day, and free coffee in the morning, but they don't tell you about it when you check in. The valet guys are sooo funny! Also, the bar could use some help as far as attitude and service. I didn't mind it being dark. I mean, we women over the age of.....don't mind the darkness! Oh, you have to go to the Palomino for happy hour. It starts at three and goes all night. It's on 5th and Union, I believe in the City Centre up the escalator. YUMMY! And the price was so right. They have flatbread pizzas and regular thin crust pizzas for six and eigh bucks. Then, we ordered a side of meatballs that were so delicious and put them on the pizza. I want to return just to go to that place! Can't beat the price. Oh, yes, the W....internet is not free, but we enjoyed the lobby to go on the computer. It was a business trip for my husband and I tagged along, so the parking was reimbursed but it would bother me if I had to pay out of pocket. Yes, very expensive to park anywhere in Seattle. I hated that bedspread. It was so thick! I had to take it off the bed. Who ordrers these things? Overall, I liked the place and would stay there again. The gym is very nice, but two of the treadmills wouldn't turn on when it said to touch the screen.

Great Experience We originally went into our reservation a bit wary due to past reviews on this hotel. However, our stay was quite enjoyable. For such a low rate, the room was comfortable. They used high quality bath products and the air conditioner was fantastic. The location was less than a block away from a bus stop to ride into downtown Seattle. Some points of improvement: the TV channel selection was quite limited; the breakfast was mediocre at best. However, there is an espresso shop just down the block. Overall, we were pleased with the value and would definitely stay here again.

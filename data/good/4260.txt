We loved the Hyatt Regency!! 8 days-WOW! We were there on our honeymoon. It was spring-break times so lots of children and teens around. Very clean rooms, good service. Loved the parrots and penguins in the lobby area took lots of pictures. Valet was $20/per day, but you can self park a few steps away. Hyatt charges a $15/per day resort fee for the gym. So we used it everyday. Gym was very nice and clean (TV monitors on cardio) they provide headphones. My suggestion go early 6-7 am less people. After you workout walk down the boardwalk about 10 mins-There's a McDonalds Express in Whaler's Village-Great inexpensive breakfast. Or try Mixed Plate $15.00/per all you can eat. We did both. Save money especially if you plan on doing activites they can be pricey$$$ We spent over 1000.00 on activities. When you leave go to Walmart to get 3.00 T-shirts postcards, candy to take home. Walmart located by airport Dairy Rd- behind the Panda Express. Overall the Hyatt Regency Hotel & Spa was great~ If your charging anything to your room make sure you get a printout during your stay to be sure your charges are correct. We were overcharged for room~we prepaid~ But it was corrected. Staff was friendly at check-in & check-out.

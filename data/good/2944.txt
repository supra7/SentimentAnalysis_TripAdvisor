Stayed one night b/c arrived late at Sea Tac Airport. Shuttle very convenient (courtesy phone located at ground transport at airport if you don't see van). Hotel has Pacific Northwest theme. Staff (from shuttle driver to front desk) very friendly. Used Marriott reward points for 1 King room. Very small. If you look on floorplan on back of door, there are just a few of these smaller rooms on each floor - book 2 queens for more room or ask for larger King room. Also, we had interior courtyard view (overlooking indoor pool - no natural light). Fine for one night, but would have been bummed if more than that. Room was clean and looked newly refurbished. Had breakfast at on-site restaurant next day. Pricey, but lots of choices, inc breakfast buffet. Also coffee bar w/pastries, muffins open in am. Took shuttle back to airport in morning to rent car for week-end - so we avoided paying for parking at the hotel which is expensive. As we drove back to airport next day, noticed that Marriott Sea Tac seems like one of nicest options on airport strip of typical chain hotels.

On paper, there are better hotels around, but the friendliness of the staff has made this my personal favorite for longer stays in Seattle. The view of the sea and the market from some of the balconies is terrific. The location is good but it's still quiet. I'm quite picky and I've never had any complaint about the staff or the room here. Ask for your favorite room numbers because the rooms are all a little different. That's it's charm. The lobby's kind of small, so I don't recommend it for meetings!

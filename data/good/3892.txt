The hotel is only three years oild and is ideally located next to the convention center and the popular Gaslamp District which is accessed by crossing a bridge directly from the hotel. The hotel has an excellent breakfast buffet, and the wait and bar staff are very good. Erin, Travis,Jennifer, Melanie among others. Also helpful Concierge and greeting staff. Oddly our room was not serviced twice during our stay for which management apologized. We stayed a week. Bay view wonderful.

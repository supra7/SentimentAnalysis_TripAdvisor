We stayed here on the recommendation of my mother who stayed here a good 20 or so years before us - and we were very happy. I didn't want budget accommodation and I was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect the Hilton or the Sheraton but in terms of value for money - I really enjoyed it. You are on the end of the beach/chain of restaurants, which means you aren't in the hive of activity - which is either a good thing or a bad thing. We spent our evenings hopping from one restaurant bar to the next with a five year old in tow. The beach at the time was too rough for my daughter to swim, so we spent a lot of time in the pool. The "kids club" was great - I only have one child (a daughter) and it isn't a club that you drop your kid off and see them at the end of the day. You participate with them, creating lei's, learning dances, etc - which builds on the whole holiday experience. We had great fun together, which I think is the whole purpose of a holiday. If you are looking for value for money, having fun with your kids while still having adult fun - this is it. It needs to be said that our room overlooked the beach!!!

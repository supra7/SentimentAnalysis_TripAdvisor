We used this hotel 3 separate times during a recent vacation and found it meets all our needs. Reasonably priced for SeaTac. Clean. Compimentary full breakfast was way better than most. Staff was friendly. Shuttle to airport was timely. Just 50 yards from the Enterprise car rental drop-off. Only negatives were being on the south end of the airport runway, therefore some noise, and the elevator (only 1) is at the end of the hallway away from the desk.

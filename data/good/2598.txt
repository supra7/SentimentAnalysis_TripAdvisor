My husband and I live in Portland, OR and frequently travel to Seattle as a weekend getaway. We have stayed an numerous hotels, and I would venture to say that the Hotel Max is definitely the best deal for the money. We bought the all-inclusive package for 1 night plus free valet parking & breakfast voucher and everything was excellent. The hotel is very artistically decorated and is every bit as unique & modern as they boast on their website. The beds are amazingly comfortable & the room was very clean. We went with the Artist King Room, and had plenty of space. If you are looking for a downtown Seattle hotel with basic amenities, swanky decor, a great bar & restuarant and want to stay away from mobs of parents and kids looking for the pool & buffet, this is your place.

This was a fantastic resort that gave everything it promised - a romantic, relaxing setting with good food and a beautiful location that was perfect for a much needed vacation! The food was good, as was the service. I loved the small size of the resort - it never felt crowded, you could find quiet when you wanted it and there was a lot of privacy. My only complaint was that the people staying above our room left their jacuzzi tub running and fell asleep (I'm assuming they were drunk), resulting in a flood. We were awoken at 12:30 a.m. with water dripping from the ceiling onto our pillows and my boyfriend's head, and discovered it was also flowing down the walls. The staff arrived within a 10 minutes of our call and after some assessment gave us a different room to sleep in for the night because our bed was directly under the leak. Unfortunately, the AC in the new room wasn't working, and between that and the commotion of having people come in to photograph the damage and us switching rooms in the middle of the night, neither of us really slept that night. Other than a brief apology during the move, we didn't receive much of an apology for the inconvenience - I thought more could have been done to make it right, given that we lost a night of sleep (and sleep is important when you're on vacation!) and a night in our room as a result of this. We aren't the types to complain or demand extras, but at least an apology the next morning from the management would have been in order. Aside from this problem with customer service, I was impressed with the place, but the incident did lower my overall impression.

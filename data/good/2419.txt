This hotel is really nicely located in Seattle. You can walk to all shopping areas and to the Piers from here. Ask for the superior rooms. They are very nice and nice view. Don't go there if you want to relax or if you are looking for a quiet spot. It is a very busy area and the hotel itself attracts a lot of people and very active bar scene.

We just returned from the Hyatt Maui and really enjoyed it. Told the front desk we were celebrating our anniversary, which we were, and ended up in an oceanfront room instead of the ocean view that we booked. Paid a little extra for the Regency club which saved us a bunch of money on meals. Continental breakfast was very good, cookies in the afternoon and good appetizers from 5-7pm along with soft drinks, beer and wine. The Spa was wonderful, the pool was great but skip the restaurants. Very average with high prices. Book the Kiely Catamaran for a good time, good munchies and nice crew. They leave right from the hotel. Watched whales from our balcony which was magnificent. Only complaint is that the Queen sized beds are full sized and the mattresses are extremely soft. Could present a problem for someone with back problems. They have a locker room with showers if you have to check out but don't leave until late night. We had dinner, went back and grabbed showers before leaving at 10 pm on our flight. It is an extra day without the charges. Would go back in a heartbeat!

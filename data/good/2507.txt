My husband and I stayed here for one night on 8/4/11 while we were in town for a wedding. We chose Hotel Max because of the location, the price, and the reviews. We prepaid for our room, which gave us a discount. It was $200. I've read other reviews which quoted prices much lower than that, so I guess we just chose an expensive time or something. Check in was fine. The elevators were a nightmare. We didn't figure out until the second or third trip in it that you don't push the buttons for your floor, you put your room key in. And that doesn't always work, either. So we spent some time going up and down aimlessly. The room was just fine and what I was expecting. People had said they were small, which they were, but it didn't bother me. I'm just sleeping there, not moving in! In other reviews, people complained quite frequently about the smallness of the bathroom, and again, while certainly not palatial by any stretch of the imagination, were just fine. My knees did not bump into anything, and I'm 5'9". They had nice marble floors and a bathtub and a enough space for my toiletries. What else do you need? The bed and sheets were great! No problems there. There was a flat screen TV as advertised. For what we were paying, there really should have been free wifi. I'd say that and the elevator are the only real "needs improvement" areas. Overall, I was pleased with my stay and should I ever need a place to stay in Seattle again I just may find myself at Hotel Max again!

I stayed there this past weekend. We were in a superior suite with a king size bed. The room was great. The room had lots of space, the washroom with a soaker tub and rainfall shower head, well stocked kitchenette, spacious bedroom, cozy living room. Before I went one complaint I read about was the noise from outside. We were on the fourth floor and yes you could hear traffic and emergency vehicles, the windows were definitely not sound proof. Growing up in the city, these noises didn't bother us and easily became background noise and didn't bother us from sleeping soundly. If you are a very light sleeper and outside noise bothers you it may be something to be aware of before booking. Another complaint I read about was the duvet. It is paper thin almost looks like a sheet, wasn't sure if I was going to like it because I usually like to sleep with a more fluffy style duvet but it was cozy and there is a furry blanket in the closet if you want something heavier. There was a choice of a firm or soft pillow, all in all a comfortable sleep. My one disappoint was when booking this trip we were choosing between being in the city or going out to the eastern townships because it was my birthday weekend and I really wanted an outdoor hot tub. I was really excited to find this place that I could be in the city and enjoy an outdoor hot tub, which was the main reason we booked here. Unfortunately it was out of service and would not be repaired until Monday. From a customer service perspective I wish we were informed in advance and given the opportunity to reschedule our stay, which we would have done, seeing as how the outdoor hot tub was our main reason for staying there. So just beware that sometimes these special amenities do breakdown and probably best not to plan your trip around them. We made the best of the situation, enjoyed the room, enjoyed Montreal overall it was a good birthday weekend.

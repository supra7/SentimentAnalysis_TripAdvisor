Had to stay at an airport hotel which I normally detest, was not looking forward to it. Room was as I expected, bathroom clean but minute, the bed was really comfortable with good sheets, pillows and duvet, actually had a really good nights sleep, did'nt eat at the restaurant , the only service we used was the valet parking, which was expensive for an airport hotel! Would definately stay here again!!

My wife and I vacation every year for 7-8 days in Maui and for the past 4 years we have stayed at the Hyatt in Maui. This year the hotel seems to have slipped in service and quality of food especially at their morning buffet. We have always prepaid for the buffet, but must admit that we skipped it after the 4th day. Food was not that great and the table/utensils were always dirty. I think they made a mistake by eliminating the white table cloths as we found the tables very dirty and sticky. The front desk staff were excellent as usual, but the maid service was not up to their high standards. We will always come back to Maui, but have to think about other hotel options for 2012

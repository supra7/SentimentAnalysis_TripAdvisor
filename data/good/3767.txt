My wife and I traveled to El Dorado Maroma on Feb. 13th for a six night stay. A huge thank you to Mike from Dream Makers for all his help and quick responses to all our questions. The beach is one of the best we have been to, it is beautiful and quiet. The Marina next door is no problem and adds to the atmosphere. You can walk for over a mile. The staff is exceptional. They work very hard to make your stay special. The food was good. The breakfast buffet was an excellent way to start the day with plenty of fruit and made to order omlets. Lunch also had a good variety to choose from. The theme nights for dinner had a limited selection, though we never went away hungary. The rooms were amazing. Upon arrival we were told we had a 4 level upgrade-- Thanks again to Mike from Dream Makers. Our suite was large and very nicely decorated. This resort is definitely for those who want to relax on a beautiful beach with beach waiters serving you. Would definitely recommend the El Dorado Maroma for a relaxing vacation!

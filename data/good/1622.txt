Just returned from a 6 night business trip to Seattle, and enjoyed staying at the Andra. This was my 3rd long stay at the hotel, and each time I've been tempted to stay elsewhere in Seattle and have always ended up back at the Andra. This time my wife came with me and agreed it was a great hotel: we had a Queen Andra Suite with 2 double beds, large desk, flatscreen TV, walk in wardrobe, minibar and plenty of space. The decor is in muted tones and interesting textures. And the beds are amazingly comfortable: fine cotton sheets and soft down duvets and pillow made for a relaxing sleep. The bar and lobby area is great for kicking back - quite small but never had a problem getting in for late drinks. The best thing here is location too: on the edge of trendy Belltown with great restaurants in walking distance, and the shops a couple of blocks away. Lola onsite is good, but the Dahlia Lounge directly opposite is fantastic. Would definitely recommend the hotel: we stayed a couple of nights at the W Seattle and the two hotels are very similar in terms of service and room standards, but the Andra is about half the price! One thing: definitely try to get a high floored room away from the building works for the new skyscraper next floor. I have never had any problems, but some of my colleagues have been near to the construction site and they start very early!!

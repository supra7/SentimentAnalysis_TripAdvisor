I stayed here for two nights during a conference that was taking place at the Hilton tower around the corner, and I am very glad I chose this hotel, which has much more charm and personality. I also got a terrific rate ($!50) through Priceline, which I'd never used before. (A side tip: never use Priceline for rental cars; what a rip-off!) I got upgraded to a deluxe room. It was medium size and I loved the decor -- a mix of deep maroon, orange, purple, green, some in brocade ... they really made it work. I also loved that they had a desk with an aeron-style computer chair and free wireless which worked pretty well.

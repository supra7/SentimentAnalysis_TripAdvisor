I spent one night at this hotel before flying out of Seattle. The hotel is well located across the street from the airport and the light rail route into central city Seattle. The hotel staff was very friendly, helpful and eager to serve / please. This certainly was very noticeable and one of the highlights of the hotel. Both the front desk and the room service staff get top marks. The staff at the restaurant for breakfast were also very cheerful and helpful and personally attentive, even though it was obvious they were busy and I had a free breakfast voucher (I did leave a tip, but the staff had no guarantees I would do so). I had a courtyard facing room and it was very light, airy, comfortable and spacious. The bathroom was well stocked, but a bit on the small side. I could hear hallway noise, but as the runways are parallel to the hotel, I do not recall hearing any airplane noise. I also did not hear any noise from adjoining rooms. The only negative about the hotel was the internet connection. As I am a Hilton Honors Gold member, I got free internet. I do not know if this was the problem or not. But the connection to the Hilton Honors network from my laptop must have dropped 10 times. Basically every time I opened a browser, I had to re-log in. I have stayed at many different Hilton properties and while it seems a number of them now require one to re-log in every 24 hours, I have never had this experience before. I also had just spent nine nights at a budget hotel in Lewiston ID and never once had a dropped wireless connection, so I have to believe the problem is the hotel's, not my laptop. The garage is a bit of a hike from the front desk. This is one hotel where you definitely want to stop / park at the main entrance while you check in. Overall: great service, great location, very nice and comfortable rooms. Just needs a better internet connection.

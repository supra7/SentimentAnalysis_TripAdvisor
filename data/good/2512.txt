Second time in Seattle, visit family and book this cute hotel. Great location, safe to walk around at night and Lots of restaurants and shopping around here. You can easily take the Link Light Rail from/to Airport to must of the downtown hotels. Last stop and two blocks away to Hotel Max. Service is great and friendly staff. Little boutique hotel, so do not expecting the room will be big. Enough just fit two adult, but if you are two+, I will says you have to book elsewhere....or request/upgrade to a bigger room. Away from the elevator if you are a light sleeper. Pillow Menu is great option for the travelers. Truly boutique, that's all I can say. We booked at expedia with flight package which, this hotel is meet our budget and we knew the room will be small, that's why we were enjoying our stay. Think of NYC. :) Breakfast can be next door (Starbucks). Red Fin Sushi is a great restaurant, be sure go to their happy hour. We had a wonderful trip, hope you will have a great one too!

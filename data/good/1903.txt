The Westin is always a great stay. It's very comfortable. The rooms are pretty quiet and the bed and bath are comfortable. The location is convenient to everything in downtown Seattle. Perhaps best of all, it's consistent, always providing a quality stay. The circular shape of the hotel gives you a great view from any room. I've been staying here for 5+ years, at least 3-4 times a year. I've tried other hotels in the area, but always end up back at the Westin.

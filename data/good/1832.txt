The Westin is a very elegant modern hotel at one edge of the CBD in Seattle. My room was very large with a huge king sized bed and decent bathroom. Television reception was not perfect - not digital quality! - and was interested as ever in advertisements in America - a prize on one morning call in show was an all expenses paid trip to New York including free colonoscopy !!! Oh brave new world that has such people in it! Very relaxing place to be. Good view across the city. Think you probably need to be higher than level 20 to get picturesque views of the sound. Really good for access to the metro back to the airport. Couldnt face making conversation with a Slavic driver in a town car for 30 minutes so had an entertaining 40 minute ride interacting with the locals :) [... no-one seemed in need of a colonoscopy, so I didn't use that opening line.]

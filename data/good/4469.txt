The hotel itself it fairly average - clean and neat - but the decor is a little dated. The hotel makes up for this with nice amenties - nightly music & hula shows. Our rate through Costco came with a daily breakfast buffet that was very good. The location is great both for being on Kaanapali beach, and the distance from Lahaina to the northern and southern locations on western Maui. $9 / day for self-parking was fair, although $1.50 / day for the safe in the room seemed unnecessary. We'd go back again.

I stayed at this Doubletree for a conference in October. I had read some reviews and got a little concerned but I was pleasantly surprised. They are remodeling the rooms. I was in wing 3 and it was complete. The beds/linens are nice and comfortable. I didn't use the restaraunts. I would stay here again.

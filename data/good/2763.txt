We found that most of Seattle was booked out for a baseball game, so looked a little further afield to SeaTac and found this to be a very nice & convenient hotel to stay. It's massive! There were whole airlines staying here and using it for staff accommodation. They have whole wings of different suites that you actually drive to in order to access your local room & carpark. Bed & bathroom was immaculate, clean & comfortable. If passing through on roadtrip, or staying somewhere close after a long flight, I would recommend this place.

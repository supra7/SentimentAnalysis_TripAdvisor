I checked in for one night for a conference in October. Smooth check-in with very friendly desk staff. My room was clean and comfortable. The beds really were very cozy! The Sheraton conference facility was nice, not huge, but seemed perfect for the meeting I was attending. The best thing about the hotel was how close it was to EVERYTHING! I took a jog around downtown and easily reached the Space Needle and sculpture park. And it's so close to Pike Place Market that you can walk in heels! There is also a ton of shopping within blocks of the front door. I would gladly stay in this hotel again if I go back to Seattle!

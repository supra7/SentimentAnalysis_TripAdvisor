Booked through Priceline, $122 including fees (offered $100). Arrived at 12:00pm, our room was ready. Offered the $50 upgrade at the front desk, opted to see our 4th floor City View room first. Our City View Room was small but doable. After passing a Waterview room that was being serviced, we fell in love and called down and asked if we could have that room, they were only too happy to oblige. The hotel front desk staff were absolutely wonderful as well as housekeeping and the housekeeping manager. THEY NEED A NEW BARTENDER! This guy had to be the worse bartender I have ever dealt with. I still do not know why I tipped him. Two draft beers....doesn't sound too complicated, he poured the wrong beers AND overcharged us. Really, how hard could that be. How many people in the bar...including us? A total of 6...all drinking drafts. He was rude, cold and should be behind a desk...not dealing with the public. Avoid the bar at all costs. (I did overhear a waitress talking to a manager saying her table was also overcharged for their drinks.) One last thing, noticed when I arrived home, I had a minibar charge on my bill. Which meant I was once again calling to dispute a charge. Seemed odd to have to dispute two different charges from a hotel I was at for less that 24hrs. Regardless, the rooms are beautiful but beware, if you go when a cruise ship is in town, you may have part of your view blocked.

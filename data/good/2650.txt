I stayed one night at the hotel on a leisurely trip to stay at a historic hotel in downtown Seattle. The Roosevelt takes you back in time. Very friendly and helpful staff. restaurant and bar was a very fun atmosphere and great foodm their selection of different alcohols was amazing! Being a previous beverge Manager, I appreciate a great bartender and good selection. My room was a bit smaller than your usual hotel rooms, but like I said its historic, so back then they built things differently. Nice soft comfy bed, good room service, they were very quick. I will definitely be back for another stay, and I am a seattle native.

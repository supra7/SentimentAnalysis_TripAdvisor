Had a great experience staying at the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel. The room was updated and clean, the staff was wonderful and extremely helpful. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The view from our room was incredible, we slept with the sliding glass door open so we fell asleep and woke up to the sound of the waves every day which was great. Some of the hallways and common areas inside could use some updating and the food was adequate but a little over priced. Otherwise there are no complaints and would stay here again in a heart beat.

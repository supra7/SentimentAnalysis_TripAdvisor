We stayed a week at the Hyatt and had a wonderful time. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. I thought the rooms were a bit dated but comfortable. The location was perfect for walking to the Whaler's shopping complex and getting a catamaran to go whale watching. I loved it and will be staying there again.

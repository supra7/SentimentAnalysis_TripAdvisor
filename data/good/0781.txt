Stayed at the Moore for two nights with a friend. Pros: great location a few blocks from Pike Place Market and downtown shopping, friendly staff and a clean bedroom, good mattress. Cons: bathroom needed updating (cracks in shower, mold around shower), hotel could use some updating. Hotel doesn't provide shampoo so bring your own. I'd stay here again based on location and price. The bed was comfortable and the room was large.

This was one of the cheapest hotel that we found in downtown Seattle, and we were not disappointed at all. We didn't have any problems with our reservation and people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. We had a room with a shared bathroom (which is what we asked for; these are their lowest priced rooms). The room had older furniture but was clean, and the shared bathroom was perfectly fine. It's very well located too, as you're a few minutes walk away from the downtown transit tunnel (w/ light rail directly to/from Seatac airport), Greyhound bus station, and of course the Pike Place market. If you're looking to save on lodging costs in Seattle and you don't mind not having brand new furniture in your room, don't look any further, this hotel offers incredibly good value.

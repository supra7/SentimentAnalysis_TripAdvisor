Our family of four traveled to Montreal to visit McGill University with my daughter as a prospective student. This property is ideally suited for this. It is a 5 minute walk from McGill. I reserved a King Suite and had the bedroom made into 2 twin beds for our daughters. My husband and I stayed on a queen-sized pull out sofa bed in the living room. Turgay (the general manager) was exceptional in providing information before our visit and during our visit. He is very friendly. We felt very comfortable at the hotel. Full kitchen with grocery store just steps from the property. Lots of granite and marble throughout. Very tastefully decorated and well-appointed. Our only complaint is that the girls felt the beds were somewhat hard and the pillows a bit lumpy. I discussed this with Turgay and he said he may replace the mattresses at some future point. You must be aware that the hotel is on the 2nd and 3rd stories of its building. You will be required to climb stairs. We did not mind this at all. Turgay was very helpful with taking us to the free parking and helping with the baggage. Free parking, free US and Canadian calls, nice fresh fruit at the reception desk, an immaculate room, a friendly host and reasonable rates for a family of four ... who could ask for more?!?

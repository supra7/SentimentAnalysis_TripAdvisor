My wife and I asked for a quiet room and we received that with an 8th floor (of 9 floors) room in the South tower. We had a beautiful view of the Maui sunsets and we were grateful for the high floor. What I liked. The location of the hotel is on the south end of Kaanipali beach. Since it's the end of the boardwalk, its not as heavily traveled as some of the other hotels on the beach. Essentially, the closer that you get to the Whaler's Village, the more crowded is the boardwalk. I appreciated that it was less crowded. The staff was right on target for me. Professional, yet casual as you would expect in Hawaii. The poolside restaurant, Umalu, provides consistent and good food. The food in general on Maui is expensive and the food at the Hyatt is no different. Expect to pay around $20 (per person) for casual meals and $40 for dinners. We ate at many of the boardwalk restaurants and Umalu was the best or among the best. The Maui onion rings were unbelievably good. (note: for some of the best cheap eats on the island go to Okazuya at 3600-D L. Honoapiilani Rd.) If you enjoy staying out in the sun all day, consider getting a cabana by the beach so that you can use the cabana for shade when its needed. No need to worry about food and beverages...the service at the cabanas is timely. If you want privacy...choose cabana #24. It's a small thing, but the safe in the walk in closet (yep, a walk in closet) is at eye level and extremely convenient. What was less than good. There were times when the water in the shower would suddenly get cold...very cold. This is not something that I would expect from a Hyatt. The AC unit is against the opposite wall from the bed. You should expect to have the air blowing on you all night if you have it running...and you will. All in all, the Hyatt Maui is a good place to have a relaxing vacation on Maui.

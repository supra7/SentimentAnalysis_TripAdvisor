I stayed one night at this hotel because I had a mid day plane to catch to New York and I didn't want to bother with morning traffic. I stayed on the third floor facing the airport. My good sized room had two sleep number double-beds and was nicely decorated. These beds are cool and I found out that my ideal number is 45. Everything was clean. The club chairs were comfortable and looked new. Checking in was pleasant although there was a wait because there were two people in front of me asking a lot of questions. There was no fridge or safe but I really didn't need them. The next day I took the complimentary shuttle to the airport after a short wait and it didn't take too long to get to the airport. I could have walked across but I didn't feel like dealing with a six lane highway. I had a very nice stay at a low price through hotwire.

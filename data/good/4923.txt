We were happy to stay at the Parc Suites. It is a small, boutique style hotel with highly attentive service. The location is convenient and at the heart of the city. Good also for long-term stays. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The owner manager is always around and this is a promising factor for consistent quality. The only shortcoming is that there is no elevator. It might be hard for elderly and particularly disabled people.

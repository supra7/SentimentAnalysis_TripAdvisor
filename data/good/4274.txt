Thank goodness we booked through a travel agent. After a not so positive experience at another hotel, we were able to move to the Hyatt. It was great! Love the nature feel in the center of the lobby, everyone was pleasant, and room was clean. The Italian restaurant was a pleasant surprise - the food was so good. I wanted dessert, but we were too full! The hotel is a walk away to Whaler's Village, but that gave us the opportunity to check out the other hotels' restaurant options. The pool was large and fun, and of course the poolside drink service..okay, once we got nachos and they were awesome as well! Ours incl buffet breakfast and that was good too - lots of options. We ate that early in the morning and we didn't have to worry about lunch, so that helped out to save on meal costs. Overall, we loved it. We didn't have a view from our room, but at that point, we weren't choosy. We were just happy that there was vacancy at the Hyatt!

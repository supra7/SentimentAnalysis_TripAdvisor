newer facility, convenient to several area restaurants. far enough off highway to be quiet, but still convenient to I-65. very friendly staff, spacious clean rooms, frig/microwave, comfortable bed. breakfast is quite adequate....pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereals, hard boiled and scrambled eggs, and sausage (although i have to admit it was "different looking"). lots of area restaurants nearby.

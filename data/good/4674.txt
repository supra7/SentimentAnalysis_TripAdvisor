I took my retired mother to Maui for her first trip there. She insisted upon staying at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel because of its reputation as "Maui's Most Hawaiian Hotel." I must say that I was skeptical. This was my 7th trip to Maui and I didn't really want to stay at Kaanapali because it is so crowded. To my surprise, we had a lovely time there. Although the room itself was average, it was clean and in good repair, and we loved the view of the beautiful spacious garden and the ocean from our lanai. The welcome breakfast got us off to a good start. The daily breakfast that came with the room was a buffet with a variety of selections. The food was not gourmet, but it was more than adequate for us. The staff are so friendly and helpful. We participated in many of the activities provided including hula lessons and lei making. My mother wanted to watch Rudy and his crew perform nightly in the courtlyard, and we had a great time! Mom even had tears in her eyes during the farewell ceremony and she continues to wear her kukui nut lei as a cherished treasure. A great big MAHALO to the staff at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel for helping me to make a wonderful memory with my mom.

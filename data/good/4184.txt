This was our 3rd time staying here and the hotel continues to meet most expectations. Rooms are adequate (but not spectacular), the grounds are beautfiul as are the swimming pools, the location is ideal (beaches and near Lahaina) and food is above average. We upgraded to the Regency Club rooms which give you free breakfast and afternoon snacks (the food is quite tasty and we noticed quite a few guests making this their dinner) which is much better value given how expensive food is in general. The negatives remain the same - it has a standard convention center feel to it once you go past the grounds nearest the front of the hotel and the swimming pools and hotel parking is incredibly expensive. What used to be Swan Court (?) restaurant has become a different restaurant but the food and the views (Swans in the pond) remain good.

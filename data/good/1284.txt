The room was nicely appointed, but I would have liked to see a small refirigerator and an ipod docking station. The room was very clean, which is the most important thing to me when I travel. However, the room was very stuffy, as if the thermostat wasn't working. We had a very noisy neighbor, but as soon as we called the front desk, security was dispatched and the neighbors behaved. Overall, I reccomend this hotel, even above others that I have stayed at in the vicinity. The staff were great, the room was CLEAN and they allwed us to bring our dog. The location couldn't be better, right next door to the convention center and a block or so away from the Paramount theatre and malls.

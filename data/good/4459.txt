Just returned from KBH and left a pretty favourable impression. As other travellers have stated, a pretty good hotel, great location, and really good staff. We recommend staying in the freshly updated rooms. We were on the 5th floor (Kauai bldg), and the room and it's view were fabulous. Only 2 minor criticism's: The property is a bit aged, and the included breakfast package venue is a bit chinsey (location faces the front of the hotel and buffet offerings a little boring). Other than that, a truly fine time and cudo's to the property owners and their promotion of Hawaiian heritage. PS--Don't miss Dale (the 400,000 Mai Tai Guy) at the Tiki Bar. As he would say......AhhhhhhhhRight! Well done KBH. As a side for dining, highly recommend the Tiki Grill (at KBH) and the adjacent Hula Grill and Lelanis.............do not go to Dukes, about 15 minutes down the road. This restaurant does not hold a candle to the other Dukes eateries/locations.

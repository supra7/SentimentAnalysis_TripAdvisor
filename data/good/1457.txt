I was in Seattle for a meeting at the convention center. The Sheraton was well situated for this, and also was very convenient to great restaurants and shopping. We had a "club level" room, which was surprisingly small, but comfortable and with a phenomenal view. Club level breakfast was very good. All in all, the Sheraton is your standard "convention style" hotel, that was comfortable and staffed by friendly employees. I would stay again for a work trip, but probably try something more interesting for a personal trip.

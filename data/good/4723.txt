This was our third visit to Maui and our first stay at the El Dorado. We took another couple with us and rented a two bedroom condo. We checked in late and was assigned a condo in the D building which backs up to a busy road. It just did not work for us.The next morning I voiced my concern to the front desk and also the management.They acknowledged my concern and went to work finding more suitable accomodations.All their two bedrooms were booked for the rest of our stay but they were able to show us three studios that were available.We took one in the A building and the other couple took one in the E building.Even though we were not together it still worked out great.I want to thank the staff and the management for a wonderful stay and for going the extra mile for us,we really appreciated it.We look forward to coming back.Mahalo

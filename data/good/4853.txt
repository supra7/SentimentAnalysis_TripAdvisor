I stayed here for 3 nights because I had a ticket to the opera. You couldn't ask for a more convenient location not just to Teatro dell'Opera Roma, but to a main street Via Nazionale. It's also close proximity to the buses, Piazza della Republica and Termini Stazione. My single room was lovely, but really very very extremely tiny! This would be the only reason why I wouldn't stay here again. Staff were pleasant, friendly & helpful. There is a lift, breakfast was delicious, the espresso was fantastic and to be most honest, there was nothing wrong here other than my room size.

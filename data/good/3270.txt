Large newer type resort with great pools and restaurants. Rooms were modern, clean, and staff were excellent. Never a shortage of drinks and you always had someone asking if you would like one regardless of where you were. The restaurants were very good and quality and portions were right on.........even the French restaruant provided an excelllent size steak. The japanese was great in that you could just reserve a normal table away from the tradition show table and order your own portions and this was great since you can order double steak just for yourself. The beach had the best fluffy sand I have ever seen but the only issue was that it was not visible from the resort. Overall a very good resort.

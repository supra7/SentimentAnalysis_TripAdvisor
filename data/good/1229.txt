This hotel is in a great location close to a lot of shopping and restaurants. I stayed in a room in the new tower. The room was so beautiful. Great beds, really nice bathroom, good TV. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner. Great shower. The hotel is large is it is very crowded and busy but the service was excellent. Great food. Free wifi in the lobby.

Based off of others reviews pro and con I decided to stay at the Destiny Palms. Glad I did, yes the rooms were small but honestly how much time do you spend in them. The beds were clean, comfortable and the Motel was off the main road so it was quiet and peaceful. We were able to walk to conveniences such as Mcdonalds, Houlihans and 7-11.. Felt safe walking around at nite, and the staff was more than helpful. Breakfast could have had a little more variety but for free what can we expect. Based on the prices we will stay there again when we visit next season or sooner. If you expect alot, pay alot and stay elsewhere, if you need a nice place to sleep while visiting area attractions give the Destiny Palms a chance to save you $$$ that you can spend on the attractions..

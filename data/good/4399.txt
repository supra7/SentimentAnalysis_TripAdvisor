I thought this hotel was very nice. The location is perfect and the guests and the staff are friendly. It is close to the Whaler's Village, restaurants, and the beach cannot be better. However, I would like to recommend that whoever leads the religious service early sunday morning in the area in front of the rooms tries to not be loud, as there are many guests in the hotel, with balconies facing the courtyard where this religious service takes place. I have nothing against the event itself, just would like to ask that it is done in a way that will not disturb the peace and quiet of the other guests. Thanks.

We arrived before the designated checkin time after a very long flight and the hotel was brilliant in getting 2 rooms side by side within 20 minutes of our arrival. The property was first class with great places to relax, drink and eat and the service was good. The Hyatt is down one end of "Resort Row" and everything is within a short walk from here. From what we could see we had luckiliy chosen well and the hotel suited our older teenage kids that came along. The gym facilities are one of the best I have used anywhere. Be aware that every hotel along the beach fronmt seem to charge a $25.00 per day resort fee. Don't let it spoil your hoolliday when you see it.... they all do it.

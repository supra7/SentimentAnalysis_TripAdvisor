This hotel is in downtown Seattle - great for shopping - and just 6 blocks from the famous Pike Place Market. I have been going to this hotel for the past few years and it always seems pretty popular. Apart from the location, I guess the reason you'd choose the Sheraton is because of its reputation. It's a well-known brand so there are no nasty surprises. The staff are friendly, the rooms are nicely-decorated and the hotel generally well-maintained. There is free wifi throughout the hotel - other hotels, please take note. There is a good gym and swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel.

I had to be in Madrid on business, and this hotel was within a few hunderd meters of the two locations I need to be at. Having stayed in Barcelo hotels in the UK I expected the standard to be good even in a business type hotel. I wasn't disapointed. The hotel is modern, purpose built and quite stylish. Room had every I needed, buffet breakfast was good and the evening meal choice was excellent and well presented. Helpful staff and a enjoyable stay. Very easy access to the airport and the Metro is a few hunderd meters down the street, you can be in the city centre in a no time at all. I will use it again for sure, and would even consider it for a weekend break, it won't break the budget.

stayed for 8 night,lovely location,stayed in room 218,2 big double bed loads of room,cleaned daily, every thing about maui seems relaxed,chilled out,5minute walk to beach,not worth paying for a ocean view as golf course is there,it $7:00 a day to pay in their car park but at least it is safe,arrive from the u.k. 19 hour flight changing at los angeles

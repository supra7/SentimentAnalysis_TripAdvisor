The Hilton Bayfront was a beautiful hotel in a very centralized location. Close to public transit, shopping, and resturants. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The hotel accomidations were nice. Pool was very nice right next to the bay. Would have been nice to have some more beachfront location being it is right on the bay. But was still very nice.

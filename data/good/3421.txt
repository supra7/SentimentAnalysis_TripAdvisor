This place is amazing value for money but lacks any charm or character. The place is HUGE and don't be fooled by the images on the web site which make it look like it's in the middle of the rain forst. It's for people who like to drink and eat for long hours a day. The pool is usually full of people being rowdy and playing games which is no problem if you're happy with that and like participating. If you're shy and like sitting on a beach i'd avoid. If you like joining in with evening games and other such activities then this is for you. Free drinks is amazing. The food is pretty useless - lunch is impossible to find anything but dinner gets better if you find something you like...and i'd stick to it.

I was originally attracted to the Ace by the price (of course). I'll also admit the hype surrounding the Ace Hotel made me curious. I found both positive and negative hype across the internet, and booked the Ace with an open mind. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms and staff and overall value. If you've stayed at pensions in Europe and liked them, you'll be at home at the Ace. When I arrived I asked to upgrade from my single to a room with a washroom attached, imagining the worst about the Ace's communal washrooms. I needn't have worried. The ratio between rooms and washrooms is small. The washrooms are clean with a focus on white-tiled functionality. The room itself was small but I didn't feel I needed more. In relatively tiny area the Ace manages to fit in a comfortable bed, retro TV, desk and a stainless steel sink, all in an undeniably cool style. More than enough without feeling cramped. The staff was polite and interested, and offered well considered suggestions for food and entertainment. With perks like free Wi-Fi (a bit slow), free breakfast and parking, the Ace is a deal. That being said, if you are at all finicky about the hotels you stay at, the Ace may not be for you. Upon first entering the Ace you are overwhelmed by stairs reaching out of sight; note there is no elevator for your heavy luggage. The Ace sits above the Cyclops bar, a hangout for Gen Y hipsters. The music, chatter and cigarette smoke will filter up to your room. But that's all part of the vibrant area of Belltown that the Ace is in. Stay away if you're very particular about your room for the night. Stay at the Ace if you want value, location and style.

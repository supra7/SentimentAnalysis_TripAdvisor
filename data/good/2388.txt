We stayed at the W in downtown Seattle on 8/14-817. Our family had 3 rooms there. The hotel is dim, but what do you expect it's a W hotel. We got a decent deal on Priceline. The rooms were nice and clean. The location is also great, there is a big Starbucks right across the street (though there was coffee in the lobby every morning) and also restaurants only a block away. They have Bliss products which are great. We didn't park at the W (it's $37). The parking garage next door was $30 with in and out privileges. The concierge was really helpful and so nice. I believe his name is Travis. He was really nice and helpful. Gave us excellent recs for oysters and a park to see a Frasier view of Seattle! The only problem I had was with the blinds. I love hotel curtains which block out the morning sun.

We visited during the swine flu scare. There was no reason not to. I am very glad that we did not alter our plans. The beach is beautiful and the rooms are very nice. The food is mostly good but we never had a meal that I would consider exceptional. There are some changes that have occurred due to low occupancy. We did get an upgrade. It seemed only about four of the buildings were occupied. There was never a problem getting a chair at the pool or beach. Only two restraunts would be open at dinner and the only restraunt open for lunch was the one around the pool. The world cafe was only open one day for breakfast and it was wonderful. The other days you had the choice of room service or the pool restraunt for breakfast. Room service was good but the breakfast at the pool restraunt was bad. The staff members were all very nice and hard working. I think the staff may have been cut back too much. The few that were there were working much too hard. An example is there was always only one server working the beach and it is a big beach. Even if there are only a few people on the beach they are spread out and the servers still had a big area to cover. Some of the shows were also cut. Two night there was not a show only a movie.

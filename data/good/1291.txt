Me and my friend booked this hotel for the night to stay in Seattle they gave us a complimentary upgrade so we were on the top floor! I would stay here again and the pool and hot tub are super nice!!! The only down thing is the expensive parking and we had a little music on at night around 6 when we were getting ready, and they told us to turn it down when it was not even loud but overall it was a great stay I give it a B+

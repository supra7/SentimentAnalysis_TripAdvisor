Stayed at the KBH in early September. The hotel is starting to show its age but the staff and attitude of the employees makes up for an aging hotel. Employees are genuine and sincere and always wishing guests aloha..... Our room was clean and overlooked the gardens and a partial ocean view. My only suggestion...drop the parking charges....unless valet parking. The Tiki Bar was second to none...Dale is a master mixologist and Lynn busts her buns to provide the very best service.....Thanks Lynn. Even the guests seem more relaxed and engaging than at other higher-priced hotels. Nightly entertainment is world-class. We even came back after leaving the hotel to enjoy the Tiki Bar and nightly entertainment. We will be back!

Hotel used as a layover for cruise ships. Nice rooms, ok food near by, can catch bus to down town seattle (30-45 min away) for 2-3$. I was expecting a dump as this was just a lay over between Denver and anchorage, however, the room was nice, VERY close to airport (you could walk). Corcierge was a tool. Restaruant was too expensive, walk across the street. Good price from the cruise on a package deal.

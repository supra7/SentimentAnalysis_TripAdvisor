Had a wonderful time. The hotel was especially nice because of it's location. You can walk to dinner and shops at the Whaler's Village. Being able to just walk to the beach was wonderful too. My grandson's favorte time was going to the Luau each night and dancing with the music. People were very friendly..the ground were beautiful. Loved the plumeria trees. I would definitely go back again.

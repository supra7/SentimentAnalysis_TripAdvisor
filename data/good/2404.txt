Here are my reasons why I have chosen W several times before and still seriously consider it every time I travel to Seattle. Ambiance, rooms & restaurants: W Seattle has a boutique feel to it and you feel chic the moment you step inside. I am particularly fond of the lounge in the evening, when local or not, beautiful people come for drinks (and sometimes food). The rooms are fine, nothing extraordinary but definitely won't dissapoint. I don't have the same complaints as many others do about the dark hallways and elevators. It's nice in a way but I find the dimmed lighting more Vegas than luxe. It's a colour preference perhaps. The restaurant is expensive and the food subpar. I've only eaten brunch there and try not to do that if I don't have to. Service: Don't expect great service from the front desk, concierge, lounge servers or at the restaurant. Room service is also slow and so is housekeeping. The staff seem to have received no training in customer service. Distance to shops: It's a bit of a walk but all downhill. If you want proximity to Nordstrom, Hyatt is your hotel but I prefer W and just walk 5 min. to Nordstrom. Overall: If your stay is a short one which wouldn't give rise to too many interactions with the hotel staff, then W is a great place to stay. It's definitely worth a try for you to form your own opinion.

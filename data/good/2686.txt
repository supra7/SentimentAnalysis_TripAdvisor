From the time I arrived, I received superb service from the front desk. When I needed directions, the young man at the desk was always available to give accurate directions and provide a map. The day before I left, I was told by the friendly young man that when I needed my cab to call downstairs 5-10 minutes before. So the next morning, I called the front desk at 4:23 AM (I wanted a cab by 4:30 for my 6 AM flight). The guy at the front desk told me to call back 5-10 minutes before I was ready. I told him that's what I was doing, it's 4:23 and I'd like a cab by 4:30. My whole thinking was that I was calling 5-10 mins before I was going to head down. So then the front desk guy had an attitude, said that I needed to call back because he wasn't going to call the cab company because he's not going to watch for cabs that pull up in front of the hotel, "that's not my job, I'm not going to be responsible if the cab leaves". All I could think was how rude this guy was. I smiled, and hung up the phone. I called back down when I was literally walking out the door. When I reached downstairs, I was ready to tell the guy how rude and unprofessional he was over the phone, and he was not there at the front desk. I got in the cab and went to the airport. I just feel that there is a more polite way to deal with guests. I would hate to give this hotel a p!ss poor rating for one rude employee, so I'd still recommend it, I just ask the hotel front desk (in particular the young man who works the overnight shift) to learn some manners and etiquette when dealing with customers if you want return business.

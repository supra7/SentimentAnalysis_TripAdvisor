Even though we arrived late at night, the staff of the Warwick was courteous and helpful. We had a glitch with one of the room keys, but it was quickly resolved. The only downside was the musty smell of the room upon arrival. After opening the sliding door to the outside, the mustiness was gone and was a non-issue. The balcony was standing room only, no room for a chair. The hotel offered us a perfect view of the Space Needle both at night and during clear days. The Warwick was an easy walk to delicious restaurants and attractions. There was no need to rent a car. The Link Light Rail brought us all the way from the airport to between two and three blocks away. Even at the late hour we arrived, it was an easy jaunt. The public transportation in Seattle and surrounding areas brought us within blocks of the hotel, with one bus stop right across the street! The grocery store across the street was convenient for any meal, but especially breakfast and a late night snack. After a long day of walking downtown, the hot tub brought relief to tired muscles. An early morning swim in the small pool reawakened the muscles for another day of excursion. We would stay at the Warwick Seattle again.

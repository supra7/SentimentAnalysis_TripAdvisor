I stayed here at the Hilton Bayfront for one night for a business convention. The Hilton is conveniently located right next to the convention center, and the Petco Park baseball stadium. It's also fairly close to the gaslamp district, though I'm not sure you'd want to walk there, especially at night. On the plus side, the hotel is located right on the water so there are some great water and sunset views. Unfortunately, there's a big container ship harbor right in front as well, so the view was *dominated* by a giant cargo ship. The hotel is also brand new, so the rooms are modern and feels totally clean. The pool and jacuzzi deck also looks like a really nice place to hang out. The decor is modern, with lots of white ... but it just feels quite cold. This hotel ultimately is really just a nice business hotel. It's clean but pricey, relatively convenient but lacks personality. My point of reference is always "would I pay to stay here for leisure". I think there are much more interesting places to stay for leisure in San Diego, but if you have business at the Convention Center, this is a great place to stay.

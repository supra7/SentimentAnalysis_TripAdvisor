Finding an affordable hotel in New York can be a daunting task. It was after several searches I randomly found this hotel and I am so glad I did. We wanted to use LES as our base for a long weekend in NYC as it has wonderful neighborhood bars & restaurants but didn't want to blow our entire budget on hotel . The room is small,but if you are going for leisure , that shouldn't matter. It really reminded me of a Hong Kong hotel in many ways.. not just the compact size of the hotel but the attention to small things (Bulgari bath products ) & the complimentary continental breakfast ( with cheese!!) & coffee. The free wifi was also a nice plus. We had a room towards the back and had no issue with street sounds. The bed was very comfortable and provided a great nights sleep. I did not go up to the roof deck , but saw people binging up their breakfast to there, which seemed like a great idea. Importantly, the hotel is in an easy walk to the Subway and one could catch a cab easily should they need to. I would definitely stay there again..

I spent three days at this hotel, and I regret I couldn't stay longer. The reception is in a nice space, very elegant and full of light, and rooms are amazing: the bathrooms are big, not the usual hotel bathrooms in which there is no space, and they have the rain shower that I really love. The city view is interesting and also the fact that the bedroom is in another small room inside the room itself helps you sleeping, because you separate the area in which you work or read a book from the one in which you sleep only; I really appreciated it. Furnitures are modern and I liked the style, neutral tones of gray and beige mixed with glass and wood, they make look the room even more confortable. The hotel has also an amazing spa, a gym and a swimming pool, everything kept with the maximum of cleanliness and order. I recommend this hotel, it is one of the best at which I have ever stayed.

My parents had given me and my boyfriend a certificate for a night and when I made the resrvation I was told that we were going to get two double beds but I asked if possible that I could get a single queen. On check in I was told that I was getting a single queen (maybe it was a king) on the 29th floor. I was AMAZED when I walked into the room on how nice it was! It was alot better than I was expecting. Of course the first thing I do is test the bed and it was probably the most comfortable one I've slept on in a long time. The valet people were really nice and helped me figure out how to avoid traffic areas to get to Pike Place Market and the aquarium. When trying to find how to get to my grandma's apartment the concierge was more than willing to help me with a smile. I think the only problem I had with the stay was the next day we had deciced to have breakfast in the restaurant after waiting about 10 minutes for the waiter to acknoledge us we decided to forget about ordering from the menu we may as well do the buffet since it felt like we weren't being payed attention to. The buffet was decent but could've had more for the price I personally feel like if I had taken the same amount I paid for the both of us and taken it somewhere else I could've gotten ALOT better breakfast.

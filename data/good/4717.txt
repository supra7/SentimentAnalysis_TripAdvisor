We stayed here for two nights on a fourteen-day (seven-hotel) trip. We were very impressed by almost every element of this hotel - its location, design and luxuriousness. But we were extremely put-off by the non-functioning air-conditioning (and, in particular) the staff's (non-)response to it. The hotel is well located - quite close to the station and along the "main drag" between there and St Mark's Square. At least one other reviewer has recommended taking the ferry there along the Grand Canal, but we walked. The distance isn't a problem at all, and it's not hard to find, but there _are_ two bridges (with stairs) to cross on the way, so consider that if you're lugging suitcases. It's a very modern and renovated place (in an old building). It's listed as four stars and looks it. Quite luxurious, but small and a bit fancier than we needed. And not "luxurious" to us in the ways that we find most important. For example, the shower was tinier than most, and the fittings (though modern) don't work well in it. Breakfast was so-so. Nice to have proper coffee and fancy little jams. But the croissants and eggs were no better than places half this price. The only real inconvenience though was the AC - it didn't run, and we suspect the staff were lying about why. The room was quite warm (with not much of a breeze from the windows), and the air-conditioning either didn't work or wasn't turned on. Friends who'd just visited Venice warned us that might be the case - something about laws about the date they can start activating it...? But they also warned us the hotel would be liable to lie to us about the problem. That's pretty much exactly what happened. There were lots of excuses and no real action to resolve the issue - both signs (in our minds) that we were being lied to. We were able to live with no AC. But being misled really rubbed me the wrong way.

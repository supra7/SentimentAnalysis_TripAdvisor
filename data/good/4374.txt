I will be the first to admit when we arrived we did think omg what have we done! But after staying here it was a pleasant experience. It was also about half the price of the more expensive neighbours who's resorts you can just wander into. We had a partial sea view from the Molokai wing which is the original building. There are no lifts so you have to carry your bag up the stairs. The room was comfortable but dated, beds were comfy and we had a nice view. Only downside to this wing was the noise from the showers. I think if anyone in the vacinity of our room had a shower you could hear the pipes. And people are up early for flghts or tours! Other than that apart from one set of very loud neighbours we didn't hear any others through the walls.. The grounds are lovely and you can lie under the trees or in the sun. The pool is small however the beach is great. You can walk down to Black Rock for swimming with the fish and turtles (if you are going early keep a beach towel from the day before as they don't open till 8). Breakfast buffet was ok, a little more variety would be nice. We also ate from the Tiki bar/hut a couple of times and the food was good. All the other hotels are in easy walking distance and after we had been through them all we actually did like our hotel a little more. The Westin has the wow factor but the Hyatt and Sheraton were quite bland and the Marriott is just timeshare hell! We caught the bus into Lahaina several times. Get the $2 day ticket rather than $1 each way and you can always go back in at night. The nightly music at the hotel was nice, we didn't go see the show but listened to the music from our lanai. Staff were helpful, especially on the tour desk. If you are looking for a spa highly recommend the Westin. Overall this was a nice experience and I would stay here again.

Hotel was very nice and easy to get around. Macy's was disappointing. The food was great and I am a picky eater. Never went to the beach, pool was nice, water was cold. Drink service was slow.... and at $12 each you would think they would come around more requently. the nightly luau / entertainment was ANNOYING, if you make a reservation, ask to stay away from that side of the hotel... do the helecopter ride,,,, it'll seem expensive to you at first but once you do it, you will realize you would pay every more

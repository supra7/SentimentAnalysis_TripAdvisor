We stayed at the Moore Hotel while spending 3 days in Seattle waiting to board our ship for a cruise to Alaska. We thought the hotel was a pretty good deal. It's easy to get to from SEA-TAC airport. Just take bus 194 and walk the 2 blocks to the hotel. Could not be easier or cheaper at $1.50 one way. The location is great. You are close to Pikes Public Market and downtown Seattle is well within walking distance. However, its location is also the only disadvantage we noted. 2nd Avenue is a pretty busy one way street leading into the downtown area. With the windows open at night, the police car sirens were pretty noticeable as well as pretty frequent. But that is a small price to pay for staying at the Moore. The hotel itself shows character. It is clean and housekeeping was great. The room was large and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom we had was private and had recently been remodeled. No complaints at all. The desk crew was very friendly and helpful. There is a room where you can securely leave your luggage on your last day after checkout for that one last jaunt to the market. All in all we would stay at the Moore again. It's price, location and traditional character make for a pleasant stay.

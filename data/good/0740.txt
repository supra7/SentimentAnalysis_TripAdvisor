We stayed here for 2 nights and had a great time. The guy at the desk was more than helpful. Parking was not included but $12 a day close. We didn't use our car at all while we were there. It was close enough to everything to just walk. The hotel is old but nicely redone. It is funky but elegant and clean. The internet was marginal. The guy at the desk gave us good insight on restaurants and places to walk. We did the Pike Place Market, the Aquarium and the Space Needle along with lots of eclectic shops along 1st street. Be sure to do the "Underground Tour." It was right there and amazing!!! Have fun here!!!!!

We stayed 3 nights at Pera Tulip. Room was nice, clean and modernly furnished. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Great breakfast buffet with a pianist. Great location, close to Taksim Square, Galata, and tons of great restaurants. To get to the old city, just take the tunel which is a few blocks away or you can walk across the galata bridge. Enjoyed the sauna, turkish bath and the pool. Will definitely stay here again.

Lodge-like hotel. Cozy, comfortable rooms, right on the waterfront, with fireplace and balcony extending over the bay. A beautiful view of Elliott Bay and Olympic mountains. The lobby and all dining areas have a gorgeous view. Just go in the winter -- it's too warm to use the fireplace in Sept. The service in dining wasn't the best, but the scenery being enjoyed made up for it.

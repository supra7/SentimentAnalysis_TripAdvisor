We were looking for a cost effective stay during the new year rush. This hotel completely fitted our requirement. We got a top floor room, free internet ( please be aware it is not wifi - wired) The staff were kind and courteous. Plenty of taxis which are safe, prompt and nice. The deira city centre shopping mall in stone throw away and enjoyed our frequent shopping trips The Metro is close by so you can whizz around the town easily only down side was separate time for male and female swimming so we could not swim as family but made it up in the water parks.

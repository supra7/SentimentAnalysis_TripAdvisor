My husband and I spent 4 nights in March, 2012, at this downtown Seattle hotel. Location was perfect! Close to Pikes Market, across the street from a movie theater and Cheesecake Factory, and lots of shopping (Forever 21, American Eagle, Macy's, Ross, Nike, etc). We took the bus to Discovery Park and the Ballard Locks. Took the ferry to Bainbridge Island. I only have three minor complaints: we had requested a king bed, but was given two doubles; the Concierge wasn't too familiar with the public transportation; and housekeeping failed to remove the previous ocuupants black panties left in the bathroom. However, these complaints are not deal-breakers. I would definitely stay here again!

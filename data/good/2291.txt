I found this room after putting a fairly lowball number into the Priceline four star or better search for downtown Seattle ($79 was accepted). This hotel has a great location for the theatre and shopping area. The convention center, Pikes Makret, and waterfront are a little further, but still not a long walk. The hotel had a very cozy lobby and helpful staff. The room was clean and safe with nice city views. The bed was decedant in its softness and the linens were first class. The decor was quite unique and all in all, made a cozy little nest from the cold outside. The only drawbacks were parking (over $35/nght after tax---being ripped off like that always leaves a bad taste in my mouth), and the bathroom. Nothing wrong per say with the bathroom, only that it was not special. It was very small and just very vanilla. The Aveda products were nice, but it could have been a bathroom in a Best Western. Still, at the Priceline price, and with tickets in hand for the 5th Avenue Theatre one block away, it was the prefect stay for us. The place may not be the most special place you ever stay, but it is a very solid choice for downtown Seattle and just as nice as all but the most glamarous addresses.

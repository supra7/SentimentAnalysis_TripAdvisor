We stayed here overnite, one night for my daughter's 16th birthday. Myself ,my daughter and two other friends of hers....We loved the room, two queen beds, one hide a bed(it was surpisingly comfortable!!) And the pool area, so beautiful and relaxing...while the girls swam I rested on one of the chaise lounges....We were swimming at night and they had the atrium area and pool all lit up with lights...So fabulous! They were in a state of remodel in lobby area and some of walkways and corridors to room halls but was not noisy or inconvenient in any way...We live in local area but treat ourselves to this hotel every once in awhile, we are always very pleased with service and amenities....Stay here...you won't be dissapointed!

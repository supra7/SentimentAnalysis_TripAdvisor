It was fairly simple - while booking online through Starwood's site for a room the night before Halloween to have a "staycation", I requested a room on a higher floor for better views of downtown Seattle. We had been stressed out a bit and were looking forward to feeling as much like we were getting away as possible while staying close to other responsibilities. So I booked a "Spectacular" room, and when we checked in, was pleasantly surprised that the hotel had not only read the request, but had already booked us on the top floor of the hotel facing the side with the best views of downtown. No need for us to even ask at the desk. Granted, this wasn't a weeknight where the availability might be less, but it created a better experience right off the bat for us. Now if only they wouldn't insist we supply a refundable deposit on an umbrella that clearly came from a lost-and-found when it was pouring outside. A W-branded umbrella, sure, but a Sahalee Country Club umbrella? Come on! One negative - paying a $4 "delivery service" charge AND a 22% F&B charge (presumably for delivery also) on top of $6 for a cup of room-service coffee. I say this somewhat in jest, of course, because overall we were very pleased.

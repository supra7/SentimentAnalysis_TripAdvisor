Overall this is a nice hotel, with an excellent location, close to great shopping, and business, and Seattle Center, and Library. Rooms are spacious enough. However the Heavenly Bed which is supposed to be 250 thread count sheets was clearly not what they claim. They had us sleeping on thread bare, pilled sheets, that could give anyone a good exfoliation. The only sheet that was like this , was the bottom sheet...which of course needs to be 250 thread count to be slippery , and comfy. This persisted for 6 nights....and on the last 2 nights I finally got them to put a TOP sheet on the bottom as well. Those last 2 nights were great. too bad I had to get up at 3 in the morning for my plane. I can only imagine why they were using such poor sheets....either they were trying to save money and bought 180 thread count sheets....or they were just OUT of regular sheets due to the completely booked hotel, and had to use "loaners" or something. they offered no explanation to me thus far. Overall, they have a nice staff, and I did not have any other complaints.....however we were there to get good nights rest, and the Heavenly Bed is supposed to provide just that. And keep in mind that Parking is $36- $38 per night...which added about $360 to our stay! yikes! I am still awaiting response from the management to see what can be done to amend the situation. I will report back.

If you're driving to Seattle for a cruise, you quickly discover parking is a sizable cost while you're on board the ship. Hotel Max was offering a terrific deal: stay for one night minimum, and you could leave your car in their secure valet pkg for the full week! The upcharge was a mere $79, compared to the $18/day the cruise line was going to charge us for a public parking lot - not ideal when we were leaving half our stuff stored in the car. Rooms are small, downtown is its usual noisy self with buses and car traffic, and the bathrooms are miniscule. I mean really tiny - the bathroom on board the ship was bigger! Nonetheless, we knew it would be noisy downtown, the room was fine and the beds were excellent, and that parking deal is phenomenal. Plus, the hotel threw in a complimentary town car out to the ship! This was unexpected and was a wonderful freebie we weren't expecting. Good location, very close to the Tom Douglas restaurants which are some of our favs to eat at. Be aware the color scheme is dark gray, black and red. You'll need a flashlight to find the step up to the bathroom without stubbing your toe!

Very cool looking boutique hotel, located at the very edge of Belltown so that everything was very centrally located. We were in town for 4 days and did not find the need to rent a car. We walked everywhere! Took the monorail to the Seattle Center, and only used a taxi to and from the airport. The hotel rooms are small - our room was no more than 250 sq ft - but if most of your time is to be spent outside, then that should not matter. The rooms are clean, eco-friendly, and the beds are SUPER comfy! I wanted to take the entire bed, blankets, and pillows home. i would definitely stay here again and recommend everyone to stay here. The nightly rate prices are very reasonable and the staff are really friendly and helpful. Also there is a really good fusion Japanese restaurant located in the hotel called Red fin Sushi that is great for meeting with friends and happy hour.

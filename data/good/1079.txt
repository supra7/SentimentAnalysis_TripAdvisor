We stayed at this Seattle hotel for one night only in early December. We arrived late Friday night and were told that the highest floor they could put us on was the 4th floor. We had booked on Priceline, and are used to getting the "leftovers" as it relates to the rooms. But we were happy that they got us into a king-size bed. We didn't mind being "only" on the 4th floor, but I suspected that they are aware that there is some highway noise, and the higher up, the less noise. Nevertheless, the room was adequate - not luxurious. But we had paid a very reasonable price through priceline. If you have stayed in many "downtown" hotels, you know that there is a very high price to be paid for large perfect rooms without flaws. This room wasn't perfect, certainly, there was a chip on the bathroom door, that type of thing, but it was fine. And we didn't experience any troublesome noise from the highway. Mostly the reason that we are rating this hotel so high is because of the friendly staff and the great value we got on priceline. I would have been very unhappy with this hotel had I paid $150 or $200 per night. In the morning, at the breakfast buffet, we were treated to a wonderfully friendly server who couldn't have been more delightful and helpful. He helped us with our plan to walk down to Pike Place Market and chatted with us about the weather in Seattle ;-). The breakfast was fabulous and I don't think I've ever had a better waffle! The location is PRETTY good for getting to the Marketplace. The way there is all downhill so no problem. I would definitely recommend the bus system to get back. In the off-season, it's free. But it would be worth the small amount in the peak season as well. It is a very steep uphill climb to get back. We would definitely return but ONLY if we got a really good rate again. I would not pay over $100 for a room here.

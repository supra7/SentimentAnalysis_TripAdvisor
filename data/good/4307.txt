We checked into the Hyatt after a 5 night stay at the Sheraton Maui. Checkin was smooth, my only complaint was that the checkin desk was so dreary! It was so different from the rest of the hotel. I wish they would put in a nice cheerful fish tank. Anyway, we were "terrace view" but it actually was partial ocean view...we were on the third floor in the Napali building. Our balcony overlooked the walkway leading to the pool/beach. The hotel is beautiful. I didn't interact with the staff that much, but everyone seemed friendly. Our room was very nice, upscale polynesian furniture. The bathroom was great: Seperate toilet and shower and a room for sink, bar area, and a seperate closet to stash your junk. I did a trip report on fodors/talk under "beachkomer". It has a lot of details about our trip. The pool was nice, smaller that I thought it was going to be. There is not a useable beach, but the lawn area next to the beach was nice and relaxing. Casscades restaurant was the only one we ate at, and had two great meals. We didn't do the luau. I would love to stay here again, IF the price is good! The hotel is beautiful.

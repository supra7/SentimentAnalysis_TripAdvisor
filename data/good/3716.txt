I stayed in this hotel a couple of years ago when I went for the Mobile World Congress. This was a last minute booking. Although, I has my reservations initially, I quickly found out that the best feature of the hotel is its location. Very close the the metro, La Ramlas, Placa Catalunya, a Gaudi house, not too far from the old town, etc. Lovely restaurants around, good areas to explore. The room was quite nice (modern and simple), the bathroom has no place to put your soap or toiletries, decent room service and friendly front desk staff. My room had an ante-room that faced the back street. Clean and cosy. The breakfast was not good at all (watery scrambled eggs and dripping bacon). The coffee shop staff was efficient and very helpful. I would go there again but would try and negotiate the price a little bit. Oh yeah...not many TV channels that you can watch. Was stuck with a Spanish game show until I discovered that the wifi was pretty good in the room.

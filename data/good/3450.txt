After a ton of research, my fiance and I chose Secrets Maroma Beach based on all the great reviews on TripAdvisor. While there were several positives, there were a few negatives that would cause me not to go back. The biggest negative for us was the lack of good music played by the pool and beach. Most of the time it was very soft music and was pretty quiet. There was hardly any upbeat pool music played and it made all the pool time a little less energetic and exciting. Wished we could have brought our own iPod speaker. The pool felt like warm bath water. I recognize that lots of pools are hot in the heat of the summer but this was by far the hottest one I've been in. Maybe b/c it's so shallow but it was a little too hot for me. The drinks were ok but not fantastic . You had to request top-shelf liquor and even when it was used, the drinks were not mixed very well. Overall, the place is beautiful, the food is decent (Italian was by far the best), drinks are ok, service is good...it just lacked the exciting factor that makes the best vacations stand out in my mind.

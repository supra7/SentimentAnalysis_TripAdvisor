We used Priceline to get this hotel for a weekend night at $55 when arriving at the airport in the evening. I called in advance to find out the shuttle procedure--up and over to aisle 1 or 3, then use the courtesy phone. Shuttle there in 5 minutes. Although we were going to use a car during our stay, we waited to pick it up the next morning to avoid the high self-parking rate. A group was having trouble checking in--another Priceline customer who had 4 people in their party and all that was available was 1-King rooms. Not the Hilton's fault. Priceline only assures room for 2 adults. So I tried out the self check-in terminal and entered my Hilton Honors number etc., but it could not print out keys. A second clerk appeared behind the desk just as I finished, so he made the keys. Because of Honors, given room facing interior courtyard and renovated. Bed very comfortable. Room fine. Toiletries nice. View of Mt Rainier next morning. Another line at desk the next morning, so I used the terminal to check out and dropped keys in box. Fruit available to snack on and a coffee stand with scones, etc. open, but we went to Dennys down the road for breakfast. A staff member was working hard to ensure everyone who needed to get to the airport was moving along, counting folks to fill a shuttle, getting ready for the next one. Would stay again if could get Priceline rate, but factor in cost of parking. Seattle hotels are so expensive!

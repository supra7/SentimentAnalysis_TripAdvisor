Pros: great location for beach and shopping, beautiful grounds, clean and comfortable room, friendly, helpful staff. Cons: paid for a garden view room and requested non smoking and on a higher floor. What I got was a room where the view was a small strip of grass and a few potted plants that overlooked the condos next door, in a smoking building (smoking only allowed on lanai so not a big problem) and on the ground floor. After i got over the initial disappointment with the lack of view from my room I was very happy with this hotel (plus the location of my room allowed me to "borrow" the wireless internet from the condo next door for free). It is very affordable plus has everything I was looking for. I will definately stay here again, but next time will pay for at least a partial ocean view.

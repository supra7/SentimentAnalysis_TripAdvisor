We stayed at the Hyatt Regency Maui for a week with our children ages 8 and 10. We were very pleased with the property in general. As other reviewers have stated, the grounds and pool were spectacular! The pool is a virtual Hawaiian paradise with waterfalls, caves and grottos and flowers floating around. There is a tube water slide which was a lot of fun also. Keep in mind that the water is deep (9 feet in places) and there are a lot of hidden grottos. Children who are not strong swimmers should be watched carefully, there is no life guard. There is a shallow, sandy area for the little ones, however, that is roped off from the main pool. The hotel uses a towel card system which is very cumbersome; I'm not sure of its purpose. I think a hotel of this caliber should assume you're not going to steal the towels. They use a wrist band to identify hotel guests that are currently using the pool- isn't that enough to fend off outsiders? The staff at the hotel were very friendly and approachable, We felt very much at home, even with our active boys! Breakfast at Swan court or Umalu was great. If you arrive later that 7:30am at Swan Court, you will have to wait for a table. There was never a wait at Umalu. We had an ocean view room on the ground floor. It was fine, though it needed a upgrade. Wallpaper peeling, bathroom fixtures corroded, etc. The walk-in closet was a nice touch. It was very quiet, however, and we slept well. All in all a great trip and we would recommend, particularly for families.

The Roosevelt was a great choice for my attendance at a conference at the Seattle Conference Center. More reasonably priced than the Sheraton or Hilton, and just as convenient. Was there four nights. Everything was generally fine - while not overly spacious, the room was a good size for one person, and had a good work desk area. The king-size bed was quite comfortable. Ironing Board /Iron were there, although there were only a couple of hangers in the closed. I asked at the desk after I got there, and more were placed in the room while I was at dinner. I did see a couple of minor maintenance issues. The floor lamp in the main room area couldn't be turned off. Two mornings in a row I stopped downstairs and asked if it could be fixed. Didn't happen. Don't know why - it did look like it had been touched, but it still didn't work. One of the window blinds didn't work very well either, and I had to get creative to keep them up at times. But beyond these minor irritations, the amenities and cleanliness of the room was just fine. The staff was very friendly and offered excellent recommendations for dining. Between that and the ease of access to the convention center, it was great.

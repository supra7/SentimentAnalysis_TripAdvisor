Working with Hotel Monaco was fantastic, Ariela was amazingly helpful with changes and altering the block of rooms and the dates of everyone coming into town. While at the hotel, the staff was super helpful and incredibly friendly. The rooms were comfortable and beautiful. We would recommend them highly for working to make your event wonderful!

We went here for a weekend getaway and had picutre perfect weather that San Diego is known for. The hotel is modern and clean with well maintained grounds. If you are looking to hang out in the gaslamp quarter, bring good walking shoes, as it is a good 10+ minute walk from the hotel. The outdoor pool was nice and had comfortable chairs to lounge in. There also is a paved promenade that runs along the water, great for taking walks. There also is now a skybridge to get across to Petco Park and the Gaslamp quarter, but it still is q good 10-20 minute walk from the hotel to this area. The restaurants within the hotel were completely understaffed. We tried to get breakfast one morning and were told it was a 45 minute wait. There were probably 20 tables that were completely empty! It was obvious they decided to understaff the restaurant and were not able to run at full capacity. Very disappointing! The Good: Pool Well priced Very close to Coronado Ferry Great views of downtown & water Rooms nicely appointed, comfortable beds and linens/towels The Bad: No free wi-fi Restaurants were understaffed to handle capacity Long walk to Gaslamp Quarter Would we stay here again, probably, but I think next time we will find something closer to gaslamp quarter.

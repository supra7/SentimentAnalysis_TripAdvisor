Fabulous boutique hotel adjacent to the fish market in Seattle. We stayed here for one short night before heading to Vancouver Island on our honeymoon, and we loved it. The service was great, and the front desk pointed us to a great spot for sandwiches at 10pm on a Sunday (not easy to do!) - the hotel had even put adorable chocolate covered strawberries in our room decorated like a bride and groom. This was a thoughtful and cute touch. We didn't have much time to explore the area around the hotel, but the room was very clean, we had a pretty view of the water/market and the bathroom was nicer than a standard hotel bathroom. We had brunch in the morning at the little breakfast place, which was tasty and hit the spot before our drive to the ferries. Oh, and the hotel has a cool outdoor patio on one of the higher floors that offers really incredible views. A stone's throw to Pike Place Market, too!

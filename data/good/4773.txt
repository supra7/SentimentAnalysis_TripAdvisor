We're just wrapping up an almost week-long stay here and have been extremely pleased with our choice. Our studio with garden view looks just like the pictures on the Outrigger site. Spacious. Not particularly modern or luxurious, but quite comfortable. Sufficient parking ... never had trouble getting a spot in the little lot near our room. The location is terrific. Walking distance to Whaler's Village, but not down in the noisier part of Kaanapali. Very quiet up here. We are in the far end (C building), but even then it's only a 5-10 minute walk to the Eldorado's beach cabana. Fantastic having access to that! Found out today you have to pay in other locations on the beach just to sit on a chair! Crazy. The cabana has lounge chairs, towels, bathroom, full kitchen. I would have given it five stars, but the housekeeping was a little odd. First day, it looked like someone got distracted mid-way, leaving a stack of five washclothes on the counter, not-needed second Kleenex box on the counter and additional toiletries thrown haphazardly into the basket, emptying of one trash bin but not others. Then one day, an overwhelming number of towels on the racks, the next day, spartan number. Yesterday, we were gone all day and came back at almost 4 to find it hadn't been cleaned yet. They showed at 4 and we just said to skip that day. That said, it was a pretty minor situation and didn't detract from us enjoying our stay. I'd highly recommend this place for the value. Great bargain in a pricey location. Also nice having the restaurants and gym across the street. Very convenient. CJ's Diner is great for any meal. Had breakfast and dinner there and both were very good. Great when you don't have reservations anywhere and just want a tasty, casual meal.

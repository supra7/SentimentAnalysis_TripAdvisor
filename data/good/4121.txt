We had a great time during our stay at the Maui Hyatt. I was surprised by how attentive and welcoming the staff were. Each and every staff really did their part to make our stay a memorable one. Even though the hotel was quite busy and packed with customers, the staff at Hyatt were professional, friendly and helpful! They even remembered our Wedding anniversary! The single only thing that could be improved is the weak water pressure of the shower head. Other than that, everything was quite perfect.

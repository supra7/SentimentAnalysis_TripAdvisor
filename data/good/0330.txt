Simple, modern, & idealistically located in downtown Bellvue Seattle. The staff was friendly. There was a very nice complimentary breakfast (yogurt, cereal, coffee, make-your-own waffle) and Pike's Market is about a 10 minute walk from there. The rooms are small but so is the price for a great location! Not too bad for the cost.

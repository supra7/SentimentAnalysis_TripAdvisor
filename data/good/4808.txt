We stayed there for 3 days and they, starting from the front desk, Mustapha, were all great in every detail. Helpful at all times in all our needs. They even managed to put us in our room as we arrived at 8 am, and they extended their hospitality further with smiles and Breakfast. If you want to visit the historic sites, then this place is just a walk away from all, the sole problem is the building next door that is being redone, so bare the noise.

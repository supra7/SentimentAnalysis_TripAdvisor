I almost gave this place 3 stars but it has a things going for it: the price, the location, and the staff. The hotel itself is a little shabby, eg. chipped paint, broken bathroom door, a little loud - but you simply CANNOT beat the price for the location. The hotel is right in the middle of Kaanapali Beach and walking distance to bars, restaurants, and shopping. Considering we were at the hotel only to sleep, it was fine. Anywhere else would be double or triple the price. The staff is really friendly and accommodating. The brought me a large fruit plate when I ordered the small one, didn't charge for coffee at breakfast, helped us book a shuttle to the airport last minute - nice stuff like that. The bar isn't so great. Go next door to the Sheraton for drinks and sit at the bar there for sunset - great view and great happy hour. This is definitely more of a "families from the Midwest" place and not so good for couples. I still think your best bet in this part of Maui is a condo with a kitchen since the restaurants are generally waaaaay overpriced for the quality of food you get. And that is coming from a San Francisco foodie who will pay stupid prices for a really great meal.....

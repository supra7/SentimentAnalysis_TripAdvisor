Great hotel for kids and adults too. We enjoyed the water slide as much as kids. The pool seemed to be one of the largest and best in that area of Lahaina. The room we had was an excellent partial ocean view, very clean. The live music was excellent during our stay. We were there during a time they had a band from a music college performing at all the different restaurants and pool, they were outstanding! They are only there 2 weeks out of the year. I thought the performance of the Drums of the Pacific Luau was good, but it would have been better if it started a bit later, the sun is blinding for the 1st part of the show. The food was about average for a luau but not bad. I thought the service for breakfast at the lower restaurant sucked for the massive price we had to pay. Is it so much to ask for a water, or an ice tea refill? Other than that, a great place.

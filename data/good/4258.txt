The Hyatt Regency offers a relaxing vacation in a beautiful setting. I liked the location as it is slightly further down the beach away from the hub bub of a few time share places and the Whalers Village. ( Try the Hula Grill at Whalers) We sprang for a ocean view in the tower on the 20th floor and did not regret it! Pool is beautiful, with adults on one side and the kids and kidstuff on the other. You can swim underneath a waterfall to a private bar area and then keep swimming under another waterfall to the kids area. There is a 150 foot lava tube to slide down! As expected, prices are high but I don't have any other Maui hotel prices to compare it to - we economized by going to Safeway and having our own breakfast in the room - splurged one day and had their delicious buffet in th Son'z restaurant. Service around the pool sketchy - some very attentive service people one or two not so much - high pool bar prices we thought - $8.00 for a no alcohol smoothy. $15 for a salad - we loved the star gazing on the roof, the hotel has hired a astronomer with a big telescope. We saw Sirius, Saturn and Mars. Absolutely a must do! Another great value is the $15 fee to go into the spa after you check out and your flight isn't until 9PM. The spa treatments are very pricey. We swam and then went for a sauna and a rest in the lounge area. Beautiful lanai picture window overlooking the blue Pacific. There is a really nice Macy's on the property with a nice variety of bathing suits and plenty of sizes. prices were comparable to the mainland ( Northern Calif) for a top brand. I would go back for sure.

We stayed here on our honeymoon and it was a pleasant stay. The staff was nice and welcoming and it has your traditional Hawaii'an feel. I didn't have any complaints about the room, it was clean and tidy. Their restaurant is very good. We ate their on 2 separate occasions and enjoyed it both times. When we first arrived their restaurant was closing in 5minutes but they still cooked our entrees for us which we devoured in our room. It was a skirt steak and they included a free slice of cheesecake cause it took a bit longer but I can't fault them since they were probably closing up. The other time I had their lamb which on the 3 course menu it was one of the best lamb chops I had and the dessert that came with it was also great. Their bar stand food is your typical bar food it was alright but I didn't like their fried calamari which was too greasy even for me. The location of the beach is a great location, near the end of it where it wouldn't get too crowded, the water and sand was nice but there wasn't much in the water. I find it's just more to sit there and relax. The time I went is considered the off season so it wasn't crowded. Overall, I enjoyed the stay here especially their restaurant food. If you're one of those who needs a more modern and updated room then perhaps this isn't the place for you. If you want a hotel that has a more traditional Hawaii'an feel then you would enjoy this place

My husband and I stayed there in August and we had a great experience. Very beautiful location near the pier so there are a lot of things to do that are walking distance and eat at great restaurants. We took a cruise and visited the aquarium. Our room was on the first floor- right on the water. We set on the balcony and watched the ferries crossing right in front of us. One morning we woke up with a cruise ship docked at the pier. Pretty cool view. The room was well put together - very romantic with warm colors, pretty soft bed, amazing fireplace, and pretty large bathroom has very nice soaps. The hallways are long with dimmed lights that look so 19th century. Everything was prefect except the kitchen forgot to deliver our breakfast at 7.30am due to a lost request:-( But the manager was so polite and professional, he let us order whatever we like from the menu, and we liked a lot :-) We are likely to stay there again once we are in Seattle.

We stayed at the Hyatt from 11/6/04-11/12/04, and the overall experience was great as we were of course in Maui but........... Almost daily housekeeping would not collect old towels, replace soaps. We had mold growing on the tile grout in the bathroom The water pressure was poor, like a leaking faucet. There was the constant sound of drilling, or construction work above our room, when we questioned it the desk simply said sorry, tough luck. There is a $15 per day service charge which is said to cover a short spread of what should be considered accommodations (included) The $10 valet contrary to other reviews, we received a tip from one of the hotel employees indicating that as long as we moved the car to the parking lot before 10:00 PM the first night, we would not be charged. This was a good tip because the lot is not far from the patio level, and the valet can back up heavily in the evening not to mention the savings. Overall the grounds were beautiful, the beach is a moderate stroll from the hotel as there is little beach front directly in front of the hotel which went from grass to water. For a five star hotel we were disappointed, the prices were that of a five star but I would say that this is more like a 4 star. It seems as if being at the top by way of 5 star rating has allowed for the reigns to slip slightly. We are not picky people as we could enjoy Maui from a campsite, but when we are solicited to be staying at the best, we pay for the best, we expect it.

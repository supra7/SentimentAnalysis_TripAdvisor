Perfect location for that early flight to the airport. Price somewhat higher than other area aiport hotels, but worh the extra amount. Area felt safe. The rooms were good size, free wi-fi. Sleep number bed wasn't all that wonderful. I couldn't ever get the room to the tempature I wanted. Food from room service was just okay (don't get the apple pie) Bathroom needed updating. But even with those gripes I would stay here again because the airport entrance was right across the street.

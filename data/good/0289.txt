The Inn was a warm and welcoming place. The location is fabulous. We had a beautiful room with a partial water view. The only problem we had was that there was very little water pressure in the shower. We had to call the front desk to send someone up to check. By the time the maintenance man arrived and remarked that the water restricter was on the shower head and needed to be replaced, it was time for us to go to dinner. We didn't get to shower and the front desk staff didn't seem bothered by the inconvience of the situation. Very strange. I guess they already knew the restricter would make showering a challenge.

Recently stayed at the Hilton bayfront during busy Comic Con weekend. For such a large event the hotel premises never felt crowded so that was a plus. Check-in was uneventful and swift, as was the Check-out. Rooms were pretty adequate for standard rooms. Bed was comfortable, lounge couch was a nice touch and the hdtv was also nice. The $18 for daily internet seems like a gouge. In this day and age, wireless internet should be standard and included with the price. Particularly if im paying over $300 a night. Vela breakfast buffet downstairs was good. $20 is fairly standard for a buffet and the selection was better than most buffets I've had at the same price level. Waiter service was particularly good. The sheer convenience and painless check-in/out of this hotel during an extremely busy event would make me consider coming back. The only thing I didnt like about its location was that you are kind of isolated from the heart of the gaslamp. So if you want places to eat youll have to walk up a bit. You'll get bored of the restaurant/bar downstairs after a few days.

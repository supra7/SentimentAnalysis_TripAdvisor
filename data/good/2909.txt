I've not stayed at a Hampton before this but I was very impressed. The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet. I heard just a faint bit of plane noise but nothing out of the ordinary if you live in a suburb of a big city! We all slept just fine. The breakfast was one of the nicer ones we had during our stay in the Seattle area which consisted of La Quinta's and Best Westerns. It had was a "glorified" continential breakfast and has something for everyone, truly. My hubby and kids used the pool and found it clean, warm and relaxing. We rented our car from Enterprise and it was just about 1 block away so quick access to drop off and back to airport if you catch an a.m. flight. We paid $119 on internet rate for family of 4. Can't beat the price/location if you need to fly the next day. I was impressed with Hampton, especially the beds and breakfasts.

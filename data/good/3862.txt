We booked this hotel not really knowing what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised by the location when we arrived - nice ocean view - boardwalk to Seaport Village and an easy 10 minute walk to the gaslamp area. We had a room which included breakfast which was a huge perk because the buffet breakfast was phenomenal! Scones and pastries, hot made to order omelettes, smoked salmon, you name it. Awesome! The people in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful, even when our 5 year old barfed all over the carpet one morning at breakfast. They sent help, asked if we needed a doctor, etc. The concierge was also helpful. The only thing I would say is that the food in general at the hotel was pricey for lunch/dinner/room service. I also was charged $3.99 for a pack of gum in the hotel store. The pool was heated and felt great. Didn't partake in any spa activities as we were with our kids. Rented a car for a day from Enterprise which was also super convenient. The car was ready for us in the morning.

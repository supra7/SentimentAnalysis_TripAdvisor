We had a king room, not much deluxe about it. It was small, as expected, but comfortable. Nice central location for walking just about anywhere downtown. We found a a great little tapas place a few blocks away across the freeway. Room was clean, bed very comfortable, room pretty quiet. We would stay there again, but would spring for a larger room if for the two of us. Room is spacious for one. Tub not very big, but quite deep. Only complaint is that the handles on the sink are difficult to use if your hands are slippery; there is nothing to grab on to, just a little "c" shape that your finger fits into.

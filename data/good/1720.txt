I really enjoyed my stay. The staff was incredibly helpful and accommodating. Soft but comfortable bed in room with views of harbor. Heard some hall noises but not too much. Wonderful bar/restaurant with great views and good "happy hour" snacks. The walk downtown was not long at all. Also took the free shuttle once. Would definitely consider staying there again, if room had views of the water.

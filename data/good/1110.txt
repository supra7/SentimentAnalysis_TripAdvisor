We traveled to Seattle from the San Francisco Bay Area by Amtrak and stayed two nights at the Hilton. The location is good. I would describe it as an upscale area of the business district. A beautiful view of the Sound or Bay from our window. We had a bit of a walk to Pike Place Market that was mostly flat, then downhill for about a block. The area is beautiful, so walking around was no problem. The room was very nice and clean. The hotel was quiet. I really appreciated getting away from the tourist hubbub each evening. The only downside, there was not much in the way of dining onsite for a family with small children. There is a bar off the lobby with a few tables and chairs and this was the "restaurant". I thought the limited menu looked pretty good for a business traveler, however, for children ages 6 and 11, not many choices. (I suppose that most visitors to Seattle prefer to eat out since there are so many excellent restaurants.) The hotel staff readily recommended a family friendly restaurant (Rock Bottom) less than 1/2 block walk away, which was a very good pizza/brewery with a varied menu but specializing in gourmet pizza choices. So, the inconvenience was very minimal. In fact, when we got to the restaurant, there was another family from the hotel that had been directed there by staff.

A friend and I stayed at Hotel Max for one night a few weekends ago. We chose it for the great location to downtown restaurants and shopping. It was the perfect location and a 2 minute walk to shopping, and a 10 minute walk to the market. The hotel had a cool European boutique hotel feeling, and don't forget, in Europe things are smaller, like the bathrooms! If you need a lot of space or have mobility issues you may want to check out something different. In our room there was a stair to get to the bathroom. However, both of us were completely content in our cozy room. The beds were very comfortable, real duvet covers is always appreciated. Friendly and helpful staff. No complaints. Will return!

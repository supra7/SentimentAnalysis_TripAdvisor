We just arrived home from our amazing honeymoon in Maui. KBH is a wonderful place to stay. It is in a prime location where there is a lot to do. The beach is so beautiful. We had a room facing the water and just watched the sunset from our balcony~ can it get any better?! The main goal of the staff is to make you a part of their Ohana (family) and they really excel at it. When it was time to say goodbye, it was such a bittersweet ending. We definitely hope to come back and visit our new family at KBH.

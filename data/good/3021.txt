Rooms are a nice size, clean. Had a room with two beds facing the inner courtyard on 1st floor. It was quiet and we could not hear hear any noise from the airport. Light rail train was opposite the hotel and is convenient for those with no car. Parking costs $20/day which allows in & out privileges. Hotel had a restaurant and also an area you could purchase coffee, muffins, cereal for breakfast in the morning. There is also a Denny's about a block away. Air conditioner in the lobby is on super high and is very cold. Even in the summer.

Stayed here in dec 2011. A bit further away from central but was easy to get around by train. The hotel is much nicer than the area that it is in. Rooms are larger than other hotel rooms we've come across in Germany. When we first got there, we opened the bathroom bin and there was rubbish in there from the previous guest. The second day we went out and left a "do not disturb" sign on the door. This was ignored and housekeeping came and made up the room anyway. I advised reception who apologised and said they would follow it up for me. All went well until the second last day we were there. We put the "do not disturb" sign on the door as we had done previously and it was ignored by housekeeping again. We had also left a bottle of wine in the room next to a used glass and housekeeping filled the glass with some of the wine. No idea why. I called reception and explained that housekeeping had come in again and the response I got was "ok..." followed by 5 seconds of silence. I asked why this had happened again, told them it was a privacy breach and said I had private things in the room. I finally got an apology and was told that they would follow up with the duty manager. I don't appreciate the fact that the staff did not respect our privacy and they didn't seem particularly worried when housekeeping disobeyed the sign. I want to leave a hotel during the day knowing my belongings are safe and this hotel did not make me feel this way. Fir this reason, I will not be staying at a best western hotel again.

I loved this place!!! It really has almost everything, and I could have (and would have) just stayed to relax and enjoy the resort each day if I hadn't already booked off-site tours during my stay. The rooms were comfortable and lovely, the grounds were gorgeous (the gardens, waterfalls, exotic birds, torch-lit walkways at night, etc.), the shop were plentiful, and the spa was heavenly. For those who like large sandy beaches, this is not the place for you, but a large sandy beach is a short walk down the ocean-front walkway. I personally enjoyed being able to lie on a lounge chair at the edge of the grassy area overlooking the ocean without getting sand between my toes (there is a thin beach area for sand-lovers). The kids' area of the pool is separated from the main pool by a swim-through cave-type area, so it was never too kid-infested for me (and I have kids - they LOVED it, especially the long tube slide). The service was friendly, and I highly recommend the luau - not necessarily for the food, but for the quality entertainment. Prepare to pay, though (and come with a prepaid calling card if you want to phone home, or you'll be unpleasantly surprised at your phone bill through the hotel) - this kind of luxury comes with a price, but for paradise, well worth the splurge. Truly lovely and memorable.

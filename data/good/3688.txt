Nice friendly staff, tidy rooms. For boutique read small but it's comfortable and pleasant. Being near the Trevi it's fairly busy, very touristy but that said, I had a room overlooking the street and it didn't keep me awake as the glazed windows and black out blinds removed any disturbances from outside. Free wifi. Helpful staff. All in all I'd happily stay here again. One thing I will mention and the reason I have marked them down slightly on cleanliness - the room was cleaned each day while I was there however in the bin in the bathroom I noticed a ladies deodorant that had been disposed of. It was still there when I left. But it didn't bother me and the hotel is certainly clean.

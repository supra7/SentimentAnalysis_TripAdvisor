This was our third and final stop on Hawaiian honeymoon. The hotel was very nice, clean, with a great pool. I did not love our room location though, we were on the bottom level near a doctor's office and the entire floor hallway smelled awful. The location of the hotel was perfect. My husband and I got a lot of use out of the pool, which we really enjoyed. There seemed to be many businesses having company trips at this hotel--which we didn't experience on the other two islands we visited. We had the breakfast buffet one morning instead of leaving the property. It's in an open air environment and the staff was not at all on top of picking up the left behind plates--so birds was an issue. It was also expensive. We did have sushi at the cafe near the pool, which was great for a quick bite and pretty good food. On our final day we had a late flight back to Connecticut (red eye). The pool has a locker room with showers, so we were able to clean up after hanging out all day--which was great.

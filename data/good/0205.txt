We stayed 2 nights with a toddler. The room was fine and quite nice for a 3 star hotel. The location is nice and you can walk anywhere in the shopping area of downtown Seattle, including the market. Across the street was a grocery/deli store that was open late and you could grab food or a coffee. We would stay again. Th only negative were the staff. When we checked in (which was late at night after traveling with a toddler), they gave us a room that was not cleaned. Then we switched rooms and then they gave that room to someone else. When we checked out and caught a taxi early in the morning, no one helped us or even opened a door. There were tons of staff in the lobby (no other clients) and we had a toddler, stroller and LOTS of luggage. The doors are not automatic, so imagine us trying to get out and organized! Not one person even said hello. The lobby is small and they could not have missed us. That was very disappointing.

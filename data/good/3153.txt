If in Berlin on a tight budget but tired of ratty rooms, economy look and feel, then this is your hotel. For the price, this hotel offers contemporary style, bright, sunny rooms, a large and pleasant bathroom. The staff is attractive, attentive and professional and the lobby area and breakfast feel like that of a much more expensive property. The working class neighborhood, however, has little to offer in the way of sights or restaurants, requiring one to walk 10 minutes (three blocks) to the U-bahn to access any night life, attractions or central districts. If you don't mind being off the beaten path, this hotel is a pleasant experience at a budget price.

My husband and I stayed for 5 days at the Outrigger Maui Eldorado in a Garden View Studio Unit [Room K111] in late September. We were both surprised with the size of the studio unit - large in comparison with NZ size studio units. The room was spacious and had a rather homely feel to it, with dining table for 4 inside and outside dining/lounge area, comfortable lounge suite and a large queen/king size bed. The room also included full kitchen facilities including washing machine and dryer - though the dryer wasn't working properly in our room, but the hotel has laundry facilities. The hotel is within walking distance to a few restaurants and 5-10mins drive to Lahaina Mall where there is a supermarket, which my husband and I made regular trips to for groceries during our stay. Location is fantastic and a good spot to explore West Maui and what it has to offer. The accommodation also has its own store where you can purchase goods. On our last day we used the hotel's large pool .... and we pretty much had it all to ourselves. There is also a complimentary trolley bus that picks you up from in front of the hotel and drops you off at several other hotels [including Whalers Village]. We used this facility when we went to the Lu'au at the Hyatt.

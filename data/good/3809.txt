Go ahead & get the suite with the hottub in your room, you won't regret it! Iguana's were outside the room, flowers in the room everyday. The beach was beautiful, the only thing I have to say that wasn't great, was the service is slow, order 2 drinks when you order, because it will take a few minutes to get it. It was worth it for the great views & memories.

I was researching hotels like mad and finally used the secret hotels deal to try and get a good deal and got the Edgewater. At first I was nervous because I read reviews that said that this hotel was off path. I was worried that we would get too stuck in the hotel and need to eat at the hotel all the time. This wasn't the case at all. We loved being on a pier and on the water--it was super relaxing even though we had a city side room. Our city view for new year's eve was perfect as we got to see the fireworks over the space needle at midnight from the room. We could see the space needle from our beds and everyday we ate at the market and walked all over-- both to Pike Place and Seattle Center as the Edgewater is located right in the middle of the two. We easily got to Belltown on foot and to Fremont and Capitol hill on the metro. It was easy to get around Seattle with many transportation options and we took the lightrail back to the airport for $4. The hotel felt super cozy and comfortable. My room was really quiet which is something that is very important to me. I'm sensitive to noise. The beds were really comfortable and the fireplace was a treat. The room had really high ceilings and we enjoyed the room a lot even though the style was different than a minimal/modern style that I would usually desire. The only negatives for me were that I asked for a wake up call for 8am on my airport departing day and I didn't get one. Also on the one day that I asked the guest services guy for directions he gave us the wrong directions for taking the bus. The restaurant was beautiful but the salmon dish I had was just ok especially compared to other food around the area. Overall I love staying at the Edgewater and would stay again in in a heartbeat or look at Hotel 1000. I love Seattle! It's a beautiful city!

I stayed for 5 nights in this hotel and it was ok. I don't think that they deserve 4 *,maybe 3*.The internet wasn't working properly (in one day it didn't work about 10 hours and another day 12 hours) but they charge me for the whole day (24 h/8 euro). The breakfast it's basic.I didn't have a shower gel in the bathroom,but it had a jacuzzi.The location is the best quality of this hotel,on a walking street full of shops,cafes and ice creams,very close to Fontana di Trevi (1 min).

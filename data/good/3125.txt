This hotel is right across the street from the airport, which made getting to that early morning flight a breeze! The hotel lobby was very clean and inviting. The desk staff was friendly. The pool was great! The room was clean and quiet. The crib for our baby was clean and sturdy. We had one minor issue with this hotel - the kitchen was being remodeled during our stay and no one at the front desk mentioned this upon check-in. When I called room service to order dinner, I was told that the kitchen was closed and I could only order off a temporary menu containing cold items (e.g., salad). The menu, which was apparently supposed to be on the bed upon arrival, was nowhere to be found in our room. We had to make a separate trip out of the hotel to find something for dinner. It was a slight inconvenience, and it would have been nice to know this before we got our two young kids out of their winter gear and settled down.

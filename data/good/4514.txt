We stayed here and paid $132 a night, and for that I'd say it was a great buy. We were given a room with two double beds for the first two nights of our four night stay despite having requested a king, but that was the only hiccup and it wasn't a big deal. I've stayed a few of the placed on Kaanapali beach and this is on par with the lower end of those hotels (the Whaler next door has a very similar level of service). The included breakfast was nice to have available (the coffee is undrinkable however - starbucks is a short drive) and saved us time on early mornings. There is live music in the poolside area at night and it was great - not too loud but we could listen if we opened up the lanai. I'd stay here again for sure.

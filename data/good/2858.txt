Stayed at the Embassy suites for 4 days, it was slightly dated, but overall good. The full breakest was excellant, with plenty to eat (made to order omlets or eggs, bacon, hash browns, pancakes, etc). The only complaint was after breakfast or after the happy hour manager special, the floor of the dining area was extremely messy with popcorn/snacks dropped on the floor. The same mess was there the following day before breakfast. The rooms were clean. The shuttle service was nice, however airport shuttle service takes priority and there were times you may have to wait 20 minutes. The drivers were very pleasant and helpful. the front desk was pleasant most of the time giving google directions if needed. There is nothing open as far as nightclubs after 10:00 that is walkable. The train station if fairly close but not walkable. You can take the shuttle to the train station (Sounder at tacoma or airport) to go downtown....but do not advise to take a car to the train station in Tacoma as the parking lot was extremely full all the time. the pool was very small and hot tub also was small, but ok. Business center had 2 computers, which were used most of the time, so if you wanted one, I had to use it off hours such as later at night. View was beautiful, could see Mt Renier from one side of the hotel. There's a bike trail next to the hotel if you have a bike. We didn't use the restarant, it was closed in the evening (as well as much of the other establishments in the area).

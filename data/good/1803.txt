After staying at one hotel in Seattle, then spending two nights in Olympic National Park, my wife and I stayed at the Sorrento Hotel for two nights. We stayed in a junior suite (Room 400), which was very nice -- large and well decorated. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very spacious. The room also had nice couches where we could relax and watch television on the nice HD television. We were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel even provided us with chocolates and a bottle of wine! While staying at the Sorrento, we ate lunch at the hotel restaurant (The Hunt Club), which was very good. Even though I wanted an item that was not on the menu, the chef whipped it up for me anyway - quite impressive! The only downside, if any, was that the hotel just far enough from downtown and the water that it makes the walk back and forth somewhat of a pain (although definitely do-able). The hotel, however, has a complimentary (you must tip) Mercedes SUV that takes you within 2 miles of the hotel. Overall, a great trip and hotel. I would recommend the hotel Sorrento to couples visiting Seattle. If available, ask for room 400!

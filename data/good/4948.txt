We booked this hotel via its website and chose the sunday arrival special promotion, which included a free wednesday night stay as well as receiving 80 dollars/day resort credit for food and beverage, on top of daily complimentary breakfast. 6 day stay for bout 1100 dollars including taxes and fees. Arrived at the resort via a side road off the highway, and yes, the dirt road is still filled with huge potholes but nothing any ordinary car can't handle. Check in was effortless and we were given a quick tour of the hotel by the very friendly concierge. Rooms were good sized, clean and included your own grassy yard, outdoor tub and literally a couple feet away from the beach. The pool, poolside bar and spa area were tastefully designed and the beach was beautiful with nice huts, a hammock and free snorkels and water shoes available for use. The beach around the hotel though is rocky and isn't particularly suited for swimming unless you walk a short distance upwards. Hotel staff overall were courteous and helpful. Ismael made great cocktails and you have to ask for the coffee flambe (quite an experience). Food at the hotel's restaurant Naay was overall pretty superb. Daily homemade breads and yogurt with honey as well as the chef's own special habanero sauce is to die for. There is a daily turndown service as well which includes a different small desert treat waiting for you every night. Things which could be improved on would be the gym. The weight machine is essentially a piece of junk that doesn't work, and the area itself is pretty small and cramped, but I guess people don't go to resorts to work out till their nuts explode. Overall, great value for money, considering we payed less then 1100 for 5 night stay, and pretty much took care of food and beverage for the entire trip. Also a nice little secluded piece of paradise away from the typical young, noisy and annoying spring breakers. Will return again.

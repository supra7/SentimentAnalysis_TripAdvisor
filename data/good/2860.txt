After staying at the Best Western across the street for one night, we opted to look for nicer lodging. My wife got an excellent rate here so we gave it a try. The location is great for getting to and from the airport and is also very near shopping and several dining choices. The hotel is also about 12 minutes away from downtown Seattle. The rooms are clean and roomy, the staff seemed very nice and helpful. The business center was very convenient as I needed to print some tickets for a ball game. The breakfast is very good as well. The only negatives I can find are they charge for wi-fi and there is quite a bit of train traffic behind the hotel, so if you have a room on the back of the building ( like we did) there is some noise from the trains. And really, $10 for wi-fi, Boooo! We stayed in cheaper hotels that provide it for free.

This was our first trip to Seattle. We found the Hotel Max to be very well located, both near where we needed to drop the hire car off and also near where tours left from, shopping etc. The hotel has been recently renovated and definitely has a theme going on (with pictures of rockbands on every door). We found the room comfortable, although the bathroom was very very small to the point of being a bit of a pain. Still if it's a tradeoff between that and having more space in the main room, I guess they made the right decision. There is also no free wifi in room. Check in and checkout process was painless. There is also a very good happy hour at the restaurant/bar attached to the hotel.

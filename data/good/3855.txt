This is located right next to the convention center and across from the Gaslamp district. Because I am a Hilton Gold member, I was upgraded to a bayview along with free breakfast at Starbucks as well as internet and spa. However, if you are not, then you would have to pay for all these separately. People were nice and the place was clean and new. I would definitely stay here again. The only reason it missed 5 stars was the housekeeping. They didn't go the extra miles they easily could have. For example, we needed a couple of more hangers and when the housekeeping came to our room to clean, we asked her for them and her answer was that she was too busy and we had to call housekeeping.... I was thinking, is she not housekeeping and she can't handle this? Also the cleaning time was erratic. One day, they came at 4pm to clean? Even with that, I still like the place.

My sister and I went to Seattle for a sister weekend trip and stayed at the W. Like all the other reviews mentioned, they are currently going through a renovation. However, the service is still great. Our check in was smooth and they upgraded us to a superior room. There were coffee and yummy donuts in the am and water/ice tea and cookies in the pm for us to snack on. On our last day, they helped us check in and print our boarding pass for our flight back home. We had a great stay. The only complain I have is that they did not re-supply the bath products after our first night. Not a big deal though.

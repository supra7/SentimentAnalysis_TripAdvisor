The hotel is conveniently located in downtown and we were able to walk to many of the tourist attractions. Our room was located on above the 30th floor and had a decent view of Seattle. All rooms are located around the elevators and the voices and noise of doors closing woke me up a couple of times. It was a bit busy and hectic hotel.

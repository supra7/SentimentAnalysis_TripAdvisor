Date: Traveled 12/17-12/24 Just returned from this trip with my two children, 17 and 13. I had not been to Maui since 1979. I booked through Expedia and upgraded to an ocean view room. It was well worth the extra. Loved the pleasant atmosphere at the hotel. Does not have the bells and whistles of an upscale hotel but it certainly met our needs. Small pool with a cute little Tiki grill for lunch hot dogs and burgers. While the pool was small, you could get a chair anytime. I walked to neighboring hotels and by 10am on such a peak week, chairs were not available, so I liked the casualness and lesser crowd. Definitely a relaxing family experience. One small problem, the shower/tub stall did not drain well, so we justed paced our use.

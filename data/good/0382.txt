Stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. My room, #2652, had good views of the Space Needle and downtown. A day before arrival, I checked the 'Specials' section on the hotel's website, and saw the 'Upgrade to Club Level' promotion. At check-in, the front desk staff seemed a little skittish about letting me use it, but got back to me a minute later, and said it was okay. Pros: Safe/good location, friendly staff, and (with 'Upgrade to Club Level') free computer/internet access in business center on 5th floor & free cont. breakfast, on 32nd floor. Cons: Not enough elevators for amount of guests/floors, which created slightly long waits. This is probably unavoidable, due to the sheer number of people who stay there before going on cruises.

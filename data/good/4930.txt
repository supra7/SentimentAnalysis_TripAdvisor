From the moment we entered the hotel we knew we made the right choice. The person at the desk was very welcoming and went out of his way to do make sure that we got everything in ok and that we had everything we needed. The room was nice too. Everything was very clean and working properly. The fact that there is a grocery store a few doors down from the hotel was very handy, especially because we had a fridge and stove in our hotel room. Making our own breakfast saved us a lot of money. The location is a great one. We did not use our car or even public transit to get places. We were within walking distance of everything we wanted to see (Molson Stadium, Old Montreal, shopping on Saint-Catherines). Within a block of the hotel you have a grocery store, convenience store, bakery, 24-hour coffee shop, and many other cafes and stores. We strongly recommend this hotel.

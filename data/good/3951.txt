My review will be short because we were only sent here from our actual hotel, the Bristol because they overbooked. All I can say is these were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. I hate to be cliche but it was literally like sleeping on a cloud. The lobby was really beautiful and rooms were clean. Since we only stayed one night that's about all I can say about it!

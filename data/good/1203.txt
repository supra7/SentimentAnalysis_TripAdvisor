I stayed at the Sheraton for three nights at the end of September, sharing a room with my parents as we toured Seattle. While the room rates are good value, be prepared for hefty surcharges for parking and incidentals. The Sheraton is a large hotel, divided into two towers. Having been recently renovated, the public areas of the hotel are attractive and clean, while our guest room was modern, comfortable, but somewhat small. Beds were comfortable and the standard amenities were present. What sets the hotel apart from the other business hotels is the solid fitness center and pool. Located on the top floor, the pool features fantastic views and is large enough to accommodate lap swimming. Likewise, the fitness center itself is over two floors with plenty of cardio and weight equipment and never felt cramped. If you're visiting Seattle for the first time, consider staying here: the location is perfect. Pike Place Market is just a few minutes away, while Capital Hill is just 10-15 minutes away by foot.

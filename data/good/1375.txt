Got a great price at an excellent downtown hotel. Checking in was fast and the room was extremely well-appointed. They have a TWO-level gym on the 35th floor with astounding city views. The gym is far superior to any hotel gym I've seen with twenty aerobic machines and many free weights and benches. I got in two workouts during my overnight stay. Now for the annoying news. In this day of free hotel WI-FI, the Sheraton charges guests $9.95 per day for a hard-wired network connection. Business travelers expect free Internet these days; however, I was able to justify it because of the low room price I got, The real kicker, though, was the $10.00 "handling" fee they charged me for receiving a UPS shipment. That, in my opinion, was way out of line.

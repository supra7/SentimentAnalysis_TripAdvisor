Great view and food. Be sure to eat lunch in the World Cafe, not the barbeques on the beach where you are in line with the local workers for food. The World Cafe had a tremendous buffet with cooked to order fish and meat. Breakfasts were outstandng. Check in was slow, we asked for a 4th floor room (to see the ocean) and was told our bed type(king) was not available -....then realized they have eight other buildings each with a 4th floor.. ..they would not search for us. The housekeeping was another issue - they did not make up the beds until after 4:30 each day....when they forgot to leave us fresh towels (took the old and didn't bring new) and we phoned the front desk ....we came back to our room and found, not the four towels we had requested....but four bathrobes! Also the nightly turndown is at 10 p.m. We would recommend you do unpack your "NYC attitude"......they need a bit of proding. It was great to be in an adult only resort .....no crying or unruly children. An added touch was the wild animals in the bushes next to the resort and the 1/2 parrot 1/2 bird creature.

I loved this hotel. When you walk in there are oversized couches and a large fireplace in the lobby which make you feel like you just walked into your house. The concierge is extremely accomodating. The decor is uber chic and trendy. The bar is also downstairs next to the lobby - very open room. The rooms are small in size but chic and comfortable, especially the bed. Views from the room are great - looking on downtown Seattle. Great room service and staff also!

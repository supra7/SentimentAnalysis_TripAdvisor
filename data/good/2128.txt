I tagged along with my wife who had a 4-day conference at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised--food, service, decor and views (we were on the 40th floor) were great. While the exterior of the hotel might look worn the rooms all look like they've been redone in the "W' style recently with nice wood, plush comforters and pillows and a decent TV. For a downtown city hotel the pool was substantial--my wife and I could be in it with little ones splashing and still enjoy ourselves. We watched the Super Bowl at their lobby bar on their flat screens and had a great time--only bummer was the Seahawks losing! Close to everything--Pike's Market, Space Needle and tons of shopping.

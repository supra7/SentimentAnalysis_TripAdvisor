Just got back. Hotel is in a great location. We walked everywhere, up to the Paramount theater, down to Pike's Place. Light rail is 1 block away to airport. Bus is 1 block away and free for downtown. Staff was always very friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the Andaluca restaurant was very good. Street noice is a little loud but it is a downtown hotel. I'm a light sleeper but I didn't find it too bad.

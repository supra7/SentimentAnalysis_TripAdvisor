Informative front desk staff. Friendly housekeeping staff. Very comfortable beds. The 'Art of Two Queens' ( i.e 2 double beds) provides a large room. We liked that the windows opened in the rooms. (or you could you the air-con). If you're from B.C., Washington, or Oregon, ask for the 'Staycation' rate which provides very good value (a breakfast coupon, in-and-out valet parking in a secured parking lot). My only qualm is that the hotel doesn't provide free internet use (beyond 15 minutes a day). Overall, however, Hotel Max is an excellent choice for staying in downtown Seattle.

We put together a last minute adult family vacation for my wife's 50th birthday. We looked at many of the hotels in Cancun, due to great deals, but decided on this hotel becuase my sister in law is in the travel industry and recommended this property. She was also able to get us a great deal for the trip. The property is beautiful, the service is impeccable but the food was not phenominal. Above average.

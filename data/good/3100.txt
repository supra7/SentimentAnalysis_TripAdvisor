We stayed at the Radisson Gateway before and after flights to Hawaii in December. We were very pleased with the hotel. Our room was very nice, clean and a very nice decor. The desk manager also told me they are renovating the hotel in 2010 and I was a little shocked. I didn't think it needed it at all. We had a rainshower head in the bathroom, which I found very pleasant. There was a 32" flatscreen and we loved the sleepnumber beds. We were a little disappointed that the restaurant was closed for dinner the day we arrived but the bar was still serving food. The restaurant opened for breakfast at 6:30 but the hotel does serve coffee in the lobby from 4 am for those with early flights. There is also a computerd provided in the lobby to check your flights and there is a printer at the front desk should you need it. Although we didn't use the pool and gym then looked very nice and the gym is 24 hours. The 24 hour shuttle to the airport took us right to the place we needed to be to check in for our Alaska Air flight. The hotel is right across the street from the airport and those that just missed the shuttle would just walk across. All in all our 2 nights (before and after Hawaii) were comfortable and I wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel in the future.

The funny thing about this place is, I was looking through old photos (1997) 0.3MP camera before we left, and when we arrived, very few things had changed! Even with that said, I still think looking around the other hotels on the island, it's definitely one of the nicer ones when you're on a budget. Great for families as well. With all that said, I have no regrets choosing the Hyatt Regency, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

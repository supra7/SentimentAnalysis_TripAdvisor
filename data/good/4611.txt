Just returned from our 5th visit to Kaanapali Beach Hotel. We had 2 weddings on Maui and as always we stayed at the KBH since it has the best atmosphere, the ohana (family) spirit, which will make you feel welcome. And yet at the same time you share the same greeat beach and amenities of Kaanapali as you would by paying twice or three times as much at the surrounding resort hotels. It may only be a 3 star rated hotel, but the feeling of being at home, with the large uncrowded garden space and the free nightly entertainment will make up for it. The 3 restaurants available give you great choices for good but reasonably priced food. The guest services personnel will give you the friendliest and efficient service for all your other actitivities you may want to enjoy while you are on Maui. Say a special Aloha to Malihini - she is the best. So if you want to enjoy Maui at a reasonable cost and still feel like you are being treated as family - stay at the KBH. Opawalt

We stayed here for five nights and felt very happy with our choice. We loved the fact that it is a little out of the main centre (but within easy walking distance) and right on the bay. We upgraded by 20 dollars per day for a better view over the bay and city skyline. Nice room, great view, clean and modern with comfy bed. Didn't use the pool but it looked lovely. The only let down is the service which is patchy. At the bar in Vela the staff were disinterested, gum chewing and unprofessional. The staff in the restaurant were pleasant enough but there were not enough of them. This was a pity as the food was good and deserved service to match. This was also true of the concierge service which was very hit and miss. Check your bill. We had a "fall fun" package which included 35 dollars per day spend which had not been taken off our bill. Take a Flagship harbour cruise early on in your stay as it is well worthwhile and is a pleasant way to get orientated. Also do visit USS Midway for a fantastic day out. Overall a great stay in San Diego.

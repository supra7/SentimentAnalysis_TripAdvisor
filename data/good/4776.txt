We stayed at the El Dorado (http://www.vrbo.com/75882) from May 28 to June 2, 2007 on our honeymoon. We wanted to stay on the Ka'anapali Beach and wanted to save money as well. I do not regret our stay at the El Dorado; it is very close to all the resorts on the Ka'anapali Beach. We actually loved the beach the El Dorado was on. On one occasion we saw tuna and turtles swimming there. They have a very nice cabana on the beach. This is not a place to stay if you want to be pampered or luxury. This is a very nice and quiet place to stay. This studio has all the amenities of home. I would recommend this place to a couple that wants to be on one of the most desired beaches and likes to save money.

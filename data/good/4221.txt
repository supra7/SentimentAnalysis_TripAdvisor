This was the first hotel accomodation of our 3-Hawaiian Isand adventure. In terms of the room, it was quite standard. Nothing stood out in a bad way so that's a good sign. The hotel itself was quite impressive. Colorful birds, penguins & flowers everywhere you walked. It was definitely a treat for the eyes. We didn't get a chance to canoodle at the pool as we were set on heading out to the beaches but the pool was nice enough, towel exchange was present, etc. There was a mandatory resort fee (about $20) that gave you access to their fitness center and towel exchange for the pool. The gym was quite nice but do go out for a morning job along the beach (something I wish I put in time for). The only real complaint I had with the "hotel" was one valet parking attendant who seemed to really hate her job. It showed and wasn't a very appealing interaction for us (travellers who expected pleasant and friendly?). Aside from that, the hotel delivered in what was expected from the glitz of Hawaii to the simplicity of stolen moments for lovers. I'd recommend it for those looking for a "nice hotel". Side note: the spa shampoo and lotion they supplied for the rooms was aromatically delicious. It kept my skin feeling nice, soft and the lingering smell of mango was truly decadent.

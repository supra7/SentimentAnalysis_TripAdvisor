We stayed at the Kaanapali Beach Club (KBC) on the same trip and prior to staying at the Hyatt...NO COMPARISON! The Hyatt had everything we needed and our 3.5 yr old had the absolute best time in the swimming pools. We were not notified by the broker - Robert [--] - that the KBC swimming pool would be under renovations during our stay which was the main reason we stayed there. We will definately stay at the Hyatt next time for the whole trip.

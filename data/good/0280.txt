My husband and I took a few days off from the family and stayed at the Inn at the Market. We enjoyed our stay. The service was good but sometimes a off. But overall we had a nice stay. It is a splurge for us but if you can get a discount, its even better. Can't beat the location. Good restaurants nearby.

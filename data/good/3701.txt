We chose this hotel for its central location and were not disappointed - most main attractions are within walking distance. In general the staff were friendly and professional. The room was of a good standard - well air conditioned and well sound-proofed from the bustling streets outside. The breakfast offered was very good although as other reviews have mentioned the breakfast room is small so with a toddler (no high chairs available) and small baby, we opted to have breakfast served in our room after the first day - no extra cost - and this worked fine for us.

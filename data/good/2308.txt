I stayed at the Vintage Park for a week while on business in Seattle. My flight got in early and they were able to accomodate me, but in a very small room. Being that I was going to be there for so long, I asked if I could be moved to a bigger room, which they did without hesitation. Needless to say, the staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. The location of the hotel is great - across from the public library and within a few blocks of central shopping areas, and the public market. Their restaurant, Tulio was also very good.

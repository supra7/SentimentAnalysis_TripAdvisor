The Mayflower Park is a routine destination of ours during the Christmas season. It is a beautifully restored historic hotel in the heart of downtown Seattle, within walking distance of a host of shopping, dining and entertainment opportunities. With their seasonal specials and broad spectrum of complementary extras it is a very good value. Valet parking is expensive ( $29 /day) but inline with other hotels and Seattle taxes and fees are ridiculous ( not a Mayflower Park problem) The highlights: near perfect location, competently managed, excellent staff at all positions, well maintained and cleaned, have a very good restaurant ( Andaluca) and a great lounge ( Oliver's); internet / local telephone/ daily newspaper are all complementary, lots of TV channels on a modern flat screen, very good bed and linens. Some of the minor shortcomings are just because it is an historic hotel ( built in 1927 and remodeled many times): two painfully slow elevators serve the 12 floors ( at a busy time it can be a long wait); rooms come in a variety of shapes and sizes, some like ours were rather compact ( an observation not a complaint, we were offered others); the lobby men's rest room is 2 flights of stairs down ( and up), the walls are are not exactly soundproof ( our neighbor had a persistent cough). Two short comings that need to be addressed for this quality of hotel: The HVAC in our room was very noisy ( electrical contactor clanked loudly about every 15 minutes during the night when the unit came on /off and the air handler is very loud)- difficult but not impossible to address. Easy to address is the lack of shower gel in the bathroom and the tiny, medium weight bath towels- not even close to what should be offered in this quality of hotel. The positives far outweigh the negatives at the Mayflower Park and that is why we keep coming back.

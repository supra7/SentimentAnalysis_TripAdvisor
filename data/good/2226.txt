I've just returned from staying here for 5 days on business.This hotel offered a nice continental breakfast each day. They had waffle irons to make homemade waffles and feel a little less like being away from home. The woman overseeing the breakfast was so sweet and friendly each morning. They also had a mid day snack daily and it also was quite a selection. The front lobby has a dish of candies and was sampled on many occasions. The room was enjoyable with a refigerator and microwave. It had a wonderful triangular window extending past the edge of the building allowing for a great view to look out upon the city.

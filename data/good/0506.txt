Booked this hotel without knowing more than it was a budget hotel. At check-in, my friends and I, were met by a friendly, warm, welcome. The rooms, as you might have read in other reviews, are simple but charming. Beds-OK, bathroom-OK, really big closet, and a nice little kitchenette. The breakfast could not be described as a great experience, but who needs that when you have your own little kitchenette? Bring coffee from the lobby and prepare your own bacon and eggs, that can be bought from a supermarket located not more than 150 metres away. What made the stay a great experience was the friendly staff (especially Dana), conveniant compementary shuttle service, low price, and the great location. A 10-15 minute walk you are in the city center, 2 minutes to Key Arena, (20 minutes to Hooters restaurant), 20 minutes to Pike Market, 8 minutes to Space Needle. /// Anders with friends

Beautiful hotel. It was a real treat to stay in the Beatle's Suite. Dinner was fantastic at Six Seven. Portions were on the smaller side in this "super-size" culture. Definitely sit outside! My only suggestion would be for the hotel to comp the $35 parking fee. Especially, if you just spent $400 for a one night stay and $200 at hotel restaurant.

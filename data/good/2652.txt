This is an older hotel which has been updated. The updates are lovely. Our room was large with a separate entrance area with flowers and closet space. The room it self looked out at the city. Beautiful bed and furnishings. Check in was quick. One just has to remember to use your room key to use the elevator. There was breakfast in the morning in the bar which was very adequate. An extremely nice property!

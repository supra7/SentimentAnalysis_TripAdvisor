We rode the Amtrak from Vancouver, BC to Seattle and walked from the station to the hotel with no problems. It was quite a ways to walk and if you are not in pretty good shape you may want to bus or cab it and would not recommend walking it at dark. We got to hotel before noon and were pleasantly surprised our room was ready. We thought the room was really nice and in a great location. I found the WiFi did not work very well in the lobby but as soon as I went out the front door I was able to connect to Starbucks WiFi. Everyone seemed very nice and the free coffee in lobby in the morning was actually very good...SEATTLE DOES LIKE THEIR COFFEE.

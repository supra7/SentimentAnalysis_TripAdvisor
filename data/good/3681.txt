We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Inner Harbor for 2 nights. Check in was smooth and easy, and we were given a room on the 8th floor. However, it was a street facing room and the minute I walked in the door I could hear the noise from the construction just across the street. Just would not have been acceptable. I went downstairs to be told that there may be one room to switch to but the occupants had not checked out yet - it was 3.30 PM and check out is noon - why hadn't they left yet?? I was asked if I needed the room right away, and I agreed to wait until later to switch. About an hour later, I checked a different person at the front desk, who said that I could have my choice of room facing the court yard (no contruction!). He gave me keys to 2 rooms to see which one I liked better - now that's the serivce I should have gotten when I first complained. We switched and that was the only issue with the room. The location is fantastic - easy walk to the aquarium, restaurants, etc, Tthe hotel is very clean and modern but nothing fancy. No one there to help with bags, no concierge, but the price was good for being in the inner harbor. Pool/gym was great. They have a couple of pools, one of which was specifically for the kids, and they had a lot of fun. Parking is extra and expensive (not affiliated with the hotel)- costs a little less if you don't take your car in and out. Whole Foods, CVS, etc. just round the corner. All in all we had an enjoyable stay in Baltimore.

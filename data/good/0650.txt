The location of this hotel is great as it is walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The deluxe hotel room we stayed in was very spacious. The service was great, too. The bathroom wasn't as spotless clean as a four or five star hotel, but the rest of the room was clean. I would definitely stay here again if I was in Seattle.

I recently visited Secrets Maroma from June 9th-14th. The first impression was great because the property is fantastic. Check in was a bit slow but that was fine. Once we arrived to our room room we were pleasantly suprised. It was really nice with a swimout pool off our outside patio. Ok, let's get into the nuts and bolts of this property. 1. The service is fantastic. The staff is very friendly and helpful. 2. The restaurants are just ok. The quality of the food is subpar. I would say average at all restaurants. None of them really separated themselves too much from the others maybe Himitsu would be the best option but you need to make a reservation as soon as you arrive.. 3. Huge mosquito problem! Bring bug spray. We were eaten alive in our room every night. It was huge issue and made our stay uncomfortable. We said something too late to management. There response was a can of Raid they handed to us. lol! 4. The AC in the room does not work too well. Don't expect to freeze because you won't. The best place in the entire hotel to get great AC is the men's bathroon near the Oceana restaurant. No joke, it's true! 5. The pool and beach are phenomenal 6. If you get a chance get a spa treatment. Pevonia Spa located on the property was exceptional! I would go back for the spa alone. Don't miss out.

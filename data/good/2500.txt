My husband and I spent two nights in Seattle before we boarded a cruise ship for Alaska. The Hotel Max has a wonderful location if you plan to walk to Pike's Place Market or the Aquarium. It was a sunny day when we arrived, so we also took the monorail to the Space Needle. I stay in cities quite often on business and this was a good value. The bathroom was very tiny, but that's often what you have to sacrifice when staying in a boutique hotel in a downtown area. Service was good and they were great about us checking in early. The decor of the hotel is cool! Also, we were able to take the "light rail" from the airport directly to a stop just a few blocks from the Hotel Max. Quite a savings!

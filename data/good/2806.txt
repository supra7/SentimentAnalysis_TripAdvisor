Wonder why the Doubletree (3*) hasn't been included (along with the Hilton) for the Sea-Tac Area Hotels. These are about the best of the bunch for hotel offerings near Sea-Tac. It's right across the street from the airport at 18740 International Blvd @ 188th...with free hotel shuttle to/from Sea-Tac. Express City Bus and others, stops at the corner to Dtwn Seattle for a couple of $. Used this hotel for pre/post cruise nights...and it worked fine. Great stay, great location....comfortable beds, yummy warm complimentary cookies. Parking is $16/night, which is a bummer.

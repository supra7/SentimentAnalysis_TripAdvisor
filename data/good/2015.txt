We stayed here for one night following a trip to Canada. The hotel is large, spacious and the rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The hotel also has a nice, airy indoor pool and spa. The downtown location is ideal for walking to Pike's Place, shopping, the Aquarium, restaurants, etc. Would definitely stay here again!

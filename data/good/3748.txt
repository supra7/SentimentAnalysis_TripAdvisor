I booked this hotel at the last minute bc I was in Indy and wanted a hotel with 2 Queen beds. It is fairly new and very clean. FYI: parking is $12 night. The hotel was booked up......but the staff was very friendly and accomodating. I lost my parking pass for the garage and they cheerfully made me another one. Not much in the way of restaurants close by (say walking distance)....but it's not far to the dwtn restaurants.

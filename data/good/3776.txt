The purpose of this vacation was relaxation and relax we did! Our room was gorgeous, although the ocean view was blocked by palm trees. The palms did offer privacy, however, while we lounged in our own private infinity pool. The most difficult decision my husband and I had to make was whether to lounge on the beach or by the pool. A peek at the beach in Playa Del Carmen while on a shopping trip only served to reinforce how wonderful the beach was at El Dorado Maroma. It was never crowded and always had lounging chairs and beach beds available. The same went for the pools. Plus, nothing beats beach and pool butler service! I also highly recommend getting a spa treatment or two, especially the couples beach massage. The food was amazing! This resort has ruined all other all-inclusives for us. The Gourmet Inclusive concept is a winner, for sure. The food was so amazing, we had a hard time believing we were at an all-inclusive. But....the best part of all..... the staff! Now, with all this said, I feel I should offer a warning about one unfortunate experience my husband and I had during our very relaxing, very indulgent, very wonderful vacation. The concierge will offer you a $100 voucher to attend a Loyalty Program presentation. I don't know what my husband and I were thinking when we agreed. The more than 60-minute long sales pitch (taking away precious suntan time) to join the Exotic Travellers program for more than $10,000 left us feeling very uncomfortable. We paid for this vacation; it's not as if we received a free trip to one of those time-shares where we would expect to be solicited. The whole thing was very pushy and I feel a bit angry even thinking about it now. My husband and I both agree that we would go back to El Dorado Maroma and we would recommend it to friends, but with this warning to AVOID the Exotic Travellers presentation!!! Maybe the Karisma people will read these reviews and realize they ALMOST have it perfect.

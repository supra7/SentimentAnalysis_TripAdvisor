It is with great hesitation that I give this hotel an above average review. First let me tell you all the great things about this place. It's located on a fantastic beach (close to good snorkeling at Black Rock). While we were there, the beach didn't get very crowded. The grounds are so charming and it evokes an intimate, tropical, and old Hawaii feel. It is close to Whaler's village where you can shop and eat at nice restaurants. The bad news is that it's an old hotel and the rooms show their age. We got a room on the first floor. The bathroom was old and in need of a paint job. The room was small and a bit dark and since people can see into the room through the glass doors, we kept the curtains closed most of the time so we couldn't enjoy the garden view. The bed was a bit lumpy and not that comfortable. The furniture and appliances were old and needed replacing (fridge didn't keep food cold, and the safe was falling apart). The food in the restaurant was plain and expensive. We ate there once and moved on to better restaurants in the area. BUT because the location is so fantastic and the ambience is pretty special, I'd stay here again IF I can find a cheaper rate than the $170 that we paid per night. I would also request a room on the second floor.

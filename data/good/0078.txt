The hotel and staff was great. My flight got cancelled and the front desk helped me take care of all the problems that go with that. The wallpaper in the room was a little overwhelming - as my boyfriend said "Where candy stripers go to die". Loved Mei, our pet goldfish. Awesome jacuzzi tub, and the shampoos and soaps smelled really great. Our air conditioning in the room didn't really work and it got somewhat stuffy, but I would say that overall the stay was great and I would go back there again if I had the money to do so.

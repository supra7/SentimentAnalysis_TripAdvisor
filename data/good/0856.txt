Although a very small hotel room, the location gave it top marks. Shower head was too short for my 6 foot husband. Awkward stairs to elevator from lobby when you are carrying luggage. Staff friendly and helpful. Elevator was undergoing improvements, so was often a long wait. The hotel still allowed smoking so although we had a non smoking room - it still had a slight odour. Would definitely stay again if we were in the area.

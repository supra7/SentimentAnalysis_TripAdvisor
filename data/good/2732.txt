We stayed here for 1 night before flying overseas. The hotel is well situated near Seatac and there is a free shuttle to and from the airport. The hotel was clean, friendly (free cookies upon arrival), and we found the rooms quite spacious. We had a fabulous dinner in the lounge and then a large-ish group of us stayed drinking for hours until they closed. The service was super friendly and the atmosphere welcoming and relaxed. It was a very comfortable place to gather. We would most definitely stay at this hotel again!

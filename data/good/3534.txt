While I did find the staff amazing, how I loved, "It's my pleasure", and the resort itself was beautfiul and clean; the swim-out suite made this trip amazing. During the afternoon, when the pool would become crowded and loud, my husband and I wold slip away and enjoy the shade and quiet of our swim-out suite. We took a dip early in the morning and every afternoon and had the whole pool to ourselves. I myself never saw another soul out there during our entire stay. I know some reviews stated the water was cool but we found it refreshing after sitting in the sun and heat around the main pool. I did notice the crowd was mostly honeymooners in the mid-twenties and the activities were focused around this; but the staff was respectful to those of us who just wanted to relax, enjoy the sun and be quiet. Our favorite restaurant was Portofino and we ate there twice. Try the antipasto plate and the lasagna! We loved the fun and crazy staff at Himitsu! And a pre and post dinner drink at the lobby bar is a must! If I had to find things to complain about, it would have been the size of the pool and the reserving of chairs around the pool. If I would not have had a swim-out suite, I would have been very upset to find myself having to hunt for a chair and an umbrella each day. And like other reviews, the pool is a bit small for this large of a resort. Overall, I would say stay here and enjoy the sun, staff and resort! Just pay a little bit more for a swim-out suite!

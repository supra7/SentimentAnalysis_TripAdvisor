You can't beat the location of this hotel and the lobby, restaurant/bar and staff are great, but the rooms are very small and noisy! Our room was right next to the maid's closet and the clanging and slamming of doors was so loud! The room lacked a desk so, if you need to work, you'd be out of luck. That said, the price is reasonable for Seattle and the location is perfect so I'd probably stay here again.

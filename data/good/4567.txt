Older hotel but right in the middle of a beautiful stretch of beach surrounded by expensive, pricey hotels. I stayed here over Easter with my daughter who just turned 8 at the time. My oceanfront room I reserved wasn't "available" the first night but we were given an ocean view room and the bellman moved our things the next day while we were swimming. The pool is nothing spectacular but it was perfect for my daughter and I could sit close and watch her. The life-sized checkers game using coconuts as checkers was fun. The restaurant was good and the Easter egg hunt and buffet was wonderful. My daughter expecially enjoyed the "passport program" the hotel has. She had fun going to every station on the passport and the hula skirt making acitivity was interesting as well. The hotel has hula classes and several Hawaiian cultural demonstrations. The staff is especially friendly and helpful. I would stay here again. If you don't need a big, fancy pool to make your vacation complete, this is your place. Rooms were somewhat dated but I'm not here to spend my vacation in my room. IThis is a great location at a good price. Within walking distance to may very good restaurants and The Whaler's Village shopping plaza. The ocean is right out back of the hotel. Rent a covered lounge chair for a few hours if you like the beech. The beech was good for making sand castles but the waves are rough at times. You can walk next door to the famous "Black Rock" behing the Sheraton for amazing snorkling and a sheltered cove for swimming.

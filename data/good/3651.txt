I stayed at the Hotel East Houston last week and overall it was an enjoyable experience with very few downsides. The room was clean and freshly stocked, appliances and outlets worked, and my full-size room was just big enough for a solo traveler. There wasn't a ton of space to move freely around the room, but what else can you really expect for downtown New York? My only gripe was the desk surface had some dust on it around the edges, indicating it wasn't properly wiped down (which makes you wonder what else was hastily cleaned in the room). Otherwise, everything else looked in order. It was also nice to have a complimentary (albeit small) breakfast in the basement so I was able to head straight to work without having to stop somewhere for something to eat.

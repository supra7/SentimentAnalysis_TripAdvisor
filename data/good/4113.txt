The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. Altho the rooms are higher priced than other hotels I feel I got a good value for what I paid. We went thru Costco travel and got our car included. The parking is free if you self park and there was enough self park to always park there. A sign of the times (economy). The luau ws nothing new to anyone who has seen a luau before but it was a good show with great entertainment and the food was very good. Again if your looking for something new from a luau you will probably not find it here but if you are a first timer this is a great luau for you. If you are like me I dont feel like I am in Hawaii until I am at a luau. The emcee was very good as well as the food. The pool was awesome. It had something for everyone. Of course the ocean is what most enjoy but for me the mid afternoon to evening the waves are rougher so I stay out of the ocean and the pool is the place to be. The Grounds are beautiful with lots of lush plants and trees and exciting wildlife. One hint would be they are doing construction on the front coffee shop and all those wildlife enclosures are closed which includes the penguins so if you are planning on the wildlife (penguins) call to see when they will make their grand re-entrance. Overall I would stay here again. The bed was fabulous with great pillows.

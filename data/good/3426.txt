Going to keep this simple. I have been fortunate to see and stay at 12 resorts in this area. Secrets Maroma beach has hands down the best beach. Only concern is that they bury their seaweed, they do not compost it, as time goes by they will run out of space to bury it. Food Breakfast buffet is fantastic and fresh Lunch options are great, bonus is the barefoot grill which allows you to dine pool side and avoid the white linen sit down service that gets old at all inclusive. Dinner options are also great, no reservations required. Themed restaurants are tasteful and not tacky. Disco by far cleanest and well maintained I have seen. Bonus item-fresh baked cookies in the afternoon in the lobby Grounds Clean and well maintained, facing the ocean the right side is quieter. Pools very clear and refreshing not cold Wished there was more shaded areas around the pool Beach very clean, great palapa bar with swings down to the far left Great walking beach Email me with questions.

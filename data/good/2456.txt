Just returned from an excellent weekend in Seattle. A friend was attending a conference there this week, so I joined for a 36 hour trip to Seattle. W Hotel is in a great location downtown--a few blocks from Pike and shopping. It does tend to play up the "hip/trendy" atmosphere with an attractive staff--definately seems to cater to the late-20's-30's crowd but I think anyone would be comfortable there. The bedding is simply marvelous--high quality mattress topped with a feather bed, down duvet, and lots of pillows. My friend and I ended up with a two bed room and while four probably could fit, the beds seemed more like doubles than queens--not sure what their real size was. It ended up working out great for us though. There is also a great large window seat that a doubles as a soft. We had a great city view on the 17th floor of the Seattle Public Library next door. (see photos) Wireless internet access is free in the lobby and the first three floors of the building (the conference center) and there are plenty of chairs and sofas around. It adds to the trendy atmosphere to actually have a buzz in the lobby. The charge per day for internet access in your room seemed excessive. The bathroom is well appointed with great Bliss products--lime and sage soap, facial wash, body wash, and lotion. A bottle of mouthwash would be handy for the hip/trendy crowd, I think. Bathrobes are included and soft and fluffy. Tube is large and water pressure poweful. I had no problems with housekeeping while I was there...my room was cleaned quite well. Breakfast was better than average at the lobby restaurant at typical hotel breakfast prices. They didn't start serving until 7.30 AM which seems a little late on the weekend if you're used to Central or Eastern time. All said, I'd certainly stay here again.

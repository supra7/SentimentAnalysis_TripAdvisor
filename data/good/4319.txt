We just returned from Maui and a stay at the Hyatt for 7 days. My wife will write a totally different review but this is MY experience and thoughts for those of you who have my expectations. I personally was "relieved" about things I researched regarding this and other particular hotels along the Kannapali stretch of hotels along this beach. Main thing for me was the reviews I read regarding the number of kids that usually are found at these resort hotels. I am really anti-kid people when it comes to spending thousands of dollars on a getaway vacation (although we love our beautiful 15 year old girl) this for me was a mom and pop vacation. Nevertheless, although there were a lot of kids here during our stay, the hotel seemed to "absorb" them because of its massive structure and large grounds and we really did not notice them other than at the pool. Bottom line points to remember: (1)Hotel staff was excellent, (2)hotel itself is AMAZING (caveat: on-site restaurants/bars are expensive), (3)would recommend combining hotel rate with free breakfast package(buffet breakfast at "Swan Court" is the best)and (4) plan to experience things outside the hotel which requires a rental car. We saw so many interesting things. Recommend trying the drive up past Kapalua on the northwest coast. Road gets really interesting for the adventurist and to Wailea on the south for the ritzty outlook on things in Maui. Lastly, would recommend this hotel to families, honeymooners (during low volume kid time of year if you are anti-kid) and singles. PRETTY NEAT!!!!!!!!

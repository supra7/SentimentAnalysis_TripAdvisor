Ive stayed at this Sheraton many times over the years on business to the Seattle area and its a solid choice for business travelers and perfect if attending functions at the convention center just next door. The location is close to major business/office locations downtown not to mention large retail areas, restaurants and a short walk to Pikes Place Market so you cant get much better. The hotel was renovated in 2009 and still looks new from the lobby to rooms and function areas. Room service was good and probably some of the fastest Ive seen anywhere. The restaurant (Daily Grill) is good for a business lunch/dinner was decent and quick for a low key meal if you didnt want to venture out to other great choices in the area. All in all I would recommend and stay again at the Sheraton.

I would recommend this hotel to the budget-conscious traveler. It's a comfortable and clean hotel with really helpful and friendly staff, free shuttle to the airport and lightrail station, free breakfast, and walking distance to a few food options. The reason we chose to stay at Quality Inn was because of the price. Being the stereotypical poor college kids, we were on a tight budget for the small vacation we planned. I must say, you definitely get the most bang for your buck at this hotel. The rooms were tastefully decorated and large. They were probably the largest out of the three we stayed in during our trip. We had no problem with storing our luggage and had plenty of walking space. They also offered a GREAT free breakfast: pancakes, eggs, sausages, muffins, cereals, toast, donuts and turnovers, juice, coffee and milk. That being said, this wasn't a fancy hotel with gold leafing and marble floors, walls, etc. It was comfortable and clean. The location wasn't bad, either. It was within walking distance of several restaurants and convenience stores, rental car offices, and if you don't mind the hike it's within walking distance to the airport and lightrail train station.

We found this hotel on TripAdvisor.com and liked the reviews. The Sixth Avenue Inn is conveniently located in downtown Seattle. It is walking distance from the Space Needle, Pike's Market, many restaurants, and stores. The bus in the area is free from certain times and up to certain streets. The drivers are very helpful. Back to Sixth Avenue Inn....The room was clean with double queen beds and lots of space. We also got a microwave and little refrigerator, which we requested when making reservations. A flat panel TV, coffeemaker, blowdryer, iron, ironing board, and closet safe were standard in our room without requesting. The front desk staff were always very pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful with directions or any questions we had. They even gave us several maps to help us in our walking adventures. The fresh cookies were an awesome bonus! The hotel restaurant located on the second floor honors take out orders which we made good use of. The pleasant restaurant staff delivered our food to our room as we enjoyed a few drinks at the bar while waiting for our take out order. The only negative thing was the heavy footed neighbors upstairs. We could hear them walking around every once in a while. Overall we would definitely stay there again and recommend this Inn to others. The hotel staff is outstanding!

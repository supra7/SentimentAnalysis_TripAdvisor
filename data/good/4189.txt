We had a great 6 night stay at this hotel. We had a fantastic corner room on the top floor so had ocean views and mountain views. Had booked a Regency Club room and it was well worth it as we used the appetisers and desserts (and cocktails) as our evening meal for several nights and also used it during the day for tea/coffee and nibbles. Our only complaint was that there was not enough shade around the pool as we don't like to lay in the sun but do like to swim and relax around the pool. We also thought that internet access should be included in the daily resort fee charged or at least as part of the Regency Club package.

The hotel was very clean, amenities were wonderful, and the fitness center was top notch. I generally would never pay this much for a hotel, but I wanted to navigate Baltimore by foot, rather than car. Having lived in the city for a short period of time I can tell you parking is a pain. The hotel offers parking in a garage across the street - not the most convenient but it could be worse! The location is fantastic, it's a block or two from the harbor, but without all the hustle and bustle. Staff was very friendly, I was offered a bottle of water upon arriving in the lobby due to the wait (it was Orioles/Yankees game day). The room had a wonderful view. Overall I would say it's definitely worth the value!

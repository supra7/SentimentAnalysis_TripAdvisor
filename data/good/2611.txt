Hotel Max is a refurbished older building in central location in Seattle. The rooms are beautifully decorated in a minimalist kind of way. Very modern bathroom--ours had a step in shower. Rates are also moderate. Our only small gripe was that the very young staff are not all well-versed on services and local places of interest. We asked about a "non-coffee bar" place for breakfast and were advised to try the greasiest spoon in the city. A block and a half from the hotel was the terrific Lola Restaurant that had an outstanding breakfast. We would definitely stay at the Max again.

I chose this hotel for budget reasons and location. It was only a few blocks walking distance to 5th avenue, beaches, nightlife, etc and I felt very safe walking at night alone. The rooms were clean and simple yet charming with mexican flare. The showers always had hot water but it would always overflow onto the bathroom floor. The window air conditioner cooled my room down just fine in 90 degree weather but I like it hot sometimes. The hotel was very quaint and quiet. I would not stay here if you were looking for a very nice hotel as this is a place to crash but comfortable. the beds were hard as most are in Mexico. The staff was friendly but did not speak english very well so when I asked a few questions they had a hard time answering me/ I would stay again if on a budget. At night I had to knock at the front door to get them to let me in. Sometimes it took awhile when it was at 2am but not a big deal.

My husband and I stayed here for 8 nights at the beginning of August. I was just amazed when I walked into the atrium and saw how beautiful this hotel was. The wildlife was incredible and I spent hours just walking around viewing everything. Check in was easy and quick and the staff was greayt. We even got into our room before noon without a probable. We tried a couple of the restaraunts and loved Sonz although it was very expensive. Our view was amazing and the pool was great. My only issue was there were more families here than I thought there would be and children were everywhere. I have nothing againts kids, but was looking for something quieter for my honeymoon. Rooms were nice, didn't like the low bed and my husband who is almost 7 feet tall had a hard time getting off the bed and sitting on it.

This small hotel has a great location. It is within a walking distance from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Topkapi and the tram line/taxi stops that will take you to the other attractions in Istanbul. It is surrounded by a great diversity of restaurants (the negative being that you will be asked to check the menus as you walk the streets) and small shops. A very lively and colorful neighbourhood. Not too noisy at night though. There is a restaurant at the roof terrace with nice views, however it did not seem to be very popular. Very friendly staff, a good example of what you will find in Turkey. Breakfast was fair and adequate. The hotel was very clean. The only downside is that one of our rooms (on the ground floor at the back left of the entrance) was ridiculously small for two people. After complaining, a larger room was made available two nights later, but no refunds. That was a single room for sure. I recommend this hotel because of the location, specially if you are interested to stay in the old town. However make sure you book a room in the first or second floors.

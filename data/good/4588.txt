The KBH is showing its age, but hey, aren't we all? It remains the best value on Ka'anapali Beach, and one of the few hotels left with a personality all its own ... no corporate culture, no homogenized experience ... when you're at the KBH, you know you're at the KBH. You couldn't be anywhere else. I don't know if the staff actually live on the premises, but they sure seem to. You have the feeling that they are a family and that you are their cherished guest, their old friend from the mainland. The feeling of welcome and the "aloha spirit" are everywhere. The KBH takes their reputation as "Hawai'i's most Hawai'ian hotel" very seriously, and diligently maintain the relaxed, friendly atmosphere. When you first drive up, you will be dismayed by the rundown exterior -- the ugly awning over the entrance, the peeling paint in the dark, low-ceilinged lobby -- and steel yourself for a nasty experience. Well, you won't get it. The KBH pours its $$ into keeping the rooms nice rather than dressing up the facade. So the rooms are nice. You won't see a bug and you'll always have plenty of towels. And you can't beat the location. Our package, like most, included a daily buffet breakfast. Again, the ambiance was lacking (coffee-shop style and no view to speak of) but the breakfast itself was excellent and varied. Can't say the same for the nightly free entertainment by the pool, alas. This time of year (Christmas week) you must book a minimum 5-night stay. They ought to require that the musicians come up with a minimum 5-night repertoire. You get pretty sick of listening to the same show night after night ... and you can't escape it since it takes place in the center of the grounds and the buildings all surround it.

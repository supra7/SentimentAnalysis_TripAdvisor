Was Beautiful Went to Colany Bay Resort , in Feb and March of 2008 , this was a new place , and was only opened for a month..still needed some work.but other than that... It was a beautiful place,and the staff was number 1.they went out of there way to make your Holiday , the best. The food was great..... the drinks where the best...and Id go back there again...It is breezy there....but its nice ,because it cools you down....we had great walks on the beach....so if your just looking for a place to relax , and suntan...... and do much of nothing, thats the place to go..we loved it there...So have a Great time when you go...and just injoy your self,Life is what you make it.

we stayed in march , in the preferred section, the rooms are rustic, but you have all the actual comodities lcd tv ,dvd, two phones one wireles etc, nice bed with no so nice linens and bathroom toiletries provided by glichrest and soames london,nice and full of towells, separate shower and jacuzzi, all very nice internet freein bedroom, and a full mini bar with a short variety but ask to your buttler what you want. the bad part is the food, it is not at the same level, it is a hotel with very high standard room but low at all of others services,poor wines few choices to dine, with a very low attitude of their crew. In the other hand is really the best beach in the caribbean, remember you paid a lot for the beach not the resort. if you can ,choice maroma resort it is beside , absolute incredible service , food and prices.

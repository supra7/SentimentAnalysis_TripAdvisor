Overall a very nice place. Golf is very close by and the twilight rates were cheap. The pool is big and a lot of fun. My 7 year old loved every day of it. The slide was a real highlight. We stayed on the Club Floor, which gave us access to breakfast, drinks during the day, a happy hour buffet that totally rocked and dessert bar in the evening that was pure evil to the waist line. It was a little more money to stay on the Club floor, but well worth it when you consider that a bottle of water costs $4!! We probably made up the extra cost just in water.

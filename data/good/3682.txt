My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for a weekend getaway and I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Great location, about halfway between Inner Harbor and Fells Point, and walking distance to both. Room was spotless although a little on the small side. We were on the fourth floor and I didnt hear a sound from other rooms or outside the entire stay even though area buildings are under construction. Check in and out was effortless and the hotel was easy to fine as Route 83 essentially terminates a block or two before the hotel. They also had the best price for of any Inner Harbor or Fells Point hotel for the time we were staying. Would definitely stay there again!

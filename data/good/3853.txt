I came to San Diego for a conference taking place at the San Diego Convention Center, and stayed this hotel, which is adjacent to the convention center. I stayed here for 4 nights, and would definitely recommend this hotel. The decor was pleasantly modern, without looking like they're trying too hard to be edgy. I had a room on the 15th floor, with a nice view of the San Diego Bay, over looking the promenade. I usually travel with a fairly decent number of toiletries, so large bathroom counterspace is essential, and this hotel didn't disappoint. I forgot to bring toothpaste, when I went downstairs to guest services to inquire about how to find a drugstore, the helpful staff gave me a complementary travel sized toothpaste, which was very kind! I did end up having to go to a drug store to buy other things, and I found a CVS a few blocks away in the Gaslamp district. For 2 nights of my stay, I was too busy/tired to go out for dinner, so I decided to order room service. I was pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the sea bass that I ordered. Even the bread and butter were very good quality as well. One thing I wouldn't recommend is the mojito at the Odysea bar - I tried one there with a couple of colleagues, and it was one of the worst mojitos I've ever had because all I could taste was sickly sweet syrup, incongrously mixed with a small quantity of rum. DIdn't try other mixed drinks so I couldn't comment. Anyway, I would recommend this hotel!

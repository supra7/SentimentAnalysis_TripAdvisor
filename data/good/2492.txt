I used to live on the West Coast but this was my first time staying at The Max. I found it to be in an ideal location - central to many points of interest that are within walking distance or a relatively inexpensive cab ride away. While I my room was more than adequate, the rooms are indeed TINY!!! I was in a Queen Room and it was rather small. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. But the bathrooms are incredibly tiny! You could wash your feet in the shower, wash your hands in the sink and use the loo all at the same time. The elevators are tiny as well - lucky if you can fit 6 people. But honestly, it was still very comfortable, very clean and the staff was professional. Perhaps it was just the time of year but we were there during Halloween - but the place was really quiet. I was expecting wild parties considering it was Fright Night in Seattle but I did not experience what many have complained about (thin walls) and my room was just outside of the elevators. My stay was very pleasant, quiet and compared to many places I've stayed at, ideal. Based on my four days staying at The Max, I would definitely recommend it to others and will return in the future.

The W Hotel is a fine choice for Downtown Seattle. It's in a great location with proximity to everything. It's trendy and has a lively bar scene that was hopping past 11pm on the Wednesday evening I was there. It's pricey, but in line with other W Hotels. The hotel is a little "dark" so you'll definitely be taking off your shades in the hotel!

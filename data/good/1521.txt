For a group of forty traveling to Seattle on a natural history/cultural/sight-seeing tour, we found the Inn perfect. Price: very reasonable - an older building but well-maintained, large rooms. Service everywhere - room, restaurant, front desk - was friendly and attentive. Location: walking distance to major downtown attractions.

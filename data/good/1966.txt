My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend in Seattle. The location was central, but not really close to any nightlife. The rooms were great - very clean and the bed was amazing. We even had a nice view. The staff was a little below par for a Westin, but maybe it was just a bad weekend. They were rather unhelpful, which was a little disappointing. I think this would be a great hotel for a business trip, but I think we'll stay somewhere else next time we come for fun.

The location of the hotel is more than great, less than 5 minutes walk to the metro and bus stations. Istiklal street nearby .the rooms are little bit small Breakfast includes wide variety of food. The hotel staffs were very friendly staff very helpful with directions and figuring out the metro and ferry times/locations to get me to may destinations .Very good hotel but they need to add coffee and tea machine in the room

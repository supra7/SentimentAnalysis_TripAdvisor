This was part of a package and we weren't quite sure what to expect and were very pleasantly surprised to find a very well run resort with upscale, fully equipped (even a washer and dryer) and nicely appointed rooms and very helpful and courteous staff. We love the lanai overlooking the pool and golf course. Wish we could have stayed longer! Our only complaint was that they do charge $7/night for parking which is a bit irritating and really "nickle and diming" people - especially since you have no choice but to park there.

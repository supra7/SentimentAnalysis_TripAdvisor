A nice little minimalist hotel at a great price I stayed here for 4 nights in October and found the front desk staff to be super. I arrived very early in the morning and they let me check in to my room even though it was hours before check in time. The only problem I had was the housekeeping forgot to make up the room one day. I had a superior king room. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping.The hotel is on a quiet street just off La Reforma and its a few blocks walk to Zona Rosa.

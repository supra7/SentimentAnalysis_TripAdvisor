The Inn at the Market was great hotel with the entrance tucked in an alley way. Beautiful rooms were large with a view of the harbor. We were right next door to Pike Market and a block from the waterfront where we took the Lock Cruise. Great cruise! Several restaurants and shops are near the hotel. We walked everywhere. I didn't realize there were so many hills in Seattle. The walk to Pioneer Square was only five blocks, but the homeless and decay in that area was a drawback. The Underground Tour was worth the walk! We caught a bus back to the hotel since they were free in the downtown area. We had to use valet parking for our car at $25 a night. Parking was too hard to find in that area. I thought that the rooms were overpriced too, but I guess hotels can overcharge in August.

While the rooms are a bit retro 70's, they were clean and the staff pleasant. The Mai Tai's at the Tiki Bar were not the greatest and overly priced as was the food, the atmosphere was very relaxing with a beautiful beach and walkway for those mid night strolls. My first impression upon walking in our room was you gotta be kidding we paid how much to come to Hawaii and this is the best our travel agent had to offer. When it came time to check out we did not want to leave. The Lai ceremony for departing guests is a nice personal touch. A rental car is a must, but be prepared to pay to park$9 for self park $11 a day for valet, there is no free parking here. They also offer free breakfast at their restaurant where the food was barely edible. For the most part, I found it to be a did it time to move on, I can't say I would go back and if I did I would stay elsewhere.

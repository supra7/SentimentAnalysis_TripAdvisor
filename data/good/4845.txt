I stayed in a 2 bedrrom apartment between April 5 & 15, 2010 with my friend & her 2 teenage sons. The front desk & Food & Beverage staff are quite attentive. The service in the hotel generally is good and response time is quick. The rooms are comfortable though the twin bedroom is small, the linen is pampering & the guest supplies are of good quality. The location is the "icing on the cake" just a short walk from the Deira city centre, one of the best malls in Dubai. We walked to the mall several times to shop, eat & watch movies. The boys enjoyed going back & forth from the malls. We did not have to worry about safety. Cars & taxis abound just outside the hotel. The bell boys are quick to help. There is a grocery store opened twenty-four-seven @ the corner. The buffet breakfast is very rich & tasty. What i like best about Copthorne is the location and the warmth. The hotel environment is very clean but the rooms are not always very well cleaned by the room attendants. In that regard, one needs to be on their case.

This is the perfect place for a family vacation. Lots of activities for kids and parents. The pool is kid friendly and the rooms have been recently renovated and always kept clean. The staff is very friendly and you really do feel welcomed and feel that aloha spirit. Staying at this hotel added to the great memories of our family vacation in Hawaii and a big part of why we would love to return someday. We all miss it!

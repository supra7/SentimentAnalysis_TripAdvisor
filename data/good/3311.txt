This was our second time to the Secrets Maroma. We were there for 5 nights last November. We spent 3 nights there this time in Building 27 which has great views! It did rain nearly the entire time we were there, but we did get to play board games, eat at the restaurants and watch movies. It was helpful that they have a gym there too. Our favorite meal was the breakfast buffet because there are so many options and it was pretty quick. The food is good too. We did like the beach area too. Cons: It was pretty crowded, but if that's what you like then this is your place. We prefer to have a quiet pool area at smaller hotels. The charge was $100 for a ride from the airport, which some other resorts include in their price. That was a pain in the neck, and expensive. The staff is friendly and service was fast.

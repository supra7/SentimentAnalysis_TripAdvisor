Stayed here twice in October (beginning and end of trip). I have travelled to Seattle many times on business and either stay at the DOubletree close to SEA-TAC or in downtown Seattle. This was my first time at the Hilton. The hotel is close enough to walk to from the terminal but they do offer a shuttle service three times an hour. Each time I needed the shuttle it was there to pick me up within 5 minutes. Reception check-in was very quick and the service was great. This is not a high rise hotel (only 4 floors) so it is very spread out and can take a while to walk from one end to the other, especially if you self park. Rooms were very standard for Hilton and clean. I'll look to stay here on my next trip to Seattle, especially for late arriving flight or an early departure.

This was our 2nd time at the University Inn. Even though we already liked it the 1st time, we looked for another place, just to stay in anoither part of the city. After searching for a while we finally decided to just come back to the Unicerstiy Inn. What a good decision! There was a place in the (free!) parking lot left, even though we checked in at 11 pm. The room was clean, pretty big (2 Q beds). Every bed had 5 pillows on it. And the beds....wow! These beds are in the top3 of alle hotel beds I ever slept in. The staff is very friendly. The small breakfast bar is very nice (not for a huge breakfast, but to get you started), with bread, cereals, fruit, waffles,... we didn's use the free shuttle service or the swimming pool this time. The hotel is located in the University district, a 5-10 min drive from downtown. It's also 3 blocks away from a street with a big book store, Starbucks, a couple of restaurants, shops etc... but the University district is -of course- a student neighborhood...so if you're looking for 'fancy', 'luxurious', 'spotless clean'...go somewhere else. You see lots of young people, some poor, some weird people. The only negative things: A fridge in the room would have been great. And there was one hair in the shower. We would definatly come back.

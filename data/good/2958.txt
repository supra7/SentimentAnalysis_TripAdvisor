My wife and I stayed here on our way back from Vancouver having just did a 13 day Alaska cruise out of San Diego. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived that the staff were incredibly helpful, they went out of their way to make you feel welcome. The food in the restaurant was also good but not incredibly great but good for hotel food. I've stayed at some properties where the food was barely palatable. The service was a bit slow, but in the servers defense she seemed to be the only one working. The breakfast buffet was good. The room was standard Marriott room. Incredibly small bathrooms and I mean small. Internet was a charge per day which I don't understand with Marriott properties. Can stay at a courtyard and get free internet, pay more at a Marriott property and pay for the internet. The Internet should be included in the price at the higher end Marriott properties and charged for at the lower level executive hotels like Courtyard and Fairfield Inn. Overall this is an excellent choice for cruise travelers both coming into Seattle or leaving Seattle. Take advantage of the free shuttle to the airport, although we took a sedan to the airport for our very early morning flight from Seattle to Alaska. Charge of $20.00 was well worth it as we were whisked right to the Alaska Curbside check in.

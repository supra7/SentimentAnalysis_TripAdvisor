It's interesting to see sometimes how those that review rooms say they are treated upon checkin if they arrive on a Priceline/Hotwire reservation, vs. one that is directly booked through the Hotel. I'm a SPG member, and 99% of the time, will book directlry through them to ensure I maximize my starpoints and get 'extras' when I can. This time, on a whim, I ended up with the Westin Seattle through Priceline for half what the AAA rate was. I checked in very late, and it was quick and friendly. I originally ended up on a high floor, but the two full beds were too much. I called and asked if I could have a room with a single bed, and they offered me a queen accessable or a Westin Workout with a King. I took the latter. The room was great! I didn't have to trott through the hotel in my sweats to go workout, the treadmill and weights were in my room, including a set of extra towels, wipes, and other workout toiletries. There was an extensive collection of Yoga equipment, which was no use to me, but I didn't care. The room was no additional charge, which was nice, because they usually rent at several dollars more a night then the deluxe rooms. The view was the best I ever had staying at the Westin. Great view of downtown and Elliot Bay with the ferries coming in from Bainbridge and Bremerton. The fact that Westin/Starwood offered me this great upgrade, not knowing that I was a SPG member and booking through Priceline really delighted me and will keep me loyal. Only downsides to the experience were the lack of any toiletries in the bathroom upon arrrival (they were restocked on the second night) and on the second day, water bottles magically appeared where there were none before. Wifi is expensive, but the lounge is open and free. Parking is expensive for valet ($40/day) and self parking is still steep at $22. For anyone that is looking for a great way to keep up with their fitness regimine, I highly recommend the workout room.

We had an Ocean view room in one of the two side buildings. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The pool was very nice and there was never a problem getting a chair. We had the free breakfast and I would recommend skipping the swan court and eating at their second location by the pool. It had pretty much the same food without the lines. The food was very good and they had a good selection. The beach in front of the hotel isn't that great - a walk up the path to the Sheraton has a much better one. Where they lose a lot of points is around parking. They clearly don't have enough - not by a long shot. If you return in mid-afternoon you'll have no trouble finding a spot. But after that - don't bother until after the luau is over (8:30PM). They will sometimes waive the valet charge if the parking lot is full but not always, plus given the size of the resort, the wait for your car can take some time. If you can get past dealing with the parking hassle, it's a very good place to stay.

Everything in this hotel was pretty nice - from the lobby to the room to the health club - and the location is good. I was kind of surprised at the size of the room. We had two double beds and that pretty much took up the whole room. The bathroom was small, too. But otherwise the place was very nice. I even used the "library" on two occasions to read at odd hours. They have a small pool table as well, but bring your own cue sticks (looked like a 6' table). The health club is a full blown health center that has three pools (lap, exercise, "splash" pool for kids), every machine imaginable. Clearly it's not just for hotel guests. Breakfast was odd. The "system" was confusing and resulted in cold eggs. I'll spare you the details, but you might want to find something off Pratt Street for breakfast. This is definitely walking distance to everything in the Inner Harbor. Parking ran us $22 a day (it's $25 a day if you want to come and go). My favorite part about this hotel is that it is across the street from James Joyce Pub. We had lunch outside one day, dinner outside the next. I had a blast drinking pints and listening to a band until 2 AM on Saturday night. Then I just walked across the street and I was home. I've been to enough Hard Rock Cafes. This pub was just what I wanted and literally a 15 second walk to the hotel. (See picture; that's the hotel in the background.) Homewood Suites is connected (if not the same operation) if you want the same location, but bigger rooms.

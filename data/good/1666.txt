We stayed in Seattle for 5 days over the New Years weekend. We won the room through a Priceline auction and got it at what we thought was a good price. The location was great in that it was on the water, but it was quite a hike or a cab ride to get anywhere. Plusses: GREAT shower! On the water Negatives: $10 a day for wi-fi (Really? In this day and age still charging for wi-fi??) $35 a day plus tax for parking Fireplace was odd in that if you wanted a set temp in the room, it and the fan had to run all night. Overall we had a nice visit.

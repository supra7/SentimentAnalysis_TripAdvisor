Pros: Great location in the city, the Concierge service was excellent for directions, dinner suggestions and coupons for local attractions. We stayed in the North tower on the 39th floor and the views of Puget Sound and Mt Rainer were excellent - we paid extra for that Cons: Why is it that most every time I pay for the Starwood hotel using Starwood points, its feels as if the hotel tries to give me a room that is almost its best? Like they are trying to sneak me a bruised apple that I redeemed a coupon for? We changed rooms three times until the King size bed was actually a King - the others were Queens posing to be Kings. Plus, the view (which I paid extra for) was absolutely better in the third room. Shame on you Westin Seattle Management. I have GOLD status in the Starwood program for a reason - Frequent guest! Also, this Westin Seattle does not have a restaurant for breakfast but it does not Cafe to go. There are several eateries near bye to make up for the missing sit down breakfast service. Aerobic and Fitness facilty is crampt but useable.

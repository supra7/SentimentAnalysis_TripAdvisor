Parc Suites was a satisfying choice for our 4 days in Montreal. Our suite was large and comfortable and clean. Parking was behind the hotel and was a little tricky to find, but the owner Turgay accompanied us to the spot and helped carry our bags to the door, and then showed us our room himself--he obviously takes great pride in his hotel and seeks out ways to improve it. He acknowledged that the shower water pressure wasn't great due to local zoning rules, but that was the only flaw we noticed during our stay.

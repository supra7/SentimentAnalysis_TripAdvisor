This hotel was located within easy walking distance to many restaurants and sports facilities. The lap pool was great for swimming and the view of Oriole Park at Camden Yards was terrific. The door men were very helpful with suggestions of places to eat and see, access to Washington DC, and the room attendants were friendly and helpful. I was very appreciative for the early room check-in. I think the front desk staff should have been more aware and informed re our conference room locations as the conference was located in the hotel. The facilities were well appointed and the rooms spacious. Overall I had a pleasant stay in a good hotel.

We had a great stay at the Westin. My husband and I, with our two daughters (ages 7 & 5), stayed for one night over spring break. We arrived before noon and found the staff very accommodating. We were checked in early to a nice room with a fantastic view. We had a room with two double beds, so it was a little on the small side but it worked for us. The bathroom was small but clean and the shower was wonderful. We loved the location - we walked down to the Aquarium through Pike Place and then shopped on our way back up, it was perfect. After dinner - at Redfin Sushi on Stewart = awesome! - we took advantage of the pool. The girls loved it. We ended our day in some heavenly beds and slept soundly. The next morning checkout was a breeze and we were off to the zoo. We didn't park at the hotel because right across the street, at the Westin building, parking is half the price. Plus, the buildings are connected with a sky bridge, so it's the same as parking at the hotel. We chose the Westin because of the location and the pool. We got a discounted rate by paying upfront and the total was about $220 with taxes and such. It seemed pretty comparable to all the other hotels in the area. We'll definitely stay here again.

We have stayed at the Hilton at the Seattle Airport four times, and each has been a very pleasureable experience. The rooms are big, the beds comfy, and the staff is pleasant. They have free coffee in room, dryer, iron/board, and in room PPV movies. The drawbacks are: $18/nt self park and very expensive bar/restaurant. I solidly recommend this hotel to anyone with business south of downtown Seattle.

We recenty returned from a weeks stay at the Hyatt. After reading many negative reviews I had very low expectations for this hotel and it's staff. I have to say I was very impressed with the check-in staff, who upgraded us to a corner oceanfront room, even though the hotel was quite full at the beginning of our trip. Bellman followed us to our room with our luggage and was very nice and polite. The room with two balconies was clean and yes it was a tad bit worn in a few areas, but overall very acceptable. The corner room was spacious but the toliet and tub area were very small, almost disfunctional, we adjusted to it. Good comfortable bed with view from second balcony all the way to Lahaina. The lobby was pleasant and outside bar and lounge areas nice. We did feel however the pool area was wall to wall with chairs and people, We found lounges without to much difficulty but we were up and out each day by 8am. I would say pool needs some attention but it did not really impact our vacation. We did have breakfast in the buffet once and it was good. Although the beach is narrow, there were areas to swim and the water was warm. All in all, I would say the Hyatt was nice, not as nice as the resorts on the Wailea side of Maui, which we have stayed previously. The staff was courteous, professional and not at all rude or indifferent like others have posted. We travel alot and stay in mostly 4-5 star resorts, so for me I would say this hotel was on the low end of a 4 star, but only because of it's age and the fact newer resorts are just built differently these days.

Interesting how people can have such different experiences. I stayed there last week prior to flying out and I thought the hotel was above average. No trouble at all with shuttle, the front desk staff was very accomodating in taking you to local restaurants. They even called restaurants for several folks and made reservations for them. Had problem with lobby computer in printing boarding pass, so desk clerk used the hotel computer to complete it for me. I didn't see any problems with security, although there must be some because back lot is closed in with barbed wire chain link fence. Seatac area is iffy, I wouldn't walk anywhere at any time of day. I would either stay at this Hampton or the Sleep Inn, which also has had problems with car breakins. Seems as if lesson is to leave nothing in car, which is what I do when in Seatac, I put everything in trunk.

If you're looking for a resort to stay in Maui, instead of a condo, the Hyatt is a great choice. We got a nice deal on Jetsetter.com, which made the price worthwhile. Great amenities, beautiful scenery. The only issue is that the the beach area that is right by the resort is rocky, so if you want to go in the water you have to walk a 1/2 mlle right or left of the resort. Otherwise, it's wonderful! Super friendly staff, great service, paradise!

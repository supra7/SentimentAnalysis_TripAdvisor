I would like to start by saying is a very nice hotel, the only thing is the management & by this I mean the manager Chuck. He is very rude, not only with his guest but with the employees, At one point I saw him throwing a stack of papers at another manager (he was the one who did my checking in) not only did he do that but he was also yelling at the rest of the staff. I think that was very unprofessional on his part, to the point where one of the employee walked out cause she couldn't take his yelling at her in front of everybody. Other then that my stay was very nice, the rest of the staff where very nice and helpful, my room was nice and clean and very comfortable.

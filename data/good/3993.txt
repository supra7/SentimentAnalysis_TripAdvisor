This is new hotel and a bit sterile, but very clean and locatiuon is right on the bay with the convention center across the street. The gaslamp area is a walkable distance nearby and lots of foot-traffic between the hotel and the gaslamp at night. Had a high room with a great view of the bay. Pool and fitness areas are good.,

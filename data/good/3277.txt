Beach resort hotels are generally not my thing but as this was for my honeymoon I thought a bit of time for relaxation and romance after a hectic few weeks in the lead up would be just the thing... and it was! The room was comfortable, well appointed - adequate but nothing outstanding that for me would make it stand out from a four star hotel. The hotel had a excellent range of activities so you could do a little or as much as you want! We did kayaking and yoga but both being disaster (we could not co-ordinate our paddling in our two person kayak - so much for marital harmony and my husband's comment "you look like you have run a marathon" to me after a yoga class in almost 30 degree celius heat put an end to that) we did not exert ourselves any further and spent our days longing by the pool. It was one, however, some pool to lounge by. Canopy beds were stay there all day comfortable and the pool was never overcrowded. The pool bar served any and every drink you could think of and it was refreshing to cool down in the pool with a drink in hand. All restaurants we dined in and we covered most of the 7 or 8 on offer were lovely although sometimes the Mexican ingredients or twist in some of the European dishes was a bit... unusual. A particular favourite was the teppenyaki show - we somehow managed to get the show to just the two of us- it was excellent! At the end of my stay I felt recharged and blissful but was glad to be going on to the next leg of our honeymoon - New York. I just more of a city break kinda girl.

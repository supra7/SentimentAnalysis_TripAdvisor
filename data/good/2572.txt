Hotel Max is right in the centre of town, so a very good location. However, despite asking for a quiet room we were on the street-side on the 3rd floor and as there was construction going on outside (which started early), it was pretty noisy - earplugs are a necessity. The glazing doesn't do much to filter the noise. On the plus side, the staff are very friendly and helpful; the hotel is beautifully decorated with full size black & white photos on each bedroom door - a different photographer on each floor, bright stripey carpets in the hallways & original artworks on the walls; the beds are extremely comfortable with very good quality linens. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms, having been led to believe that they were tiny from other tripadvisor reports. A big plus is the free use of PCs with internet access & printing facilities in the business centre; as in-room wi-fi was expensive. There is a restaurant/bar at the hotel which we didn't use; instead having breakfast at the Starbucks on the corner of the block.

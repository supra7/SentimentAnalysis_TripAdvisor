We stayed at Le Reve in January (arrived New Year's Day). Because of the holiday and availability, we booked the Horizon Suite for one night before moving to the Master Suite. There was no comparison. The Horizon Suite was lovely, but for a small premium, the Master Suite was exactly what we envisioned for a beach stay. Amazing views, privacy, indoor shower with a view, and a luxurious bed. As for amenities, the gym is very small and not very usable, the pool is nice, but not heated (and could use some updating). If you are in the Master Suite, these minor details are less noticeable. Food was very memorable. Service was also very good - friendly and genuine. It is a small hotel, so we had to wait on occasion for the reception as they give individual attention to each guest.

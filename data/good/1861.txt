This hotel was very good! Located right downtown, it was easy access to westlake center and pike place market. We pretty much were able to walk anywhere we wanted. Lobby is great and hotel is well appointed. The staff at the front desk was really lacking in customer service. Whenever I needed them, they were short with me and quite rude. However, the valet and dining staff was great!! We dined at the lounge for food and drinks. Great food and great staff at the lounge. Rooms were comfortable and the views of the city were great. Beds were the best! Parking was easy (valet is the way to go). Pool was busy but still nice. We will return!

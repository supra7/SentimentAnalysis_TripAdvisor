The Mayflower Park was perfectly fine for our recent trip to the Seattle. The room was small but very clean and the staff were quite friendly and eager to please. Best of all, the hotel is within walking distance of any place we cared to reach downtown. Further, it a great value compared with other downtown hotels we considered. While the hotel experience itself was forgettable, we didn't go to Seattle to hang out in our room, so would definitely stay there again should we return.

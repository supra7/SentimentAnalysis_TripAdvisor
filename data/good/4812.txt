Very spacious rooms, very close to the metro station. Dubai is a very safe city, but it happens here in this location is a little lower area of the city. A huge advantage of the hotel is free internet, I know from experience that what may be surprising, but in a Dubai hotel with free internet hard and Normally you need to have very much to pay for it.

I stayed at the Gezi Hotel August 12- 2011 in a Deluxe Park View room. Taxi from Ataturk Airport was about 20-25 mins although our driver seemed to have trouble finding it. Not sure why as the major selling point of Gezi has to be its location, which is only a 3 or 4 minute stroll from the main commercial street of istanbul. The room was relatively small but comfortable and well equipped with very helpful staff and concierge service. The dining room/bar is well worth a visit with some spectacular views although drinks and food were pretty expensive. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Istanbul, a cosmopolitan and friendly modern city, very different from what I was expecting and wouldn't hesistate to recommend the Gezi hotel to others.

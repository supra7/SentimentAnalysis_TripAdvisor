Had a great stay in the Westin. My mother and I shared a room while in town for my brother's wedding. We got an amazing deal through Priceline (put in "downtown" and "four stars"). The hotel was wonderful about our special requests (two beds, high floor), even though we had come in through Priceline. The staff was very friendly and quick to respond when needed. My mother is very sensitive to her environment and had no complaints about the air quality, linens or noise. I found the beds really, really comfortable, with nice linens and lots of pillows. Everything was clean and fresh without have any weird perfume-y air fresheners. The round tower structure makes the rooms wedge-shaped, with huge windows. we had a nice view of city buildings and the water from the 32nd floor in the south tower. I used the pool and whirlpool twice (5th floor, North Tower, with a cool glass roof), and found everything clean and well cared for. When I went early in the morning, I had the pool practically to myself. The outdoor deck area looked really nice, too, but it wasn't quite warm enough to do any sunbathing. There is no room in the minibar to put your own items, but the staff brought in an extra fridge on request. The location was perfect, just minutes walking to Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, and downtown shopping, including the great Nordstroms. It was about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport. I would definitely stay here again.

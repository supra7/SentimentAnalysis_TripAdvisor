We normally stay in Napili bay area when we visit Maui, but our favorite place (Napali Shores) was all booked up, so we looked at Kaanapali area where hotels were available (this was week bracketing Christmas). We stayed in Kaanapali area (opposite end of the beach and boardwalk) once before and I was not that impressed with the crowds or the snorkeling. My stay at this Hotel has revised my opinion significantly. It is an older hotel and is very affordable, but is extremely clean, the staff is superb, the drinks at the Tiki bar are priced reasonably with generous pours on the Mai Thais, and the food in the restaurant was (for Maui) inexpensive and well prepared when we ate here. Two thumbs up.

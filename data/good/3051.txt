We stayed at the Hilton on a road trip that we were taking. The hotel was nice and the employees were extremely nice. The only complaint we had was that parking was an additional charge and the parking structure was located pretty far away. Normally the parking wouldn't have been an issue, but it isn't exactly fun to cart luggage that far. The biggest tip I can give is unload your car at the door and then park.,

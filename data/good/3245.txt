Everyone was so warm and friendly and helpful, it was more like staying in a small inn or B&B. I have reason to be in the Orlando area frequently and now that I have found this little gem I look forward to making Destiny Palms my "home" in Orlando. Thank you much to all the staff and managers, it was a pleasure! Room was updated and very tastefully decorated. Room had a flat screen tv,frig and a large walk in shower. The hotel is a little difficult to see off of the road..look for Houllihans restaurant, its right behind it.

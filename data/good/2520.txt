This hotel was the first and last stop for my husband and I on our honeymoon. We are both in the arts, so it was great to find a place with such a great style and appreciate for art. Because it's an old dorm, the rooms are quite tight, though, so if you need space, this isn't the right choice. We were a bit disappointed because prior to our trip, all of our friends told us to mention it was our honeymoon where ever we went because people are very generous. We mentioned it and the staff could not have cared less. They were nice and all, but not generous. Not that we're the type to expect things to be given to us, we had just heard so many stories of couples who honeymooned before us and we seemed to draw the short straw with Hotel Max. So FYI - if you are looking for a honeymoon hotel and you like perks, Hotel Max isn't the right choice.

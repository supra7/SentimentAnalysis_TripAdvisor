We went in August 2011. This is a great family friendly hotel. The pool is great for kids. We did have some trouble finding shady pool lounges, but didn't end up spending a lot of time on the lounges (probably part of the problem; people stake out lounges then leave.) I don't know that I'd recommend this hotel for a honeymoon; it does seem geared toward families. The room was nice; great ocean view. Bathrooms are a bit on the small side (not a Vegas bathroom). The closet was big. Large flat screen TV that we only turned on to watch the visitor channel. The staff was very nice and accommodating across the board. Self-Parking does fill up, but they comped the valet when that happened or they just opened the valet lot across the road for self-parking. The Swan Court breakfast buffet was nice, but I would not stand in line for it (we went early and were seated immediately). Omalu (sp?) was adequate, although a bit overpriced. Pool side service was was prompt and frequent.

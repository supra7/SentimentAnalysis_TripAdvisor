Husband and I took our first trip together without our son to Secrets Maroma. We absolutely loved this resort. Beautiful location and service. Food was very very good. Top shelf liquor and never stopped. The staff just kept on top of everything. My only complaint was our shower did not drain. We asked - maintenace came but never seemed to fix it. Also, one day it seemed to affect the toilet as well. We were upgraded to a swim out pool however, these pools are NOT heated and freezing. The only pool that was heated was the main pool with the pool bar so remember that for winter traveling. The beach was very nice and there were chairs available as long as you were there before 10 am in the morning. Our room also being on the main floor was musty and we could here alot of what was outside. Everyone we talked to sure did get a chuckle out of Channel 14. Excellent resort and would return but would request a different room location. Spa was phenomenal!!!! The 'secret' box for room service was the best loved our breakfast in bed.

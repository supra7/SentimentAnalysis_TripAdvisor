Just returned from a 4-night stay. The hotel was not so crowded and the room was great (king bed + sofa sleeper, fridge, etc). Sure, the price was steep, but the facility is gorgeous (fantastic swimming pool, Asian-themed artwork, penguins, etc.) and there is plenty to do there. The beach in front of the property was disappointing, but a short 10 minute walk away (in front of Kaanapali Alii) there is a nice beach area. Recommendation is to go early in the morning in order to scout out the best place to lay your beach towels. As for prices, you will be ripped off at any of the major hotel restaurants. Go to Lahaina and eat at the Aloha Mixed Plate or other similar "local" restaurants. Also, stop by the CostCo (Kahului) or Safeway (Lahaina) and stock up on snacks in order to save $$. Also a "must" do is to snorkel at Black Rock (park your car at the public access parking garage near the Sheraton) early in the morning.

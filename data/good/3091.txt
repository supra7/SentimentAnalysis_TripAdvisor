My husband and I stayed one night at the Radisson at the airport. We were checked in smoothly and were upgraded to a suite ( apply for their gold card) on the 7th floor. We ate dinner and breakfast at the hotel and had no complaints. The staff was excellent. We took the shuttle (which leaves every 1/2 hour) to the airport. On our return from Denver we phoned for shuttle and it arrived to pick us up within 10min. The driver drove us to our parked car in the parking lot which was great as we didn't have to schlep our bags all the way to our car. My only complaint was that I found the air circulation system in the room to be noisy and since it was a central system you could not turn it off. But I would stay there again as we parked for 8 nights and they did not charge us for the extra night.

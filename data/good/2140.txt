A good option for business or leisure travellers. Good central location, excellent leisure facilities (gym and indoor pool); fantastic views of Puget Sound from some rooms. Not as "cool" as the W, but nonetheless the rooms are a decent size and smartly furnished. Service pretty good overall; food OK but could be better. New seafood restaurant lacked atmosphere and service was rather overbearing.

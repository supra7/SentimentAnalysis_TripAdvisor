Had another visit to "Pill Hill" recently and decided on the Sorrento instead of our usual Inn at Virginia Mason. The Sorrento really is lovely, if a bit casual in service. When I have to hit the hill again, I'll probably go back to the Inn with a couple mealtime visits to Sorrento. For me it is a matter of value vs price. I would give it good marks for anyone who has to be at the hospitals, but can't imagine suggesting it for a regular visitor. Why? The neighborhood is a M-F 9-5 sort of place, far from the rest of the tourist activities. Two blocks to the nearest Starbucks, but for those who can handle it, there is a Tully's across the street. The free coffee in the mornings is Illy's European style and quite good. I have a hard time understanding anyone wanting to be in Seattle and not being within sight or scent of the Sound. I'll still be recommending the Mayflower, Edgewater and Inn at the Market for this price range. For higher, the Olympic.

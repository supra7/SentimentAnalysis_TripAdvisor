Bid on Priceline and got the hotel for $90. Check in staff were fast and friendly, hotel clean and beds were comfortable. Only very minor quibble was that the heat in the room seem to cycle a lot so you would suddenly wake up too hot and then it would cool down again. (we had set the temp to about 68F). We didn't use any of the hotel extras such as WiFi or parking. Took a previous Trip Advisors tip and parked 1/2 block down for $28 rather then the valet parking. And for shopping? The location is absolutely unbeatable. Close to all the major stores and Pike Market.

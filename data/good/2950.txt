To avoid the long drive from another city in Washington, and to avoid any possible traffic delays, my husband and I stayed here to catch a flight out in the early morning. Service was great and the restaurant had excellent quality food! The room was standard - too small if you ask me - but it was nice and cozy enough for a 1-night stay. I also forgot a peice of jewlery in the restroom and the staff was quick to send it to me. Thank you, Marriott!!!

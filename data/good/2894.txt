We stayed here for two nights, a week apart from each other to bookend flying in and back out of the airport while we were visiting a nearby area. I was surprised at how quiet the hotel was for the proximity to the airport. It wasn't completely silent, of course, but the layout was specifically designed to reduce (not eliminate) airport traffic noise. Breakfast each morning was sufficient and good quality in comparison to other Hampton Inns we've stayed in (Hilton/Hampton is the chain we prefer when traveling) and was slightly different each morning, which was nice to see. The room decor was quite a bit nicer than Hampton Inns that I've normally stayed in, so that was a nice touch, and the hotel staff were more than helpful and pleasant when we needed assistance. (Both nights we stayed the manager on duty -- the same person both nights -- checked us in at night and out in the morning and assisted us with any issues that arose quickly and efficiently.) The location was great for getting to/from the airport, but there wasn't much choice of things to do or eat nearby, unfortunately. We'd definitely stay again for a quick night before or after needing to use the airport, but probably would not have an extended stay at this particular location, mainly due to distance from sights and restaurants.

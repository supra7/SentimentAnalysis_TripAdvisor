We booked in here last minute as our original plans fell through. The first night we had a room with a private bedroom. The second night, a room with a shared bathroom. Room with private bathroom Very comfortable, as this hotel is very old (has been remodeled) the rooms are large. Neat and tidy, nice bathroom with a claw foot tub. No internet access though - the wireless signal is really weak and no wired internet. Room with shared bathroom We were reluctant - but it was all that was left on such short notice. The shared bathroom was fine, never had to queue to use it. Our room was still a good size and comfortable with an incredible view over Pike place and out to Puget Sound. No internet. It's in a really good location, right downtown. We really enjoyed it. Staff were helpful, affordable.

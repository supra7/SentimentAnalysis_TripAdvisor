Really enjoyed my different stays (6 times in 3 years !!) in le Crystal. I was one of the first client when they opened Very trendy. Service is very good. If you have time to try the pool, it is really great and has an amazing view but the last times I went you could not use it if you were in a business trip because of the opening hours Bfast could be a bit long to serve for business travelers. Could be a bit pricy. for business travelers, I would be ready to pay it if I could use the pool when I am back after a long day. Still a very good experience

The Edgewater has a fun vibe, everything is decorated like an old log cabin. Our room was nice, clean, with a great view. The restaurant/lounge looks right over the water. The hotel offers a shuttle (which is nice because it is at the bottom of a BIG hill). All of the staff we interacted with was very accomodating.

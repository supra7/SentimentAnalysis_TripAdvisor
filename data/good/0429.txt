Stayed at this hotel at the beginning of a Pacific Northwest vacation. The location is great, just minutes from Pike Market, shopping, restaurants, etc. About a 5 minute walk to the tram for the Space Needle. We were able to get all around the city from here without any issues (though some uphill trekking is required returning from certain parts of town). Didn't go to the restaurant and the lounge was just OK. For access and price, this was a great choice. If you are on the Concierge level, be aware that the breakfast is fine but gets very crowded on the weekends - the views from the breakfast room are great, however - and you can stop in for a soda or other drink just about any time...

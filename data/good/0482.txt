The Inn at Queen Anne is a great little hotel! The accommodations were comfortable and convenient. Our room had a kitchenette with small table and two chairs, a small bath with a tub/shower. Nothing fancy but totally adequate. The staff is exceptional. They went out of their way to provide help, directions, suggestions whenever we asked. We also enjoyed the coffee in the little lobby. It was lovely to take your coffee, or wine ;) into their lovely courtyard to drink. The Inn is in a neighborhood with cute boutiques, a used bookstore and great little restaurants. In the next block is a super grocery store, Metropolitan Market, that has everything you could need or want...flowers, health products, a deli for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! We had a delightful stay at this quaint little hotel.

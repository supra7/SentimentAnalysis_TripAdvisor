We had a late arrival on July 19, 2007. We booked two rooms, the hotel once we arrived was sold out so our rooms were not adjacent nor in the new tower as requested through Sheraton. We arrived by limo from the airport as we had 3 adults and 2 children travelling. (limo was $45 -great deal at the airport and you don't have to wait in the taxi line!) Although they could not put me in the new tower like I had requested our room was great and overlooked the street right in front of the hotel. The pool on the top floor was great and had an amazing panaramic view of the entire city. The service was wonderful and we had an early check out at 6am on the 21st and the staff was very pleasant and were right there to help with all of our bags. I would without a doubt stay here again. All of the construction has been completed and the lobby is large and beautiful. The bar/restaurant has a great happy hour as well. The Sheraton Seattle made our short stay in Seattle perfect with its quick walk to Pike's Market where once there you can also catch a bus down to tour the Mariner's stadium - It's a great city!

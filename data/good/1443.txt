The Sheraton Seattle is a great place to stay in Downtown Seattle on a budget. I received this hotel through a priceline bid that was half what the hotel cost through other sites. Had I paid full retail, I would have been disappointed, but it's a fine choice. Here are the Pros/Cons: Pros: 1. The location can't be beat. Awesome shopping - Nordstrom, Macy's and other great venues are within sight of the hotel. Nike Town and a great Adidas store are across the street. Great restaurants are nearby as well with a Cheesecake Factory across the street. Gameworks and a movie theater are across the street. It is right off of Pike Street and the Pike Street Market is within a few blocks of the hotel. 2. The staff is very nice and very accomodating. 3. I got a great rate through priceline. 4. The view. I could see the water and the mountains from my room - amazing. 5. People make a big deal of the remodel in their reviews. This is not an issue at all, but maybe that is because it's further along than when the early reviews were written. I didn't really notice anything. Cons: 1. They nickel and dime you horribly here. They charge something like $5-$7 a box if you have them delivered to your hotel from your office from FedEx/UPS. Maybe this is common, but I've never seen this and it's kind of ridiculous. 2. Parking is $36 a night! I've stayed in Chicago, San Fran and NYC and have not seen this - this is Seattle, not a top 5 sized market! 3. The room/furnishings are average at best. Hopefully the remodel helps this. The rooms isn't dirty or gross - just in need of some updating and the bed pales in comparison to a lot of hotel beds I've seen. Again, not bad, but not worthy of a "4-Star" hotel. If you get this through priceline, be happy - it's a great deal. If you paid retail, hopefully it works out for you.

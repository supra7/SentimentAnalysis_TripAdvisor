I have just stayed in the Seattle Hilton for 4 nights and apart from a couple of minor issues I found it to be excellent. The concierge at the front desk was very helpful. Check in is on a different floor but there was no hassle going up there, and it was extremely fast. The rooms were very clean with large, comfortable beds and nice views, if not spectacular, and the flat screen tv is really excellent with a wide rage of channels. The bathroom is small and has a strange layout but overall it was ok. There is lots of storage space to put things. They serve a nice, and not completely overpriced, breakfast which also had fast service. I did not eat a main meal in the hotel but it is close to a lot of restaurants and two blocks away from the major shopping area. The only issue that I had with the hotel was the bathroom. The plug in the bath did not work making it impossible to take a bath if you wanted as the water just drained away.

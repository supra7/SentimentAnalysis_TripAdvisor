Positive: Excellent location, friendly professional staff, fantastic restaurant. Not so positive: Paper thin walls and being awaken both nights by the "partiers" in the next room upon their return after the bars closed. Seriously, "normal" conversation in the next room was like they were in your room. This was a special birthday surprise for my wife and I REALLY wanted to like the Edgewater. They came soooo close, especially with the great staff and restaurant. But a less than quality night's sleep has a way of putting a damper on the experience.

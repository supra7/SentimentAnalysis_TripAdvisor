We spent 5 nights at the Hotel Opera Roma, and really were pleased with our stay. We chose it because it was near the train station. When we arrived, we found that it was a few blocks away and the map was somewhat confusing, but we found our way easily enough. It was also walking distance to many Rome tourist attractions, but there was always a bit of a walk to get there. However, it was very convenient to buses and metro. The room itself was typical small European room, but it was certainly adequate, and we were comfortable. The best thing the hotel had to offer, as far as we were concerned, was their customer service. The people at the desk were so helpful with directions and advice. They really helped us get our bearings in a very large and confusing and city. One of them was also kind enough to lend us an umbrella when it suddenly started pouring as we were heading out to a laundromat. The breakfasts were a wonderful way to start each day. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.

Nice enough hotel. Friendly service. Good location. Lovely wine reception from 5:00-6:00. HOWEVER- be careful when you book a standard double room. The only "standards" are located directly across from the elevator bank on every floor. All other rooms are considered "deluxe" and are a bit larger. If you are a heavy sleeper and don't mind hearing the elevator all night, then a standard is fine. If you want a peaceful night then pay extra for the deluxe room.

Yes, the hotel is a bit dated, and the hilly parking lot is intimidating, but there are not many places in Branson that are not hill challenged. The age of the hotel didn't affect the coziness of my room. The breakfast is continental...for those of you who don't know what that entails, perhaps you should do some research. Continental is not sausage and eggs. And as for all the reviews I found saying how the hotel took more money than needed off credit/debit cards...this is a very typical practice of hotels.

The light in the shallow end of the indoor pool fell out -- there way of fixing it was just to put it back in with no screws. Several kids were taking it out and playing with it.

Due to the great price and location, I wasn't sure exactly what we were in store for when we arrived at the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised beginning with the initial contact of the hotel staff at check-in. Smiles and pleasant attitudes are certainly values you don't see at a lot of \"public\" places, but we received both. The indoor pool and hot tub area is adjacent to the office (they also have outdoor pool which hadn't opened yet due to the weather) and is surrounded by 10 or so rooms. We happened to be one of the lucky ones to get a poolside room. Although our children smiled and giggled at the thought of being steps away from the pool, we were a bit reluctant since the pool didn't close until 10:45pm. Now, I'm a very \"light\" sleeper, but seriously, I could not hear any of the noise/excitement from the pool area while trying to sleep. The room's walls and doors definitely did their job to keep the noise out. (ha!) The pool was heated and very clean. The hot tub worked great and felt so nice after a long day. The breakfast was basic, but good and filling ~things my children normally eat for breakfast like cereal, toast, donuts, milk and juice. The hotel sits on a pretty steep hill, so the parking was a bit crazy, but a great location with easy access to the Red, Blue and Yellow side routes.

Only thing bad I can say about that is when kids are in the pool, it really echoes and you can hear it in your room....but what do you expect, your door is only a few feet from the pool. I didn't find the steep hill to be a problem at all, but I can see where it may be slippery and dangerous in the winter.

After driving the strip, we thought despite the bright yellow color of the building, the hotel appeared to be in a somewhat good location for what we wanted to do and at a price that wouldn't leave us wondering how we would afford to do anything else. One of the worst things about this place is the parking lot. The entire lot is at a steep angle, I can't imagine how anyone could get in or out in snow or sleet. The people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. The rooms appeared somewhat clean, but the beds and pillows were hard as rocks. The bed had two flat sheets on it instead of a fitted and the blanket looked like something I would have let my dog sleep on. I looked for an outlet to plug my phone into in the room and the only outlet I could find was the one the bedside lamp was plugged into. An old brown extension cord ran to the other side of the bed for the other lamp. There was one plug in by the sink that the coffee maker (a really ancient yellow minature Mr. Coffee) and the hair dryer (desperately in need of cleaning from a clogged filter) shared. There was a bottle of complimentary shampoo on the sink which we dumped after noticing that the seal had been broken. The bath towels were about the size of two hand towels and extremely rough. The ceilings were stained and appeared ready to fall in at any moment in spots. Now here's the best part. When we checked in we were told there was wireless internet and furnished instructions on how to connect to it. I was able to connect to it for a brief time the first evening, but couldn't connect when I tried later that evening. I tried again the next morning hoping to check on some of the events we were interested in. No luck again! My husband called the front office and was told that they have a tough time connecting with internet at the hotel and that I should bring my laptop down by the pool for better reception. Are you serious??? I finally tried it later that day in desperation, and was able to see yet another connection option of the hotel's I hadn't even been able to see from our 2nd floor room. I was able to connect after a few tries but, once again lost the connection when I tried to look at a second site. By then I was so mad I shut my computer down and went back to the room.

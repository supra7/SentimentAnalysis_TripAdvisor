While I'm glad that some reviewers had a good stay here, I really had a sub-par experience for 2 nights. I almost always stay at Marriott properties, have mid-tier \"status\" and enjoy the brand. But: 1. The whole hotel (except for the lobby and restaurant) is way over-due for a remodel. The furniture in the elevator lobbies is cracked, chipped, and looks like something you might find along Rt 66 in the hinterlands of Nevada alongside some tumbleweeds. The carpet and wallpaper are no better. My room was a shambles...there had, at some point, been a leak in the room above mine (on the 6th floor) and there's a huge water stain marring the popcorn stucco ceiling above the bed, punctuated by a big, shoddy-workmanship patch-job to the underlying sheetrock. My bed's skirt was stained the entire way around...left side, foot, right side with large black scuff scrapes and stains of an entirely different sort that I don't want to speculate on (I have pictures). 2. The reservations and front-desk staff did nothing to accommodate standard requests. I like to stay on a high floor, and won't cry about it if I don't. My reservation included a request to stay on a high floor. When I checked in with 2 co-workers (one with higher status and one with lower), mysteriously, I got the lowest floor of the three of us even though they hadn't requested a high floor. I pushed back gently with the front desk rep, and was told I was out of luck. So what's the point of asking me if I would like a higher floor if you ignore it and give those rooms to those who have no preference? 3. My toiletries were USED! hahaha. The shampoo bottle was already opened and half empty (again, I snapped a pic for posterity). The eco-friendly person in me thought \"well, at least they didn't just dump it out,\" but I have to admit I wondered what some sick person might have swapped for the shampoo. Here's the upside: Other than my high-floor room being given to my unappreciative coworkers, the staff in the Concierge Lounge is really exceptional. Very, very friendly and they go out of their way to help out. And even with dirty, outmoded furniture and fittings, the bathroom was spotless. After getting a rebuff from the front desk staff, I decided that pursuing this stuff with local management any further wasn't worth it. But it colored my opinion of the place, and regardless of the room condition, the furnishings and decor are clearly from ~20 years ago and have not improved with age.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Poor Customer Service at the Front Desk\u201d", "Author": "FLJ021251", "ReviewID": "UR124763154", "Content": "I just spent one night at the Marriott near the airport in Phoenix. While this is a full service Marriott, my experience was much less than full-service. I travel almost everyday and last year stayed at 191 different Marriott properties. I called several hours before reaching the hotel to check on my reservation. I was assurred that I was placed on the club level. However, when I got to the hotel I was on the eleventh floor and the club is on the twelth. Also, this hotel does not have suits and it is about six miles fromt he airport! Check in went smoothly, however the two young ladies working at the front desk were not friendly at all and could not provide any directions. They simply handed me a small card with directions Parking can be a problem in that there is not much space. The lobby area has a small bar area and while there was only about eight people in the bar it was very noisy. I think lack of carpet and much tile make sounds very loud. After checking in at 7:20 I went up to the 12th floor to the club to grab a quick snack before dinner. However, the only thing out was sweets. I asked about the food and was told that everything gets put away at 7:00PM. So, they open at 5:30 and put everything away at 7:00. That makes no sense to me. The sleeping room is pretty standard Marriott, however, bedding was worn. The room was quiet and there was a flat screen television. The bathroom was fairly small, but the shower seem to work very well. There are no restaurants within walking distance. I had requested a 5:00 AM wake up call, but that did not happen. My profile request for extra towels and news paper was not followed. This hotel seems to be resting on the fact they they are a Marriott and close to the airport.

My room appeared to be newly carpeted, and it was very clean and comfortable. It included all the amenities Marriott is known for, as well as a new extra-large flatscreen TV.

The bed was delightfully comfortable & I slept well. The bathroom was large and well appointed. It included a scale. (ot sure if that is a pro or a con! ha ha) As already mentioned in other reviews, the staff here are exceptional. They go out of their way to serve. No matter who I met in the hall or lobby or the maid, I was always greeted with a smile, a hello and they asked me how I was enjoying my stay. The food here is a little pricey, but was very delicious. I am happy to give this hotel my highest rating. Notes: As usual with Marriott, Internet is free in the lobby - $11 per day in room. This hotel is very convenient to the airport. Travellers should be aware that it is a bit of a drive to the downtown, and there are no eating establishments within walking distance. Thus, all meals must either e eaten on sight (two restaurants available), or you will need to take transportation. For those who like outdoor exercise, there is a very nice park/nature reserve jogging trail about 1/2 mile from the hotel which staff will give you directions to. This provides a great 3 mile loop. The hotel includes a decent exercise room, and a nice pool. My only small \"complaint\" is that the hotel uses a citrus scented cleaning product which seems especially strong when entering the room. I am very sensitive to scent so I got a small headache the first night from it. After that, the smell either dissapated over the next day, or I adjusted used to it.

I'm in the media and was covering the New England Patriots-New York Giants Super Bowl, which was held in (fairly) nearby Glendale at the slick University of Phoenix Stadium. This was one of the NFL's official hotels for the event. The location is probably the major selling point for this hotel. Though not right around the corner from the airport, it's certainly a short drive. Moreover, it's nicely situated at the midway point between downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale and sits next two a pair of major highways. This was convenient for me -- downtown held the official NFL events, while Scottsdale hosted the Super Bowl parties -- and would be for other visitors to the sprawling Phoenix area, I'd wager. Beyond the obvious business district, downtown doesn't have much in the way of attractions: a Diamondbacks or Suns game, and a few decent bars (including Marjerle's, a fun sports bar owned by the former Suns player) and restaurants. Most of the nightlife, meanwhile, is in Scottsdale. The hotel also is not far from some Camelback mountain and other hiking trails if you're looking to do some outdoorsy stuff. More immediately, there are several stores and (mostly chain) restaurants on the streets surrounding the hotel. The hotel itself was nothing special but certainly serviceable. My room was reasonably-sized, though not especially modern. But no real complaints: there was a comfortable bed, a nice TV and a friendly staff. It was February, so I didn't use the pool. If I'm back in Phoenix as a tourist for just a day or two, I may opt for a hotel downtown or in Scottsdale.

The bar at this hotel was an afterthought as it was in the middle of the cold lobby. It felt like a train station. I frankly have no idea what the designers were thinking when they built this. It's bright and has no more than 8 stools at the \"bar\". That's it, no tables no nothing. Not a place you want to go to relax. I have seen better \"bars\" at some Holiday Inn Express where they pull out a temporary bar for a few hours at night to serve guest. Well, the one at the Marriott also closes early, so don't expect to be served if you arrive on a late flight. Room service food is good. There is no 24 hr service and there is no food anywhere if you happen to come in late. Not even vending machines. The shuttle goes every 30 minutes. Not often enough for my taste but Phoenix is also not a major international airport, which may explain why this hotel's service was really lacking compared to Marriotts at major airports.

I provided my confirmation number to the desk agent and asked if they could help me out. I returned and my boarding pass was waiting for me at the front desk. It was A60 (for those of you who know Southwest), so not bad. If I had a complaint, its is that the bar is right in the lobby across from the front desk.

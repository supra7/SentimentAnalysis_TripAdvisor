Glad we didn't we noticed people walking through the parking lot to get to the gas station, they didn't approach us at all. The pool was out of order on our last night there my son was a little disappointed about the pool. One thing I couldn't understand is why the breakfast was set up all on one side making it a little congested for people that only wanted fruit or cereal. They should restructure that little part, I don't liek congestion. Overall we had a good stay!

A few of them \"eyed\" me as I walked through the parking lot. I took every valuable I had in the car and kept it in my room at night, or with me during the day in the car. In fact, I'm surprised the car was even there in the morning. The particular second floor room that I was in had cigarette burns on the curtains. Overall, the entire hotel looked like it had not been updated in about 15 years. Even the lobby area was dark, dingy, and uninviting. Not only did I skip breakfast, but I cut my stay short by a day and got the heck out of there. You get what you pay for.

You had to wind through a residential area and appartment complexes. It was right near the Gallaria mall and close to the freeway. One evening my two children and I arrived back at the hotel probably about 11:30pm and we were approached in the parking lot by a nicely dressed man saying he and his wife were stranded back on the highway and his family was in Ohio and they needed money to stay in a neighboring hotel. They were short $16.00 and could I help them out. I gave him $20.00 and hurried into the hotel. Legitimate? who knows, well probably not but I figured 20.00 was worth there being no scene or other problems with my kids there. I didn't really feel unsafe and the parking lot was very well lit.

We arrived at the hotel after dark, we thought it looked nice and it also has a Country Inn & Suites across the parking lot. We were literally there for 45 minutes when our car got broken into. We had gone up to the room and started upacking, my son and his friend went back to the parking lot to get a drink from the cooler in our car. There was glass all over everywhere, car was completely ransacked and several electronic items including our video camera (which was hidden down in the console) were stolen. We had left nothing out in plain view. We called Dallas PD, they took an hour and half to respond. While waiting for the police, we observed the parking lots of both hotels crawling with thugs looking into people's cars, one would even change clothes once in a while from a strategically based bag of clothes sitting behind the dumpster. We stayed close to the front doors of the hotel while waiting. We called the PD back to say there were several people checkiing door handles and looking in cars, the still took forever. When they finally arrived, they informed us that this is not a safe side of town to stay on and that this happens all the time in this parking lot. The next day in daylight, we discovered there was a low-income apartment building right next door to the Country Inn & Suites (across parking lot from Comfort Suites Park Central). This is where all the low-life, degenerate, coackroach thugs were flowing out of. We also observed several obvious hookers (about 2:00 am by this time) flowing in and out the front doors of the Country Inn and Suites. We alerted the hotel clerk of what had happened. He didn't seem surprised. We lost half a day of vacation getting our window replaced and can't replace the electronics.

The rooms were good sized, mini-suite rooms with the beds, and a couch and coffee table, a small desk, and the bathroom. Also we had a mini-fridge and a microwave, and an iron and ironing board in each room. A few small things with our room were loose tiles in the bathroom which wiggled if you stepped on them, and a very loud A/C unit- sort of like a freight train coming through- the fan was vibrating and hitting something, never could get it to quiet down below a dull roar. Also the shower head leaked- it shot up and into the side wall of the shower. The breakfast was included and was very good, the waffles came in the shape of Texas! Also were eggs, sausage and bacon, hash browns, cereal, donuts and muffins, bagels, milk, juices and coffee - we found it to be a very wide selection. Staff was not friendly in general, the lady tending to breakfast area talked on her cell phone the whole time each morning so no one was able to ask her any questions, if needed.

Check in was quick and efficient. We were given a room on the third floor. The room looked nice and clean. The bathroom was spotless. Closer inspection showed the grout on the tile floor was not in great shape. A lot of cracks and a few floor tiles were loose. The toilet seemed to get clogged fairly easily so I am betting the floor was in rough shape from it overflowing multiple times. Just hope it got mopped some. The shower head was also in bad shape. It had multiple setting but is was falling apart. I finally got it set on just a normal spray, but it took a lot of fiddling to get that. The rest of the room looked good though one of the beds was pushed up right next to the A/C unit. Looking at the beds, they looked nice and clean. They even use fitted sheets which I really like. HOWEVER, the fitted sheet on my bed was coming off and as I was fixing it I noticed some bad stuff. The mattresses on the beds looked extremely old. My bed has a large brown stain that started on the top and went down the side. Seeing this would have normally led me straight back to the from desk, but there was a VERY clean, white pillowtop add on over the mattress held in place by elastic bands. While that made it tolerable for me, I still cannot give real high marks for this hotel because of this. I just tried to not think about it and what the stain might possibly be. The TV was a big tube TV. However, many channels would show up black. All the channels were mislabeled on the screen. Not sure if it was just our room or the whole place was like that. The breakfast was another downside. The selections where very slim and the person who was suppose to restock items was not very attentive or even around very much. SO really I was stuck eating cereal because all the bagels and pastries were gone. The only hot items I saw were eggs (weird, precooked individual serving eggs) and bacon (very flimsy and thin) or sausage. Not even any biscuits to go with it. The hotel is located next to a couple of apartment complexes. There is a gas station in the next parking lot where it looks like day laborers hang out all day.

But that wasn't the worst part, we got up on our second morning and walked to our car and see some people standing around their car and they asked if our car was ok because their truck's passenger window had been smashed out and items were stolen. Luckily our car was fine but we felt really bad for them. Then the hotel never cleaned up the glass, it was still there when we left this morning! The location of the hotel is not great. It is confusing to find, confusing to get on I-75N from, and there is a sketchy apartment complex right behind it with some creepy/sketchy people walking through the parking lot at all hours. No wonder you have to use your key card to access the front lobby after 9pm! The only good thing about the place, the price and the room layout. You have a separate living room area and separate bedroom area. Too bad the air conditioning is only in the bedroom area so that made it difficult for the living room to get cool enough.

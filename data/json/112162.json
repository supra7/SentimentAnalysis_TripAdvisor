I was originally pleased when I called the hotel to see if they offered any additional discounts from the online source and they knocked ~$20 off the per night price. The rating was 3.5 stars so we opted to book 3 rooms for 3 nights. Upon arrival the hotel has a very small lobby with quaint features. It wasn't until we actually went to the rooms and realized that the hotel is very outdated and not as clean as hoped. Our stay went downhill once we first went to the hotel bar for a quick drink prior to dinner and the entire lobby smelled horribly like a sewage leak. That night when ready for bed each of the 3 rooms were at least 75 degrees F with no thermostat control. My particular room was perhaps in the 80s all night with me sleeping on top of the sheets and sweating nearly the entire time. Central air conditioning in a hotel???? The walls might have well been paper since everything in the neighboring room was audible. All three of us independently opted to leave this hotel first thing in the morning upon congregating. Apparently we weren't the first people to opt leaving this hotel so they included a mandatory $50 fee for early check out but said we can dispute the charge with our credit card. We moved to a name brand hotel just across the street for $30 more and were absolutely satisfied. Don't stay at this hotel. The small savings are not worth it.

No room service If they promoted this monument as exactly what it is \" a chance to stay in a really historic hotel with 1928 detail\".

Everything about this hotel makes you feel like you're living the life of luxury in the '30s, which is a fantastic experience. You won't get that at any of the more modern hotels in Phoenix. It's historic, but it's clean and well appointed and has all the conveniences of a modern hotel. The only negatives about the Hotel San Carlos are parking (valet parking is $20/day, but not easily discovered; but the parking problem is typical of all downtown hotels) and the restaurant, the Ghost Lounge, which is a separate leased operation - it doesn't fit the character of the rest of the hotel. There is an adjoining coffee shop, however, which serves breakfast and lunch.

Well, put me down in the \"LOVE it\" category! My wife and I spent 4 nights there back in June while we were in Phoenix for a convention and would gladly have made it 4 WEEKS if we could have! We loved everything about the hotel! Having read the reviews on here, we were braced for the worst--but were pleasantly surprised in every regard! From the moment we arrived, the staff could not have been any more helpful or accommodating! After one minor mix-up, they more than compensated for that by giving us complimentary breakfast vouchers for the duration of our stay. When we expressed interest one night in trying a particular restaurant elsewhere in Phoenix (several miles away), the staff printed out directions for us & were eagerly awaiting our return later that night to hear our impressions of the restaurant; on another occasion, they took care of arranging a cab for us, etc. Extremely helpful and accommodating in every regard! Our room was far more spacious than the reviews here had led me to expect--and beautifully decorated and appointed! The central air (which you almost never find in newer hotels) was an especially nice surprise. There was a brief period one night when my wife complained of hearing noise from the neighbors (I myself was out at the time) but that was it; neither of us ever noticed any disturbance whatsoever the entire rest of the time. In fact, everything about our stay at the San Carlos was about as restful, tranquil, and peaceful as could be imagined! As others have mentioned, the location of the hotel is ideal: not only is there a light rail stop right outside the doors, we were within easy walking distance (5 min. or so) of the convention center and MANY fine restaurants! We didn't have a bad meal the entire week! Also walked to an AZ Diamondbacks game one night. If you enjoy getting away from the cookie-cutter sameness of modern chains and are up for a place with a real history, vintage feel, distinctive character, and loads of charm--then the Hotel San Carlos is just the ticket! We have nothing but warm and wonderful memories of our week there and would gladly have stayed far longer if we could have!

I don't like this type of location as a single woman traveling alone but didn't complain until the next morning after an incident that night that made me feel unsafe. The room was right next to the vending/ice machine room and about midnight two men were banging the vending machine (which was on the shared wall as my room) attempting to break in apparently. It went on for about 5 minutes then I heard them leave. Didn't sleep well after that...and I could hear the ice machine every 30 minutes. The room was also very hot even after calling down to the front desk the first evening and asking if there was a/c (no). She told me to check the antique heater on the wall and it was turned off. Only found out the next morning from another staff member that there is also a vent that is used to pump heat/air through the entire hotel that I could have closed too but was not told about this. There was a ceiling fan in the room that help move the warm air around. Fortunately, I was given a new room the next morning (again at the end of the hall but it was a dead end, not one with an access door to the pool/vending/ice machines.

Had to curl my hair in the room because, again, no counter space. Nice pool on the 3rd floor for some quiet time and free breakfast was okay (plain or omelette, has browns, and toast), but juice is not included and pricey (nearly $4...milk a little cheaper at ~$3).

A friend showed us several news paper articles about the huge $$ remodel at the Hotel San Carlos. She got us an excellent group rate.We all were excited for the event and not having to drive home. We walked into the antiquated lobby and I almost turned around, it's clean but poorly decorated. My husband suggested that maybe they simply hadn't gotten to this area and to have patients. He sounded like the voice of reason, so I acquiest. The ladies room in the lobby looks like something in a Russian nightmare, I was told by the truly lovely woman at the front desk that this was newly remodeled. Go see for yourself, but be prepared you may want to vomit! The thread-bare carpet and rotting moldings in the hallway should have sounded an alarm to prepare me for the atrocities to come, but I was completely unprepared for this hotel 'suit'!! The furniture looked like early pioneer meets the '70's and the bathroom was more than hideous, including the nasty rusty old tub. Please do not stay here, even if it were gifted, it wasn't worth the ensuing trauma, The next morning at breakfast, our friend was mortified, it was difficult to comfort her as we all felt the same. I felt horrible for her as she had planned this celebration for some time. (oh yeah, the decor in the dining room, truly frightening) But we did manage a good laugh. We all left and where thrilled to shower and scrub ourselves in our own homes. This unfortunate time has since become a very private joke! We (our group) consider ourselves well traveled, broad minded and enjoy a variety of experiences, but this was to much. I/we all have empathy for the homeless and there plights but why they allowed a stinky homeless guy in the lobby claiming to be the owner, I can't say. I guess that explains the lateness of this review, just to difficult to revisit.

We had read the reviews on this site and some other sites about the quaintness and about how the bartender's specialty was blackberry mojitos, and of course the thrill of staying in a \"haunted hotel\". Like others we were lured to the hotel by the age of the hotel as I am a history buff and I will say that if you are looking to walk back into time into the 1930's then this place is for you. But, that having been said you have to keep in mind the hotels from that period. Some of the accomodations have been updated and a large part have not. I expected extremely small rooms and the Hotel San Carlos did not dissapoint, in fact one of the spare bedrooms in my home was about the same size as our hotel room and I have a small home. The hotel did not help the confinement by furnishing the room with a large amoire and television that took a whole corner up. The bathroom was too small for two people to be in at once unless one stood in the shower, whereas the toilet and sink were somewhat new the plumbing hooked to it was the original plumbing. In the shower you could see where some of the tiles had been removed to put in the usual one handle shower control and take out the two handles that were common for the era. They couldn't match the tiles back up exactly. There was a small tattering of a sign in the shower that advertised that water temperature could fluctuate with water pressure and boy they weren't kidding when my wife flushed the toilet while I was showering and scalded the heck out me. I could only hope that it didn't carry into the next hotel room and I wasn't scalding some guy or gal taking a shower in there whenever I flushed. There is no insulation in the walls, and I don't believe they even knew what it was when the place was built way back when. Consequently I could hear the person next door gently snoring through the night but it wasn't overwhelming and luckily we had a room at the end of the hall on the 3rd floor so we only had one common room wall. I would say that if you decide to say here the 3rd floor accesses the pool on the roof and when we went out to the pool at midnight there were a lot of young people from the bar downstairs who had congregated to the poolside tables to continue drinking so I would think that those rooms at the end of that hallway would be a problem for excessive noise. The Marilyn Monroe suite is right at the end of that hallway on the 3rd floor and shares a common wall with the pool area. I told my wife before we arrived that if they still had the old key locked door locks we would have to leave our luggage in the trunk of the car when not in the room, but they had moved into the 21st century on that one with the card swipe locks, which was a relief. There is no parking on site, but with your room fee they give you a day pass for the parking structure one block to the East. There were some street people out begging and stuff between the hotel and the parking structure but since Arizona honors all concealed weapons permits and I have one from my home state of Nevada we just walked on past and ignored them. Anyone reading this who has a permit can contact the Department of Public Safety and veryify that your permit will allow carry in this state. Anyway, the street people weren't bothersome. We checked in and were totally impressed with the downstairs lobby complete with its plated copper elevators from the period. After dropping our luggage in the room we went through the hallways taking pics with our digital cameras of the pictures, etc. Just normal stuff was captured. Then we went and sat at the pool for a while and dipped our hands into it just to say that we had touched the pool water where Marilyn Monroe used to swim, but we didn't actually jump in. This was early in the evening and we were alone in the pool area. We went down to the lobby and took photos of the restaurant and bar and then decided to go out and have dinner at one of my favorite places in Phoenix, Rustler's Rooste up on South Mountain, where you can actually get rattlesnake for an appetizer. As we got out of the elevator on the third floor lobby to go to our room and change for dinner there was the overpowering smell of flowers or perfume or something in the lobby. I asked my wife \"what is that smell?\" and she said that it was the floral arrangement in the lobby. I told her \"go check...all the flowers up here are artificial\". After picking at a bunch of atificial flowers she said \"so, it's somebody\"s perfume\". I said \"yeah....whose\" as from the lobby you can see down all three hallways and we were the only one's there. We looked at each other and I took two pictures with my digital camera and suddenly her cell phone rang inside her purse. This was a kind of red flag with me as I work nights at a casino position on the Vegas Strip and this was about ten minutes after I normally start work, so I thought \"uh huh, someone didn't get the message that I wasn't at work tonight\". I asked my wife \"who's calling you at this time of night?\" She replied \"I don't know\" as she opened her purse and took out the phone. She opened her phone cover and looked at me and said \"you are!\" I said \"I'm not calling you, I'm standing here with my hands on the camera!\" I reached for my Samsung Rant in the pouch on my belt and was astonished to see that it was active and had dialed the last number called even though the Rant keyboard locks automatically after ten seconds of non use and two buttons must be pushed in succession to unlock it. My phone had called my wife's phone right next to me! While we pondered for a minute over whether my phone had an electonics issue, my wife looked at me and said \"notice something....the scent's gone.\" Gone it was and so was my chance for any other photos . At dinner my wife said that the event was \"impressive\", but I told her, \"I don't think so, but it was kind of [--]up! If it had wanted to be impressive it would have sent a text message, something like \"I do not smell like flowers , you dumb [--]\" As it was it not only made me a little concerned but also cost me my chance for anymore photos. Anyway, that's my weird story for the place, make of it what you will. We noticed some other oddities later on that evening, but that could have been from a somewhat then heightened sense of imagination after the phone event. After coming back in from dinner we grabbed a maintenance guy changing light bulbs in the main lobby chandeliers and engaged him in some conversation and he was quite sociable, but as soon as I changed the topic to ghosts (which now was my foremost thought after the phone thing) this guy turned from nice to ice in like two seconds flat and walked away. Apparently the property owners do not want any of this discussed and are happy that most guests only complain or are concerned about the small rooms. Oh, and when we went to the bar for blackberry mojitos the bartender met us with a \"what's that?\" response. He said that the last bartender was a mixologist specialist of some kind but he only pours beer and stuff. In the morning we were behind a host of other guests complaining about their rooms and trying to get some compensation back. One last thing for staying here: when you leave the parking garage you actually come out on the other end of the garage from which you entered which means an immediate right turn upon exit and at the next light will bring you back to the hotel. The garage will get you turned around and if go left upon exit you will get to navigate a bunch of Phoenix's one way streets trying to find your way back. Also the attendent in the garage was creepier than any ghost could ever be as he took my hotel ticket, argued with me that I did not need it to reenter and then suddenly gave it back with a \"here's your ticket sir, you can't get back into without it\" just as we were about to drive out.

This hotel wasn't the closest but we wanted to check out the downtown area while we were here, and stay at a \"haunted\" hotel. Nothing supernatural happened to us while at this hotel, but to be fair we were only here one night. The rooms were just big enough for us, not spacious but comfortable enough. The wireless was more secure than a lot of other hotels, you needed to log in to use it, but it was still included in the price of the room which I didn't expect in a downtown hotel. Unloading at check in was a little confusing because we arrived facing the opposite direction of the valet stand, which doesn't really have a designated area to pull into, it's just curbside parking which is fine if you arrive at the hotel with it to your right. The clerk at check in (and out) since it was the same lady, was very nice and gave us a little history about the hotel and told us where the pool was and chatted for a bit. The pool was a little small, but it was just nice enough to get a little dip, not great for swimming laps if that is your thing. The pool deck is nice though, lots of chairs and space to lounge. It was really cool to swim in a pool that Marilyn Monroe swam in too. That was probably the highlight of the hotel, other than the awesome coffee stand outside on the street. It is located just outside the restaurant next to the valet stand. The guy who was running it the two days we were there was awesome, I believe that his name was John. And he made some great drinks and they were so reasonably priced. I didn't expect that in the city. The only thing that was bad about this stay was that the day of check out we were packing up and the phone books fell out of the closet and a pair of underwear were hidden behind the phone books on the shelf. Housekeeping must have missed them, but working in hotels I think that was kind of a big deal. I didn't make a big deal about it but know that it would have been bad if someone else had found them. We just took a garbage bag and threw it over them and tied it off and put it with the rest of our trash. We didn't want the chance that they would be left again.

We booked a room at the hotel well in advance and figured it would be fun to stay in a rustic place. I requested a suite since some of the reviews complained about the smaller single room size. Our flight got in late so we decided to find something to eat at the hotel- no such luck. The bar & hotel restaurant were both closed along with no room service after dinner. We opted for Dominos and went up to our room. We were on the second floor (Carrey Grant room). Upon entry, the room was very cool. It had a classical charm that some might look at as old and outdated, but it was really quite nice. The bathrooms were small and \"old\", but again, we were not expecting anything over the top modern. The first night we were getting ready for bed when a loud noise stared coming from the radiator. It eventually stopped 20 minutes later to give way to the loud music coming from the downstairs Irish Pub. Our room was RIGHT on top of the pub ceiling. It was so loud that we did not fall asleep until the bar closed at 2:30 AM. It was a rough first night and neither of us were happy with the room. We went to the front desk the next morning and asked to be moved to another room, the hotel was booked and there was nothing available. They informed us that if the music was too loud, they would send security over to tell them to turn down the music. So that seemed fair. The next night around 1AM the radiator in our room started to clang again. It was so loud it sounded like someone should have been standing there hitting it over and over with a pipe. We figured it would stop, as it did the night before, but it continued for over 2 hours. We were beside ourselves. The clanging stopped around 4am and construction outside our window began at 6am. We had noticed the construction the day before and my boyfriend had joked about how at least they weren't jack hammering. Well, at 6am they started jack hammering. The fact that the walls of the hotel are so thin does not help. You can really hear EVERYTHING that is going on around you. (more about this on night #3) By this point, we were both just exhausted from not getting any sleep & from running around mixing business & pleasure. I guess we could have said something about the radiators, but I think they would have tried to pull it off that our room was haunted instead of fessing up to poor maintenance of the historic hotel. (It is said that the hotel is one of the most haunted hotels in the US and that when they dug the well to the hotel in the early 1900's that they dug too deep and opened up a spiritual vortex. You can take a ghost tour of the hotel where they will show you the vortex- we did not make it... read on) The 3rd night (Friday) of our stay in Phoenix, we went out with friends and didn't get in until about 1am. The radiator seemed to have a knack for starting RIGHT when we would get into bed. This night, it clanged and banged all night long. I cannot describe how loud it was. You could not sleep through it. It did stop just in time for us to hear the room next store \"start\", if you know what I mean. I really don't know which was worse. By 7am I was up flipping through the phone book looking for another hotel. We called up the Wyndam and took a room for only 20.00 more per night than our current room. We were out of the hotel by 9 that morning. Hindsight, we should have left after the first night. Here's what I will say in fairness to Hotel San Carlos: It is a beautifully historic hotel. There is a lot of history and character that make it unique to the big chain hotels. The room prices are very high. So you are paying for the historic charm. I had a AAA membership discount and it was still fairly expensive. I would highly recommend requesting a room away from the Irish Pub and even from the front of the building to avoid the construction outside. The rooms do get chilly, showers are not very pleasant and walls are paper thin. Next time, I think I'd stay for a night then get the hell out and go somewhere more comfortable. The Wyndam was excellent.

Apparently the staff members whom previous reviewers have carped about had all taken the day off. A word about rates. Plan in advance, look at booking services like expedia, or use whatever discount one is eligible for, but there's certainly no reason to pay the rack rate, at least during midweek. Those who think big box chain hotels are the height of luxury should NOT stay at the San Carlos. This is a '20s hotel, and the rooms are '20s size, not supersize. But what big box hotels have bronzes and paintings decorating the upper floors? My room was totally satisfactory in the areas of housekeeping, mattress quality, and climate control. If I'd brought my partner, I might have splurged for one of the suites (named after the many old time movie stars who chose the San Carlos) but for a single, the standard room works just fine. When I went for ice, I found the ice machine shut off. But the staff happily provided a bucket of ice from the bar. This typified their positive attitude. The restaurant doesn't share the hotel's '20s decor, but I certainly can't complain. The service was exemplary, the food delicious--I had the sinfully rich \"I'm No Angel Hair Pasta\", a dish touted in another travel review. Currently I'm living on carrot sticks to atone for my lapse, but like any really wothwhile sinning, that pasta was worth it. The faux-Irish pub is quite...well, quite pubby, and no doubt appealing to those who are into bonhomie with strangers. Along with pub food (read appetizers) various brands of UK beer are offered, along with enough brands of scotch to relapse any recovering alcoholic. The San Carlos is within easy walking distance of anything of interest in the center of downtown Phoenix, which is currently undergoing major construction angst. For the adventurous it's near a central bus terminus for low-cost exploration. The usual urban panhandlers are present, but they're quite nonassertive. A steady pace, firm grip on one's purse, and a pleasant refusal of their entreaties suffices. Of course one took the usual big city precautions, but both on the street and in the hotel I always felt safe. The whole San Carlos experience is as close as one will get to a time trip back to Phoenix in the 1920s. That's what I'd hoped for, and I was totally satisfied. I encourage those who empathize with what I've written to visit the San Carlos and enjoy its wonderful ambiance.

This hotel is in a GREAT downtown location. You can WALK to America West Arena. Hotel staff couldn't have been more friendly. You must understand that this is not the Holiday Inn or the Comfort Inn though, it is a HISTORIC hotel so things are going to be old and show wear and tear but it is not a shack by any means. On the weekends you can park at the parking meters for free but on the weekdays you must park in a parking garage nearby and the one I stayed in was $14 for overnight parking but the hotel offers a $9 pass and the parking garage is half of a block away. San Carlos has a cute mid-level pool where you can swim with city views. They have suites for different stars that have stayed there in the past such as the Marilyn monroe suite, Clark Gable, West etc..very cute. The only thing that keeps it from being a \"excellent\" review was the hotel staff messed up the reservation in a few different ways but when I pointed it out they fixed it immediately and did not have any problems with it. They also offer great packages for baseball etc...you MUST check it out because I didnt and realized afterwards that I could have had free parking, 2 Diamondback tickets and 2 free drinks at the restaurant for the same price as just a room reservation. Also had ghosts and a ghost book where you can read about other guests experiences.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Desert, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you get a deal!\u201d", "Author": "Danni0005", "ReviewID": "UR3508904", "Content": "I like this place. I travel alot on business, but stay here when the bearby Hyatt and Wyndham are booked. You can get GREAT rates here. I foud it to be a plaesant place to stay. IF you need to stay downtown. I usually am here when I go to a ballgame. Parking -----, and the neighborhood can be a bit rough, but if you are looking for a room on a buget, this is your place. Pool is nothing special. Rooms are cute, and staff is nice. BUT, I do stay here--and it is FINE if you just need a room. You can walk to ballpark, basketball arena, and convention center. During the summer you can stay here as low as $60 when Hyatt and Wyndham are 2-3 times that. IF you get a good rate--stay at Hyatt first, Wyndham 2nd.

The carpet was stained, the sheets were too small for the bed (and, thus, kept coming off), the television reception was snowy on all but three channels and I had to move the furniture to find an outlet. Alone, these issues would have been tolerable - however, the bathroom was worse. The sink, toilet and shower/tub drains and handles were either rusted or oxidized, the tile was cracked and the grout was black with mildew, and the tiny plastic shower head offered a trickle of water pressure, along with a permanent sign underneath that warned patrons \"a decrease in water pressure is accompanied by an increase in temperature\". In addition, my three colleagues had similar problems with their rooms. My home was built in the 1930's; I have a great appreciation for older architecture and, generally, a high tolerance for the unknowns that can happen in these types of places.

I dont know how many times I said this on my trip to Phoenix while staying at the run down San Carlos. This property has seen better days. Rooms are extremely small. My bathroom could not have been bigger than 6' x 6'. By the way it required a 18 inch step up to get to. Watch your head. By the way watch out for the hot water that comes and goes as well. Glad they warn of that. They dont warn you of the green oxidized faucets or prison toilet that you will be using. If you like cheap, no frills, and do not require heated water then this is the place for you. By the way there is little opportunity to adjust the temp of your room. Vents blow air and radiators come on 3 times a night. The best part of the experience is checkout.

Maybe once thier remodeling is finished it will be nicer, but I felt it was really misleading. The hotel is not in the greatest neighborhood, I pulled up and a few intoxicated patrons from the bar next door were hanging out and \"rough housing\" in front of the hotel, I had computer equipment with me so I was reticent to get out of the car. I drove around the block until they left. The wireless internet was not available as advertised, there is no valet and the parking is a block and a half away, so if you are lugging heavy computer equipment, good luck. I finally found a spot on the street but when I parked I could not help but notice several men sitting and sleeping on the street right near where I parked. The gym is the Y which is 4 blocks away which is no big deal, except the streets were not well lit and again, it's not the greatest area, so I had to pass on my workout. Finally, the shower flooded the tiny bathroom, it had a shower curtain and that apparently wasn't enough. I used most of my towels cleaning up the mess. The cherry on the sunday was the jackhammer that woke me up at 4:35 am in the morning. There is alot of construction going on in this area, but 4:35 am?! I was a mess for my meeting the next day since I was operating on 3 hours sleep. I originally was booked for 3 nights, I checked out the next morning and moved to a hotel in Scottsdale.

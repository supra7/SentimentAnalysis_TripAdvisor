Rooming at such an affordable place enabled us to really see a lot since we didn't have to return sooner. While I can't say it was peaceful, I can't imagine any hotel being quiet in S.D.--it's a city that's got a lot going on, starting with traffic. I hate noise and was not bothered by the ambulances-you don't really sit in your room in a place like S.D. If you're staying in a suite, you know the benefits--works great for us--I like to read to unwind, my husband to work on the computer and/or watch tv. The amount of space for the money is unbelievable. We rented a car and the parking was tight, again--you're in the city--it's to be expected. As for areas where they fell short: We came back so tired at night that we would have liked more options with ordering dinner in.

The bathrobes on the closet are a nice touch. The best thing is parking: At $6 a day, it is quite reasonable for SoCa. The low is breakfast... not many options and it can get very, very crowded.

There is a fabulous dining and shopping district right across the street. Pretty much anything you are in the mood for you can get within a 5 minute walk.

It is a simple hotel, nothing really fancy about it. But it is comfortable and clean. The rooms are very large! And comes with a full kitchen complete with a closet full of kitchen utensils and supplies. While my room only had a king, I felt as though with the right beds, you could comfortably sleep 4-5 people easily. The bathroom was nice and clean with a good amount of counter space. The hotel has a pool and hottub. I did not get the chance to go in, but I walked around it and saw people in there enjoying it. It has a good amount of parking underneath the hotel. The hotel served a wonderful breakfast with freshly made waffles, eggs, cereal, etc. The hotel staff was so wonderful and friendly. They were quick to help me when I got locked out of my room and had great recommendations for food and fun local places.

The pool, though small, was a perfect size for the grand kids and they spent two hours at the pool on two of the afternoons. The staff was great. The breakfast was adequate but we especially appreciated that there were 2-3 staff members helping to clean up, cook the waffles and keep everything well stocked each morning. Our room on the 4th floor had been recently painted and the kitchen was large and took care of all our needs.The living area was spacious enough as was the separate bedroom and bath. I didn't notice any dirty carpets anywhere that we went in the hotel as the previous reviewers have suggested . The beds were comfortable had soft pillows, nice sheets and comforters. Lots of easy access parking. Didn't have any of the noise issues the previous reviewers had. Guess we had more \"considerate\" guests during our stay. Don't really feel a family hotel should be blamed for children running in the hallways. It seems like that is more a issue of \"parenting!\" We actually seemed to have far more adults occupying the hotel during our stay than families. The only bothersome noise we had were from the occasional sirens from the ambulances passing by the hotel to the nearby hospital. The Not So Good: The beds were only doubles which was hard to adjust to when you sleep on a King. The grand kids, who usually sleep in their own beds at home, were definitely cramped for space. Strangely, the kitchen had dishes and utensils but no dish soap, towels or sponge. Guess we were suppose to buy those things at the Albertsons down the street. The overall feel of the room was a bit dated with older t v's and furniture. We prepaid our bill on the internet and it was misleading. It seemed to say the bill was all inclusive but at check out had to pay the taxes as an added amount. The $7 parking per night seemed a bit ridiculous for the location.

But this was just a fabulous experience. I should first say that I am a fan of Pacifica Hotels and look for them when I stay on the coast of California. But what a little gem the Sommerset Suites turned out to be. From the very first moment we walked into the lobby, we KNEW it was going to be a good stay. The front desk was very pleasant, and pointed us to the good (and away from the mediocre) restaurants right around the hotel ... and there are an abundance of them in all types and colors within walking distance of a couple of blocks.. The suite itself was spacious, clean, and way more appointed than the price would indicate. Really nice linens, more than enough high quality towels and product in the bathroom, and comfortable sitting in the living room. I'm not much of a TV watcher, so the older tube TVs didn't bother me much ... but I did appreciate the breadth of channels, including Speed (so I could watch the F1 race!). But having an efficiency kitchen and dining table are much appreciated. Of course, during our short visit there we didn't use it besides making coffee because the hotel had a tremendous free BBQ by the pool on the evening we were there, with really good, high-quality food. It was the real deal, not just some lame burgers and weiners ... but a really nice spread of a variety of food and free beer, wine and margaritas. The staff that were working that evening all participated, and acted as though we were guests in their home and visited with everyone and made sure everything was perfect. They succeeded. And then the free breakfast the next morning was more of the same ... with arm boiled eggs, beautiful fresh fruit, nice granola and yogurt, juices, great coffee, toast and pastries. Plus the fresh Belgian waffles ... and the staff that was on hand were helping everyone with the waffle machines to make sure that the normal screw-ups that happen all the time at other hotels were NOT going to make for a disaster at the Sommerset. Can you tell that I was impressed? Way more than I EVER expected, even though I have come to expect nothing short of excellent from Pacifica Hotels. So I have already booked for three days later this month when I need to be back in San Diego.

The property is a bit dated, so don't expect luxury in terms of room, bathroom or kitchen amenities. However, we found everything to be clean and met our needs.

This is a decent place to stay, but there will be trade-offs. You therefore need to decide what is and is not important with respect to lodging when you stay here. On the plus side, the location is incredible. Hillcrest can't be beat for shops and restaurants, though the number of 'street people' has increased substantially in recent years. All of these are within walking distance of the hotel, as is Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, a movie complex, and two gyms. If you're going to the zoo/Balboa Park, it's not far, and if you're heading to Sea World or the beaches, the freeway is less than five minutes away. The staff at this hotel are professional and there is private parking (though they charge by the day). The Internet in the room is free (perhaps to offset the parking fee). The rooms have a kitchenette, with stove, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and basic utensils. The hotel serves a simple breakfast in the morning, though I ate in my room both times as the lounge was swarming with little kids. Most---if not all---of the rooms have a balcony with table/chairs, though the views are of other buildings. The use of the word 'suite' has been stretched within the lodging industry in recent years. I certainly wouldn't consider these suites, in the traditional sense. This hotel is an Urban experience, in that it is on a busy street right next to a hospital. You will hear sirens at different times of the day and night, and the hum of the city is evident and pervasive in most of the rooms. Unless you're on the 4th floor, you also risk hearing the people above you walking around. The hallways tend to be noisy, as the design makes for an echo of the slightest noise. You also risk hearing your neighbors---as is happening now as I write this, at 11:00 PM--- if you keep your sliding glass door open. The rooms in this hotel are dated, with evident wear and tear. In my most recent room, for example [Room 314], the ceiling was patched in different places; there was a crack in the sink; and the toilet seat wouldn't stay up without my holding it. Unlike most hotels, there is an open breezeway in the hallways, and the hallway carpet is extremely worn. The room I stayed in most recently had a peculiar and foul smell all 3 days, which I was never able to pinpoint. The refrigerator motor was also loud, but I needed it, so I didn't unplug it. The bed was reasonably comfortable and there is a small desk for getting work done. Movies are available on the TV, but at $13 a pop, it's cheaper to go to the theater, or--as I did--buy a used DVD up the street and watch it on my computer. Both times I stayed at the Sommerset Hotel, I was well-aware of how noisy the place is. This last time, in particular, felt as if I was staying in a preschool. For the cost, I'm surprised parents would even bring kids here. The pool is centrally located, and because of the open-air nature of the hotel, the noise permeates the building. On this last trip, the kids were extremely loud all 3 nights, which continued---and mind you, I was on the third floor---until after 9:00 PM. While lax parenting contributed to some of this, I believe the management also had a responsibility for telling the kids/parents to use their 'indoor voices.' Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Will I come back to this hotel in the future? That's a tough one to answer. I love this location and there aren't many hotels around here. But the noise of the place, coupled with peculiar odors and a non-competitive price will make me consider my other options next time. I wouldn't discourage you from staying here, but understand what you're getting into. If the gripes and reservations I cited above don't concern you, this is a great choice.

On each occasion family members stayed a few days with us and were very comfortably accommodated within our suite. The hotel offers a complete breakfast consisting of a great variety of items: hard-boiled eggs, real waffles, bagels, toast, cereals, yogurts, fruit, pastries, juices, coffee/tea. The breakfast area is sunny and cheerful, just adjacent to the outdoor patio and pool. The pool/patio area includes gas grills for grilling food that can be purchased at nearby Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and 3 other grocery stores. There's a fitness center and garage parking. The staff is extremely courteous and accommodating. They are sensitive to guests' needs and impart a family feeling. This is an older but well-maintained property. My husband and I have stayed here two years in a row for over a month during each stay. We recommend Sommerset Suites to everyone we talk to. It is an excellent value and simply a welcoming, intimate and comfortable place to be when you're not out and about enjoying San Diego and environs. We've seen many families with kids here too. While we were here we met other couples who also come for long-term (one month plus) stays. We sit with each other at breakfast and catch up on the previous days' activities and chat about the plans for the day, comparing notes on where to go, where the bargains are, and what's going on -- opera, concerts, newborns at the zoo.

It was definitely not luxury upon closer inspection, but their effort to make things nice was apparent, well executed, and greatly appreciated. First off, the suite was huge and laid out in a way that made it feel more like an apartment. The bed was big and plush and extremely comfortable, the closet was HUGE, the sofa was just right for snuggling in front of the tv, and the kitchen had all the cooking stuff we needed. The little patios were a cute idea, but ours loooked out over the parking lot of the building next door and wasn't as private as it could have been with better design. The free breakfast every morning was a nice touch, and the lady manning the breakfast room (who makes extra thick, yummy waffles) was very nice. Parking there is kind of tight, but doable with some skill, good timing, and a compact car. Getting to the lobby from the parking lot was also a little weird.

Here's the good reasons to stay here: 1. GREAT location. There is soooooooo much to can walk to - restaurants, bars, clubs, grocery stores, stores. It's in a great spot! Although downtown is about 3 miles, on a nice day (which most are in San Diego) it would be a really easy walk! There is plenty of public transportation (bus) as well. 2. Physical property. It's a cool set up - in a U shape with a nice pool/spa/patio area in the middle. It makes it easy to enjoy the great SD weather. 3. Room size. The rooms are all suites with a full kitchen and a sep. bedrroom. Very spacious! It appears all rooms have a patio with furniture - which is awesome! 4. Very clean! 5. Free Wifi that worked very well! The negatives: 1. Although I loved the location and physical layout, the hotel is a bit outdated. Certain things are fairly up-to-date (like the bedding) but other things (like the kitchen) could use a little modernism. In any case, it's all comfortable and worked for us.. 2. The bathroom shower was probably the worst hotel shower head I've had in a while. Maybe it was just bad luck in this room?! It was a cheap fiberglass tub and a THIN shower curtain and didn't hold the water back. 3. At check-in, the clerk was a little surly. However, the other staff I ineracted with seemed a bit friendlier. 4. They charge $6/day for parking, which I thought was a bit ridiculous. 5 There is no workout room!

The first time was for 2+ weeks last December and this year for the same. I had a large, comfortable 1 bedroom unit that included a sofa bed in the main room and tvs in both the living room and bedroom. Since I am a diabetic and have some food issues, I prefer to cook most of my own food. However, there are dozens of restaurants within minimal walking distance and food shops like Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Ralphs, Vons, etc.etc.The room itself while a little dated decor-wise was spotlessly clean and had everything I needed including a full-sized 'fridge, microwave, oven and cooktop, toaster and all necessary pans and utensils. Anything I lacked, the friendly, accommodating Mexican staff brought in, including immediate fixing of wayward plumbing (a toilet that ran). Aron the manager was extremely friendly, helpful and solved an internet problem while I was there. It's true that the building is situated across from a hospital because it was former accommodation for student nurses and doctors, but any complaints about that like in a former review should be modified. If you need a quiet place, you don't park yourself next to a hospital no matter how much double glazing there is. I also booked this motel because of the heated swimming pool and jacuzzi which I needed to workout torn shoulders. The only thing that can be improved in this regard is that there should be a sign--and it made clear when registering--that after hours--or dinner at least--that the small jacuzzi area should be child free and a place to relax since it is very small. Even though I booked the corner room I'd had previiously, at one time a family moved in above me with apparently two small children running and stamping around. But all it took from me was a polite visit upstairs to let the mother know and the problem was solved. My unit had a nice balcony with a view of a freeway, but at least it was a place to sit out and enjoy fresh air. It's true that the breakfast could be improved because there is not much for a diabetic. However, that is certainly a special need and I don't expect every hotel/motel to accommodate this which is why I shop for myself. I did find it a bit annoying that unless I got quickly to breakfast (not always possible with my business appointments) that the newspapers had run out.

I was able to park the car for $6.00 a day, vs $24.00 at the hospital, another savings! I parked my car and walked to the hospital each day after my FREE breakfast. There was a Whole Foods nearby where I was able to shop. After a long day at the hospital, this was so easy as I had my own kitchen to fix something quick. There are many great restaurants nearby if you prefer eating out. Also, they have laundry facilities. Bed was comfortable with lots of different pillows. I also took advantage of the free apples each night at the desk! Everyone here was helpful and nice, from the lady that took care of breakfast, desk clerks, managers, and housekeepers. It was a tough time for me, but I felt very well taken care of at Sommerset Suites. I will return when visiting this area for the zoo and Sea World.

Others here have complained about the noise: be advised, the hotel is next to a hospital, so there is the occasional ambulance going by, and is on a main street in a business district. These things did not bother us, but are good to note. The only other caveat I would note is that we booked our stay only 24 hours in advance and on the hotel's website. When we got there, reception did not have a record of our reservation and the agent at the desk said it must not have come through yet.

The 1 bedroom \"suite\" we had reminded me of the cruddy apartment I had in college. It was serviceable but not at all nice. Mold on the walls, bedroom door would not shut all the way. On the plus side it had a fully kitted out kitchen with utensils, etc. We had a nice balcony that overlooked the hospital next door, which provided a little show one evening for the kids as a medevac helicopter landed and later took off from the roof of the emergency room next door. Luckily it wasn't in the middle of the night. The service was way above what you'd expect in a place like this. The front desk staff was very cheerful, the continental breakfast room staff was also friendly, but the real test was when our daughter had an accident in the bathtub during a bath and when we phoned to get cleaner to clean it up, we got a very quick response (although no offer to clean it up themselves which I wouldn't have expected :).

There was a discount for a 4 day stay. The 1 bedroom suite we were in is quite spacious, and there was a sofa bed in the living room too. It housed my family of 4 comfortably. My wife was very happy with the kitchen, which is adequately stocked. There was a stove with 4 hot-plates, a microwave oven, a refigerator, dishwasher, an oven and utensils of all sorts. Our room was serviced everyday, the rubbish in the kitchen was cleared, our towel changed and our bed made everyday. Well done, the housekeeping staff of the hotel. One improvement that I would like to suggest to the hotel is to change the shelf by the doorway. Apparently, it was a shelf once upon a time, but the door have now been removed, and the several levels of wooden planks now hang loosely on the wall. I only dare to put light things on it. Perhaps it is time to either remove it or install a new shelf. The bathroom has a bathtub, and bath robes were provided. There is pay TV and TV Games in the living room. My son had a good time indulging himself in the games, which comes up to about US$60. Anyway, it is not often that he has such opportunities. Breakfast was provided in the breakfast room, which is beside the pool. This was the highlight of our stay here. The staff in the breakfast room were prompt in replenishing the food, courteous in their interaction with the hotel guests, and very accomodating. There is a variety of food, including the favourite of most guests, self-made waffle. There is also a restroom and TV in the room. The front desk was prompt in checking us in and out, but unfortunately the hotel shuttle was down when we need it to go to the airport. We took a taxi instead, which doesn't cost too much. The hotel is also quite near to the train station. We took a train from Anaheim to San Diego, the costal scenery along the way was great. There were plenty of taxi outside the station. We took a taxi too from the zoo back to the hotel, which cost less than $10. There are also buses passing nearby the hotel. We took bus 10 from the bus stop near the hotel to the old town interchange, and change to bus 9 to go to the Sea World. There is a Vons supermarket less than 1 mile away from the hotel, and also a cheap Chinese restaurant, Panda Express, less than half a mile from the hotel. The hotel is really ideally located for us to explore around the area, as well as to get to the attractions in san Diego.

There is a bus stop close by so you can take the bus to the Gas Lamp district with ease. Hill Crest is known as the \"gay area\" of San Diego and the reason is obvious during the evenings. If this fact somehow bothers you, be advised. Finally, the hotel is located right next to a major hospital. Throughout the day you will hear ambulances racing to the hospital. In my opinion, it was not that big of a deal, but I did hear a few guests complain about the noise. I would suggest asking for a room away from the hospital. The hotel. I would not call the hotel modern; its years are starting to show. However, it was adequately furnished and clean.

This is an older hotel in the quaint, safe, uptown area of San Diego called Hillcrest. It is located directly across the street from a hospital but we only heard ambulances 3 times during our stay and never at night. We stayed on the 2nd floor and only heard walking from above twice in the bathroom. We had a one bedroom suite which had 2 queen beds in the bedroom and a queen pullout sofa in the livingroom. We fit 3 adults and 3 children comfortably. There was a full kitchen with pots, dishes and utensils, a coffee maker and microwave. There was plenty of closet space and hangers to my surprise. There was a balcony off the livingroom that did have a safety bar lock for the children but the bedroom window did not have any lock or screen so if the kids opened it, out they could go. So my husband wedged something between the wall and the window for their safety. There is a laundry room on the 4th floor wich was convenient but you must bring detergent with you or you can buy it at the front desk for $1. There is no change machine in the laundry room so bring that too. The washer is $1 and the dryer is 75 cents. There is a nice pool area with a hot tub, both were very clean and the hot tub nice and hot. Even though it is an older hotel, everything was kept very clean. From the room to the grounds I was very pleased with the cleanliness. There is a complimentary breakfast that was a great start for a busy day. It included bagels, english muffins, toast, 3 types of cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, make your own waffles (great for the kids), apple, orange, and cranberry juice, muffins, coffee, tea and milk. This was a great breakfast with plenty to choose from and something for everyone. Martha was one of the breakfast hosts and she was the BEST!!. She was friendly, helpful with the kids making their waffles and making sure we had everything we needed. She was happy and smiling and we looked forward to seeing her at breakfast each morning. Our last day there Martha was off and breakfast just wasn't the same. We would go back just to see Martha. On our first night at the hotel I noticed the air conditioning unit was leaking water so at midnight I called the front desk and let them know we needed this fixed. The next day when we came home from Legoland, there was a new, updated digital unit installed and in perfect working condition. I also called housekeeping the next night to let them know we needed more shampoo and soap and coffee creamer because we had 6 people in our suite and the next day and every day after there was plenty of everything. I was very pleased with the response I received when I needed something from the hotel, this showed great customer service. This hotel is 30 min. to Legoland, 10 minutes to Sea World and 5 minutes to Balboa Park. They did give us directions at the front desk which was helpful. No matter what time of day we got back to the hotel there was always parking and spots close to the door. We never had a problem parking and the hotel was sold out when we were there. I was a little nervous reading the negative reviews about the parking and ambulance noise and bugs but I did not find any of this to be true.

Upon arrival in Vegas, my mom feel on the jetway and had to be seen in emergency room. Called motel and told them the situation and that we would probably not make it in to the motel until after midnight. Eight hours later, we finally get to motel to find that they have actually changed our reservation to the next day so that we could check in whenever we arrived and could actually not worry about checking out until we were ready to!!! Even though we be checking into our timeshare that same day and did not need to stay the whole time, it was SWEET!!!! They also gave us a room without any neighbors so that we could get some sleep. We were going on 26 hrs plus without sleep. The free internet made it possible for me to quickly locate mobility scooter rentals so that our 10 trip could still be saved. We returned after checking out of our timeshare as we were still in town for another day. We were assigned the exact same room as our first stay. We had our luggage delivered ahead of us, and they gals on duty took great care of them for us. Manager even escorted us to our room and helped get luggage to room. Not something that is \"normal\" at a location like this. Checked out the next morning. Left our luggage at the front desk and told them we would be back later that night to use the airport shuttle and drop off our scooters. NO PROBLEM!!! This is again NOT the typical for a motel like this. When we returned, discussed our pleasant experience with the manager, especially under the circumstances. This place really went above and beyond to assist us as much as possible. The one and only drawback was the shuttle driver who stated to me, \"I don't want to be here\". He then also delivered us to the wrong airline gates. Had to deal with 4 pieces of luggage and mother on crutches across 4 lanes of traffic and into some place where she could sit down and I could go get skycap. Highly recommend this motel.

If you've stayed at a Super 8 before, then you should know what you're getting. The place is in a great location, off the Strip so you don't have the traffic noise, lights and crowds but you can easily walk there in 10/15 minutes. I had a twin room (two double beds) on the ground floor (first floor if you're American). Check-in was quick - had a view of the car park but wasn't there for a view from my room! There was a wardrobe, flat screen TV (didn't check if it worked though), alarm clock and coffee making facilities. The sink was outside the bathroom (like a lot of US hotels) and had a tonne of freebies (free hair wax and toothpaste samples), plus the usual shower/body gel. There were plenty of towels and hot water and the bathroom had a shower over a bath and was a good size. The bathroom fixtures were a bit dated though but clean and functional. This Super 8 doesn't offer free breakfast like most do but does have free coffee available in the lobby (I loathe coffee so the smell was off-putting, but for the vast majority, this is a good thing!). The hotel's right next door to a casino that serves good food - had a breakfast there one morning, which was well priced and had the usual large American portions. There're also vending machines in the Super 8 for water and other drinks you might want. The free WiFi was a good speed and had a good signal in most areas. A few people have commented on the area this Super 8 is in - I didn't have any problem walking to the Strip and felt pretty safe walking back on my own as there was plenty of traffic going past and you could always get a taxi. Overall, would recommend staying here as it's a good base for seeing Vegas and you can get away from the bustle of the Strip, whilst still being close enough to enjoy it when you want to.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Drumheller, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFor The Price, A Decent Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "Nelson S", "ReviewID": "UR124487887", "Content": "After being taken halfway around Vegas by some cabbie who didn't know where he was going, I finally arrived at the Super 8. There's nothing really impressive about this hotel, but that's not so bad. It's perfectly adequate in every way. The beds were comfortable. I got a flat screen TV in my room, that had maybe 25 channels. The air conditioner seemed to have a tough time keeping up, so I'm not sure about its effectiveness when it gets really hot. But it was fine for the duration of my stay. The bathroom was the worst part of the room. The upper corner of the shower wall was dirty and had cobwebs. For some reason, the sink was located outside of the room. They did leave lots of towels, and the free shampoo made me smell all pretty. The hotel does include wireless internet, but I wasn't really impressed with it. It was slow, but it did work all the time. The location is just off the Strip, 1 block east. I was able to walk to Bally's in 5 minutes, but I do walk pretty fast. 10 minutes should get you there, where you can enter in the side door (right by the big sign) and be a short walk away from the monorail. I know some people have complained about the sketchiness of the neighborhood, but I wasn't concerned. There is a 7-11 right next door, where I'd pick up a granola bar for breakfast, saving me a few bucks over a breakfast buffet. The Super 8 is attached to the Ellis Island Casino, which is a little ran down. I spent all of 10 minutes in there and just couldn't handle the smokiness anymore. It's definitely a place that attracts more of a blue collar crowd, so don't have high expectations for it. Overall, it was a pretty good place to stay. It's a solid value for all of $35 a night I paid.

Not only were we allowed to check in, but the rates were great--and the location! You're only a block off the strip. We walked there that night and while walking back was a little sketchy, it's Vegas...I really can't complain. Our check in/out were both smooth and the service very friendly. The room was clean and needed updating, but for the price, we were thrilled. I think we paid around $50 and it was midweek. There was some updating going on; it looked like it was just in the hallways but who knows. They have a couple washers and dryers which was perfect, since we didn't have to go to a laundromat to do our dirty camping washing. I believe they sold the soap at the front desk.

We spent the previous week in Vegas at a nearby resort but since we had to check out of the resort @ 10 am our last day and our flight was not until 1 am this place offered us a cheap room to fill our needs. We wanted a place to allow us a day to lay by the pool if we wanted but during our stay the pool area was closed for renovation to the desk. Oh well there are plenty of other thinigs to keep us entertained in Vegas. We had breakfast one morning earlier in the week @ Ellis Island and were pleased with the food and atmosphere at the Super 8 that we were glad we booked this place. Upon checking out of the resort nearby, we walked down the street and were able to check in early. The front desk staff were very friendly and checkin was quick and easy. The room is a basic room with bed that was a little on the firm side, TV, chair & table, bathroom and sink area that you find in any standard hotle room. It was clean and bright. After dropping our bags off, we headed over to Ellis Island to get a bit to eat before heading out for a day of fun. The food here is fantastic and very reasonably priced, we loved our meals here both time we ate, where else can you get a Steak & Eggs that had a very good steak for $4.99? The breakfast burrito my wife ordered was huge and could easliy feed 2 people. After spending the day on the strip, we returned to the hotel to get ready for our flight home. We took a shower and finished packing. Around 10:30 we checked out and took the shuttle to the airport provided by the hotel. Here is where Super 8 was able to come to the rescue. Upon checking in at the airport we discovered there was an issue with our flights, something to do with flights not correctly confirmed by our travel provider and then connecting flights being cancelled due to weather. After spending 2 1/2 hours at the airport, we need to spend another night in Vegas while we sorted out our flight issues. My wife called the Super 8 to see if we could check back into the room we paid the for but already had checked out. The gentleman at the front desk, Rich I believe was his name, said it would be no problem, our room was still there and he would send the shuttle over to pick us up. The shuttle arrived at the airport to pick us up as promised and upon returning to the Super 8, they gave us new keys to the same room we had used ealier in the day. After several calls to the airlines' toll free number we were confirmed on new flights for the morning. The shuttle to the airport in the morning went smoothly like it had on the previous times we took advantage of the shuttle. The beds were a little firm and the pillows were a little think for our liking but the hotel is currently under a renovation so I hope this is something they will change when done. I overheard the woman at the front desk explain they were renovating the entire hotel, they were currently doing the common areas and then will work on freshing up the rooms at a later point. I would have no issues using this Super 8 again in the future. They came to the rescue for us when our flights were messed up and the free airport shuttle is great.

I had originally planned to stay at the airport La Quinta, which also accept pets but is not walking distance to the Strip. The reservationist said Super 8 was closer, and had a mid-week special running for $33/night for 3 days so I took it. I've never stayed at a Super 8 and was a little more than leery about the hotel and location. I had no expections whatsoever given the price, but was pleasantly surprised at what $33 bucks could buy. The street doesn't appear to be the safest area especially at night, and has poor street lighting due to large vacant/under construction lots that run along Koval Ln. However, the nearest intersection is so busy with car and foot traffic at all hours that I didn't mind walking to the strip after the sun went down. Just use your common sense. The hotel is 1 (Las Vegas) block from the strip and about a 10 minute walk - or less, if you cut through Ballys at the side entrance. The room was your standard motel room with a flat screen tv, coffee maker, a/c, etc, nothing exceptional. The linens were clean, but I noticed the boxspring/mattress had various stains at the side. I guess as long as the sheets were clean, I didn't need to know or see what was underneath. The hall carpets were stained but my room was clean and okay. I discovered that all 3 icemakers on all 3 floors were broken, which was a disappointment, however, on my 3 day they replaced them with new ice machines. All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. I think if you have no unrealistic expections, you wont be disappointed. I mean, you do get what you pay for, and if we all had the $200 to $300+ per night to shell out for the Bellagio--we would, so I have no complaints. It's a good deal if you only want to crash for a few days, and don't intend to spend much time in the room, but just to sleep. The pros are the proximity to the Strip and being able to park your car directly in front of your room. They also have Ellis Island next door, open 24 hours. I didn't eat there, but looked at the menu, which was inexpensive and had the standard Denny's-esque food items. It was fairly busy, and the patrons seemed to be locals.The one con that may be a big deal to some (besides the obvious lack of any semblance of luxury) is the dark unlit street. A couple street lamps couldn't hurt, and the creepiness factor may intimidate some people. There were a few homeless panhandlers hanging out at the corner Arco and at the bus stop across the street, but not unlike the many homeless you see on the Strip asking for money. It's just that seeing a few on a dark desolate street seems more ominous than the ones you see on the busy well-lit Strip. They didn't bother me and I had no problems.

And there is complimentary tea/coffee 24/7. But there is no free breakfast in the morning as it says on the sight - this is an error made by Super 8. The rooms are fairly spacious - but very basic. But we got a good deal and were happy with the place.

I stayed here for a family wedding. The rest of my family were in the Luxor/Bellagio and I was glad I had decided to stay somewhere smaller/cheaper which did not entail a six mile walk from the hotel lobby to the room which is the case with those big Vegas hotels. (I reckon I was on the strip in not much less time than it owuld have taken me to get down there from a room at the Bellagio once you had taken into the account the lengthy corridors, waiting for elevators etc etc). check-in was fast and easy with no queues, they had internet access (expensive but good that it was available) and free coffee in the lobby (be warned, Las Vegas hotels don't seem to supply the tea and coffe making facilities beloved of English hotels). An added bonus is the very blue-collar small Ellis Island Casino which is apparently where the locals go to gamble. They make their own beer, the steaks are meant to be great value (although I never got to try one). Being an Englishman in Las Vegas, I also quite liked being near 'real' things like the local 7-11 which meant I could buy bottled water and food etc as pretty good value (such places exist on the strip but are relatively few and far between). I felt pretty safe walking around this area even late at night although you do see the occasional signs that you are away from the wealth of the Strip - eg poor crazy people yelling at traffic, mumbling to themselves etc. On a general note re Las Vegas, it's amazing how long it can take to walk from one hotel to another even though they appear quite close on the Map which might be worth bearing in mind if you are working out where to stay. The 301 and 302 (Express) buses which run up and down he strip are relatively fast and easy to use - although they can get crowded and you need to make sure you have the correct change before getting on... (2 dollars a ride on the 301 or 5 dollars for an all day pass, and I think 3 dollars on the 302).", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Super 8 Las Vegas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d111731-Reviews-Super_8_Las_Vegas-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$40 - $87*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4250 Koval Lane</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "111731", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/50/b0/cb/two-queen-room.jpg"}}

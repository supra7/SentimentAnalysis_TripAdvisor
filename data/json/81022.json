Before moving back into the city, this was one of my favorite stays in San Francisco. Now, every now and then my lady and I will head down for a \"stay-cation\". The staff has always been friendly and courteous. Coffee in the am is perfect, and the reception in the evening is a great opportunity to sit down and enjoy the fireplace and people mingling. Grab a little dinner in one of the MANY restaurants (there are multiple options within walking distance, or grab a cab and head to \"Street\" on Polk). If the Giants are in town, its a reasonable walk or a short Muni ride down to the ballpark. There are a couple things about this property which are unfortunate. The inside rooms which are not overlooking the bay, well, there is no reason to open the curtain, and your experience will be better if they remain closed. Second, the $50+ per night parking has just never set right with me. Overall the rooms are tastefully done, and we have always enjoyed a good nights sleep here.

The location is really great. It is on a relatively quiet block (Steuart St; there is a 2nd entrance on Embarcadero) very close to the Ferry Building and the Financial District. The staff is very helpful, and there are many restaurants on the block. The rooms are incredibly small, but very comfortable. Overall, I highly recommend the Harbor Court. The rooms may make you feel claustrophobic, it is true. We had a Bay View king room, so the bed was big, the light was good and the panorama of the Bay Bridge and beyond was fantastic. (I saw that interior rooms were dark, but they looked fine if you don't care about the view. Queen rooms were even smaller.) The furniture and bathrooms were quite comfortable. Very nice bathroom products. I didn't mind being in the small room because it was all so nice. The hotel employees were quite friendly and helpful with advice. The cleaning staff was warm and worked efficiently. The YMCA next door is a nice gym option; my hotel rate included gym use, but you may have to pay. The lobby is very cozy, with a warm fireplace and wi-fi service. I truly enjoyed coming back each day to the hotel, and just hanging out in the lobby. I was on a work trip, and I was able to do work there as did several others most of the day. There is water all day, a.m. coffee, a wine happy hour, and cookies at night. The neighborhood is really coming up and cool. You can quickly walk to Market St. There are nearby Starbucks, Walgreens, and restaurants catering to workers in the area. The restaurants on the block are a bit expensive but good. Perry's for breakfast (the only real option) is not too pricey, and the food was much better than expected (it looks like an old bar from the outside). Ozu is a solid and fun sushi spot (if evidently not really Japanese). I would certainly return to this hotel. The usual Kimpton pluses were on display. If you are on business or get a good deal (perhaps on weekends -- the place is quite expensive during the week), the Harbor Court is a great stay.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lansdale, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cHORRIBLE HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "Valerie S", "ReviewID": "UR125306132", "Content": "the nicest thing that I can say about this hotel is that it is located next to a great restraunt, Perrys.

I was glad to be cheered upon arrival as if coming back after a (very long indeed) flight. As some others have noted, this may not be as luxurious as other Kimpton properties, and the decor (especially in the hallways) do appear a bit dated. But it delivers on all Kimpton qualities: friendly and helpful service, fast check in/out, exceptionally clean rooms and facilities, and of course the free coffee in the morning and wine in the evening. Regardless if you use these extras, it is just great to have a warm and cozy lobby to mingle with fellow guests. The room itself was larger than I expected (it is narrow, but you have plenty of room at the foot of the bed), the bed extremely comfy, and you get free wi-fi on the loyalty program. And the Bay view rooms are really worth the extras, you could lie in bed and admire the lights at night. Priceless (trust me, I have paid way more for other views in SF!). One of the key reasons I chose to be here was location. It's easily accessible to public transportation, including the BART to SFO 3 blocks down (for the sake of clarity, the Griffon and Vitale are within a block too). It's literally 2 blocks from the Ferry Plaza, which has plenty of dining options for breakfast and lunch, and the best wine bar in town.

You can walk just a short distance from the hotel and be at many different wonderful restaurants (also the hotel restaurant is very good too). It is a very short walk to catch public transportation to all the major sites in San Francisco or you can easily walk. It is also a short walk to the Ferry terminal that has been turned into a lovely shopping center with many unique shops and restaurants. On the weekend this same terminal has an Amazing public market with all kinds of fresh fruits, veggies, baked goods and also arts and crafts.

My room more than lived up to expectations--the views of the Bay and Bay Bridge were awesome, both day and night, and the room itself was extremely clean, comfortable and peaceful. It was so well laid out that, despite its compact size, it felt cozy in the best sense, and not at all cramped. The weather turned hot part-way through my stay, and the room's well-functioning A/C was much appreciated. The free wi-fi was really fast and reliable. The lobby was an attractive and inviting place to hang out in; the citrus-infused water available all day, and the coffee/tea available in the morning, were nice touches. I loved the Embarcadero location, just a block from the Ferry Building and near many top-notch restaurants--an area perfect for foodies, and with none of the tackiness so prevalent in Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. It was great strolling over to the Ferry Building for breakfast every morning, and for the farmers markets 3 days of the week. The hotel is convenient to lots of useful bus lines, the F-streetcar, and the Embarcadero BART/Muni stations. Taking BART to and from the airport is really easy. The housekeeping staff did a phenomenal job keeping the hotel in tip-top shape and making me feel welcome. Marina, who is in charge of housekeeping, introduced herself to me as I was checking into my room, and encouraged me to contact her if I needed anything for my room. However, my room was always kept in such perfect condition that I never had any issues to report at all. And, every time I came across a member of the housekeeping dept. during my stay, I was met with a smile and a warm greeting. The bell staff was also great--really efficient in storing and retrieving luggage, and a few times when I was waiting by the front entrance for a friend to come pick me up, the bell staff always approached me promptly and courteously if I needed help with transportation or anything else. Sadly, the only thing that kept my experience at this hotel from being perfect was the front-desk staff. Most of them seemed young and somewhat unpolished, and I can't recall any that seemed particularly helpful, efficient or welcoming. Check-in was esp. frustrating, as I arrived when there was only one young man working behind the desk. He spent a lot of time helping the couple in front of me with a bunch of non-hotel-related issues, during which time my presence was never once acknowledged. Really, is it so much trouble to say \"I'll be with you in a moment\" or to call a colleague to come back you up at the front desk?! When my turn finally came, I received no greeting, no welcome; just a brusque \"Can I help you?\" Talk about an abysmal introduction to the hotel, and being made to feel like a third-class citizen! During check-in, he also failed to volunteer any information about the hotel's amenities, but only answered direct questions that I put to him. Fortunately, most of the front-desk staff seemed somewhat friendlier and more engaged in their jobs, and in any case, I didn't need to interact much with them for the rest of my stay, as I'm a frequent visitor to SF and didn't need help planning my activities or getting around town. Overall, I would give the front-desk staff a rating of 2.5 stars (the check-in guy gets zero stars!), while the housekeeping and bell staffs both merit 5 stars. These hiccups with sub-par front-desk service wouldn't prevent me from staying at this beautiful, well-located hotel again. I loved my cozy, clean bayview room with its magnificent views, and would book one again in a heartbeat, esp. if I can get another good discounted rate.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cFriendly + efficient + good location\u201d", "Author": "OnurWashingtonDC", "ReviewID": "UR118321873", "Content": "Great hotel.

As many have mentioned, the rooms are small, but cozy, clean and will fit your needs for a weekend away. Upon arriving, they provided us with a bottle of champagne and chocolates to celebrate our anniversary. We opted for a cheaper non-bay view room and were placed on the 8th floor. We had a nice city view looking up, but looking down our view was of the a/c and power units for the building. As a caution, you are able to hear the noisy outside a/c and power units from inside your room. However, your a/c inside the room will mask the sound, as it is loud too. Overall, it's not a deal breaker, just an annoyance. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a light sleeper, you may want to consider packing some ear plugs. The bed was quite comfy and the bathroom served our needs; although it was on the small side and could use updating. In booking the reservation, we were excited about the nightly wine reception. However, we ended up missing it all four nights -- bummer! Although, as we missed it by only 15 minutes one of the nights we asked the front desk if there was any wine left and he poured us each a glass. We didn't miss the fresh baked cookies each night though -- very yummy! They do serve coffee and tea in the morning, but no breakfast. Although, it would have been nice touch if they served a light continental breakfast. Be sure to register as an In-Touch Member (it's free); you'll get free Wi-Fi and $10 credit for the mini bar during your stay. As for the customer service, it was good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing spectacular. When we arrived at the hotel the valet, Jason greeted us and helped us with our belongings. Throughout our stay, the front desk was helpful in answering our questions. The only issue came the day of our departure. Wanting to enjoy breakfast and a few more hours in the city, we opted to checkout around 10:30am and store our belongings with the hotel. Checkout is at noon, so we didn't want to hold up the room if we ran late. Upon asking for a cart to bring our things down, we received a very grumpy bellhop named Neil. At first, I figured he was just grumpy as it was likely a very busy day. However, his attitude did not improve once we returned a few hours later to get our bags and car from valet. Apparently, he was serving as a valet assistant too. We waited inside the hotel for him to retrieve our car. About 20 minutes later, he returned and I helped him carry our belongings. However, he ended up bringing the wrong vehicle and then questioned whether it was indeed the wrong car! As everything was now outside, we waited on the sidewalk for him to retrieve the correct car. My boyfriend stepped away for a minute, when Neil finally returned with our car. He parked the car in the street, abruptly grabbed our suitcase, and told me to follow (my cue to grab the rest of the bags and help out). As we had a number of items, we asked him if we could pull into a valet parking space and get situated before leaving for our 8 hour drive. He promptly rolled his eyes and asked us how long we thought it might take. Overall, I thought we were very polite, friendly, and helpful, while he was rude, curt, and unfriendly! For $30/day, plus tax I was not impressed with the valet service, especially since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your only option with the hotel. Needless, to say our last impression of Harbor Court Hotel was not great. All in all, we did have a good stay. We enjoyed the location near the Ferry Building, Bay Bridge, and Muni Station.

Located in the Embarcadero, the price was reasonable compared to many similar hotels in the Union Square area. The location was actually perfect for us. Practically across the street from the Ferry Market Building, we went to the market often, and the Saturday farmer's market was a highlight. It was nice to be close to the water, and the Embarcadero was great for walking in both directions from the hotel. It was about a 20 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf, and a 20 minute walk to downtown. There were plentiful options for good restaurants near the hotel, albeit fewer than downtown. We walked everywhere, so walking a little farther for a restaurant was no big deal anyway. It was actually a bit of a relief to come back to a quiet hotel at the end of the day after spending the day fighting crowds and noise of the city. The hotel itself was clean, decorated nicely, and the staff was very nice and helpful. The room was small, but we didn't spend much time there, so it didn't matter.

Our room was not facing the street, so there was no view, but it was blessedly quiet. We could barely hear noise of other guests at the hotel, either.

When we checked into our room, it did not have a view so I called the front desk to see if they had another room desk and they very graciously upgraded us to a king room (no charge) with a beautiful view of the Bay. Rooms are very small, but that's not surprising as it is a very old building and was once the YMCA (there's no workout room because guests get access to the fully remodeled, gorgeous Embarcadero Y adjacent). They have a lovely \"living room\" lobby with sofas and comfy chairs, and a complimentary beer and wine service in the evening. Milk and cookies at 9:30 as well, but as they are a half-block from Boulevard - one of the city's best restaurants - we didn't take them up on those.

The food and coffee didn't arrive until 7:10, which really sucked because drinking coffee and eating that close to a long run is not good. We would have gone to the lobby and gotten coffee had we known it was going to be late - they apologized but by then we had to gulp and run-literally. -We don't usually even turn on the TV but we wanted to watch the last inning of the Giants game. The TV had awful picture quality, very fuzzy. It wasn't the channel, either. -No coffeemaker in room -Small rooms, windows are small too, remember it is an old building and back in the day they wanted to keep heat in and noise/pollution out.

LOCATION: The location is superb - near the water and the fabulous Ferry Building makes for cool breezes and affordable breakfasts and snacks. It was great to have the farmer's market across the street. It's away from the Ghiradelli Square area that gets noisy and sometimes unsavory. Also one of us had a knee injury so it was nice to be able to get out and walk places without immediately encountering hills. I've stayed at the Fairmont and boutique hotels downtown, and walking anywhere is definitely a chore from those places if you are temporarily or permanently disabled. Tons of buses come within two blocks, and BART and Muni are also right there, so we didn't rent a car and took public transport everywhere. ROOMS: Definitely spring for the bay view room - the view is spectacular. Since, as many of the reviews mention, the rooms are small, having that expansive view opens up the room in a really nice way. The bed was comfortable enough and the room was clean. The cleaning staff was actually great about accommodating our needs given that we were needing big bags of ice and strange room cleaning times. SERVICE AND AMENITIES: The service was good without being over the top. If you like fawning service, this may not be for you. But if you like friendliness and helpfulness from young, energetic people, this is a good fit. We enjoyed the little touches - flavored waters all day, coffee in the morning, the cookies in the evening, Aveda products in room, and they even brought up a bottle of wine for the birthday we were celebrating! I loved having the YMCA as the gym- so convenient and even though it's $10 a day it's totally worth it if you want to have real workouts (more than a treadmill and some 10 lb. weights) while you are away. I also liked having the little Japanese restaurant attached - it was convenient and decent food. VALUE: If you like a big room, you will find this to be pricey and disappointing. However, if your key components are location and service, then the price is right. Become a Klimpton program member and you don't have to pay the surcharge for wireless. I booked through the website and got as good of a deal as from any travel site. Given that we didn't need to rent a car and had easy access to cheap food, I would say the value was great.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "L.A.", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for business travelers and tourists\u201d", "Author": "chumleyjones", "ReviewID": "UR115857887", "Content": "I booked this hotel on Hotels.com based on the positive reviews from other travelers.

What's bizarre is that this floor boasts no restrooms, leaving guests to be sent from the lounge through a connecting door into the adjacent YMCA building, where not one sign will direct you. This is how to make guests feel unwelcome. Even with a quiet room request, beware booking online - you will probably be allocated a room overlooking an internal courtyard of A/C units, with giant cylinders mere inches from several room windows. These cylinders hum non-stop and sleep will be elusive. The noise is not unlike that aboard an airliner. That good rate you thought you had scored will not feel so great once you are sleep-deprived.

Luckily this hotel showed up with a promotional price and I was happy to transfer. I have stayed at a Kimpton hotel before and I love the chain. I was at the hotel within 15 minutes of my online booking and they had my reservation. Because it was last minute, the room they had for me was quite small, but they offered me a free bottle of wine, which was what I needed after my little hotel booking fiasco. Check-in and out was quick, smooth, painless. They also have a free \"happy hour\" in the lounge with free wine, free coffee in the mornings, and free lemon or orange-infused water 24/7. Free wi-fi access when you sign up for their loyalty program, and free bicycle rentals. I love that they have complimentary Aveda products. My friend (who lives in San Fran) ended up staying with me because it was such a nice hotel and they had a complimentary toothbrush, toothpaste, and razor for him. Very cozy and romantic for couples. They are also pet-friendly with dog treats in the lobby. They moved me to a bigger room after the first night and even offered to move my bags for me while I was out. Service was prompt, courteous, thoughtful, excellent. Rooms are clean and up to their boutique hotel standard of excellence, keeping in mind it is an older hotel. The only negative experience was that they were doing construction next door while I was there so you can hear the jackhammering in the daytime. It is across the street from the Ferry Building so you can wander over there for some great culinary exploring, but if you want to go shopping, you need to take a streetcar to Union Square, so it's not that close.

We were only paying like $150/night in SF, that's a steal. We were mostly only in the room to sleep or get ready. If you can't find other stuff to be doing in SF, then get a life or pony up the extra scratch and book a luxury hotel. The Harbour Court nails it's demographic, young, hip, adventurous, budget conscious travelers looking for some amenities but nothing overwhelming. My wife and I had a great time. The location is the embarcadero which is great if most of your activities are up north but with all the public trans in SF it turned out to be easy to navigate the entire city from there.

They were on the money reporting the super friendly and helpful staff; small but stylish rooms and great location. I will stay here again next time I am in SF as I feel I got value for money. Wifi is supposed to be an extra $10 a day but they provided this for free--they give you a print out with the monthly passcode so I suspect this is a general frieebie if you ask. Note that phone signal from my room (509) overlooking the airconditioning units and fire escape was very weak, so if you require calls to your mobile for business purposes you might want to upgrade to a harbor view room. The hotel has two computers in the lobby you can use to print out boarding passes (free) or surf the web (charge). The hotel doesn't have a healthclub but you can buy a pass for $10 a day to use at the YMCA next door (a door from the hotel lobby leads right into the YMCA). The YMCA isn't open 24 hours a day, but the benefit is you get to use a much better range of equipment than a hotel would normally have. I didn't do the cocktail reception, late night cookies or morning coffee, but did like the ice tea and orange and lemon water juice in the lobby, as well as the fire they had going there. Even in summer it gives a cozy touch. As others have mentioned, the Farmer's Market is a five minute walk and is a great place to get breakfast on Tuesday and Saturday and be part of the SF scene as you mingle with locals. Margaritaville is an SF institution and people line up for their freshly made Mexican food and eggs first thing in the morning because it gets too popular at lunch time. Opposite is an organic breakfast place that does great oatmeal and fresh fruit juices. There are loads of good restaurants around the hotel (the Embarcadero Towers boast several upscale Asian and Indian eateries) and it is a 20 minute walk to Union Square. The hotel has carved out a niche for itself by being pet friendly (they even offer guided dog walks!) and over the weekend, about 15% of guests have pets. Yet the hotel is immaculately clean and the rooms don't smell.

Need I say more? Our queen room on the 8th floor was surprisingly much more spacious than I was expecting from some of the reviews. Although we didn't splurge on a bay view, we had a terrific view of downtown. Both the room size and view were superior to the one we had at Monaco (another Kimpton property at Union Square) a few years back. The Harbor Court is my new favorite hotel in San Francisco. We loved coming back each day to the crackling fireplace in their wonderful lobby/living room - and the treats! Staff is professional and friendly, although a little reserved which may be why some reviewers seem to indicate they seem aloof or uncaring. But the fact that the coffee, wine, and cookies are served on time each day, rooms are spotless, and we got all of our questions answered at the front desk easily and promptly, shows that the staff is truly top notch. We met some wonderful staff members, including Brad at the front desk and Michael at wine hour, who clearly work hard to ensure the comfort of guests. Our stay was not without glitches, but the hotel handled these issues very well. Due to high winds and pouring rain, we returned our first night to find a power outage in the hotel. The staff more than made up for this issue by passing out glow sticks which was a lot of fun, and pouring more complimentary wine! In fact, the power outage turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. The atmosphere was very romantic sitting in the dark lobby in front of the fireplace, and as we made our way up the staircase to our room, we found that staff had lit the entire 8 floors with glow sticks which was very clever and pretty. In the AM we had lukewarm water to shower in, but PG&E did not get the power turned back on until 6:30 AM which was not the hotels fault. We also had a lamp that quit working during our stay, but a maintenance worker came immediately (at 10 PM none the less), assessed the problem and had it fixed for us - all in a span of about 20 minutes. If we have one complaint at all about the Harbor Court, it is that it is somewhat removed from the hustle and bustle of Union Square. BUT, we knew this before booking, and we chose the serene Embarcadero location instead as we wanted to be on the water. Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf and the other San Francisco attractions are all within walking distance, and/or less than 10 minutes away by either the F Line streetcars or BART. It is also right next to the Ferry Building which has a number of places to eat, Peet's Coffee and a farmers market on 3 days of the week. The quiet location also made for a wonderful nights rest. One tip on San Francisco in general. If you plan to do a cable car trip during the day, take the F Line to Fisherman's Wharf and catch it there. The lines at Powell/Market were close to 2 hours when we went at 11 AM. No wait at all at Taylor Street at Fisherman's Wharf. The California Street cable car (which starts a few blocks from the hotel) is currently not running due to work being done. To summarize, the Harbor Court is a wonderful hotel, with terrific \"extras,\" a great staff, and a peaceful location on the bay.

The small bathroom did not accommodate a vanity and had only a small shelf for toiletries.

We had a \"getaway weekend\" in San Francisco over the Memorial Day weekend and as we particularly like Kimpton Hotels we didn't think we could go too far wrong by booking a stay at the Harbor Court. We were not disappointed. We booked a standard room with a queen bed and discovered that we were upgraded to a queen view room overlooking the Embarcadero and the bay and the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge. As soon as we entered our room we were spellbound by the view. After spending an evening out attending a jazz concert we returned to our room and were met with the scene of the waters of the bay glistening by the twinkling lights of the Bay Bridge. We stood in our room and gazed at this portrait with the room lights turned off. This experience alone was priceless - as they say in the credit card ad. Our service from the staff was exceptional as we have come to expect from this hotel group. The room was adequately but not overly furnished with hardwood flooring rather than carpeting. Our bed was positioned so that we could look out of the windows to see the view. There was only one desk chair in the room and a couple of more comfortable chairs would have added to the enjoyment as an added comfortable place to scenery gaze or to watch T.V. rather than standing at the window or sitting on the bed. But that criticism is but trivial to the total experience we enjoyed at this property. Oh yes, there is free wine hour near the lobby in the late afternoon and don't forget the milk and cookies waiting in the lobby when returning from a late night's entertainment. The hotel is only about a block away from the downtown financial district and the Ferry Building.

The location on the Embarcadero is great: you can jog right out of the hotel and run on the Embarcadero on pavement, not in traffic, past the Ferry Building, the sightseeing cruise docks, Fisherman's Wharf, etc. depending on how far you want to go. Amazing scenery. The area has restaurants and cafes and of course, the Ferry Building is a foodie destination with 3 farmer's markets per week. We got takeout from the Japanese restaurant that is next door to the hotel (pricey but good) and ate one night at Perry's, also next door (lively scene, good food and not horribly expensive). A half mile north of the Ferry Building is Plant, an organic cafe right on the bay that we enjoyed very much at lunch one day. Not close to the hotel but good if you're in North Beach is Mario's Bohemian Cigar Store cafe, for the ambiance. Our favorite meal was probably at Nopalito (Broderick and Oak), southwestern but all fresh, homemade everything. We bought breakfast items at a little cafe across Steuart Street in the Rincon Center and brought them back to eat in the hotel which serves free morning coffee in the lobby. There's also wine in the evening and cookies/milk later on. The service is very good: most of the front desk staff knock themselves out to please. The room we stayed in had a king bed which took up pretty much the whole room, but we wanted a view and we got it, a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge. It was stunning at night. Many Muni lines begin just 2 blocks away at Market/Drumm, so if you are planning on using public transportation to sightsee, as we did, it is well located. The hotel shares a door with the Embarcadero YMCA, whose lap pool was one reason we decided to stay there, but unfortunately the Y was closed for most of our stay. It would have been good to have been made aware of that fact via the hotel website (since we later learned they always close at that time of the year). There are other gyms the hotel has privileges with, but the closest lap pool was quite a trek away and we didn't bother. There are so many things to see and do in San Francisco, but we enjoyed the California Academy of Sciences the most. Even though it was crowded due to the holiday, we got around to everything.

We stayed in room 504 with a view of a brick wall, but we only paid $118 total for the night, which was the reason for the lack of view. The hotel actually looks right over San Francisco Bay, but they wouldn't give us a bay view room for the price we paid. Anyway, the hotel is very nice. The lobby is huge with lots of nice sofas and chairs, TV's, a fireplace, two computers, waterbowls and toys for dogs, etc.. The location is great, right on the Embarcadero overlooking the bay, walking distance to the Financial District/Union Square, the Rincon Center is right across the street with lots of shops, and there are some nice restaurants and bars on the block also. Ozumo Japanese restaurant next door provides room service for the hotel, but it is pricey. They wanted $15 for a very simple, continental breakfast. As for amenities, they have several social hours for morning coffee, happy hour, milk-and-cookie hour, etc.. There is a YMCA right next door if you want to work out, although I don't know if it's free for hotel guests; I didn't try it. Internet access is $10 or $12 a day, unless you give them your e-mail address for their preferred customers list, in which case it's free. The parking was fairly outrageous at $45 a night, but I think they were trying to make up for the low room rate we paid, as I overheard the front desk tell other guests that their parking was included with the room. You could probably get cheaper parking down the street at one of the public garages, but we just parked at the hotel for convenience. The room itself was great. Other reviewers said their rooms were small, but our room, which was presumably one of the \"bad\" rooms due to the low price we paid, was plenty spacious for us; I'm not sure what other people are used to. I have stayed at other San Francisco hotels that had truly tiny rooms where you had to step over your luggage to get to the door, but this was not one of them. The decor was very nice with a comfortable, platform, king-size bed, desk with chair, minibar, closet, cozy chair, and large flatscreen TV with free cable channels. The bathroom was very clean, good hot water and pressure in the shower, nice Aveda toiletries, and plenty of room to put your own toiletries for easy access. Our floor was practically silent, and we got a great night's sleep. I was disappointed in the on-demand TV and movies that were available. The selection was good, but they wanted to charge $15 for an on-demand movie, maybe a little less for the TV shows, but come on! I stuck to the free cable channels. The only other bad things was the lack of a coffee maker, and when we tried to go to the lobby for coffee, there was none left.

It's in a great location along San Francisco's Embarcadero, overlooking the bay and the Bay Bridge, across the street from the Ferry Building (which houses some excellent shops with bread, wine, seafood, cheeses, etc.) and about a 15-20 minute leisurely walk from the Fisherman's Wharf at Pier 39 (don't miss the sea lions and the view of the Golden Gate Bridge from Pier 39). The hotel is immediately next-door to the YMCA, which offers $10 daily passes to hotel guests. Rooms are very tastefully decorated with very comfortable beds and wall-mounted flatscreen TVs. The hotel is very quiet and relaxing; a large living room area with plenty of couches, chairs and a fireplace near the lobby offers free coffee service in the morning, a wine social in the evening and fresh cookies and milk at 9 p.m. Everyone on the hotel staff I encountered was very friendly, welcoming and accommodating. Getting a taxi anywhere in San Francisco can be a challenge, but the Harbor Court Hotel provides a towncar (a flat rate of $45 when you need to go to the SF airport, which is the same price you'd pay for a taxi); the hotel is also only a 2 block walk from the MUNI/BART rail lines on Market Street (BART also goes directly to SFO Airport for around $8).

What I have discovered in the course of my travels is that the staff makes or breaks it for the customer. While, yes, the Harbor Court is in an amazing location for a business or central San Francisco tourist stay; while it is absolutely impeccable in d\u00c3\u00a9cor; while the room (admittedly small but well appointed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6great bed, bath, VIEW, quiet) was something to truly look forward to at the end of a strenuous day; while the whole facility is in pristine shape\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the staff truly being on top of their game in customer service and dedication to their work none of the rest would matter. Give me a cheerful hostel with the staff really into their work and engaging with the clientele over a 4 star which is just picking your pocket any day! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious from the moment you step to the door that it is not simply a company or a paycheck but you, the client, that the staff of the hotel is working for. Francisco, at the door, meets you with a gracious smile and gets you to the desk. The desk staff are all engaging, Kevin was especially helpful in arranging our room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there had been one small miscommunication precipitated by our arriving to check-in earlier than anticipated but he resolved it effortlessly. James, the shift manager, along with Kevin, was a font of local information and schlepped and checked our bags himself while the room was being prepared and we wandered out to begin our weekend. Judy, who cleaned and tidied our room, left us little notes and kept the room spotless (which is a challenge with me as a client--I am a master of chaos\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). One thing I really liked was the staff did not have their hand out. I practically had to chase the young man (whose name I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch) who helped us get our bags to the taxi at the end of our stay to give him a tip. There is a wealth of helpful or charming touches: two computer terminals in the lobby with direct links to all airline online check-in and boarding pass services; a local wine reception in the lobby from 5-6 PM each evening; GOOD coffee and tea in the lobby in the mornings\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Again all things that require the care and attention of the staff to keep going in a smooth, and inviting way. One thing you could not guess, it has been so transformed, is that the building was the YMCA residential facility! It has been so transformed as to be a totally new creation. Guests are welcome to use the athletic facilities of the Y which remain next door. Far superior to any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153workout room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and any hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever been in! The building is solid and quiet. The windows, over The Embarcadero are double glazed with storm windows to boot! Thus our 6th floor corner room was absolutely quiet. Saturday morning there is a huge farmers market at the ferry terminal a block down the street. There must have been a continuous stream of traffic starting at 3 or 4 in the morning; neither my wife nor I heard a thing. There is central cooling in some of the building (though I did notice a window unit in a room down the hall) that was quiet and needed as the day time temps were well into the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s while we were there (very odd; I got sunburned in San Francisco in July)! The rooms are of a size to admit only one (very comfortable) queen sized bed. And there is armoire rather than a closet. But there is a desk, high-speed internet, and a flat screen TV. The rooms are well laid out, charming, and make best use of the space. (The size was the only down tic in an otherwise perfect score.) Many come with a million dollar view of the Bay Bridge!

Harbor Court was kind enough to send us a bottle of wine and some yummy chocolate covered almonds for my husbands' bday! What a wonderful surprise! This hotel offers a wine hour from 5-6, and also yummy cookies at 9pm. Since we were going to be out at that time, they were kind enough to hold us a few cookies that we got on our way back in. Perfect late nite snack! We loved the Harbor Court and will be back! Thanks also to Jason Stone, for honoring a promotional rate for me even though I had made a change to my stay by accident.

What attracted us to this hotel was the price and location. The daily AAA rate was $151/night after taxes (~$110 before taxes). This special rate did not allow us to upgrade to include continental breakfast for an additional $1.00. A few days after our stay, Travelzoo published a special rate for the hotel: $89/night. The boutique hotel was elegant and more personal than the Hilton. The staff was very friendly. We were in room 416 despite requesting a room that was higher up. We didn't pay extra for a view , so we were stuck looking at what seemed to be a rooftop with some pipes and electrical units. The room was strikingly small -- more bed than walkable floor space. This did not bother us though since we were looking for an inexpensive, clean place to rest our heads. The tv was oddly off-center to the bed which made for an awkward viewing angle. The room was very nice and clean overall. The bathroom was spacious and stocked with Aveda products. We were amused that the bathroom seemed handicapped-friendly: raised toilet seat, handbars in bathtub, non-slip mat for bathtub. Our first gripe came at 6:30 AM when we were awakened by loud thumping sounds. Being city folk, we have a high tolerance for next-door-neighbor noise. However when the noise continued for 1.5 hrs, we realized that the noise was something else other than neighbors rustling around. We suspected the gym next door was the culprit.--noise was dropped weights, maybe? The front desk responded to my complaint immediately and placed us in room 816 which is on the top-most floor. Switching rooms at 8:00 AM due to disturbed sleep was the most annoying hotel experience we've ever had. Room 816 was almost identical to 416, though much quieter. We were able to sleep to well past noon undisturbed. The second gripe was a minor one. We were charged an extra $12. The mistake was easily cleared up with a phone call. The erroneous charge was apparently for the mini-bar. PROS: - Location -- waterfront, near Ferry Bdlg, ~4 blocks from BART, ~20 min walk to Alcatraz tour - Evening wine reception - Wii in lobby (though it was't there our second night) - Clean rooms - Friendly staff - Small and intimate CONS: - Early AM noise heard in room 416 (and possibly all of 4th Fl???) - Room pricing seemed arbitrary - Must sign up for an acct to access wifi The room size may be a dealbreaker for some. Ppl who need more space may want to consider a different hotel. We would stay here again if the prices remain competitively low.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay\u201d", "Author": "lassiepaige", "ReviewID": "UR31446036", "Content": "This was my second stay this year at the Harbor Court. First time was with my parents for a brief trip up to UC Davis, and this time was a leisure trip with my boyfriend, who was visiting San Francisco (and not stuck in a conference around the Moscone the whole time) for essentially the first time. I wanted to make it a great experience, and I love the bay view rooms at the hotel, so we were absolutely lucky to get a gorgeous, large windowed view on the top floor. I almost wish we hadn't been so busy running around the city so that we'd been able to enjoy just lounging around the room more. The decor is is tasteful, clean, and modern. Cleanliness has always been pretty spot on, and I was raised to be finicky about that kind of thing. The rooms can be tight, of course, and I usually go klutz into the bed frame corners more than once, but I've stayed in normal Hilton rooms in the past, and at the Stratford in Union Squre, and they were just as small (and not nearly as nice as I can recall). The location is superb, especially if you're bringing up a car, as there's a greater chance of finding meter street parking (some meters aren't enforced overnight either, if you get lucky!). And since it's a little farther away from some of the major areas, it seems quieter. The service was wonderful again. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and really do try to put extra care into things. Our room attendant left us a personalized note, and we would return to dim lighting and classical music (it's a little thing that makes a big difference, I appreciated it and haven't ever gotten something like that before).

So my whole experience at this boutique hotel was a first for me, and I often felt like a \"yahoo from the sticks\". Thank goodness the staff is so professional they didn't make me feel uncomfortable. I'm sure I didn't tip the right amounts, sorry. Your first impression of the hotel is quiet elegance. Then your stress level is greatly lowered when you see the famous brown lab Maverick sprawled out in his bed in the lobby. (he tolerates pats and picture taking). I asked for a quiet room so I was given one overlooking a central area instead of the street. The room was amazing, I don't know what others expected as to size, but I thought it was the same as any other hotel, although the bathroom is a little small. But that is all overcome by the sheer comfort and deluxe decor (although a wall of mirrors is a little retro). The bed was heaven, so plush you climb up into it. Nice reading chair, small desk, flat screen tv on the wall. They allow you to use the honor system mini bar as a refrigerator, which was helpful. I never heard another quest, no slamming doors, no loud a/c unit, just peace and quiet. Location was a little inconvenient if you wanted to go downtown to Union Square area or out to Golden Gate Park, took me my whole stay to figure out the buses. Hotel is at the Ferry Building, and the trolley up to Pier 39 runs close by. There really aren't any inexpensive eating places or mini marts nearby. What makes this hotel so unique is the staff. Dulce was on duty when I had an issue with an internet charge (I used the computer in the lobby and the directions were not clear as to how to get the 15 minutes free), she promptly reversed the charge and didn't make me feel like a cheat or liar. I asked about an airport shuttle, they arranged for the pick up (am I supposed to tip for that??) After I got home I completed an on line survey from the hotel and mentioned an error in my final bill of about $3.81, which I wasn't going to hassle with. The manager sent me an email saying he had investigated the charge and was crediting my charge card; now that is service. When I told Dulce she was as famous on Trip Advisor as Maverick, she thought that was the greatest thing ever.

You can also catch the F line right to Fisherman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wharf within a block (ask the hotel staff how). Also, all of the rails that go down Market Street end at the Embarcadero, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter which you take.

Now let me start by saying that I am not an inexperienced visitor to San Francisco. I think this is important only because the room rates tend to be expensive in this city and you tend to end up with a small amount of square footage for what you pay. My first problem with the hotelm began before I ever checked in. I had reserved a room for one night and my plans changed and I called to extend the stay. My rate was $135 so I called the hotel to check in one day earlier and was quoted a rate of $299. I immediately hoped onto expedia with whom I had originally made the review and they had a rate of $135 for the same room. I told this to the person on the phone and they indicated they would match it IF they could also find this rate. Ten minutes latter they honored the rate of $135. Moral of the story, although the Kimpton Website says they gaurentee the best rate....shop around. Upon arriving at the hotel no one was out front to offer to help with the bags, although this may seem like a nit, in San Francisco when traveling by yourself you need somone to get the bags and take the car so you can check in without getting a ticket. Upon checking in I was told that I would need to get new keys the nnext day as I had two seperate reservations...although not the end of the world, it was not convenient when staying more than one day since I have to expense all of travel back to my company I have twice the number of receipts that I needed. The room was nice (small, but again this is SF) but the view was amazing! If you stay her request the \"View room\" which has amazing views of the bay bridge and the Island! Service was luke warm the entire visit, depending on the website you look at they will give from 3.5 - 4 stars....my experience has been that service is better at some of the other Chain Hotel Properties. This hotel is good for business travel if your stay involves business SOMA or the financial district (near the embarcadero) any further than that and this property will be too far our of the way. Holiday visitors would be better to stay closer to Union Square or the warf as this is where you will most likely spend your time.

The bathrooms are tiny with no counter space. It was challenging for both of us to get ready. The lobby is the largest Kimpton Lobby I have ever seen. The wine-hour was actually enjoyable.

The view from my room was incredible!!! I looked out over the SF BAy and had a stunning view of the Bay Bridge which I really enjoyed in the evening. 2. Room decor: Nicely apponted. It had a king bed, a small desk, a small plasma TV, two endtables and a chair. The bathroom was small but nice and clean with tile floors, a pedastal sink, and a shower-tub with decent water pressure. 3. Internet in room was FREE. This is ALWAYS a major plus for me. 4. Lobby: Nicely decorated in a very ultra-modern fashion. Lots of cool places decor and places to sit and drink complimentary wine in the early evening or complimentary milk and cookies in the later-evening. Both of which were a very nice touch. NEUTRALS: 1. Bed: Seemed very hard and not as comfy as I am used to in the Westins, Ws and Sharetons that I normally stay in. 2. Service: The front desk person was friendly but no one ever really went out of their way. NEGATIVES: 1. Room Size: The room was VERY SMALL and the walk from the elevator to my room was long and confusing (the layout of the hallways leading to the rooms is very maze-like). 2.

The other main negative about this hotel is the lack of room service - breakfast is available from 7-9am M-F and 7-10 Saturday and Sunday. On weekdays, you can order lunch from Ozumo during their regular lunch hours (11:30-2), but there's nothing available on weekends and nothing between 2 and when the restaurant re-opens at 5:30.

Other unique items: free complimentary wine, cookies and milk at bedtime, options of turning down the cover/mints, Aveda bath products, umbrella for rainy day use, bath robes, LCD screen, Oxygen supply (w/ charge), Ipod dock station/radio/alarm, free complimentary limo service in the morning M-F to Financial district, complimentary newspapers, YMCA pass (where you can use free internet, this place is huge 4 stories, including an olympic size pool), sushi/sake room service (that was just awesome for a sushi lover like me), assistance with your bags and recommendations for sightseeing etc. The parking charges were extremely high, $38 not including tax, but we didn't mind it considering parking was just horrible in SF. You can't find parking anywhere, especially at peak hours. If you valet, Harbor Court will get your car anytime you like and you can call down 15 minutes ahead so you won't have to wait.

The location is great, in the Embarcadero area and just right across the street from a great farmer's market (on Saturday only). The hotel is not huge, in fact probably one of the smaller ones I've ever stayed at (not counting hotels in Europe), but it is beautifully decorated and the staff is very friendly and helpful. My room had one queen size bed (though it seemed a little smaller than a queen) and had a view of another building. The view really wasn't that important to me, I was just very impressed by how tastefully decorated the room was and how clean it was. Nothing looked worn down, everything looked new and straight out of Crate & Barrel. The bathroom was spacious and had Aveda bath products, which I love! Back to the bedroom - I'm not going to lie, it was tiny, but again made up for the fact by being so clean. There was a medium sized flat screen tv hanging over the desk and a large armoire that was used as a closet. My biggest complaint about the room was that I found the bed to be very uncomfortable. The mattress was a little too firm and the pillows a little too soft. I'm not joking, I prefer the mattress to be soft and the pillows a little more firm but that's just me. The hotel offered a hosted wine hour from 5-6 pm daily and they also offered fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and milk at nighttime. I checked out on Sunday morning and when I came down stairs they had a complimentary continental breakfast going on in the living room area. The hotel also offers complimentary wireless internet though I didn't make use of it.

First of all, the Harbor Court was a great value - paid $85 for a saturday night through Hotwire (3.5* - Boutique, Restaurant). And the location is unbeatable. The Embarcadero is nowhere near as crazy as Union Square and has great freeway access (although they have closed the Embarcadero off-ramp from the Bay Bridge). If you're there for a weekend, dont worry about the parking - there's plenty of safe, nearby street parking available. I parked our junky rental right behind Mercedes SLK on Howard St. - and both were still there in the morning. Instead, we spent the $40 to upgrade to a king room with a view! (note: I called beforehand to upgrade and they quoted $70. so try to hold off until check in if you can... they might be able to hook you up!). Everybody was extremely kind, the decor is classy yet comfortable, and most importantly - the place is clean. As noted, the rooms are a little small, but the bed is extremely comfortable, the bathroom is more than adquate (they give you q-tips!), and the view!!!! All I gotta say is \"wow.\" Clear view of the bridge and Tresure Island and all the happy people walking along the water - you are really that close!! We woke up Sunday morning and took a leisurely stroll/jog to AT&T Park (the Giants were on the road). The stadium is only about 0.75 mile away... and they actually open a portion of the park to the public for free, so we went up and took a little tour. I'm a Dodger fan, so I was talking some smack, but you cant deny that this ballpark is one of the most beautiful around. On the way back, we stopped by the Ferry Building and the farmers market. The farmers market wasn't so great as there were only like 10 vendors - I later found out that the main farmers market day is Saturday. But the Ferry Building is worth checking out and we picked up some yummy breakfast and ate it outside, watching the sailboats go by. Couldnt make it for the free beer and milk and cookies, but the coffee in the lobby is pretty good! The Embarcadero has everything you need and you get the TRUE SF experience. And if you REALLY need to goto Union Square, its less than a mile away.

I've stayed in San Francisco several times before, mostly for one-night stays, but this was the best yet. I picked this one based on reviews posted here and was not disappointed. The rooms are rather small, but not as small as I thought they would be. It was a King room, the most affordable in the hotel. The decoration is very fun and elegant, extremely clean. We didn't have a view but it didn't matter to us. It was very quiet, we neither heard traffic nor neighbors. We were also next to the elevator but never heard it either. Everyone on the staff was gracious and welcoming -- from the people at the front desk to the maids. Checking out was a breeze. We got the bill under our door and final check out took less than a minute. The location is great. You're right on the Embarcadero, with restaurants all around, the famous Ferry Building and close to the Baseball park. Things to keep in mind: - Breakfast at the hotel is outrageously expensive. But not to worry. You can find plenty of places to have breakfast or Brunch within walking distance. - Getting to the hotel is tricky. Their street address is \"Embarcadero\" but that is misleading. The actual entrance is in the back, that is on the street parallel to Embarcadero on a one-way street. Check with the front desk directly for directions, do not rely on the Web site.

I booked using Hotwire and as expected I got a very average room with a view looking out to the hotels AC unit. Not a problem for me as I prefer white noise anyway. All the advertised amenities were present, but some things were slightly odd. I knew the room was going to be small ahead of time. However there were 2 support beams (or pillars if you will) that made the wall jut out about 10 inches and was 12 inches wide. This made walking around the bed a toe-stubbing nuisance and the desk chair could not freely pull away from the desk. Tight manuevering to get seated. There was some paint chipping in the closet and doorway. On my second day there was a guy painting the hall outside my room. Luckily the fumes were faint. Also there was a bit of an electrical short in bathroom light switch. Had to flip switch a few times to get it to work properly. LCD TV was mounted above closet(!?), not centered in relation to the bed and/or desk chair. Lobby staff was just average. Any friendliness from them was not genuine. Beyond those minor concerns, the hotel was very nice. This location is fantastic if you want to avoid the Union Square and Fishermans Wharf touristy areas. Some friends that are native San Franciscans commended my choice. Easy access to MUNI bus, rail, and cable car (California St.) as well as BART (Embarcadero station). I was not around enough to partake in the coffee, wine, and cookies very much. The lobby computer with printer is a nice touch for making maps and directions so you can explore SF. My bed was very comfortable! Good sized bathroom. Shower was more than adequate. Housekeeping did a nice job. Expensive minibar but there is a Walgreens and 7-11 a block away for food and supplies. Ice machines on 3 floors. Nice modern AC unit in the room which is kind of rare for boutique hotels in SF. I liked the decor very much.

My wife and I stayed there for three nights during the first week of September 2005. We made reservations through Priceline and obtained a room with a queen sized bed for a bargain price of $110.00 per night. Before we checked in, the hotel gave us the opportunity to look at a room with the queensized bed and one with a king sized bed. For an extra $20 per night we opted for the larger bed (and room). It was well worth it. The bed and sheets were excellent. The television is an about a 24\" LCD. Though the picture was fine, it was a little too small for the room. The desk staff was very kind and helpful. However, I am giving the hotel only an above average review instead of and excellent review, because of an event at check in. My wife and I arrived several hours before the normal check in time. I was suffering from a splitting migraine headache. The fron desk staff tried to get housekeeping to make up the room to get us checked in. However, it took housekeeping about two and a half hours to complete their assignment. Other than that one expericence, our stay was fabulous. The bell man serves as valet, concierge, and car valet, which is too much for one person. However, both gentlemen were enitrely helpful with directions and suggestions. I forgot to mention that the hotel is centrally located. Fishermen's Wharf is just a short bus/trolley ride away. China town is a 20 minute walk away. You are just a couple of blocks from Market Street. In short, here are my suggestions: 1. Get a king sized bed. Splurge a little. The room is larger, and of course, the bed is bigger. 2. Don't forget to go downstairs at 5 pm for free beer and wine; or at 9 pm for milk and cookies. Our expericnece, over all, was above average.

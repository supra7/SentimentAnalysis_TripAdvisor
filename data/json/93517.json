Be careful not to book low grade rooms as they are very small indeed. There are no dressing tables in these rooms and poor storage for your clothes. A point of note the air conditioning is extremely noisey and if you have a room to the front of the hotel be aware of the loud traffic noise day and night. The cost of the buffet breakfast is outragious at around thirty eight dollars including gratuity and taxes.Although the food is of the highest standard it was not worth what was being charged. Plus points the staff are all very helpful and eager to please and the bed linen is changed on a daily basis. The beds are comfortable with feather pillows and the rooms are cleaned to a very high standard and the hotel should be congratulated on this aspect.

As soon as we stepped into our \"4 star\" room we were astounded at the ridiculous size. There was next to no room for us to put our two bags and we could hardly walk around. The bed was tiny and shoved against a wall which made it impossible for the person on the wall side to sleep. The bathroom is like a prison bathroom. The only shelving is above the toilet which is treacherous. The air conditioning is too loud to use and when the toilet flushes it sounds like a rocket. There is no fridge or coffee making facilities in the room, which is just ridiculous for a \"nice\" hotel. The free lobby wifi is very slow and always drops out. This is partly because the whole hotel seems to sit in the weirdly fragrant lobby to use the wifi. We tried to cancel our booking but it was non-refundable. We were so miserable in the tiny room that it was ruining the holiday, and we went and booked the Hilton Garden Inn anyway and just paid for two hotels.

For me, this was my sixth visit to New York (wife's 2nd) but it was the in-laws first time to this great city and, because my mother-in-law is not great on her feet, we chose a hotel for its location - and this is where the Paramount is excellent. With it only being 50 yards from Times Square it is in an ideal location for you to walk to most of the midtown attractions. However, the hotel itself was a bit of a let down. The staff were very helpful, even when there were issues with the rooms - and there were a few. In our room the a/c was not working - so much so that when we tried to get the overnight temperature down from 22 to 18, we woke in the middle of the night to find the setting at 29 degrees C!! The storage in our room (and we were in a so called deluxe room) was minimal and that is being polite. The issues in the other room ranged from too small beds (2 doubles promised) and a dreadful smell from the drains (resulting in a change of room and a free breakfast for the five of us - which we would not have considered otherwise because we felt it was very expensive for the buffet style it was). The issue of storage was more of an issue for them because they had less storage for 4 people than my wife and I had in a room for two. A plus for the hotel would be the free wifi offered in the lobby and the good access to the internet offered via 3 ipads and 2 computers. All in all - if you are choosing a hotel and location is the number one priority then this could be the hotel for you.

Even at such a busy time of year, the missteps were too much for the cost involved (several hundred per night per room). First, when reserving, the person on the phone stated that there was a rooftop bar from which to watch the ball drop. No such thing exists. The bar is on the lobby floor and looks onto the theatre across the street. I knew this though by looking at the hotel online, but found this unethical. Second, the rooms were not ready at check -in and the front desk staff did not call as promised when they were readied. This left us out in Times Square with no room key to be able to get back past the barricade when the police put that up around 5PM. Third, we booked for a stay beyond NYE. The front desk personnel put us on a floor that was closing after the NYE influx, and told us (after we were already in our room) that we would have to be relocated. If I had wanted to move rooms, I could have stayed somewhere else. (Note: they required pre-payment of the room because of the holiday, which made leaving more hassle than it was worth.) Finally, the hotel itself is pretty spartan. The room are unusually small, even for NYC. You could not open the bath door and walk inside without climbing on the bed to do so. The lobby was HEAVILY perfumed. I don't usually notice air fresheners much, but this was so powerful, my eyes were watering. The smell was heavy and persistent throughout the stay.

All in all I think this hotel needs work on many things. First day of arrival for my WEDDING WEEKEND, we found a pair of DIRTY UNDERWEAR, yes that's right, under the edge of a couch cushion. This grossed me out so much that we almost left. But since we had 12 members of our family patronizing the hotel, it would have been hard to find another place last minute. When I called to report the, a'hem, dirty panties, it took them over 45 min to come collect them. I was speaking to operator Carol whom told me to 'act irate when the manager calls\" so that they would know how unacceptable it was. Thanks Carol for being on my side, but the 7 calls you made after that were a bit much. She kept calling to see what the managers would do for me. Carol the operator offered me a free dinner and a fee bottle of wine, both of which I declined. That would not make up for a soiled pair of underwear on the beginning of our wedding weekend. Finally the dirty panties were removed and then I was given a call by the assistant manager, Shakaysha (not sure how to spell it). She apologized over and over, & even came up to make sure we were ok. Nice touch. That night, the heat was cranking from the registers even though the thermostat was on OFF. It was so hot, we could not sleep, not fun after a 5 hour plane right and 3 hour time change. They said an engineer would come fix it, but did not as it happened again the next 2 nights. Also, there was a light in the hall of the room that would not turn off - also not cool when you can't sleep because of it. Next morning we both tried to take showers, only to find the water ICE COLD - WTF? Another phone call to the front desk, another promise to fix - didn't happen The next evening when we returned home from dinner, we found chocolate covered strawberries and an apology note. Nice touch and appreciated. Again another night of super hot air, we ended up opening the windows to compensate. Next morning another shower try - this time it was tepid/cold, not a warm or hot shower that I preferred. After we came home from dinner the next night there was a bottle of Champagne waiting for us with another apology note. They also offered to move us to another room. If this had not been our wedding weekend, I would have gladly packed up everything and done it. But with all the dresses, luggage and tons of other pre wedding things already in place (plus on no sleep and no proper shower), I didn't want to do it honestly. Next morning, the shower was cold again and when I called down to complain, the phone was dead. ARE YOU FING KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW???????????????? So I called one of the managers, Andrea Yeager on her cell (I had it from an email she sent before our arrival) to let her know my dissapointment. She encouraged me to move and she had another suite for us right now. I met her on another floor and I was shown their biggest suite, The Entertainment suite. PERFECT for our party to get ready, 3 bathrooms huge tv's etc. I was thrilled and went back to pack. We were so happy! We both took showers & it was super hot - perfect! I was so excited about this. Then came the night before the wedding. We invited the girls over for a little food/slumber party. When we tried to use the iPod doc, it was broken. When we tried to order a movie on the huge flat screen, it didn't work. AGAIN - WHAT THE F???????????????????? We called and had TWO engineers try to come fix the iPod doc with no luck. He had to rig it up with tape and a book. The guy trying to fix the TV said he would have to come back (it was 11 at night & I was getting married the next day - no thanks). So we gave up and didn't have the night we wanted. Day of the wedding I was startled by a housekeeper letting herself in at 8am with a master key. I couldn't believe it- what the hell? I had the do not disturb on and at 8am? AHHH! The wedding day couldn't have been any better, thank God! For the next day, the housekeeping staff came in and changed out the towels but cleaned nothing AND LEFT OUR DOOR WIDE OPEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I wrote a final letter to Andrea Yeager, but received nothing back. I'm sure they were all sick of me complaining about things, but hey wouldn't you prefer to know from someone who is reasonable rather than a nut job? They did comp ONE NIGHT for us - that was fine. All in all, I would not stay here again. There were just too many things going wrong. And I do agree with the other reviews here and on yelp, the breakfasts were WAY over priced for what you got.

Our suite had views on three sides, including Time Square and 46th Street. Breakfast buffet (served in the Library bar) was surprisingly good. Excellent selection and high quality food. Suggest you book a room that includes breakfast as it is quite expensive if purchased separately ($34 per person) -- though even with breakfast vouchers, the hotel charges 18% gratuity to your room, or about $6.12 per person, so not really a free breakfast (in all my travels, this was a first).

Don't have breakfast in hotel too expensive. Come out of hotel turn right and right again at end of block straight ahead to end of next block(about 200 yards) Carve deli is a cracking cheap little american deli which serves delicious bagels, breakfast rolls,coffee , fresh orange juice and lots more.Another tip we got from a guide always look for the blue A in eating places windows this means the place has passed a very strict hygene inspection annually. Doesn't mean it is the best for food but it usually follows if place is clean you will get something decent to eat.(have to say don't i don't class NY as a gourmet city).Directly next door on the left of the hotel doorway is a brilliant pizza takeaway(doesn't look much ) but cracking pizzas. Back to the hotel top marks for location about 100 yards from Times Square. Another tip (especially if you are not going at peak times) don't buy theatre tickets till you get there. We bought Sister Act tickets pre travelling (\u00c2\u00a3180 for 2) but managed to get Priscilla and Rock of ages tickets at half price on the day of the show if you are willing to queue for a very short time at TKTS booth just around corner from hotel in Times Square).

But then came the hiccup on checking out...... When we checked in,we were told our upgrade to a queen size room was free of charge which we were delighted about, so we spent the money that we had saved for the upgrade on souveniers and gifts. Then upon checking out,we were told we had to pay for the upgrade and that the upgrade was not free. I questioned this and in the end, the charge was dropped. After asking why a member of staff would say its free for it then not be free, the answer i got was \"the upgrade was not free as she did not get you to sign for it\".

I was a bit wary especially after reading the not so complimentary reviews on here but it was absolutely fine! The best thing about this hotel is the location, you are literally a minutes walk from Times Square and within easy reach of most Broadway shows (especially Ghost, Evita and Porgy & Bess which were in the same road!). Its about a 15/20 minute walk to the Empire State Building and similar to the Rockefeller Centre, about 30 minutes to Madison Square Gardens & Central Park - everything really is within walking distance. The only time we got a cab was back from Bloomingdales as we were so tired and couldn't walk anymore! (Beware of some cabs tho, if you're not going in the direction they are they refuse to take you which we thought was a bit rude) As for the hotel itself we found it great on the whole. We had a Broadway Classic room on the 3rd floor which was one of the cheapest and yes it was small but not small enough to bother us. We could stand both suitcases up or lay them down on the floor without having to step over them. The bed was very comfy and we had plenty of room in there with both of us. We had no view from our room, we were just looking onto another building. It wasn't noisy outside (or inside for that matter) either apart from the night NY giants won the superbowl and we heard them all night though that was to be expected and again didnt bother us. Now onto the bathroom and heating which together caused the only problems/bugbears we had on our journey. Overall the bathroom was ok, it was adequate for the 2 of us, we had a bath which we liked and didnt expect, towels were replaced and it was thoroughly cleaned every day. However it was impossible to sit on the toilet without hitting yourself on the bathroom heater, we always had to sit at an angle which was a bit odd. As for the heating, it was already on when we got there and we thought it was at an ok level so left it. Big mistake - we were woken during the 1st night by a horrible clanking noise coming from the heater in the bathroom. As it was the middle of the night we left it, shut the bathroom door and then we couldn't hear it anymore. The next morning it was so hot and stuffy in the bathroom we couldn't go in there. I had to go and ask how to turn the bathroom heating off (there were no instructions for it only the main room). I mentioned it to the front desk and someone was up within 10 minutes to look and he managed to turn it off. This didn't seem to stop the clanking, although it wasn't as loud anymore (may have been coming from another room?) so we just left it as it didnt bother us anymore. The room heating was also quite strange, it was controlled by a box on the wall and was quite hard to regulate. Luckily it wasn't too hot or too cold so we didn't need to mess with it much. Onto the reception area, that was quite art deco with its huge chandelier in the centre and wall paintings. There was a gorgeous smell as well as you walk in the building! The wifi was available there - a bit sad we couldn't have it in our rooms though without paying! I had to check us in for our flight on the last day so used 1 of the 3 ipads they have there. That was all done fine, you can print anything off for free and they give it to you at the front desk. The cafe joined to the hotel is good too, their pastries and hot chocolate are gorgeous!! The staff we encountered were pleasant especially the concierge who helped us find our bearings on the first day with the free maps and advice.

The hotel Lobby contained electronic machines with tourist ideas you might like to explore and get a little pre-knowledge. Hotel is right in Times square, food and entertainment all in walking distance. Food and drink available in the hotel but we did not access this. A beautiful pizza/pasta shop next door....... amazing - the best we found!!!! We often took food back to the room, with no complaint from the hotel. Staff are very friendly, a $ tip is required if your cases are carried up to the room or put into a taxi. We both used the hotel car to the airport (fully recommend total for $65 + tip), and the airport travel express shuttle bus. I would defiantly pay the hotel car price. Shuttle bus ($15 each person, each way) is comfortable, warm and friendly, however the journey to and from the airport is a very long ride. A separate bus will collect you mid journey to take you to your hotel as the shuttle bus doesn't go the full way. Hence, hotel car is a winner with your own personal driver!! Usual American charm, doorman service. The hotel will store your luggage $2 per bag for the day (when leaving). A excellent service, we just extended suitcases to contain hand-luggage for the storage to keep the $2 charge minimal. I was more than happy with this hotel and would defiantly book again.

But importantly it is a comfortable and clean hotel. The lobby area has no natural light and is so dimly lit it feels like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re walking into a nightclub. The customer service was average at best. Our travel agent had made an error with our booking with the number of guests and length of stay at this hotel. No fault of the hotel, but despite us producing paperwork showing the correct booking, they seemed reluctant to sort it out and give us a room for two until the manager came in the following morning (we were trying to check in at about 11pm - not sure where they expected us to go). Eventually we had no option but to take the room for one person \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a room which could only be described as a shoe-box even for one person (A queen bed and a bathroom), and with a shower-head you have to duck under \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m only 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21229\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They said they would send up a fold-away bed but that never came even after a follow up call. After frantic international calls to our travel agent back home, who in-turn called the hotel to sort out the mess, they gave us a room more akin to what we had booked, but we still had to spend two nights in the shoe-box until that room became available. Upon checking in for that room we were told that room was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very nice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. We laughed when we saw it because the room was pretty much status-quo for a hotel room. Comfortable and clean, but nothing luxurious - old rooms which have been refurbished basically. The bathroom was dim, basic and without much bench space to put toiletries which was a bit annoying, and the shower took a long time to heat up. But we were still able to relax and get a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep which is probably the most important thing. In between our change of rooms we had to leave our luggage with reception. When we came back to collect them, they had moved the bags for some reason and they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t locate one of our bags. The guy seemed almost lazy to help us find it. Just as concern was setting in we found it around a corner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then we tipped him for I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what. During our stay there was an inflatable rat out the front warning of the Paramount\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed bed-bug infestation among other things, but we found no evidence of such a problem in either of the rooms we stayed in. Breakfast on the mezzanine floor was expensive for not a lot of food which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that great. There weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any tables available so we were forced to have our meal on the sofa and coffee table! But this is New York City and there is no shortage of places to have a good breakfast! So I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with breakfast in the hotel. Overall, it was still a good place to stay and well worth considering given its location, and probably one of the cheaper options in that area. The rooms are good apart from a few minor negatives.

We caught a cab from the airport which cost approx $60 including tip. We arrived at the hotel and got checked in quite swiftly, we got offered an upgrade to a slightly bigger room and we took it after asking what floor we would be on and where in the hotel it would be, (a previous review stated ninth floor and at the back with less noise- this is exactly where we were put, no views but lots of peace and quiet) - think about it - you are a 2 minute walk from Times Square a very busy all night location - bit like being in London. We found a great breakfast place called Cafeurope (need to google this - it was the better one, possibly the 49th or 50th street from Broadway)- great you can pick what you want, all fresh, and it isn't expensive, for 2 of us it cost around $20 total. The first few days we booked onto the grayline tours, fantastic, this helps you to find your bearings and see the sights with a great tour guide, 3 day pass and a choice of 3 visits (for example, Rockafellas(worth a visit but real early in the morning on a clear day)/Statue of Liberty/Guggenheim museum/etc you do have a choice) - $104 each - However, at the present moment Statue of Liberty is closed for approx 12 months, hence you can only walk around it but the ferry ride is lovely - go on a clear day and as early as possible to avoid the mass queues. We did find some lovely places to have a drink (alcoholic of course) and meal, which are as follows: Fanelli's Bar, corner of princes street / mercer st - great atmosphere, fantastic service and lovely food, reasonable too. On Tap Pub - it is in a shopping precint - Columbus Square, Time Warner Centre, but great to visit - lovely atmosphere and beer & food are good. Bierhaus - very much of a german bar but great beer and food was ok but not too great. Shopping places - Century 21 for a few bargains, and if you visit Macy's don't forget to visit the customer service desk to obtain your card for 10% of certain products from their store.

We booked through Hotwire, getting a great price on a 3 star hotel. Based on the description of the hotel's amenities after booking, we did expect a little more, but also found the hotel to have many positives. The hotel lobby is that of a swank boutique hotel, complete with aroma therapy and great music. They offer a concierge service, a lobby bar, and a restaurant with a bar on the 2nd floor that overlooks the lobby. The room, however, left a little to be desired. We had a room with one queen bed...and that room was SMALL (think college dorm room). There was nothing really special about it--no fridge, no microwave, no extras. It was just a room with a bed, a closet, and bathroom, and a flat screen TV. However, the maid service was excellent and the room was kept clean. The heater in our room went out overnight during our first night there. When we called maintenance in the morning, they arrived promptly in less than 20 minutes to service the failed heating unit. They also fixed the super drafty window. Once functioning properly, the heater was never able to regulate the temperature in the room. Either it was too hot, or too cold at all times. Also, it was constantly clinking and ticking loudly, even at night which made for a restless sleep. The Business Center DOES NOT EXIST and what they call the Business Center is completely in adequate--3 iPads with horribly slow connection speeds (if they connect at all) connected to a printer behind the reception desk where the staff is too busy with checking guests in/out to tend to a malfunctioning printer. Printing boarding passes turned into an hour fiasco--totally unacceptable. The hotel, did however have wonderful customer service--we were credited for our first night because of the lack of heat, given two complimentary breakfast buffet coupons, and given a coupon for free wifi in our room. The breakfast buffet was tasty and plentiful. We did have drinks in the lobby bar--just be cautious of the prices. Drinks there are in the ballpark of $11-14 and they automatically add an 18% gratuity regardless of the size of your party. The hotel is less than a block from Times Square and a little over a block from Restaurant Row which features many different kinds of cuisine.

There was no place to put our bags, there were no chairs and you could not open the bathroom door as there not enough room. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen. This was by far the smallest room I have ever seen or heard about. Our friends room was almost as small as ours (the bed was the same size but the room was about 20cm wider). They did change our rooms on the second night which was definitely better (still small but the bed was 140cm wide and you had room to walk around the bed and open your suitcases). This seemed to be routine - everybody we spoke to had an awful room on the first night and this was changed to a bigger room on the second night. When we went down to complain there was a queue of at least 5-6 people with exactly the same problem - It seemed they used these ridiculously small rooms for the first night of everybody's stay. This surely should not be allowed as it is literally putting people into a cupboard and people not having a choice to stay for at least one night.

New York is always a treat but what has made it even better the last three times we have stayed there was staying at the Paramount. It is an upscale hotel with all the fixins and never makes you feel like you're staying 'on the cheap'. The service is great, someone on the desk and at the door, everytime we needed them. A cosy bar downstairs, a great (if somewhat overpriced) coffee shop accessible from the lobby, not their own coffee shop, but appreciated none the less. The beds are comfy, the rooms very clean and modern, some people might find the rooms compact but they are just the size they need to be. We don't go to New York to hang around in our room. My 88 year old mother, my sister and her 10 year old daughter as well as my husband and I stayed this time and everyone had a great time. The location is out of this world. Not from a view point of view, although I love looking out on to the theatres across the street in case I catch sight of Alan Rickman arriving early or leaving late. If I had to find a negative it was with the price of the buffet breakfast, compared to the reasonable room rate we found it way over priced. This time we didn't bother with it at all but found a very good restaurant serving breakfast a few blocks west.

Room -I booked this hotel for 6 nights having read some good reviews of it on Expedia, then before I went read some some bad reviews and almost cancelled my booking, I'm glad I didnt because on arrival I asked for a room with bath as opposed to just a shower which I think then meant the room was also bigger. Having paid for a mid priced room this seemed fair, however I was disappointed to see the size of the room initailly. After a day or two I adjusted and it was fine, the bed itself was very comfortable though not king size, and the room itself was clean and well kept. The decor is meant to be modern contemporary but i found it a bit dated, rather 80s. There was no table or desk, but their was a chair, and no bedside tables either but a very small wall attached ledge for the phone. The wardrobe was also small not enough room for two in spite of it being a double room, there was a luggage stand thankfully. The bathroom had a great bath and shower combo, shelving and mirror, lots of hot water and towels and comp toiietries. The long and short of it is, I wouldnt use this hotel again but had no complaints as I had a great holiday. The Distrikt Hotel also in midtown or the Radisson on Lexington are far better in my opinion for room size, facilities and decor at roughly the same price range. Facilities - The hotel itself has good facilities inc bar restaurant and inhouse Dean and Deluca which was fab for grabbing a coffee, pastry or sandwich and stays open till after 7pm, opening at 7.30-8am. The door staff were lovely, very helpful and obliging as were the housekeeping staff when I ran out of conditioner. There are two PC's off the lobby to use which was also very handy,and two doors along there is a great little pizza shop, possibly too handy! Delicious pizza!. There is alos a 24hour Starbucks just a few hundred yards away on Times Square which was perfect too. Tips - do explore the different areas of Manhattan and go off the beaten track to dine and drink where the locals do to get a real feel for NY, love Greenwich village and Soho, fantastic shopping in mid Jan when the sales are still on and there is further discounts. Brooklyn is also gorgeous and well worth a trip, its nor far. Bring flat/comfy shoes and walk everywhere that way you happen upon hidden gems and see lots of the city, the subway is clean and fast and at the end of a long day a taxi is very cheap.

On the whole it was a good experience - the hotel is in an excellent location, there's loads to do nearby and it is also easy for getting around to explore the rest of the city. However, the rooms are incredibly small - we wwere in a double room, but the bed was tiny so we enquired about a larger room, only to be told that the beds were that size because it was a boutique hotel! I have stayed in many boutique hotels over the years, and all of them have had a full size double bed, no matter the size of the room! Anyway, the room upgrade was going to cost us an extra $60 per night so we decided to sleep on it and see how it went. It was actually not too bad so we saved our money for the delights on NYC instead. There was another problem with the room - the shower stopper did not work, so we reported this first thing in the morning and were told that they would send someone up right away. However, on returning to the room later that night, the problem had still not been fixed so we had to go back to the front desk again - they did send the handyman up straight away this time and he fixed the problem in five minutes, which was great! The final downside of our stay was when it came to checking out time - the bill was slid under our door, and they had charged us for upgrading the room for five nights - an extra $300! So we had to go to the front desk and wait for ten minutes while the reception staff were sorting out travel money for another hotel guest in order to get this issue rectified. The reception staff were very apologetic and removed the charge straight away. Check your bill carefully! Other points - the Library Bar is lovely but very expensive - $14 for a glass of wine!

Once we got up to the 12th floor to our room, the hallway was very dark, it made me feel quite dizzy. The corridor didn't feel clean and the carpet wasn't hoovered.

One tip for the room TV, when you turn it on it will automaticly go to the pay for films but press + twice on the channels and this will go to the normal TV channels. Times Square is literally 2 minutes down the road (Out the front door and turn left) with the amazing atmosphere and Central Park about 20 mins away on foot.

We stayed for 3 nights in January 2012, and got a good deal on a double room paying about \u00c2\u00a380 per night for a room with two queen beds in. The rooms themselves are basic and quite small with minimum facilities (no tea making), but was adequate for our needs as we mainly wanted to sight see. The room was clean and fit for purpose at the price i considered it value for money. Breakfast wasn't included but there are many Deli's around that serve a mean egg and bacon roll, yoghurts, fruit juice, etc and you can sit in if you want to eat. The public areas of the hotel were newly refurbished and quite funky and fun. A brilliant location only 3 minutes from Times Square and within easy reach of many main attractions. Cocktail bar fun, and a very good atmosphere overall. Staff generally helpful and friendly too. For the price i thought very acceptable. Do check out if you want a double bed because often it advertises twin rooms and sometimes you can get a free upgrade - although don't get too excited as the room is still small. This seems to be the case with most of the reasonably priced hotels in that area. Do check out The Empire State building when it's dark, and don't get fooled by touts trying to sell you overpriced tickest telling you there's massive queues!! Pay in the building it's about 22 dollars to go up to the viewing level and well worth every penny.

In my particular room, the door was unable to open fully without hitting the bed, which sat in the middle of a small square room with about 2 feet of walking space on each side. The front desk attendants were very friendly but seemingly under a lot of stress. Many guests were complaining about room accommodations. They handled all of the situations in a very polite and respectful manner that did seem to make the guests feel cared for. We left the hotel to go to dinner and a show and when we returned late at night, we came up to the room and changed into evening attire to go downstairs and enjoy the well-esteemed Paramount bar. We arrived at 12am. The bar is advertised to be open until 1am. At the door the bartenders and waitress told us that they were closed and we could not enter. We asked if they were typically open until 1am, and they replied that they had already melted the ice and were breaking everything down for the evening. Upon speaking with the evening manager we were told that unfortunately this wasn't the first time the bar staff had behaved this way and he apologized. The one positive moment of our stay was morning breakfast in the Library bar. The staff were attentive and friendly and the food was very enjoyable in a beautiful ambiance. After completely ruling out the idea that this hotel could provide any form of hospitality, it was honestly confusing moment, but very refreshing. As someone who studied Hotel, Restaurant Management and who has several years of experience in the industry, I believe the hotel has most of the physical infrastructure that should equate with success (prime location, beautiful lobby, modern bars/lounges, historical significance). It seems, however, that there is a clear lack of genuine care and concern on the part of management- which is kind of sad. If you are looking for comfort, care and true hospitality, this is NOT the place to stay.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bury st edmunds", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in an amazing location\u201d", "Author": "bird73BuryStEdmunds", "ReviewID": "UR122172057", "Content": "My friend and I have just returned from our stay at the Paramount Hotel.

All we had to do to reach other areas (SOHO & Lower Manhattan) was to take a short bus or cab right. Now the location as I said was wonderful & the hotel is very classy & nice, but the rooms were SMALL! Imagine the smallest room you can & then half that! Even after reading other reviews we were very shocked at just how small it was. That being said, we spent very little time in our room & it ended up being functional for us. I guess to pay for a bigger room & miss out on other experiences would not have been worth it to us! Most of the service staff was very helpful & courteous including the front desk & doormen (who made the hotel feel very secure). I was quite disappointed in the concierge however.

It is located about half a block from the top of Times Square and as such has to be the best located hotel for the Midtown sites. The Rockefeller centre is a few block walk North; Times Square is on the door step; Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s around 15 minutes walk and Central Park may be 30 minutes walk. The nearest subway is available at Times Square/42nd Street. As our visit to NYC was to celebrate my 40th birthday, I booked directly with the hotel through their website for a Queen Superior room seven to eight months previously. The photo on the website by the way is representative of the Queen Superior room. On a whim two days before departing I checked the price again on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website and was amazed to see that overall it was $255.00 cheaper than when I originally had made the booking, effectively equivalent to one nights stay! A quick phone call from home before the obligatory 24 hours cancellation notice period came into force and they kindly honoured this reduced rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either that or I would have cancelled and rebooked again. I will do the same now for any future hotel bookings to make sure that I am getting the best price for my stay. On entering the hotel through the two sets of heavy glass doors you open a large open reception area with check-in to your immediate right. Check in was quick and simple and very friendly after a long day of travelling from the UK. We were given two complimentary drinks vouchers which was a nice change. The reception area has many comfy chairs to offer with funky art on the walls and a superb chandelier above you. There are three iPads available to use at a station next to reception by guests for checking email or checking in online. Boarding passes can be printed as well and are available from the reception desk next to the iPads. Alternatively the hotel had wi-fi is available starting from $13.95 for a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use. In the evening the reception lights are very low and candles are placed on the stairs opposite the entrance. Very pretty when you enter from a long day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel/sight seeing but their coconut fragrance personally was way too overpowering and quite sickly. Please change to ordinary un-scented candles! We were allocated room 430 which was sufficiently spacious for us with a large wet room style bathroom (was slightly smelling of stale urine when we entered but after leaving the door open for the day, this smell disappeared), comfortable bed, HD TV, alarm clock with docking statiom, room safe, hair dryer, iron and ironing board. Bed was very comfortable with the room serviced every day and had no problems at all. Our room was located at the front of the hotel and so we did have a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city noise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during all hours (bin men at 0100hrs and drilling at 0600hrs) which is why we always pack ear plugs now on a travels. Not a critique of the hotel as obviously out of their control but just a FYI travellers! There was also a constant background fan noise which we thought was our a/c but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Could not put our finger on it as it have been more hotel wide than just our room. Not annoying, just as a background noise. Liked how there was a large mirror opposite the lifts that tells you what the weather was for the day, either cloudy, sunny, warm, cold etc. Nice quirky touch. Can thoroughly recommend The Paramount for comfort, service and ideally placed for exploring the Midtown area of Manhatten. Concierge service was very helpful to book show tickets, answer general questions about your stay and also in arranging airport transfers. Although not related to the hotel, they did kindle arrange the airport transfer for the pair of us to JFK @ $44.00, however I would highly recommend not using this service. Let me explain why. We were collected at 0415am for a 0830am flight. Took an hour and a quarter to collect from three other hotels before then sitting outside Grand Central Station for another 15 minutes before then actually leaving Manhatten for the airport - 1.5 hours later and we were still on the island!! For the duration of the trip both within Manhattan and on the Interstate out to La Guardia and JFK, the speed and manner of driving was bluntly dangerous. In town the driver of this 10 passenger van was aggressively driving from block to block - full on acceleration then slam on the brakes. On the interstate he was literally the fastest vehicle on the road driving recklessly and excessively fast, jumping from lane to lane, tailgating, honking cars in front to get out of the way and swearing at them when he eventually bullied them out of the way. This is the first time I have frankly been concerned for my life when travelling in a motor vehicle. Not an exaggeration. So people, for the sake of $20 more I would highly recommend your own town car for the transfer, not only giving you the 1.5 hrs extra in bed but it will be a much safer transfer door to door transfer. I can recommend using Dial 7 cars (dial7.com) before and had second to none service and will always be using them in my future trips to NYC. Lastly there is a fantastic pizza place next door, ideal for late night munchies and are delicious.

We arrived at approx 6pm on the 11th and first impressions were great, the decor in the hotel is beautiful. The guy that checked us in automatically upgraded us to a queen sized room as he said we are there for a while (6 nights) and one was available. Once we went to the room, it was on the small size but very modern decor and a nice sized tv on the wall and decent channels, we thought the bed was very comfy and i thought the pillows were lovely. We have a king sized bed at home and the bed was about the same. He did say we would be on the roadside so we would have a view but it was in fact looking at another window, he may have got mixed up but given we were in NYC to sight see and we didn't intend on spending too much time in the room i thought it was excellent. The only downside to the room was you had to sit on the toilet side ways practically as it was very close to the wall. The room was cleaned everyday and the linen changed. This hotel is in a fantastic location, turn left at the main door and walk to the end of the road and you are in the middle of Times Square. A little about our stay in NYC... We bought a Metro Card for $30 each which gives you unlimited use of the subway and buses, we used to the subway to get around which was so easy. i would recommend this as a way of getting about. The concierge in the Hotel helped us book our tour buses, this was the grayline and you pay $44 each for 48 hours hop on hop off and you can go on all the tours. We went on the downtown and also the brooklyn tour, this is a good way to find out information about NYC and see places, we also did the harlem and uptown tour. We gave the congerie a tip for helping us. We booked the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty before we went both of these i would recommend. We booked tickets to visit the world trade center site, which are free but you give a donation. This was very emotional and think it is a nice way to donate and pay your respects to the families and friends of those it affected. For anyone going to NYC for their first time tips are a big thing, everyone wants a tip. I was told by an american on the plane going you don't usually tip less than 15%. When eating out once you receive the bill at the end it will usually have gratuity at the bottom what it would be for 15%, 20% and 25%, we usually gave 15 or 20 and they were happy with that. Some actually circled the amount they thought they deserved! The shops are just brilliant, if you like shopping like me and my partner its paradise, there is honestly every shop you could ever imagine! i would recommend buying things like basketball vests and other sports stuff from sports shops like footlocker etc as we bought a vest from adidas and it was $90 we then went to footlocker and it was $60, The actual brand stores may be RRP. i bought UGG's from David Z which were $20 cheaper than the actual UGG Store itself. Every store we went in a shop assistant usually stays with you and they help you with whatever you want which is quite nice it feels more personal. All in all we loved NYC and the people are lovely. Americans are the politest people we have ever met. i would recommend the paramount hotel on its cleanliness, value for money and location.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cFab hotel in the heart of New York\u201d", "Author": "delfuaney", "ReviewID": "UR121870572", "Content": "I have just stayed at the Paramount between 11-16th Dec faultless.

We were lucky enough to receive a free room upgrade with a nice view but as I said we were out all day so by time you get back to the hotel, your not interested in looking out of the window.

The shower was a dribble of water and crammed into the tiny space was a ridiculous conical metal sink that took up far more room than was necessary or indeed desirable.

I picked this hotel strictly off it's 4 star rating and it was a good price. The lobby is beautiful and the front desk staff was very helpful. However I was extremely disappointed in the room. There was paint chipped everywhere throughout our room (I stayed in Room 922) and the water pressure of the shower was extremely weak. Two things I would certainly not expect from a hotel that claims to be 4 stars. It was my service and treatment afterwards however that horrifies me most about this place. I left an electronic cosmetic device that cost $120 in my room. I realized my error and called the hotel the next day to see if housekeeping could mail it to me. I spoke with someone in housekeeping and she informed me they threw away all cosmetic items, and since nothing had been found in my room, it would be safe to assume they threw it away. I then spoke to Natalie and Marcio in the executive office about this incident, asking if the hotel could reimburse or replace my item. They said I would need to fill out insurance paperwork and make a claim to get my item replaced and they would email me the forms right away. It now has been over a month, and I have called/left messages with either Natalie or Marcio at least six times and they a) have not emailed me the insurance paperwork b) have not returned any of my phone calls regarding this incident.

It was impossible to sit straight on the toilet for 2 reasons; 1) there was a radiator directly in front of the toilet and 2) the toilet was angled in towards the wall and radiator. Secondly the bedroom.........The room contained a double bed, tray table and chair. The room had a wardrobe but unfortunately a foot below the hanging rail was the safe, preventing you from being able to hang anything longer than a childs t-shirt in the wardrobe! Because of this we had to live out of our suitcases.

The room was clean and sheets changed every day. 3. The shower was hot and powerful even in the morning.

The location is amazing, closer to Times Square than I imagined, next door to the Scientologists. A protest going on outside there made one evening more interesting.

The staff are all very pleasant and helpful, the concierge(s) are all very knowledgeable.

Check out our pictures, to see the view from the first room we got. The first room was on the third floor. It was right to the ventilation system of the hotel, and the sound was literally like sleeping next to an airplane jet motor. At 4am in the morning, I had enough, so I went down to the lobby to get another room. No problem, the next day we got a fantastic room on the 15th floor. The room was clean, quite big and the bathroom was a good size for New York. The view from this one was much better. The staff was helpful and friendly. There are just a few details that are missing, in my opinion, from the hotel hitting the straight A from me. 1) I find it really cheap of the hotel to not provide free internet with the room. When you have paid so much money, internet should be included in all rooms, not just in the lobby. 2) I find it really cheap of the hotel to not provice free luggage storage between check out and the transfer to the airport. Two bucks a bag. Are you kidding me? This should be free! 3) No door man. We saw several times, how older hotel guests struggled to get in and out of the entrance doors. People with heavy luggage also had problems with getting in. Concidering how one or two hotel security staff/ordinary staff always stood in the lobby, they should have someone at the doors at all times. We helped out when we were present and other hotel guests did also. 4) The first room we had. We put so much money into this room, and it was really, really noisy!. It should not be classed as a superiour, it should be a budget room with half the price off. If the hotel wants to be the top notch, these simple things should not occur.

I realize not every room can have a view, but my one window looked out over some kind of maintenance space. It also looked directly across at other rooms, so I wasn't very comfortable having the shades open.

The next day the room stayed in the mid- to upper 70s even though I had the air set on 68. The air con was running. Constantly. But made no impact on the tiny space. The bed was uncomfortable as well. Besides being small, the pillows were so soft my head practically sank to the level of the mattress; they provided no support for my neck. Even though I used two (only two were provided). The staff was very friendly at check-in, however, and housekeeping was nice as well. And the location was good, just off Times Square.

I stayed at the Paramount for the first time in August 2011. Paid almost $600 for two nights here for a double bed \"superior\" room. The room was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The door practically hit the first bed when we entered the room, and the second bed was smack up against the far wall with about a foot in between the two beds. There was maybe 3 feet of space between the foot of the beds and the TV on the wall which did not work. The bathroom was tiny with no counter or storage space, and the room was right across from the noisy elevator. No dresser for clothes - just a half closet with two hangers and one draw under the safe. I requested a room change because, 1. TV was broken, 2. Tiny room for almost $300 a night and, 3. Didn't want to stay next to the elevator to hear drunks outside my door at all hours of the night. At first I was told there were no other 2 double bed rooms, and that my room was actually \"large\" for the hotel. Was then \"upgraded\" to a room with a king bed which meant my daughter and I would have to share the bed. Agreed to the change and at least the room was a little bigger and the bed wasn't smack up against the door. Closet was a full closet with 2 drawers instead of one, but still no dresser and the bathroom was as small as the first. Bed not very comfortable. On the positive side, the rooms were clean and the hotel was pretty quiet, and for the weekend it was okay. Staff was friendly and did their best to accomodate. Couldn't imagine staying for a whole week though. I would be okay with the small rooms if I paid under $200 a night. I know this is Times Square, but there is only so much I will pay for the location if the room quality doesn't match. This was the most I ever paid for a room in NYC and it was by far the smallest room I ever stayed in.

WHAT A GREAT HOTEL... It is literally a 30 second walk to the heart of Times Square, yet because it is on a \"side\" street (46th), and midway between Broadway and 8th, is reasonably quiet inside. We're on the 7th floor, facing 46th street and pretty quiet except for just the loudest noises. The room is not huge, but it's not tiny. It is WAY larger than some rooms I've stayed in Paris and London. We have a Double-Double. Two separate double beds, and there is more than enough room for us, our gear, plenty of space (4-5 feet) between the beds and more around the room. There is no excess space and all the space is really wisely used. Our two duffel bags sit easily out of our way, but on the floor against the outer walls of the room. that's what I mean by no excess space. There is no room in the closet or under a rack or anything like that to put the bags, but we don't really need it or care. There is even a corner chair and reading lamp in here. A good 5-6 feet between the bottom end of the bed and the wall. Really just enough space, but not sprawling. The beds are GREAT - very comfortable mattresses and excellent pillows. The windows provide decent soundproofing. Hear very little outside traffic noises. There are double window shades - blackout shades and filtered light shades, or both can be up. The window even opens if you really want to do that. The Bathroom is comfortable in size, with a shower/tub, and nicely appointed. Two shelves for our stuff. Once again, space is wisely used... There is about a 6 inch space behind the bathroom mirror that holds our towels - before we use them of course. There is plenty of hanging space for wet towels. The rolling \"desk/table\" in the room is excellent. It's about 4 feet long and 15\" deep, and can be rolled anywhere. I have it positioned now along the side of the desk and it is holding two laptops for me. Just the correct height for typing. I do not understand all the fuss people have made in the reviews about this lack of a \"formal\" desk. This is great, because I have it positioned EXACTLY where I want it, alongside the bed, looking out the window. When I'm not using it for this, I roll it against the wall and we use it to hold other stuff until I need to use it again as a desk. The closet has space for hanging things, two medium/large size drawers, a safe, and an iron and board. Once again, not a huge space, but pretty much just right for the two of us. The front desk staff were excellent. Check in wait was a bit long, but when it got to be my turn I saw why - very friendly, chatty, and focus on customer service. My package includes WIFI (which works very well in the room) and the \"American Breakfast\" which is also excellent, and served in a very comfortable and stylish 2nd floor restaurant. I had one problem with the A/C being kind of loud and not controlling correctly. The engineering staff came right up, cleaned out the filters, and everything worked fine after that. If you want a double-double (two separate beds), call the hotel yourself and ask for the \"larger double double\". I understand that there is another type of room for this bed configuration that's slightly smaller. Suggest that you don't just use expedia or some other service to make the reservation - do it yourself, the old fashioned way, to get what you want. Location as I've mentioned is excellent - 30 seconds from all the action !! I will definitely come back. I've posted some photos. Room, looking in from the door. The Bathroom.

It was a heatwave in NYC and very humid, but still managed to walk all the way to the Empire State Building (and up 6flights of stairs). The hotel is in a great location, just off Times Square, and Broadway. The lobby is very funky, dark and inviting. Staff are all very friendly. Food and drinks are VERY expensive in the hotel, but both times we ate there, we were impressed. There was a big whoops by the hotel staff on our 2nd day which involved them removing all our stuff from our room, including all our personal belongings from the safe (passports, money, keys etc) to cut the story short, we got all our stuff back, but it was human error by the hotel as they had accidentally linked us to another party who were checking out. We were refunded one night stay, and also given a free dinner on our last night. Rooms are small in this hotel, but it was fine for the 2 of us. The rooms are comfortable, quite modern, big TV and lots of channels to choose from.We were on the 10th floor and hardly heard any noise from outside. The guests next door were annoying but that wasnt the hotel's fault. We visited the statue of liberty, 5th avenue, central park, empire state building, ground zero and times square.. Lots of taxi's going round, but during rush hour 3 - 7pm, none wanted to go near Times Square. We recommend getting a subway pass, or a sightseeing bus pass. That way, you have options for getting around and getting back to the hotel. The subway station is 4blocks from the hotel - 10minute walk. We were going back up to Canada, and got the Newark airport express bus from Bryant Park for 15dollars each. Drop you right outside the terminal in 30minutes.

The room wasn't bad at all. Sure it was small, but with 2 double beds between 4 people (we obviously shared), it worked out just fine. I've heard of some places where just walking inside the hotel room was a nightmare. There was plenty of room for us to move about. The bathroom was fine too. The layout was fine. No complaints, except the shower handle broke when my husband went to turn it off (he was the last one to shower, hence, the only one to have this problem). He was able to shut the shower off, but freaked out a little when the handle came off. No one expects that! Oh and the elevators took FOREVER. Luckily we weren't in a hurry.

Beautiful, none the less). Really excellent location as well, I didn't realize quite how close we were to Broadway until I got there. The concierge and bellmen are very helpful and nice, and recommended many great restaurants to eat and things to do. But one of the major disappointments in the Paramount is the rooms. I know NYC hotel rooms are generally small, but this was almost unbearable. The living space really wouldn't be so claustrophobic feeling had there been storage for suitcases and clothes. While they had a closet, it was very tiny, only able to hold maybe two coats, and they placed the drawers in such a way that you couldn't open them! The view was also not very appealing. I requested a room with a view, and they told me I had received a good one, but when I looked out the window all I saw was the parking lot next door. The carpets also need to be cleaned, they seemed dirty and old to me. While the Paramount has some major flaws in their rooms, they average it out with their superb ground floor and excellent service.

But it's clear to me that all of the money spent by this hotel was on these areas only. The residential hallways need updating and some cleaning. The carpet is dirty and worn thin in most places, the walls are dingy and need touching up, and there's a pervasive stench throughout. The room itself is .. only OK. It's the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in anywhere in the world -- so small, in fact, that the only table in the room is on wheels and hovers over the bed. I couldn't identify the closet until I realized that there was a shallow metal handle on that colored wall panel. They've clearly replaced the floors in the bathroom, but the industrial-grade toilet and shower are unappealing. I had to call maintenance to fix both the see-through and the black-out shades on the window (neither would go up or down). When I left for work in the morning, I asked the staff to fix the light above the bed because it went out, but it hadn't been fixed when I got home from my work dinner (more than 12 hours later). I had to call a second time to get someone to fix it. Overall, it's not my favorite place in the city.

We bought hotel and flights for \u00c2\u00a3600 each person. From very poor choices in cities such as London and Dublin, we are always dubious with star ratings on city hotels as they can be very deceptive and we insisted on a 'four star' rated city hotel as 3 stars always end up being the grubby hole in a run-down building. I think that in usual terms 4 star would require more features and facilities but in real terms of a popular city this is exactly what we expected (a standard 3 star hotel bumped up to 4 stars purely because of its location). We loved the boutique feel of the place, check in was quick and simple and all staff we encountered was polite and helpful. Yes, when we first saw the room we found it rather amusing that 4 grown women would need to be well organised to cope in such close quarters for 6 days but alas we managed. We were very happy just because it was very clean with no signs of disrepair. And yes, we couldn't unpack everything but again this didn't bother us. With some stuff unpacked, the room and bathroom immediately looked like a bomb hit it and bless the cleaners each day who worked hard to put the room right each day. Yes, the bathroom is tiny, only suitable for one person at a time (not an issue for us) but the shower was nice and again very clean. No, there was not a mini bar or bathrobes and the TV channels were limited but the safe was great and the tolietries were well stocked. The air conditioning was the only problem we found as we did need to turn it off as the last person was going to bed because it was generally too loud to sleep with it on but the first person up switched it on again and we never felt too warm during the night. It is the location of the hotel that is the massive selling point. I do not believe that you can get any closer to Times Square on this level of cost. Our room was at the back so no street noise and there was very little noise from the corridors or neighbours. On the last day, we had already enquired about left baggage and were happy to pay the 2 dollars per bag from 8 am until we picked them up again at 4 pm, i think that's a bargain!

Upon our arrival, we were given an apparently single room with a single bed. We returned down to the reception desk to point out there has been a mistake but were told that this was a DOUBLE room! We urged the not very helpful reception girl to talk to the manager and had him go and check the room for himself to see 2 people just simply cannot fit in, even if they are skinny like we both are. After long arguing and waiting, we were given an upgrade (with a lot of \"you should be happy\" and \"you are lucky we found you an available room\", no apologies at all) with certainly a slightly bigger bed but the room was so small we could not open our luggage on the floor, so they had to stay closed in upward position, not to talk about jumping over them when we wanted to go to the bathroom. Nice welcome for 300 USD a night. The next morning we were told we would get another upgrade to a bigger room. We wanted to move to another hotel, ready to accept the cancellation fee, but could not find any nearby hotel that was available for the entire length of our stay. So we stayed in Paramount. Our 3rd room was OK, very small but compared to what we have seen before it was acceptable. The rooms have no minibar (beverages would be useful) and the \"closet\" is so small we were wondering why they wasted space on it. The air-conditioning regulation did not work and ventilation was very noisy and disturbing in the night. Also, we found a 2 USD fee for storing a luggage and 13 USD daily fee for internet use just outrageous, in a hotel of this price category. We both travel a lot both for business and leisure but have never seen this anywhere else in the world ! The hotel prides itself to be a \"boutique\" hotel but having a shoe-box sized rooms and dim lighting with a very strange smell and loud music in the lobby is, sorry to say, just NOT enough to qualify as a boutique hotel. To be fair, I have to say the hotel was extremely well located and all 3 rooms we have seen were clean although very simple. The beds (mattress and pillows) are comfortable.

It's classed as a four-star hotel but I have no idea why. The only thing going for it was the cleanliness of the rooms. Almost everything else was terrible. We booked the Paramount Hotel as the first stop on our honeymoon (second stop being in Mexico). We thought a four-star hotel would be enough for our needs considering it was our first trip to New York and wouldn't spend a lot of time at the hotel. Well, we couldn't spend time there even if we wanted to. The rooms were so small that there wasn't enough room for 2 adults to comfortably relax in them. So claustrophobic! When we checked in the hotel charged our credit card $75 security deposit. That was fine - standard practice. However, they then charged us for the cost of our room without telling us even though we had already paid (in full) for our room. It wasn't until we checked our credit card balance that we found out what they had done. We were $500 down on day one of our trip. I understand that people make mistakes but when we brought it to the attention of the reception staff they were less than sorry. We never received an apology and we were made to feel like we were an annoyance. We were told it would take 7-10 working days for the money to be refunded. The money has now been refunded (now we're back in the UK) but the $500 was intended for our 'spending money' whilst we were away. Thankfully we had other funds but it could have easily left us short of cash. So, when we got into our room we found the TV wasn't working and had to call the maintenance man. Then, the window was faulty and wouldn't shut. Not what you want when you're right on Times Square and can hear EVERYTHING! Maintenance man had to be called again. ROOM - tiny, tiny, tiny. There was just enough room for us to shimmy around the edge of the double bed but that was it. Facilities were pretty basic - like I said, I have no idea why it's a four-star hotel. The room was clean so that was a plus. The en suite was very small as well and because of that you could hear everything when your guest/partner was using the facilities. The room had air conditioning but it was so noisy that you wouldn't be able to sleep with it on. If you're planning on visiting the Paramount in the height of summer, beware. STAFF - with the exception of the bell boy/porters the staff were pretty unhelpful. They did the absolute bare minimum. When mistakes were made there was no apology or urgency to rectify things. Instead, you were made to feel like you should apologise to them. LOCATION - the hotel is literally a stone's throw from Times Square. Great if you want to be in the buzz of everything. But again, be warned, it's hectic and manic and if you're the type of person who needs to chill at the end of the day then this is not the right place for you.

I know what to expect from each grade of hotel. I wound up at the Paramount due to a client deal that covered my room and tax. Even if it were free again, I'd never stay here a next time. The room: NY hotel rooms are small but smart hotels offer storage and work solutions that maximize space. This had nothing. I was in 1841 which felt like the maid's room - and as I learned from the room guide, it probably was since the 18th floor was the original hotel's attic. The room was spartan: bed, one nightstand, a chair. No desk despite sufficient space for it (also no real dresser). A sad lopsided floor lamp. There was some rolling tray table that fit over the bed or in front of the lone chair. Great concept if every guest is over 5'8\". I'm 5'4\" and this was completely useless, too high. I had no place to do work. The closet was entirely taken up with a clumsy two-drawer cabinet that left only a 4\" space to hang clothes...space further reduced by 1/2 because the ironing board was also stored there. So if you want to hang anything longer than a shirt, you can't. The bathroom is terribly outdated, with cheap 1980s metal fixtures. The room was dirty. Not in need of dusting or vaccuuming but a deep serious cleaning. It had two nasty decorative pillows on the bed that I couldn't toss on the floor fast enough with as little touching as possible. The toilet this disgusting black ring around the bowl at the water line. The toilet should've been replaced. It looked like mold was starting in the shower. The shower curtain didn't even reach the floor so water ran out everywhere. The ceiling vent in the bathroom hasn't been cleaned in ages and was full of black dust. I hated touching any surface in the room. I had no washclothes (my colleague had them daily). I had a $10 travel hairdryer; my colleague got a full-sized one. I was so busy on business that I didn't bother to try and change rooms. And the room was simply rundown. The rolling tray table was chipped. The walls were gouged, needing spackling and repair. Several doorframes were corroded at their bases. On the very last morning, I saw that one wall had been cut open for someone to reach an electrical box and hadn't been repaired but instead left peeling and fraying. Even the room service hangtag was beaten up, dirty and frayed - it looked as if no one had been in this room in a decade. The room condition was a disgrace. It was also unsafe: the marble threshold (the piece of marble that serves as the transition on the floor as you step from the bedroom into the bathroom) was abnormally high on the room side and I tripped the first time I went into the bathroom. The height of the threshold is probably in violation of NYC laws. It took nearly 5 minutes to get hot water in the shower. So I'd turn it on, do many other things and then come back to find it suitable. And a small but important point: someone had filled the peephole with gum or something. It was unnerving. If I had decided to spend one more minute than I needed to in the room, I would've alerted the desk to have it fixed. But the dismal condition and user-unfriendliness of the room kept me out of it as often as possible. Which cost the hotel several hundred dollars since I'm normally a room service user. Instead, I ran out as quickly as I could. A final point was check-in. Because of my travel schedule, I arrived too early to get my room - which was fine - but the woman at the front desk said she'd check me in and all I needed to do was stop back for the key. She saw that the room and tax were being covered. She asked for, looked at and made note of my photo ID. Oddly, she didn't want a credit card imprint although I would be responsible for non-room/tax costs. All set, she said. I returned 8 hours later to get my key before rushing out to dinner. What I encountered at the desk: --first, the man (Sean) couldn't find my reservation --once he did, he insisted that \"there is nothing noted that the room and tax are paid for\" - I kept reiterating that I'd already checked in and it had shown up at that time; he kept claiming otherwise --finally he found the room arrangements note but said the woman earlier hadn't taken my photo ID documentation. Useless now to argue with him. Plus, as should've been done originally, my credit card imprint was taken --I decided to use a particular card that's both a platinum-level Visa card ($8000 a day limit) and a debit card. Sean refused to use it as a credut card - despite the fact that it's noted as such on the card itself and had he run it as credit it would've been approved - and would only take it as a debit,. Which as he explained, required that a certain amount be withheld to cover incidentals in advance. Which wasn't appropriate but again, it was uesless trying to get him to understand. While the amount was nominal (and as explained, I had no interest in generating any additional costs in the hotel), he seemed to have no understanding about such cards or in even running the card as credit to see he was wrong. I've charged multi-day stays at better-quality hotels on this particular card with no problem but apparently it was too difficult for the Paramount. Instead, this guy wasted my time as I headed to a business dinner, This place is a dump with service to match.

The decor at the Paramount is quite striking and includes a dramatic Philippe Stark staircase. The hotel lobby seems to buzz with people and music and the Paramount Bar, with its glamorous crystal chandeliers, is great to unwind and enjoy some cocktails, before or after catching one of the fabulous shows on offer just across the street. The second floor piano lounge Library bar is also worth a visit. It was impressive that all I had to do was walk across 2 streets to see the brilliant play, 'That Championship Season' at the Bernard Jacobs Theater featuring none other than Keifer Sutherland, Jason Patrick and Chris Noth. Seeing these brilliant actors in the flesh, working their magic was just surreal. One could literally walk across the road and see a different play every night if you wanted, staying at the Paramount- it is one of the most conveniently located hotels I've visited. A room service breakfast menu is available and Dean and DeLuca are conveniently situated on the ground floor of this hotel and I was I enjoyed their yummy snacks and coffees. The guy behind the counter was pretty funny and kept shooting off hilarious one- liners.

Upon entry to the hotel you instantly notice that it is very dark (a comment expressed by many other guests/people). The reception area looks as per the pictures, beautiful; it has the checkered black & very dirty white carpet with multiple seats which does looks great until you see the signs stating no luggage or drinks in the carpet area, why? what is the point of that? Seemed very unwelcoming! When we checked-in (after waiting ages for the clearly understaffed reception desk) we were, given a complimentary upgrade to a larger room as it was it was our first stay with the Paramount. This was well received. On the way to our room (unescorted, not even offered) the hallway had graffiti on the walls; very classy establishment!! Upon entering the room, all I can say is what are the dimensions of the standards double rooms like??? Again the room is exactly like the pictures, what an amazing photographer to make them look fresh and roomy. The room was very clean but is tiny, i don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what people say about NYC rooms being small etc, as i have never experienced anything quite as small, so thank god for the upgrade because we needed the extra double bed for the bags. Next was the bathroom - wow, climbing over the basin to push the towels on the rail out of the way, to get the toilet was a daily event. And then pull back the curtain and here is the shower. Again all very clean but - tiny. To sum it up it felt like we were staying in a small grey box, i just could not wait to get out the room. In addition, stupidly we accepted a room on the lower levels which resulted in a generally noise stay specifically from the fans. This is also the first hotel I have ever stayed in NYC where they have charged for Wi-Fi ($13 pd), which is really bad policy when the small cafe next door is free, as per the most of the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but we did get a complimentary passcode after pointing this out to reception. Also this is the first hotel which I have been charged to leave luggage ($2). Granted this is minimal but with staying in so many others it just felt they were trying to squeeze every penny out of you they can!! Good points the hotel is very clean, in a brilliant location and the staff were very friendly, helpful and always working with a friendly smile. The concierges are excellent in organize events for your party. With all the money they have spent in recently refurbishing this hotel you think they would spend a bit more money on light bulbs, unmarked wallpaper and bigger rooms. To summarise if you want location and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about the size of rooms then this is the hotel for you. But based on the money we spent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wished we went elsewhere as there are many hotels of similar standing and price which are far better and just as central to TS or further afield in desired.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cChilled out, comfortable hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "Bill-bob1985", "ReviewID": "UR108086377", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel late Friday afternoon to be greeted by friendly welcoming staff who were quick to deal with our check in.

The hotel lobby was very chilled with dimmed lighting, comfy sofa's and funky but soft 'wine bar' music. The room itself was very modern and just the right size. We had read reviews previous to travelling saying the rooms were very small but ours was perfect. The bed was soooo comfy and just what you needed after a long days sightseeing. The only downside of the room was that it smelt a little bit like sweaty feet when we walked in and we couldnt open the windows and that the air conditioning unit was quite loud, this wasnt a huge problem as we didnt need it on through the night. The consigerge were brilliant, very helpful and knowledgable. We enquired on a few occasions for directions, ect. The hotel was litterly just off Times Square, i thought it would be very noisy but it wasnt.

The hotel had a bar downstairs on the street level, which we also visited, this again was very relaxed, although quite expensive and the waitress was lovely. Definatley a good way to end your busy day. Also there is a coffee shop attatched called Dean and Deluca that did coffee and cakes. The only downside of the hotel is that there are no stairs only lifts which in a morning is terrible as everyone is on their way out and although there are 4 lifts, been on the 3rd floor, each lift was packed as they always went to the top. We found the trick was to press the button to go up, get in an empty lift and go up first! it was quicker than waiting for a lift you can squeeze into, one day it took us 15 mins to get a lift!

The lobby, while a little dim, was funky and I didn't have a problem with the light. Our room - a renovated broadway classic - was perfectly proportioned in size. In fact, it was larger than what I had expected after reading some reviews. It's location is definitely a selling point, and we were able to access everything we wanted to see easily. We probably only had two issues the whole time - upon checking in we were given key cards to our room, only to find once we entered that it was someone else's room still... The clerk had gotten our room number wrong by accidentally swapping two of the digits around, which was a bit off-putting to start. We also chose one morning to put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on our door before we went out, as we had hung quite a number of our clothes in the bathroom to air and didn't want anyone to enter, however when we returned later that day, housekeeping had entered nonetheless. My understanding was that if you put the Do Not Disturb sign up, you don't want the room to be disturbed - whether you are in there or not. We were back in NYC the following week, and had planned to book at this hotel again, but a week obviously makes a difference to the price - the same room would have cost us $120 extra per night.

Asked for a room move/upgrade but were told there was nothing for the 15th but to try again the next day. We were moved to another double, but this was even smaller in size, with the bed against the wall and a tiny bathroom so we moved back. We mentioned this was our honeymoon to reception the next day and were given a complimentary upgrade to a king size room which was a huge room with a much bigger than standard UK king bed - it's a super king size bed and one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in. If you want an upgrade, go early so you can get the rooms on people checking out. Our new room was massive, however, small rooms do exist and numerous people did complain over the lack of space Rooms were cleaned nicely everyday. Great cocktails on the 1st floor bar with friendly barstaff and a lovely reasonably priced coffee shop downstairs which is a chain. The hotel is literally 15 seconds from Times Square and is a great location. After the 1st night you don't notice the noise of the streets outside. Only thing that is not mentioned is checkout is 12pm and if you need to store luggage until your flight, it is $2 per bag and does not include small bags which you can attach to suitcases. We would stay again as it was a great location and a trendy, clean hotel, but will definately book either a twin double or a king.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poole, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwrong room + 2am wake up call!\u201d", "Author": "190727Ali", "ReviewID": "UR105046081", "Content": "We originally wanted to book the New Yorker but they could not accommodate us as we wanted a 2 x double bed room so our daughter could spend the 2nd night with us as she was visiting us from New Jersey.

Each visit was a single night, so we had quick trips through Manhattan! The hotel is superbly located if you want a Times Square location--it is just a single block away. (Normally I detest such touristy locations but my colleagues and clients love such a location!) The lobby sets a very chic, contemporary and minimalist mood from the moment you enter the property. My colleagues and clients all loved it. Rooms are definitely on the smaller size, but that is pretty standard for Manhattan in my opinion. All rooms had the same design sensibility, with a very minimalist style and chic pops of color--very utilitarian but also very stylized as well. Bathrooms were all a wee bit on the cramped side, but everything worked very well. Single queen bed rooms felt a little smaller but still had all the essentials. Double rooms with 2 double beds definitely felt bigger and roomier. The hotel upgraded me for all 3 visits with a suite, and the suites were very nice--a roomy living room and the same size king bed single room with small bathroom (plus an extra bathroom for the living room). For $209 per night as the group rate, I felt the Paramount gave us a very good deal, especially when compared to other Manhattan hotels in the vicinity. Service was fairly prompt and pleasant. Twice I needed someone to come up and turn off a radiator in my bathroom, and twice someone came within 10-15 minutes to take care of the problem. Room service was prompt and fairly decent, if a little expensive, something you expect in Manhattan, after all. The Dean & Deluca in the lobby entry area was very convenient, as well.

There were also more flies in the bathroom (not an infestation, but one is still too many). There were mildew marks on the door, and no fan in bathroom so there was a constant damp smell throughout the room.

A good start as we wanted as much time as we could to explore New York. We had booked a double room via a travel agent who we have used for many of our holidays. On entering our room we were confronted by a single bed. I asked a chambermaid on the floor what type of room this was, and she confirmed it was a single room.(She did not see my partner in the room.) I returned to the reception and spoke to the lady who checked us in. I stated that there had been a mistake and we had been given a single room, and the room was not a double room as stated on the booking form which i had with me. At this point she stated that the room was a double room. I pointed out the fact that if it was a double bed why was there only one set of pillows, and invited her to come and look at the bed. She merely stated that she had worked there 6 years and she knew her rooms. I informed her that i had spoken to a chambermaid who confirmed to me it was a single room. On being confronted with this she changed her tact by stating that i had got what had been ordered by my travel agent. Basically she put the blame on them. I stated that the room was not suitable, confirmed to her that it was a single room and a double room had been booked. She checked the system and stated that a twin room was available for an extra $30 per night. I reluctantly accepted this offer. I returned to my partner who was still in the single room. Outside was what turned out to be one of the senior bell boys. I asked him what type of room i had been given. He could see my partner. He would not say what type of room it was. On returning to the UK i spoke to my travel rep, who along with a New York agent confirmed a double room had been booked. Despite being contacted several times the Hotel have refused to reply. To me that says it all. I can only assume that this was an attempt to extract more money from their visitors by the Hotel. In fact they only got $30 extra off me for the two nights as i made my feelings known to the staff who said i could have the room for \u00c2\u00a315 per night extra.

So later that day when I go to check in, i am given the room number. 3rd floor??? thats not always a good sign for an upgrade. I walked into the room and it was TINY. In fact very bare with this bare wall next to the bed. It appeared that the room didnt even have a window. But I was mistaken, there was one off to the side that had NO view at all.

So I go downstairs as it was not very far away and the person said yes that was an upgrade. I would have hated to see what they were going to origionally put me in. I went back up to the room and had problems signing onto the internet. So I decide to call the front desk from my cell phone. Well that was a mistake.

It rings back to her and she was busy gabbing to her friend as I could hear it in the background and then she just hangs up the phone. It took almost 15 minutes until I got someone.

When we arrived in NY, it was about 30\u00c2\u00baF outside, and when we arrived in our room it was a crisp 62\u00c2\u00ba. We cranked up the heat, and eventually the room warmed up, but we too were awoken two of the three nights we stayed here by the heating unit. We had a suite, so it was quite spacious. And anyone complaining about the room size didn't take the time to look at the rooms on the hotel's website. You can tell how small they are by the photos. That's why we opted for a suite. 2. The hot water was a bit hit or miss. One morning I had to take a very lukewarm shower, more towards chilly. Then my wife took a shower 10 minutes later and her water was fine. Maybe they have boiler problems? 3. My biggest beef, eventually resolved by management, was that when I made my reservation, via the hotel website, my rate (around US$375/night) included breakfast for all three of us. Considering the breakfast costs US$28 (or thereabouts) I thought that would be a nice savings. Granted there is are numerous cafes and restaurants in the vicinity, including a Dean and Deluca in the hotel lobby, where you can eat for much less. Anyway, when I asked the receptionist at check-in about breakfast, she said it was not included on my reservation. After accessing the hotel website in front of her (love my iPad!) she finally went and talked to the manager and promptly gave me vouchers for daily buffet breakfasts for all of us. And the breakfast layout is actually quite nice, with lots of pastries, fresh eggs, waffles, etc. All in all, our room was quite nice, the concierge was helpful several times, the staff always seems to be smiling, it is a very intl. clientele this hotel caters to. And being half a block from Times Square is nice. In addition, 46th is \"Restaurant Row\", (try Becco one block away, the ossobucco is to die for) you could spend a month here and never eat in the same restaurant twice, all within about a 4 block radius.

One of the protesters was a burly fella and he was dressed in the skimpiest female clothing - if he was pre-op then the op wasnt needed as it was absolutely freezing! Arrived late on day 1 of our stay and the hotel was packed out due to valentines day coming up. Read reviews of the size of the rooms before we left home and our room was tiny. No where to put the 2 large suitcases we had, so off back to reception we went. Anca was on the desk and this girl saved our holiday for us. She was unable to find us an alternative room that night as it was fully booked but worked hard to find a solution, which she did. Next day we were moved to a bigger room with 2 doubles. Several times during our stay, Anca would approach us and check all was ok. Whilst waiting for our transfer to the airport, Anca came into work to start her shift. She came up to us and started chatting as she knew we were going home, I went to give her tip for her efforts and she refused, stating that it's her job and that's what she was there for...PARAMOUNT GIVE THIS GIRL A PAY RISE!

On a business trip to New York City, I stayed at the Paramount, where I stayed several times in the past. I always liked the lobby with its stylish designer chairs, and other design elements of the hotel. This last trip was a disaster: the rooms in this hotel lack power outlets. If you're coming with a laptop, forget about recharging it. In every room, there is typically just one power outlet beyond reach beneath the main bed and you will need to kill your back and crawl all over the floor to find it, and then you will need room service to get you an extender. I've had to go through this painful procedure in former visits to this hotel. This time it took room service 90 minutes until I was set up to work. The rooms themselves are microscopic and inconvenient, those with claustrophobia, be warned. You will only have a few inches of room around the bed. New York is infamous for its overpriced accommodation but the Paramount takes value for money to new lows. My key criticism is about the heating in the room: it was insufficient, and at nights, the bathroom was almost freezing, due to poor insulation. After 3 nights at this hotel, I returned back home with pneumonia and was hospitalized for a week. I believe the cold room had much to do with it. I am never again returning to this hotel.

I mean I come to new York a lot and never had a problem with any hotels ive stayed at. The room doesn't have a desk to eat or do any work. The closet you can really only put tee shirts in because theres a safe on the bottom half. Hanging out in the front of the hotel they kept asking to see my room key and if I went to the community bathroom they asked me to see my room key like I was not a guest and just using them to use the bathroom.

Also part of the way through the week we stayed a group of Students were booked into the rooms around ours, as you would expect the parties started straight away in their rooms and the corridor. Needless to say the noise was bad. Security responded and calmed the youngsters down once we and other complained. With regards to the room generally there was little cupboard space. Shower Room was small and cramped. We were disappointed that there were no coffee and tea making facilities. The maid service was good with the room maintained in a good clean condition. However the view was of a brick wall and razor wire. The hallways and lifts where dimly lit making for a very depressing aspect and caused some difficulty in identifying our room number. Not sure if this was meant to add to the ambiance or to hid the rather shabby decor. There is a large selection of Restaurants and diners around the Hotel. The Restaurant and Cafe in the Hotel are pricy, however we found the cafe pleasant for a quick cupper. However we would recommend the dining options in the Edison a few doors along the street. Hotel location is great with all the excitement of Times Square and the theatres very close by. However overall off our group staying at various Times Square Hotels, with similar prices, agreed that the Paramount was very disappointing and found it hard to agree with a four star rating.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and value for money.\u201d", "Author": "Trispen2002", "ReviewID": "UR94979363", "Content": "I stayed for 5 nights from Jan 22nd 2011 with my husband and 6 friends.

We had all booked queen superior rooms i wouldn't recommend booking below this standard as the room wasn't huge but it was big enough, me and my husband were lucky enough to enquire about an upgrade which we were willing to pay for but the guy who checked us in (wish I could remember his name as he was brilliant) gave us this for free. You could not complain about the size we had plenty of room for us, two large and one small case left open and lots of shopping room number 837. The bathroom was very small but perfectly formed and I found the space to put all are bits and bobs another complaint I had read my friends in the queen rooms had larger bathrooms. The wardrobe is small but for 5 nights I don't mind living out of a suitcase, the light switches etc are a little dated but if you want the Plaza stay at the Plaza if thing's like that bother you. I have paid alot more to stay in New York in the past for a similar size room all be it larger bathroom and not as good a location.

I found all of the staff very welcoming and friendly I didn't encounter one rude person from check in, door staff, cleaning staff etc. I would recommend this hotel and have given it a 5 rating based on everything we got in comparison to the cost and will have no hesitation staying again next time i go to New York.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heacham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cperfect location!!!restaurant not soo good!!\u201d", "Author": "gemrust30", "ReviewID": "UR94971947", "Content": "The location of hotel was perfect....there was a lovely little pizza shop next door that served english tea to take away for only a dollar..much cheeper than hotel and they didnt add nyc tax or service charge....

If you are a tourist and looking for an easy location, this place is perfect. Half a minute walk to Times Square, we even walked to Macy's, Empire State building as well as to and from Central Park. It just works well from a tourists point of view. The Hotel staff were really efficient and friendly, we arrived earlier than check in (we arrived at 9am) and they were more than happy to help with a smile on their face. The actual hotel amenities are good and the lobby and bar are are modernly decorated and have a nice feel to them. The Rooms are small, but, if you have stayed in NYC before, nothing is ever going to be huge. Although small the rooms are well appointed and the furnishings modern and of good quality. If you want some more space, its probably best to get a room with 2 double beds and not the room with the king! (we stayed in both). The rooms with 2 double beds affords you the opportunity to place your bags on the 2nd bed and then saves you foot space around the room. All in all, we loved our stay at The Paramount.

The hotel is in a great location - 2 min walk to Times Square, in the Broadway area, amazing pizza place next door. The hotel lobby is impressive - grand lights, flowers, seating areas, cool club style music playing. The staff are not very friendly (especially compared to all the other nice people we met in NYC) and come across as quite snobby and stand-off-ish. I had emailed the hotel a few weeks before to which I had no reply. They also didn't have our booking (despite presenting them with a British Airways Hotel voucher). In the end it turned out they had made a spelling mistake. I also had to provide them with a credit card even though we had paid for the room in full via BA and had provided them with passports. The room was small, which we had expected. However there were 2 of us and we only had a queen bed i.e. inbetween a single size & double!! V small!! There was just about enough room to put our two cases down! The bathroom was small, but supplied with towels and toiletries. Big down point though was that the shower was in an alcove, which meant the bathroom light didn't shine through - i.e you had to shower in the dark! :/ Even with the dial onthe highest setting the shower was lukewarm - not enjoyable. That said the room was designed very pleasantly and was trendy. Flat screen TV on the wall with lots of channels. You could hear the taxis, people etc when in your room, even at night, but that's to be expected when you pick a hotel very close to Times Square. We used the luggage room when we had checked out, which was only $2 per bag and the bellboy flagged us a yellow cab for our ride back to the airport. (BTW we hopped in a yellow cab on the way to the hotel with no effort or queue). We used the safe in the room (free use) which was good.

My family had booked two rooms for a seven night stay with your hotel from the 14th of December to the 21st of December. We had booked through your reservations call center. One of the rooms we reserved was to be a handicapped accessible room with a bath tub. We had the call center call the hotel direct to ensure a room meeting our requirements could be supplied and had the call center detail our request on the reservation. After calling the hotel the call center assured us a handicapped room with a bathtub was available. Two weeks before we were to arrive, we called the hotel direct and confirmed that our reservation was on track and that a handicapped room with a bath tub was available and we were assured that the room was reserved. We arrived at the Paramount to find that the hotel does not have a handicapped room with a bathtub. Without a bath tub to place my bath chair in I had no way to bathe. Assistant Front Office Manager Katie Hayari-Barea was called and she made every effort to find a room in the hotel that would meet our needs but unfortunately none of the available rooms had a bathroom doorway that was wide enough for a wheelchair and in any event there were no bath tubs to accommodate my bath chair. Obviously it was a very stressful situation for us, we had flown from central Canada to find we had nowhere to stay. After exhausting all options at the Parmount Katie Hayari-Barea found us rooms at the Double Tree where a handicapped room with a bathtub was available. Katie gave us a truly heartfelt apology and we believe she truly emphasized with our situation. While arrangements were being made Katie and Aundrea Kudrna offered us a drink in your lounge, which we gratefully accepted as we had had a very long and stressful day. The sign of a great hotel is how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with difficult situations, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response is what set\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great hotel apart from the competition. How Katie treated us makes you a great hotel, she did all the right things. She realized a mistake had been made and she made it right and she should be recognized for being the excellent manager she is. We were truly grateful for everything she did for us and we wish her well in her future endeavors with the Parmount hotel. Aundrea was also very kind and considerate as were the lounge server and the lady bell hop who watched over our luggage, all their efforts were greatly appreciated. Please share our comments and thank your staff once again for the great service. We will certainly recommend your hotel to our friends and business associates.

Pathetic Service right from the off! Well we then got to our room - room 1143 - WHAT A HOLE! Ive stayed in cleaner, more comfortable and BIGGER rooms in a \u00c2\u00a350 per night B&B in the UK. The worst of it is ..... we had booked a SUPERIOR QUEEN!!! I pity the fool who books a standard room here. Where to start with the horridness? How about Wet Carpets that were obviously still wet from cleaning? Wet Towels - still wet from laundry? No Security Bolt on the door? The wall where teh TV was ... well it was just grotty! Or maybe the tiniest bathroom you have ever seen in your life? Or how about the unvacuumed hair lying in ALL corners of the room? Lets just stop there - it was filthy. Being too tired to move rooms that night we bedded down and got some sort of sleep. Next morning we sampled breakfast which thankfully was quite tasty. A small positive then we headed to reception to discuss the awful room. The lovely lady on the desk advised we would be moved to another room as soon as it was available (3pm) We then went for a wander around NYC which as always was a pleasure. Arriving back at the hotel we were give our new room key.... 1130 and went to see what nightmare we would be sleeping in this time. To say it was an improvement is like saying rain is an improvement on snow?! At least this time there was no wet carpet or towels but sadly there was still hair in the corners of the room. Also a big dirty black mark on the bed covers was spotted right away. The bathroom - was a lot bigger than the other one but this was only because the room was obviously a disabled access room. so nothing particularly good about the room! It was at this point I decided to check my Credit Card (on the fairly decent - but very expensive WiFi) and noticed the amount the hotel had taken from it (including that silly deposit - yeh like I am going to spend $1600 on a hotel room then run away without paying a $10 room service charge?!) I immediately asked at teh front desk why they had done this without telling me and apparently this was a common problem for staff?! IDIOTS! Fortunately our time there finished without much further ado and I arrived home safe in good old scotland! A few days later I noticed the Security Deposit being credited back to my card.... let me ask you some simple maths..... what is 4 x $75 ? You would probably be right saying it was $300. 4 Night Security Deposit. How then can they explain $225 being returned to my card? Apparently $75 is the tax on 4 breakfasts? Doubtful. When I emailed the Paramount I got told it was correct but they would get their accounting dpeartment to contact me to explain how 4 breakfasts adds up to $75 tax. They havent done that yet despite 2 reminders and that was 2 weeks ago! I seriously recommend people not to visit this rather poor excuse for a hotel as it will ruin your trip!

Actually, this is the only piece of decoration hanging from the wall since there is no picture frames, no by-the-number paints, no nothing but a greyish wall.

We stayed over thanks giving weekend so were aware finding a decent value hotel in a good location might be tricky but then we happened about the Paramount Hotel. It is just round the corner from Times Square - no more than a 30 second walk out of the hotel and you can see the bright lights from the windows so we couldn't have asked for better. From Times Square you can get to everything you would want to within walking distance and nothing really takes more than half an hour apart from The Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero etc which we caught a subway to but walked back from. The hotel itself from the pictures looked just as lovely in real life. I was a little apprehensive before I went about room size as this seemed to be something a lot of people commented on but it was perfect! The bed was absolutely huge (we had a standard kingsize room) and the space around the bed vast and more than enough room for all our many purchases! The bathroom was small but adequate and perfectly equipped with a showe/bath, wash basin, toilet and lots of towels (something a lot of hotels cannot seem to get right). A flat screen tv with many channels adorned the wall and the decor was simple, clean yet modern and warm. We used concierge once to ask about posting mail to the UK and they were most helpful. They seemed to know a lot about shows and the local area! The lobby was striking and one of the more unusual ones I have seen. It was quirky and eclectic in its decor so probably not to everyones taste but I liked it and enjoyed eating breakfast one morning on the mezzanine floor over looking the lobby. Breakfast was nice (we opted for the buffet) albeit a little expensive for what we actually ate. Unfortunately we never made it to the bar but it looked great. The only bad experience we had was with the elevators - one broke on the second day and was never replaced and out of the remaining three, another broke leaving two on the last day which, when we were trying to get our luggage down, made it very difficult as every elevator that arrived was full of people! Oh and the fact we had to pay to leave our luggage once we had checked out I think was a little cheeky as we would have left the money as a tip anyway!

The bathroom was small and has an unusual style. The sink was a metal one in a cone shape and the toilet reminded me more of a public washroom than a hotel room.

It is also historic, which means small rooms and smaller bathrooms. But I had four problems that would prevent me from staying there again. (1) I specifically asked for and was told I was getting a room with a view. My fifth floor room had a view of a skyscraper if you looked up....way up. But most of the view was of a wall with barbed wire that made me feel more like I was in a prison cell than a hotel. (2) The worst problem was the heating/AC unit. I cannot sleep when the fan keeps going on and off all night long, and always choose the fan \"on\" setting to prevent that. However, no matter which setting I used, the fan kept shutting off and on quite noisily every hour. I got very little sleep as a result. Glad I was only there one night! (3) Shower had very little water pressure and unadjustable shower head. Also, no washcloths. (I understand I may have been able to request a washcloth, but that is hard to do when you are stepping into the shower and on a tight schedule.) (4) I went to Bar 46 for a glass of wine. Nice little bar, great service and good wine. But when I asked if I could take the glass back to my room, I was told that was \"illegal\" and had to take it back in a paper cup instead. That has never happened to me before in any hotel. Does room service bring you wine in a paper cup? I doubt it. That was a real bummer and put quite a damper on what had been a pleasant bar experience up to that point. If none of these things bother you, then this may be the hotel for you.

It was in a fabulous location! You just turn left out of the hotel walk to the end of the street and you are literally in Times Square. It was so nice to be centrally located and made it easy for stops back at our room between outings. The hotel and room were both decorated really nice. I was expecting the room to be much smaller than it was based on some comments on this site but was pleasantly surprised. We had a corner room with a king bed and had no problem with hotel noise at all although the city noise (sirens, horns, etc...)did wake me up several times each night. Both my husband and I thought the bed/pillows, etc...were one of the most comfortable beds we had ever slept on. I was also really worried about the bed bug problem in NYC and saw no sign of them in the room (I did check the mattress very closely several times a day) so that definitely a good thing although we did still take precautions and kept our bag/clothes off the floor and bed. We did not use the hotel restaurant, bar or concierge so I can't comment on that. There were a couple of things I think that are worth mentioning. We originally made the reservation for one night. About 5 days before our trip my husband and I decided to see if we were able to stay another night and if they had a room available. I called to double check our reservation and ask and the first thing they say is that they have us down for 2 nights (this was before I asked about staying another night). I told her that I have the email confirmation in front of me and it only says one night and she tells me she has us down for 2 nights in the computer. Well...since I was calling to add a night anyway it was no big deal and it worked out but I was thinking -what if I never called and got there to check in and they had us down for 2 nights when we only wanted one - that would have defintiely been an issue. The other thing was that on our reservation we had a king bed and confirmed it when we called but when we checked in we were told it was a queen and there were no more kings available. I then showed her the printout I had brought of the reservation and she was able to \"somehow\" get a king for us. The other thing and I obviously can't be 100% sure is that I think the valet people might have knicked our car somehow. I didn't notice until halfway home and the reason I'm pretty confident it was them is that it is a brand new car and we've only had it a month so I've been really careful about it so far. Overall, we did like the hotel and would definitely stay here again despite the issues.

The room is nothing extra. The ceiling in my room had extensive water damage that left the texture missing and large water marks over it. The A/C is not central, so you either choose the loud noise of the box window unit with it blowing out cold air next to the bed, or turn it off and the room quickly becomes stuffy.

The hotel location is fantastic, practically in Times Square. The lobby is nice and elegant, and the personnel is welcoming. The room cleaning is OK (the towels and bed sheets were changed daily), and I could not find any evident sign of dirt or dust around. The bed (a double one) was comfortable, although somewhat short. I did not have breakfast at the hotel, so I cannot provide my judgment on this issue. There are some major negative issues one should be aware of before making a reservation in this hotel. The rooms are awfully small. Since I was aware of this issue from earlier TripAdvisor reviews, I booked a 2-double-bed room (we were a party of two people sharing the room), hoping that this would provide us with some more comfort. We were assigned room 1621, right in front of the elevator. Well, once we and our luggage were inside the room, hardly any other space was available for moving (actually, there was room for opening only one piece of luggage at a time!). The bathroom was incredibly small: the basin was a 30-centimeter diameter steel one, compressed between the wc and the bath tub/shower; there was almost no room to place the personal bath stuff and the towels in use; an old-styled sticky nylon curtain protected the bathroom from being flooded when taking a shower; an hairdryer was not available (although according to internet information it should have been). The cupboard was ridiculously small as well. Not only was it unsuitable to accommodate the clothes of more than just one single person, but it was also so small that suites/dresses could not be fitted in their entire lengths within. An iron with ironing board were indeed available, but they were useless due to lack of space to accommodate the board once it was opened. An armchair was present, which had to be used to accommodate some of our clothes. A desk with chair was not available. Given that this 2-double-bed room is meant to host AT LEAST two people (if not 3 or 4), the room size was totally unfit, even for 2 people only. This was quite annoying, given the fact that the room rate was much larger than that of a standard double room. The room was also very noisy. This was not due to cars, but to outside air conditioning systems. The noise was continuous at every single hour of the day. Given that the hotel was renovated in 2009, it is incredible that it was not equipped with soundproof windows.

The gym on the 2nd floor is very nice and has a street view, which is nice and better than having to stare at a wall. As far as the few negative reviews of this hotel, the only thing I will agree with is the AC was a little loud when it was on. Other than that, I'm not sure what other people are looking for in a Times Square hotel! We booked this room for $159/night about a week before we arrived and realized you absolutely cannot beat that price. I actually expected a MUCH smaller room and was plesantly suprised. The Queen room was more than enough room for my husband and I. I also expected a bit of street noise, but that was hardly a complaint. You are VERY close to Times Sq, but on a quiet side-street, which was nice. I felt safe walking in and around the area as well. Bottom line is: the concierge, front desk, lobby & baggage staff are very helpful and accomodating. The hotel is beautiful and provides just what you need for a stay in NYC. You're only other options are to pay 2 or 3 TIMES as much at a \"chain\" hotel (Marriott, Hilton, etc) or stay in a hostel with shared bathrooms....

JFK to 50th Street on the E Train, then a four block walk to the hotel. The location is half a block from Times Square in Broadway's theatre district and handy for a multitude of subway lines to make travelling to the rest of Manhattan and further afield a breeze. Unfortunately, in our experience the hotel was let down by the room. We were two people staying in a room with a Queen-size bed. Unfortunately there was only a bedside table on one side of the bed, and nothing on the other side for someone to put a glass of water, a watch, a pair of glasses, or anything else. We had to move the room's one chair and squeeze it in to act as a makeshift bedside table. It's a good job that we did, because otherwise there wouldn't have been enough room to lay the case open fully on the floor. The bed itself was comfortable, but the air conditioning unit was very loud and often woke us during the night when it kicked in. When we arrived on the Friday we reported that one half of the double lock (the bar that stops the door from opening wider than a few inches) was broken, with one half missing. Two days later it hadn't been fixed. We also reported that the door stop was missing, and it was only the bin (trash can) that was stopping it from hitting the wall. This was fixed the day we reported it, along with the double lock when we complained it hadn't been fixed since we had arrived. We also reported that a screw was missing from the plate that keeps the door lock in the door which meant that the door sometimes wouldn't close properly when the plate came away from the door. This was only fixed the next day when we complained again. When we're paying this much for a hotel we don't expect to find so many room defects, and we don't expect to have to ask more than once for anything to get fixed.

To be in the theatre district, there is seriously NO other property in a better location! Half-block from Times Square and no more than five blocks from any theatre, it was heaven. The rooms are small by many standards, but comfortable for NYC. The bathroom was also small, but was fine for myself as a solo traveller. A family with children would definitely want to upgrade to a double room- I had a queen room and there would have been no room for a roll-away or crib. The bed was VERY comfortable and the linens were of great quality. I also very much enjoyed the modern but minimal decor in the room- it was clean and relaxing. I did not eat at the restaurants or bars but did find that Dean and Deluca downstairs adjacent to the lobby was crazy overpriced, even for NY standards ($4 for a bottle of water, $5 for a cupcake) but the hotel is so close to everything, there were at least three stores within one block where you could buy drinks or snacks. Also, if you're a pizza fan like me, you will NOT find any better than Patzeria which is next door to the Paramount! Junior's Cheesecake (and deli) is also just across the parking lot, for amazing sandwiches and their famous desserts. I had several questions for the Concierge staff and they were all incredibly helpful and accommodating. Same with the front desk and bell staff. The lobby is lovely with a GORGEOUS chandelier and cute, mismatched furniture. If I had to make a complaint, it would be that the air conditioner is prohibitively loud. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a person who sleeps with two fans and a noise machine running, and it was disturbing even to me. I also felt a little disappointed that there is a $2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153storage fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd per bag charge at the bell desk. For $250/night, they could have held my bag without charge for the two hours until the shuttle arrived.

I was still charged for it, of course. -The wi-fi internet: while most hotels offer this service for free (or is secretly included in the bill), I had to pay $75 for it! - Concierge: not only the concierge was quite unattentive, I received a package and was kept for me. I was charged $5 for keeping it for a few hours! A larger package would have cost $10 or $15 per day! - Luggage storage: they charge you $2 per piece of luggage.

As I didn't have my exact booking details to hand, I did not question this until after I checked out - more on that later. My room, therefore, was a single room on the 19th Floor ( a Broadway Petite, I believe its called). If you get a good rate for it, this room could be fine. It was certainly clean and well finished. The bathroom was also fine. However... the wardrobe is very small (not a problem if you don't unpack). There was also no room for a bedside locker, so the alarm clock and phone were perched on an annoying shelf above the bed. The bed itself was also very narrow (a standard single, to be fair) and was very uncomfortable. The air-conditioning in the room worked perfectly, but was very noisy - so much so that I had to turn it off and open the window instead. The TV in the room was great - almost as big as the bed - with a great range of channels to boot. When I made known my annoyance about the mix up in rooms after I checked out (by which time I had a chance to retrieve my original booking details) the management of the hotel were very quick to offer their apologies and have offered me a complimentary night in a superior room on my next trip to NY. I cannot fault them on this. The best thing about this hotel however, is the location. It is literally only steps from Times Square - a fantastic place to base yourself for any stay in NYC.

From the moment I walked in the door, every staff member I interacted with was friendly, helpful and professional. My room was extremely clean, and I loved the modern design. The hotel is in mid town, so I knew not to expect the same size room I might get at a hotel outside of Manhattan. But even by Manhattan standards, the room was plenty big enough for me. The bed was delightfully comfy, and I appreciated having the iPod docking station next to the bed. A very nice touch. When I checked in, they upgraded my Queen room to a King, and they also gave me complimentary Wi-Fi in my room, as well as 2 complimentary breakfast vouchers. Since I was travelling on business, my company would have paid for the Wi-Fi and breakfast, but it was great to have a few less things to worry about putting on an expense report. The breakfast was in the 2nd floor level restaurant. You could choose to order from the menu, or enjoy the buffet. I had the buffet, which included delicious fresh in-season fruit, scrambled eggs and roasted potatoes. (There were quite a few additional options, but I can only comment on what I had. The rest did look very good.) The coffee at the restaurant was outstanding. Both the hostess and my server remembered me on my 2nd day, and welcomed me back for breakfast. Another nice touch. My only complaint (and the only reason I can't give this 5 stars) is that I couldn't get coffee from Room Service before 7 am. It's not a huge deal, and probably not something that anyone else might even be aware of. But my morning java is as important as my morning run or morning shower. And since I was up by 5:30 am each day I was there, the 7 am timeframe didn't work well for me. But other than that, huge thumbs up. I highly recommend the Paramount Hotel NY.

I did check under the beds to see if anything had ended up there before we left and it was apparent that they have not cleaned under the beds in a while.

I did weeks of research through the net and trip advisor to find the best hotel/location/reviews/price and settled for the Paramount and was delighted with my choice. Following a hair raising transfer from Newark by Super Shuttle (I'm not the best car traveller in the world and the driver was weaving in and out of the busy traffic in the heat thought I was going to pass out !!) we arrived at the hotel. The hotel is a couple of minutes to Time Square next door to one theatre and across the street from another. The reception is cool ,calm and dark on arrival we were given an upgraded room this was on the 9th floor the window looked into the back of the hotel with no real view and was quite dark but was a large room and very quiet. Sheets and towels were changed every day and room had it's own air conditioning. During our stay we had breakfast at the Dean & Deluca coffee shop attached to the hotel that sold bagels, croissants, cakes etc. The only negative comment I have about the hotel is their bar charges we only had one drink in the hotel and after receiving the bill it was the last too! For a vodka and diet coke and a malibu and coke it was a whopping $27!!!!! That's over \u00c2\u00a39 a drink which I think is excessive I had a $20 out the shock must have been written over my face as the bar tender told me this included a service charge. New York is a fantastic vibrant city I would definitely recommend the Top of The Rock tour which we did on our first day which gives you a fantastic view of the city and lets you get your bearings. We also bought a Gray Line three day hop on hop off ticket from an agent in Times Square. Tours were informative and the ticket we bought covered the night tour as well buses were frequent tour guides did mention tips but weren't over pushy some guides were great and New Yorkers we had another one who was African! and therefore a bit difficult to understand. Definitely do the night tour they start at 6.30 stop at 9 and are over 2 1/2 hours long best time to go is around 8 8.30 as it's just beginning to get dark we had a great guide on our last night who came complete with CD player and played Frank Sinatra New York as we were driving through the city. During our visit it was very warm and humid. The upstairs of the bus was great to get a lovely breeze even though it was a warm one! If you wish to go to see the Statue of Liberty can't really recommend best time to go we went in the afternoon and had to queue for tickets and were told that there was an hour wait after you had purchased your ticket so were standing out in the sun for that length of time - then you have to go through airport style security. I just wanted to see the statue up close so we never got off at Liberty Island or Ellis Island and just got the boat back and was glad too when I saw the queues of people waiting to get back. To sum up had a great time I felt very safe and there is a highly visible police presence. The Paramount is a lovely hotel and I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends and family.

We arrived at the hotel at 730am and requested to leave our bags - they checked us in!! It made our day just perfect and we couldn't possibly have assumed such gracious treatment. Throughout our stay the staff was genuinely friendly, chatty, and ready to serve. I've given the hotel four out of five stars for two reasons - first, the halls are a bit too dark. I'd like a bit more light for wandering long narrow hallways without exterior windows. Second, during my last stay the decor in the rooms had a bit of a softer feel (i.e. Vermeer headboards with a softer edge to the color scheme) - now they are a bit harsh with the full-on contemporary edge.

However, trust me and the other reviewers about the hotel room size. I do not recommend it. I made the mistake of ignoring their reviews as I thought these people were the types that complain about little things. When I first opened the room, I was surprised with the size. I have never seen something like it before, even by New York City standards. I have stayed at the London NYC before for the same price. There is no exhaust fan in the small bathroom so when someone uses the washroom, the room stinks as it is very small to begin with. I only used this bathroom to take a shower and ended up using the lobby washroom for the other personal matter during my stay to keep my room fresh.

The lady who checked me in and the doorman was very nice and friendly (Checked in 5:30 pm on Saturday, May 22/10). However, they need to add more staff. There is a constant line-up with people coming in. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you're single but not if you're traveling with a partner. Try booking their two double rooms but never the standard double rooms. Also to management: You need to add more staff. I was there last weekend and there were only two staff checking-in visitors and there was always a line-up. The wait is about 10 minutes per person as the staff tries not to rush with each customer for a pleasant experience, which I appreciated. After a long wait, the lady (Latina lady) was very friendly that I forgot about my discomfort of waiting in line for 10 minutes. The whole weekend, each time I exit the hotel, there is always a line-up. When I needed something, I had to line up for 10 minutes. In my check-out, I had to line-up again for 10 mintues.

I used to stay here frequently when I was quite younger but over the past 10 years decided I outgrew it and stayed in places like The Soho Grand, or Royalton, etc. but this week conferences, etc. had pushed four star NYC prices to the $400's so I stayed at the Paramount - first time in 12 years. It was great! I walked in, the staff was very friendly, the lobby looks great, and they upgraded my room. They have clearly refurbished the place. There are plenty of lifts for the 19 or 20 floors they have so waiting was never a problem. The room was nice and clean and they had a free electrical outlet by the head of the bed - I typically do some work in the evenings on my laptop and it drives me MAD that other hotels haven't figured this out - the only free outlets are by the little desk across the room. The Paramount has clearly solved this. It was a bit hot outside but the air con worked instantly and cooled down the room. Bathroom was clean and the shower was easy to figure out - another issue I have - all the strange approaches to hot and cold water, shower vs bath. Anyway, everything was clean, worked well and the location is fantastic - a nice 1 block stroll to Times Square. The WIFI was $9.95 vs $15 per day at most hotels and it was quite fast - I streamed an episode of \"V\" no problem.

We were told there was a car on fire and some concern that it would explode. There was no sense of panic. We then walked up 46th Street towards Broadway and were fortunate enough to be able to see the show we had booked - The Addams Family at the Lunt-Fontanne, further up 46th near Broadway. After the show, the police very efficiently moved the crowd away from Broadway. We were so glad we were staying close by at the Paramount. Others either couldn't get to their hotels or couldn't get in. We felt very secure that evening and the next morning when the staff told us everything was again clear.

You couldn't find a better location for a hotel if you are travelling to New York as a tourist. It is literally a half block away from Times Square, where all the tours of New York start. Service. The doormen were A+++. We weren't the typical business or wealthy guests that seem to be at this hotel, but they still treated us as if we were, and made us feel very welcome. Con's: The hallway heading to our room (301) looked like it was the scene of a violent crime. There was plastic covering most of the floor, heading up to one of the other rooms, which was taped off so no one could enter. It stayed like that for the 3 days we stayed there, and would have been nice to seen cleaned up. The strong perfume smell in the lobby was a bit aggitating aswell. I had a bit of a cold while we were there, and the perfume really bothered me. The only other issue we had was with our reservation. We were positive that when we reserved it over the internet from the hotel's website, that we included parking as a part of the package. As it turns out, when we got there it wasn't included, and were told we would be able to get it for an additional $40/day. We said fine, had them valet the car, and when we went to check out they tried to charge the normal rate of $50/day. It took 15 minutes and some bartering with the manager on duty (asian guy) to knock off $30, but we compromised and he was nice enough to honour the previous agreement. (after making me feel that I was completely wrong and that I was lucky he was doing this for me) I would recommend this hotel because you can't beat the location, just try and make sure you spend a few extra bucks and get a better room (we had 2 double beds, which was quite small).

We choose a room with 2 double beds, thinking that would give us a little extra space for suitcases, etc. The room was right across from the elevators, but we NEVER heard anything. One night, a group of kids had a pizza party out in the hallway, outside our door. We saw them when we got home after a play......but we NEVER heard them once we were inside the room. The interior design elements of the room are excellent and so very innovative. The beds, well.... I would have been happier with a more firm bed. On the second day of our stay, we **almost** ran out of the supply of body wash...but there was an extra bar of soap. I am not sure the toiletries are replenished each day. We also had enough towels, but it seemed like there were more towels the first day than there were the second day. Maybe they just supply extra towels as you start your stay! The fan created a draft across the beds, so I covered some of the fan vents to shoot the air towards the window instead of the bed. That worked ok. Some people have complained about the fan noise.....but it seemed normal to us. We used valet parking, and that was seamless. After unloading, the car was parked somewhere, and we were told to allow 30 minutes when we wanted to have the car back. We didn't need to car until we checked out, and it was delivered in less than 5 minutes. The valet parking charge was only a few dollars more than the garage across the street normally charges for 24 hours of parking. The car was delivered to us in excellent shape, and Jed, the doorman helped us back up and was very helpful. We'll be back again and again and again. We were out and about town during meal times, so never ate at the hotel. There are many fine restaurants and theatres that you can get to in five minutes or less.

When they say small within the reviews please do not underestimate that they really do mean small. I have a feeling it is hit and miss on the room size so don't take this to chance. This in of its self is not the big disappointment, it was that this was compounded by three other things. 1) No storage so the room became a health hazard, change the base of the beds so that visitors can at least put their cases under the bed. 2) The room was so small that as the one who got to sleep on the right hand side of the bed I got the heating/cooling right in my face and ear, great experience... 3) Lastly it was impossible to regulate the room temperature and wow what a noise when it was on. In a nut shell great location, nice bar and entrance but I can't recommend it I'm afraid as the niggles add up and value for money I just don't see it.

Second, who says that? It was a completely unhelpful and rude response. He offered no help and no resolution. At that, we were livid and decided that sleeping any longer was not an option so we decided to get up and check out. Then, at only 8:30am, while we were getting ready, a hotel employee just walks right into our room without knocking. We're standing there in our underwear and he doesn't immediately shut the door! Instead, he says to us, \"When are you checking out?\" We reply \"We don't know.\" and he says \"Well you know check-out is at 10.\" This infuriated us further. This should NEVER happen to ANYONE staying at any hotel ever. First of all, check out is at NOON as clearly stated on the hotel's website. Second, who cares what time check out is?

But for a hotel in that area, you absolutely cannot beat the price. (A piece of advice: make your reservations online, NOT by phone--phoning in does not get you the best rate.) Also be aware that the rooms are small (some have said \"tiny\" in their reviews; others have called them \"miniscule\"). But the size of the rooms should not be a deterrant. My room was hyper-clean, comfortable, well heated (I visted in early January when the temperature was near frigid), and just downright cozy. Perhaps because I'm used to the Milford Plaza with its considerably small rooms, I wasn't put off by the size of my room at the Paramount. Just don't go there expecting spacious quarters. On the other hand, I was (and you will also be) impressed with the hotel staff. They proved to be the friendliest, most courteous and helpful people I've had the pleasure of meeting. (Exceptionally pleasant and helpful was the young woman--Nathalie was her name--at the front desk.

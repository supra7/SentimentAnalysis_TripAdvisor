In 1999, the motel we had been staying at was torn down to build another high rise condominium. Several family members and friends had been meeting for vacation in Daytona in the fall for years. We walked and drove the beach checking all the smaller motels. We found the Grand Prix Motel that year and have been staying there every year since 2000! We like it so much that we haven't even looked at another motel since then. We go twice a year now and always look forward to each trip. If you are looking for a small, affordable,family owned motel, right on the beach, then the Grand Prix is the the place for you! The owners, Billy and Meena, will make you feel right at home. The rooms are comfortable, clean and most have an ocean view. The kitchenette is fully equipped and perfect for a short or extended stay. The pool is clean and heated and the patio has tables, chairs,umbrellas and lounges. A few short steps from the patio and you are on one of the most beautiful white sand beaches in the world! Since it is right on the A1A, you are close to grocery stores, restaurants, shops and the famous Daytona Beach Pier. What more could you ask for? We have wonderful friends that we met at the Grand Prix, that we see every year. We wouldn't have our \"Florida Family\" if it wasn't for the Grand Prix. If you are looking for a big, new,impersonal beach resort then this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a small, family run motel where you can relax and enjoy Daytona Beach Shores (and maybe make some new friends), then come and visit Billy and Meena at the Grand Prix Motel! We'll be going back, and soon...Debbie and Robert", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburndale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA great stay, at a great place!!\u201d", "Author": "Peter A", "ReviewID": "UR137120698", "Content": "My two sons and I stayed at The Grand Prix from 7/20 to 7/23 of 2012.

What you do get is a million dollar view of the beach, a pool that is more than adequate with enough size for many people, plenty of lounge chairs, tables w/ umbrellas, a BBQ area and clean rooms. This is an older hotel and for the true vacationers of Daytona Beach, lets just be thankful that these smaller family motels are still around instead of some over sized sticks and bricks condo that are so far over priced that most who can afford to pay it choose not too. The staff has been more than helpful with any and all needs requested, housekeeping does an excellent job in providing service in a timely manner. What you get is service, great price, a 2 story building and the kitchens, although, are smaller than your kitchen at home are functional and serve the cooking needs of anyone wanting to do so while here. The pool was clean and after reading a few reviews regarding the sand issue, if you will just walk out to the where the concrete meets the sand, you will notice the sand is building up from the beach. This takes it out of the hands of the owner of the property. The sand around the deck, which is not noticeable is blown up from the beach.

As soon as I showed up at 11:00a, tired after a long drive the owner charged me the full credit card for the 4 days and then told me that I could not have a room until 3pm. The parking lot was empty. When I came back at 3pm, even more tired there was nobody at the office nor answering the bell. After a long trip around the whole place I found somebody that got me somebody else to help me and finally give me the key. The room was as old as it gets, and the back of the hotel which you need to pass to enter the room was a real, I am not exaggerating, garbage dump. It was cold in January, and when the heating went on, the fan made a noise like a jet engine. There were too many problems to list here. I decided to leave next day, but the owner said that they had a policy of no refunds. The hotel was empty, so it's not that they had rejected other people to accommodate me. Finally, I could leave after forced to pay an extra night as penalty.

I have always felt as though it very much like a home away from home. You have many of the local hot spots in close proximity or if you prefer to stay in and cook or just grill out beside the pool. It is a very casual and relaxing enviroment. For families it offers an ideal place to stay close to everything but small enough to keep a close watch on the children. Where else does the owner and his family make it a point to come bye and stop to chat, just to see how your enjoying your stay. If your looking for a flashy place then keep looking, but if your looking for just a comfortable place to enjoy yourself, watch the beautiful sunrises and sunsets and kick back and relax then this is the place for you. It has been a couple of years since I been back to florida but I still receive a Christmas card every year from the Grand Prix. I highly recommend !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We always travel as a group with family and friends that have children and we could go somewhere else but we go back because of the owners and the treatment that we have always received.

Yes, the Grand Prix is old. Yep, the kitchenette is vintige 50s, but THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE VISIT. My Dad, best friend, my three kids (15, 12, and 6) and I choose Grand Prix based on some mixed reviews and the PRICE. Wow, the price was unbelievable! We figured even if it was awful, we didn't plan on staying in the hotel that much. But we ended up really enjoying the place, and especially the friendly service of the staff, especially Bill. I believe he must be the owner, since he was the one we spoke to the most. The view from the back overlooking the ocean is BREATHTAKING! It was MAYBE 50 feet from my room door to the actual ocean!!! There IS wireless internet, and it worked fairly consistantly. The rooms were clean, and roomy. I really liked that there was a small heater for the bathroom, so you could warm up after swimming. The shower in my room was very roomy. We parked 10 feet from the room door. okay, so the not so great stuff... The electricity did flicker several times one morning, and Bill came around checking the rooms. The room was a little musty, but I sprayed it down with Fabreeze, and never noticed a smell again. The mattresses were VERY clean (I know because my 6 year old stripped the beds one morning to play fort) and the sheets and covers were clean and in good condition. The mattress was too firm for my liking, and the pillows were a bit flat, but I brought my own pillows anyway. The cable was SUPER, with tons and tons of channels. The micro and fridge worked fine. It is one of the few family-owned motels I have ever stayed at, where you truely felt welcomed by the staff. We hated to leave!

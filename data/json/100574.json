The hotel is right by the Space Needle. We flew into SEA-TAC, took the train to the end of the line, hopped onto the monorail and walked a couple of blocks to the hotel. Inside the lobby is coffee, lemon water, and pastries 24/7. The worker at the front desk was very helpful with directions and bus tips. For instance, this was a non-rental car trip, so we needed the FREE buses to get around downtown. The \u201cfree zone\u201d buses run through most of the day (6 AM \u2013 7 PM, I think) in the downtown area, so take advantage. You will need to walk a few (short) blocks to get the free zone from the hotel, but it\u2019s nothing. As for breakfast, it is very good for a complimentary breakfast: waffle bar, eggs, sausage, cereal, yogurt, juice, milk, fruit, and pastries--really good for the money. The rooms themselves are nice enough and clean, though the walls are fairly thin.

Was pleasantly surprised at the clean accomodations (first time at a Travelodge)! Room was small, but it had an easy chair and ottoman! I loved the down comforter, but it was almost too hot! I had the AC on to bring the room down to 66 degrees. But I DEFINITELY have to get me some DOWN PILLOWS!! Those were the BEST! If I am just going somewhere overnight, I usually pick Motel 6, but then I have to bring EVERYTHING!! This Travelodge had all my basic necessities: hair dryer, IN-ROOM COFFEE (although generic - no Seattle \"brands\"), iron/ironing board. Wi-Fi a bonus, but didn't use it. Said up-graded spa, but the jets were broken. Would have been nice, too, after 2 days of trekking around Pike Place, up and down hills.... The room door also kind of stuck one morning. If I go for a week somewhere, I usually go a little more spendy, just for more room to spread out. You can take a cab from the motel/Space Needle (2 blocks away) to Pike Place for about $6; if you park in a paid parking area for more than 3 hours, it will cost you $26!! Oh, one thing I didn't care for is that Travelodge CHARGES for parking! $12/day! I travel a few times a year, and I have never stayed somewhere where the motel charges for parking. Breakfast was decent - not much hot food. Just sausage, waffles and hard boiled eggs; basic fruit choices (apples, oranges or bananas); but lots of selections for cereal, yogurt, pastries, bagels, etc. They even put the leftover pastries out in the lobby when breakfast is over. And the lobby coffee is Seattle's Best. The staff was very nice and helpful. They give you walking maps to get around, and they gave me speedy directions to get back on the freeway to get home! So, for 2 of us plus taxes and parking for 2 nights, it came out to $237.

The breakfast was great with alot of choice to cater everyones needs. It is about a 10 minute walk into the heart of Seattle town. You can see the space needle from the hotel.

I chose Travelodge strictly because of price. The hotel we had stay at on our previous visit was much nicer for the same price as Travelodge but because I waited until two weeks before our trip to book our room, the price jumped $60 a night so we had to make another choice. We arrived much later than we were supposed to due to Shuttle Express being over booked, even though we had reservations. Still, it is the least expensive way to get to the hotel from the airport. We were greeted by friendly hotel staff even late at night. We did not have a room with a Space Needle view but a view of the parking lot. The first thing I noticed when getting off the elevator was the musty smell, I assume from the carpet in the hall. After the first time walking down the hall, I guess I got used to the smell because I didn't seem to notice being as strong. The second thing I noticed was the dim lighting in the halls. The only light came from a few pot lights in the ceiling with a string of old looking track lights on cords strung between the pot lights. It was dark and a little scary, being that our room was the last one down the hallway. I figured it was dark due to it being night but the hallways seemed just as dark during the daytime, until you got to the area where there were windows facing Space Needle. The room we had was very small and seemed old. There was a small fridge in the corner and coffee maker. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were very nice. The kind you would expect in a high dollar hotel. It was fine for us since we weren't staying very long. More than two nights and the lack of space would have been a problem since there wasn't much room to move around. Bathroom was small, no tub but the shower was very roomy. We did not use the pool or spa but the pool seemed like a good size and looked very inviting. There was a BBQ in the pool area but not sure if that was for guests to use. They serve a complimentary breakfast, which is helpful since I didn't see any other places to eat that are close by, other than McDonalds a few blocks away. Breakfast consists of fruits, cereals, sausage, hard boiled eggs, muffins and donuts, waffles, toast and bagels. The room has limited seating but we seemed to be able to find a place quickly enough on both mornings. The ice machines are on every other floor. We had a vending machine located on our floor but I don't know if they are on every floor. Coffee is served in the lobby day and night. The hotel is very close to Space Needle, a couple of blocks away. You can also catch the Monorail there and can ride it downtown for $4 roundtrip. The Monorail stops at a mall, which is then about another four blocks from Pikes Place Market. The area is safe to walk around during the day. We stayed downtown until 10pm, riding the Monorail back and then walked back to the hotel. Not a lot of people walking on the streets that time of night. Nothing in the area but some Condo's and the McD's so it was a little spooky walking back to the hotel from Space Needle. Checking out on a Sunday morning can be a little hectic due to so many people waiting in the lobby for shuttles to take them to the pier for their cruises. For an overnight stay at a place that is close to sights, this hotel is fine.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carolina, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cVery poor conditions\u201d", "Author": "clara d", "ReviewID": "UR118778253", "Content": "We arrived at a very late flight on September 17.

Good things: Off street parking (not secured), very efficient checking, AND one of the better free breakfast services for a hotel. I gotta chirp about the latter since I need a good breakfast. They have juice, coffee, and milk. They have free waffles. They had free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. Wow,..since when do you get free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. They also had cereal, yogurt, and fruit. They also had a small pool which wasn't good for much more than taking a dip to get the grime off after running around Seattle. Note: the mention of a restaurant only pertains to their free breakfast area. Bad things: The carpets were a bit on the nasty side, especially in the hallways. They really need to replace them, though they're worn probably due to all the traffic. I think a lot of people stay here for the location to the primary Seattle attractions at the needle and center. Kind of a cheap shower (though hot) and bathroom area though the beds were comfy enough. All this said,..a bit over-priced, but I'd consider staying here again, mainly for the free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. Good location to the bigger Seattle attractions including the various pier areas (great seafood,.yum yum), the monorail to downtown (i.e., stay here, take a monorail to the city center is pretty cheap), Pike's place (you have to see this area; yum yum sea food, all kinds of shops, tons of beautiful people, the original Starbucks).

Throughout the hotel, from the elevator entrances to the hallways, are framed prints of works from Salvador Dali and Jackson Pollock among other artists. My room was spotless and there were plenty of fluffy towels in the bathroom, including a hairdryer. The bed was comfortable and not too soft, either. I would start my day with a complimentary USA Today and walk a few steps past the lobby to the buffet room with a free hot breakfast waiting. Their waffles are perfect and they know how to make a great cup of coffee, too. The only glitch throughout the whole stay was momentary when the toilet lever in my room suddenly wouldn't flush. I called the front desk and the courteous young man replied, \"Ooooo, that's not good. Someone will be up in a few minutes to fix it.\" Within 5 minutes, there was the hotel plumber at my door with a smile on his face and the problem was solved. Housekeeping deserves applause, too, for their polite and cheery way they greet guests. Centrally located, this Travelodge is just a 10-15 min. walk to the heart of downtown.

Stayed the night on a Friday before an early Saturday morning flight. Checkin was very good, staff at that point were simply great. Based on the reviews posted on here, I expected a great nights sleep with the raves about the new beds and how comfy they were. I am convinced someone who works at this hotel wrote those reviews!! The bed we had (queen) was new maybe, but hard as a rock. It hurt my ribs to lay on my side more than one minute...something I have never experienced...even when laying on a hard floor. Having been to numerous countries, I have experienced some pretty uncomfortable beds. This bed was by far...the worst. I believe what made it so bad, was the pillows they had. They felt like feather pillows...very soft to touch and squeeze. But place your head on it, and they went flat..very flat, stayed flat...felt like sleeping on a sandbag. I never did get to sleep. I gave up at 2:30 am...my body now racked with pain...as if I had been hit by a truck. Have never experienced any kind of bed that actually made my body ache and hurt from laying on it for that short a period of time. Went to the lobby to get a cup of their 24 hour coffee. It was indeed very good coffee...that part was great. Stepped outside the lobby doors to have a smoke, and heard the doors lock behind me. Wasn't sure why that was, but had my key, so no big deal. Watched in amazement as this kid (23?) comes running across the street and right up to the lobby door entrance where I am standing. In pursuit is a white mustang car with 2 thugs in it threatening to kill this guy. I honestly got spooked and decided to step back in and get out the way in case something happened. Guess what...couldn't get back in! No place to put your key and open the doors. Had to wait for the guy on duty to respond to open the door (slow as all heck!) and only after I had convinced him I actually had a room there??? Got brave again after the mustang and thugs took off, and the guy left the front of the hotel. Stepped back out to have another cup of that really good coffee with another smoke...had to calm my nerves! I'm halfway done with my coffee, when up walk 4 young guys...totally hammered. They just hung outside and smoked and joked about the night they just had. Turns out they were military...stationed in Hawaii...on leave I suppose? They were actually very nice guys...although very drunk. They decided to go into their room...again after a couple minutes of trying to convince the guy on duty behind the desk that the hotel keys they were showing were real...and for that hotel. They got about 7 or 8 steps toward the elevator when one of them turns and runs for the door to go outside again. Guess what's coming next?? Yep...barely got the door open, and he just starts puking all over the enrtyway of the lobby just outside the doors. Honestly hurled like for 3 or 4 minutes...a real mess to say the least. Sad to say...at this point I was amused. I began to wonder just what the heck kind of place was this I had booked a room...for 2 nights!! I managed to mostly step around the puke and get back in to the hotel...the night guy knows me by now and just unlocks the door without the formal proof of room rental there. I leave at 4am... FINALLY! I check out and head for the door with my luggage in tow... only to be greeted with this huge pile of puke that there is still no way to get around without having the ability to jump 8-10 feet with luggage in flight. I couldn't believe the lazy desk guy had not at least hosed the mess out of the way...it was a huge mess and he did NOTHING! I asked him how I was to get out without getting the puke on my shoes or luggage, and he simply rolled his eyes and went back into his little room off the back of the front desk. I couldn't believe it! Yes...I got puke on my shoes, simply no way around it without jumping over it....impossible with luggage. Did I mention I had booked a room there for the night after my flight returned....and had already paid for it? Yep I did. Got back into Seattle at 12:30am...dead tired. Even though it had been reserved, and paid for...I drove right on by without even thinking of spending the night there. You could not have paid me to stay there that night...or ever again.

Overall out experience was good, keeping in mind that we were looking for a cheap hotel that was close to downtown attractions. I will start with the review of the area since that has come into question in a couple other reviews. The hotel was in an older area of the city most likely built for the 1962 World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fair. As a result of this there were a few homeless people and possibly drug dealers in the area. It should be mentioned though that these people never bothered us and we walked around the area/city a lot. Often times we walked to dinner and other attractions. I felt safe walking both day and night but I was very aware of my surroundings, keeping an eye out for any possible problems. The location was nice in that it was about a 3 blk walk to the Seattle Center (Space Needle area) and from there you could take the monorail into downtown or if you wanted to walk a little further towards downtown you could get on one of the free buses from 6am to 7pm. We did have a rental car which we took at times to go to see the Boeing Tour and Mt. Rainier among other places. The free parking at the hotel was a great benefit as we saw the parking lots in the area charged between $10 & $20/day. Now onto the hotel itself. It is still going through MAJOR UPGRADES. During our stay the put up new lights in the lobby and hallways. They also put new electronic locks on the doors. Due to this upgrade the hallways were not the cleanest at all times (sheetrock and other debris) but this did not affect our room. There is a pool and hot tub which we did not use. I did see a couple of people using the hot tub and it appeared to be nice. I did check one night and the water was very warm so that is a plus. The breakfast area is a room they converted into the breakfast area. The room looks very nice and overall breakfast was pretty good. They had sausage patties and egg patties (similar to what you would get at McDonalds but tasted a little better). They also had cold cereal, bread for toast, bagels, and a small selection of pastries which could have been better. One of the nice things is they had waffle makers. Also, they had a good selection of coffee and four different kinds of juices. Finally, the room was what I expected it to be. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t large but big enough to fit a king size bed and still have plenty of room to walk around. It had an approximately 21\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV with a large selection of channels. It had an approximately 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122x3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 table and two night stands. In the closet there was an electronic safe which was large enough to fit my laptop The bathroom was old and could use some updating but my only real issue would be that there was only a shower which could be a problem if you wanted to take a bath. Also, the room had free wireless internet which worked about half the time. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was told they were going to be upgrading the internet and hopefully it would be more reliable then. There was a flier in the elevator that said they hoped to be done with phase 1 of the upgrades this summer. I should also mention there were two computers in the lobby available for guest use and when we arrived there was a printer attached to one of them but they took out the printer about half way through out stay. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t using it so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask if they would be putting it back or what happened to it. As I stated before, overall I was happy with hotel and would probably stay here again.

We chose bagels, but they did not taste good at all, so we just popped over to the Starbucks a block away. The major complaint that I would have about this property is that they need to do renovations in their bathrooms. The fan in the bathroom was not working well, and with three women, we needed a little more room and a little less humidity.

I booked online and paid upfront; the cost was $455 for 5 nights including tax. I was a bit disappointed on arrival to discover that the hotel isn't exactly in downtown Seattle as their writeup on the booking site claimed (\"in the heart of downtown Seattle\"). I didn't have a car so having cafes/restaurants close by was important to me, especially being a lone female. The writeup also claimed that \"Guests will be able to walk to myriad restaurants, bars, and entertainment options\" -- whilst this is technically true, the implication that there are lots of such places very close by is NOT true! I did find a truly wonderful Mexican cafe-restaurant about 4 blocks away, called Dos Amigos -- can't recommend this place highly enough. And the pizza delivery place Romio's (found in the hotel information folder in my room) has totally great food. But this hotel is not placed like its writeup implies. Frankly the main part of downtown starts about 5 or 6 blocks away, and goes for about 8 or 10 blocks over 5 streets, so be warned. If you don't have a car and want to get around a significant part of downtown you will be doing a lot of walking! (The Monorail was out of action while I was there) Having said that, overall I enjoyed my stay at the Travelodge. The walls and ceilings are a little thin; whilst I was never bothered by other guests' TVs or conversation, the creaky floorboards right above my bed were a bit annoying! Especially since the people above me had a habit of coming back around 1 in the morning... Initially I was allocated a room on the ground floor. On getting to the room I found this was no exaggeration -- the room's window looked right out onto the back parking lot, and if I'd left the window open anybody could have climbed in. Once again as a lone female I wasn't happy with this; I rang the front desk and asked for a higher-up room, and there was no problem. The clerk even wheeled along a luggage cart so moving my stuff would be easier, having noticed me struggling with my four pieces of luggage getting to the original room (I had skis and boots as well as suitcases). Very sweet. In fact this guy really made my stay at Travelodge. There were so many little thoughtful things he did (name is Greg, he was on afternoon-evening shift while I was there). On the Friday and Saturday nights I was there, I was *very* glad I'd asked for a room above ground floor -- the general area the hotel is in gets quite noisy and I would have been anxious about undesirables outside my room. As it was I felt perfectly safe and the noise was simply a minor annoyance. The free breakfast was tasty (juices, coffee, apples, donuts and other things made of donut dough, muffins) but I would have preferred the addition of some cereals. However it was lovely not to have to go in search of food first thing in the morning. My room had a King size bed, which had linens just a little bit too small but was firm and comfy. Good size wardrobe with plenty of hangers. A mini fridge, which I turned off because the noise would have woken me in the night. The heater/air conditioner was difficult to get to the right temperature. For some reason if I was warm enough during the day I was too hot at night. I turned it off each night but this didn't make things any better. Plenty of channels on the TV, which was installed in a sort of entertainment centre kum dresser (three large drawers under the TV which provided plenty of clothes storage space). A nice large table where I could set up my laptop. And an easy chair which I never sat in, because it was impossible to see the TV from there. Oh and a glass table which was handy for putting the pizza boxes on! The bedside tables were just tables, i.e. no drawers, which I found a bit annoying. Blackout curtains at the windows -- total darkness when pulled, very nice. The bathroom was an adequate size for one or two people. The shower was in good condition (with a door!) and had one of those adjustable shower heads so you could get it to do a sort of massage. The water pressure was right on the hairy edge of being good enough, but it was OK. However one big annoyance was that the water temperature took forever to get hot enough for an enjoyable shower! I got into the habit of turning it on 5 minutes before I wanted a shower. I don't like to waste resources so I found this very sub-par, but it really was necessary. If I didn't wait that long, the water would be only just warm enough to shower in, and I'd be shivering away, and then right at the end of the shower the water would finally get hot enough to be pleasant. I wanted to just be left alone, having just come from a disastrous stay with New Zealand friends in Canada, sleeping on the floor in the living room with zero privacy in a dump of an apartment. So I hung the DND sign out as soon as I arrived and never brought it back in. Housekeeping put notices under the door for the first two days saying if I wanted the room serviced to please remove the DND sign before 1pm. After that they figured that I wanted to be left alone. So I can't comment on the standard of housekeeping, except to say I had no complaints on arrival. I had a couple of sits in the spa pool. Not much to say here -- a perfectly adequate pool and since I was in need of a bit of hydrotherapy on my left shoulder, very appreciated. You can ask for extra towels at the front desk on your way to the pool. There's a bin at poolside where you're supposed to drop your pool towels, but since that meant going back up to my room shivering in my swimsuit, I didn't do that! Very appreciated was the free local calls (up to 20 mins duration) and unlimited free 1-800 calls. This enabled me to speak to my husband in New Zealand, over the internet for free! Since at that time we hadn't talked for 6 weeks it was very nice indeed. It also allowed me to do significant online research about Seattle and its environs which allowed me to make the most of my time there. Another thing I really appreciated was the free toiletries. I'd arrived with no toothpaste, and it was lovely not to have to find a grocery or drug store on the evening of my arrival. There was a note in my bathroom saying that they had a range of toiletries available for free. Very nice touch. They also offered me a toothbrush when I asked for the toothpaste. To sum up: this hotel is definitely a budget hotel. Don't go if you want a luxury experience, or if you mind thin walls/ceilings, or if you want to really be in downtown Seattle. But the staff are friendly, the beds are comfy, the showers are nice once they're hot enough, and the price is about right.", "Date": "April 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "san jose ca", "Title": "\u201cfor the $ they charged, I would rather stay someplace else....\u201d", "Author": "whereria", "ReviewID": "UR4094370", "Content": "The rooms are cold and damp and NOT cozy by any means and the building is old.

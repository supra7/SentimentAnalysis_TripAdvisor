The rooms are like a small apartment. Yes it is next to an expressway but you can see that from reading the address. We had an exterior room right next to the highway. I am a light sleeper and I was fine. The room is 4 rooms with a full mini kitchen including a dishwasher, granite counter tops. The eating bar is a 2 seater. The small living room had a fireplace. The bedroom was separated by 2 large sliding doors. There is a TV the bedroom and a clock with soothing sounds. The bath has both shower and tub. The place is decorated with bright modern colors. There is a pool and hot tub, and more coffer provided in lobby. The free breakfast buffet is good and has whipped cream. I loved that on my hot chocolate in the morning. There is a grocery store right next door, a Whole Foods down the street and lot of shopping.

We used the fitness facility at the hotel across the drive, as theirs was out, and we also used the washers and dryers. All were clean and in good working condition. We were in a tough situation. We came down during the Super Bowl snowstorm, and our original 5 day visit stretched to almost 2 weeks. The thing that I recall the most is the hotel staff was incredibly accommodating, providing us with a crib and fresh bedding daily for our newborn, and allowing us to stretch our stay without any hassles at all.

Our experience has certainly been better. The room is a bit small, but I am OK with that since we have a separate sleeping area. I like that feature. Everything is clean, and works properly. The front deck clerk, John, was very nice and professional. We were greeted promptly, and the entire check-in process only took 2-3 minutes. There is still quite a bit of noise from the highway as previous reviewers noted. One change I would suggest to them is to not charge 75 cents for local calls. That is just so 1980s, and seems cheap. I doubt they realize very much revenue from it, as most people use their cell phones, such it just makes them look tawdry with no return at all.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BlueMarlinDave", "ReviewID": "UR120461305", "Content": "I stayed here for two weeks in September on a business trip to Dallas.

When we got there, we were surprised that it looked like an apartment complex. We were oogling over the Courtyard Marriott next door, but when we got into our room, we were surprised at the updated, modern look it had! The room had a kitchen complete with fridge, oven, dishwasher, microwave, toaster, plates and utensils. The kitchen had a little counter top bar that separates it from the living room. The living room has a small office desk with connection internet but the room also has access to free wifi. The living room tv is a 42\" flat screen and a modern looking couch (not very soft and cushiony). The bedroom is separated from living room with sliding doors. The room was very comfortable and amazingly, it was quiet. We weren't disrupted by any noisy neighbors at all. The hotel offers complimentary, hot breakfast which big variety of items from 7am - 9:30am. Danishes, breads, eggs, sausage, pancakes, waffles, oatmeal, cereal, etc. was available. The dining room was big and roomy and finding a table was not a problem. Of course, breakfast can be taken back up to your room. The location was perfect. Only three miles away from Northpark Center Mall and about two miles from In-n-Out. Also, this is not far from, Downtown, the Galleria and the other In-n-Out location. The customer service was great. The lady that greeted us at the front desk Friday night was really nice. Also, the last-minute getaway rate we received for this room was outstanding! What a value!

I explained this is not acceptable, and she says \"I cannot help you with anything else\". After a while I decide to take a shower, except there was no soap, so I took a shower with shampoo. The housekeeping department does not leave enough shampoo and conditioner for the number of adults staying in the suite. If you want ice, you have to walk all the way to the fornt desk. There are no ice makers as stated in the room information. There also no ice machines convenient to guest rooms. Also, we had dead crickets in our kitchen which were not removed by housekeeping. We had a premium 2 bedroom suite and were placed at the farthest suite from the front desk despite the fact that we had advised we would be arriving with a baby.

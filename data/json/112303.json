The rooms are on the smaller side and also a bit dark (especially on the back side of the hotel). All amenities are in the room and free wifi works throughout the hotel.

The property is at once no frills and a luxury boutique. If that sounds like a contradiction, it is. And so is this hotel. So far as I can tell, this is a very old property that was renovated. And by renovated, I mean the rooms, lobby and even the elevators were designed by a modernist with good style. The hotel looks cool. However, it simultaneous seems that very little money was put into the structure itself. The elevators are 1930 tenement house slow and rickety. This may be the only place on the planet where I got no cell phone reception whatsoever. The wireless internet is free - and slow as all hell. And forget about room service - absent a non-affiliated restaurant that delivers dinner, they have none. But what really got me was their concierge. He was there both times I stayed at the hotel. The first time, I hailed a cab to go to the airport. As I was getting into the cab, he came out of the hotel, physically stopped me and told me that at hotels in San Francisco, you have to get a cab that is being dispatched to the hotel. (By the way, that is not the law AT ALL.) This led to the cab driver and the concierge getting into a confrontation on Geary Street. Another unlabelled cab pulled up, the concierge took my bags without invitation and put them into the second cab. That cab driver than slipped him a $10. The best part is that second cab driver refused to take a credit card (which is actually against the law in SF, I believe), so I had to pay in cash and could not expense the ride. That's the concierge up $10, hotel guest down $45 if you are keeping score at home. Not to be outdone, on my second visit (my secretary assumed I wanted to stay there again - I didn't), the valet pulled my rental car away to park as I was checking in (even though he said he could let it sit for two minutes while I checked in). I then needed to wait 20 minutes for the valet to go and get the car. Fine. But when I went to take my own bags out of the car, the same concierge from the first trip came out of the hotel, looked at my wallet, looked at me, looked at my wallet again and nodded to the valet, as if demanding a tip. So fine, I tipped the valet. At which point the concierge actually went up to the valet to see what I tipped him. Maybe you had to be there to witness that, but it was a bit presumptuous to say the lease. So, my concierge, I tipped the valet (which I would have done anyway).

I kept coming back to the Hotel Diva and am glad we stayed here. If you can get a good rate on this hotel (we got ours for about $125 on hotels.com), I'd say jump at it. The hotel is convenient to Union Square, two blocks from Powell and within 5 minutes of the nearest BART station. Front desk staff were great and very responsive and helpful throughout our stay. A Starbucks adjacent to the lobby was a plus for us (despite what we note below). A saki decanter nightly, and morning Ghirardelli hot chocolate in the lobby were also nice touches. The beds were very comfortable and the heating/AC worked well and was not noisy (like is often the case with individual units in other hotels). The room was large enough for me, my wife and our college-age son (which was a primary concern of ours). Only a few negatives would be noted, and I hope they've fixed a few of those for the next guests. The tub and sink drained very slowly and the toilet flapper valve sometimes stuck in the open position. A simple jiggle fixed the latter, but in the middle of the night...well, you don't want to wait to make sure the toilet stops! A couple of the electric plugs in a set of four behind the bed also didn't work, which meant you could plug in the bed reading lights or the clock, but not all three. Those things could be easily fixed, as I said. Our specific room (219) was directly over the Starbucks, and we could hear (slightly, but enough to make out the song) the music they play. OK if you are not a light sleeper. Other than that the room was very quiet, with only the normal floor creaks you'd hear in an older building. Our room was away from the street as well. Part of the charm for many at this hotel could be the stylishness of the decor, but it has unintended drawbacks. The wire mesh chairs in the rooms don't lend themselves to lounging for long periods of time, and the darker hues of the room mean that the rooms are darker overall than one might like. Still, if you come to San Francisco and stay in your room all day you're missing something! Others note in their reviews that the homeless around here were off-putting. I don't think they are worse here than other areas of S.F. frequented by tourists. And we were never confronted by any of them beyond verbal requests for money.

We were first given a \"Two Room Studio Queen\" and while the main room was fine, the one with the murphy bed was stark and creepy. I pulled down the murphy bed which had a thin sheet on it, not comphy blanket or pillow like the other bed. I asked housekeeping for towels and to make up the murphy bed and when we returned from our evening out, the towels were there on the unmade bed. I called again and the \"housekeeping\" but really a guy who looked like a maintenance man arrived and said \"what would you like me to do?\" with a snarky tone. He pointed me to a closet w/pillows and a blanket. Excuse me, didn't realize I had to make my own bed at a hotel. I turned on the flatscreen and it was all snowy w/terrible reception. Off to a good start. The second night we switched to a regular room w/two queen sized beds. They told us which room to go to. Later we found the bathroom was not cleaned (you don't want to know...) as well as garbage left by previous guests. That TV also was difficult to see and the clock we were given was set on a completely wrong time and the ipod plug in didnt work. Speaking of my ipod (ipad) while there was free wi-fi, it was terrible and barely worked. I'm guessing they did clean the room the following nights b/c of the housekeeping knocks on the door while we were still sleeping in the morning.

This is not the case with the Hotel Diva. This was a last minute hotel switch in a week where everything was sold out and was a very pleasant suprise. It's overpriced for my budget, but so is everything in Union Square, and especially with a convention in town. The convenience allowed me to ditch the idea of a rental car, which off-set the typical hotel room allowance. FINE BY ME! When I checked in, I joked with the front desk clerk when he said, \"let me see what I have\" responding \"Something fabulous\"....and he did. He upgraded me to a beautiful room on the 6th floor (601, by the way) with more than I needed for my one night stay. I wished I could have stayed longer! The room was clean and equipped with a computer docking station, huge monitor, USB charging station, a PRINTER (for gosh sake) and flat screen TV's in both the living room area and the bedroom. There was even a microwave AND a Keurig coffe machine with an assortment of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The only amenity missing I would like to have had would have been a refrigerator had I stayed longer, but I can hardly complain about that given the business-minded amenities already there! The only \"bad\" thing I can say about this hotel was that the beds were so comfy, I didn't want to get out of it in the morning. My business trips are \"scouting\" trips for future pleasure travel, and I will DEFINATELY be back to this hotel.

Also, some people used the fire escape right outside of our room as a smoking/talking area on a few occasions, one of which started at about 2:30 in the morning, when some people, like myself, are trying to sleep.

Check in was a breeze, as was our ease in dropping our rental car off with the valet. The lobby was a little small, very modern - I was hoping this look would be replicated in the rooms/halls of the hotel. It was not. The elevators were decent sized, but only had a cheap k-mart blue light bulb in it, not very flattering - it did showcase all the crumbs and dirt on the carpet of the elevator really well though. In the 4 days we stayed it seemed like they never vaccumed them. Once off the elevator you're greeted by cheap ugly blue carpet that just feels dirty. It follows you into your room. I HEARD vacuums in the hotel, just not sure what they had been cleaning - since it clearly wasn't the floor. The room was small, which is expected in an older building, I was fine with that. The bathroom too - was small, as to be expected as well. Overall the room appeared to be decorated in some odd 90's modern themed - with faux brushed metal, blue carpet, gun metal grey walls, some odd dead flower art hanging from the walls and strange cheap adjustable lamps that never stayed in place - they kept drooping down. The room was also accompanied by a dorm room metal filing cabinet type dresser, as well as a dorm room type mini fridge. Don't even bother with the TV because a) your in San Fran - go explore and b) the reception is awful. The bathroom was tiny, but manageable. The lighting was based on a timed turn switch, so it was frustrating trying to keep the lights on on the bathroom. the faucet handles were also very 90's modern pointless functional furnishing looking... please just use hot and cold easy to use knobs people! I'd have to say the business centers and the lobby are the nicest decorated places in the building, it's a shame you can't stay there! Overall the hotel is a decent deal for your money if you're looking for a place to store your bags and sleep. It is by no means a chic/luxury hotel. The location is amazing, and can't be beat really. The desk attendants were also very nice. Our main gripe however was the valet service. All week our car had been pulled around at a timely fashion. Until it was the day to go to the airport. It took them a whopping 60 minutes to pull our car around, making us late to the airport.

The room was damp, the bed was small, and they were stains on the wall. As I have extreme mold allergies we asked to move. They informed us that they only had rooms at the front. My husband and I did not sleep the entire night, even after the front desk provided us with earplugs. The street noise was unbearable. We had planned to sleep in, but men were working on the front of the hotel early in the morning and that made sleeping impossible. We were not informed by either Travelocity or the Diva that the hotel would be undergoing reservations. The second room was nicer than the first, but the beds were uncomfortable and too small for the surrounding frame/bedside tables. We ended up calling around and moving to another hotel. We are hoping that our refund goes through. I cannot express enough how disappointing the Diva was, we spent the rest of our visit trying to recoup the sleep that we didn't get for that entire first night.

We stayed on a room on the 7th floor king studio with a king size bed and murphy bed, the bed and murphy bed were super comfortable, the bathroom and shower-bathtub space is really small but i had no problem with that, and the shower pressure was really good as well as the amenities of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. We went to have coffee and tea every morning to the lounge on the same floor and used the computer with internet. The room had a lot of storage for clothes and shopping and a mini fridge where we stored water, juice and yogurt so we really never missed that the hotel doesn't have a restaurant that served breakfast; right outside the hotel there are several \"fine\" restaurants, theaters, coffee shops, starbucks, quiznos, wallgreens.. It's very well located at one block from union square and all the shops, cable car, and everything you could possible need. Rodney and David from the concierge were always friendly and happy to help us to make reservations for a napa wine tasting tour, restaurant reservations, and even walked outside to find us a taxi in the rain.

They offered a AAA rate and their junior suite was perfect for the three of us. The murphy bed was sooo much better than a foldout or rollaway would've been. I personally loved the file cabinets repurposed as a bureau and the mini fridge in the room was great for left overs as well. There were plenty of hangers in the closet, the HVAC all worked lovely without any noise and the televisions worked great as well. I've traveled the world over and stayed in all different qualities of hotels, motels, B & Bs and inns and The Diva had everything we needed. Parking wasn't a problem and with unlimited in and out privileges it worked out great for us. I would definitely recommend The Diva to anyone wanting to stay in downtown San Francisco and I will absolutely stay there again the next time I am in the city by the bay. If there was one thing criticism it was that the sink in my room didn't have a stopper or anything to stop something from falling down the drain.

This last stay, I was in a square white box containing a bed, a thin desk, and a small end table on either side of the bed. There was no room for anything else. The bathroom was just large enough for a tub, sink and toilet. One window, overlooking a fire escape and very narrow alley, such that you wouldn't want to look out of the window, which let in little light. A flat-screen TV attached to the wall, which swings out for viewing from the bed--there's no other place to view it from. Behind the bed, there was a large flat piece of steel bolted to the wall, which seems to be standard in every room. I felt like I was in prison. I don't tend to spend much time in my room--I use it for sleeping and not much else--but it still felt claustrophobic. Although the Diva seems to present itself as new and arty, there's actually very little art work anywhere; it's quite spartan The steel on the wall is not, in my mind, an appealing feature. It lacks both warmth and anything to distract attention from the bare white walls. I was awakened in the wee hours by lots of banging on trash cans from the alley. This is not uncommon for hotels in the area, but some have double windows to better block the noise. There's nothing wrong with a reliably clean, well-located box--if it's priced at the bottom of the scale for the area. The Diva is not pricey, but it's pricey for what you get, and it's a mystery to me. There being so many hotels within a few blocks, I don't find the Diva competitive at its price point, since it offers me absolutely nothing beyond its good location. For about the same price I can find a similar location, a larger room, some attempt at decor, and maybe a wine tasting in the evening, and/or a lobby that's hospitable. I have a friend who stays at the Diva religiously because she likes the work-out room. There's that, but it's by no means the only place around that either has a health club or access to one nearby.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel in the Heart of San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "RedRocksPhoto", "ReviewID": "UR89828865", "Content": "Steps away from the heart of San Francisco.

The check in and check out were smooth and friendly. Overall the staff were great in terms of giving me directions around the area and arranging transportation to San Francisco airport. The Hotel is in a good location, near the shopping and theaters in Union Square and around 4 blocks from the BART. However, the area right around the Hotel is a bit seedy and not too attractive to wander around at night. The room was clean and did not have any problems with smell or inoperative bathroom fixtures as noted in some previous reviews. However the room I had was quite small, OK for 1 person but it would have been a tight squeeze for 2. More importantly, the hotel had a higher noise level than that found in more modern buildings. I could easily hear conversations in other rooms. More problematic was the noise from the garbage trucks early in the morning, Perhaps a room on a higher floor (I was on the second) would be better. The free internet worked well and the internet lounges were attractive. There is free coffee from 7-10AM in one of the lounges. This is nice, but coffee the rest if the day of some fruit or pastries in the morning would have been a nice touch. There is a Starbucks next store, but the line can be long so having better access to coffee would be nice for those in a hurry.

We were in the midst of everything and a few blocks from Union Square, which makes it incredibly convenient. Fortunately, because we were only in San Fran for a few days, we were only in our hotel to sleep. Aside from Diva's location, the concierge, David, was wonderful. He had quite the personality and knew about reserving city tours, public transportation, etc. He was very helpful. However, the desk clerk, Christian, was incredibly snotty and quite \"diva\" like, which is ironic, considering our overall opinion on this hotel. After several delays at the airport, we were quite weary when we arrived, and he gave us a \"Queen\" room, despite having a print out of our reservation stating \"King\" accommodations. After requesting that we receive our original reservation, he acted as if he was doing us a favor by switching rooms, which was ridiculous. As many have mentioned, it's an older hotel which recently underwent a facelift. Unfortunately, the \"diva\" look can only take it so far. We had a \"Deluxe\" room, which was very small. Because of the size of the room, it was difficult to maneuver our luggage or to move around. The bathroom was tiny...no space to put toiletries, so we left everything out on the desk. The walls were thin, so you hear everything...the people creaking up and down the halls, others in bordering rooms, and doors opening and closing-all night long. Finally, they have a Diva \"Boudoir\", which includes two vending machines and an IKEA lounge. Seriously? More disappointing than anything was the cleanliness of the place. I'm not a high-maintenance person, but I expect to be provided with clean towels and sheets. Our \"white\" sheets were stained and dinghy looking. We requested to have them changed the following morning, and they were replaced with sheets that looked just as dirty. As for the bathroom towels, they were gray, stained and dirty-looking as well. Clearly these need replaced. Apparently, there is a suite area on the top floor of the Diva, so maybe the guests up there actually have cleaner linens? This place had a facelift a few years back, but it doesn't seem they've kept up with it. It certainly is anything but \"Diva\" like. It just wasn't up to par for the price.

The lack of sound proofing really exaggerated this unfortunate issue.

The layout on each floor is kind of unusual and the floors are somewhat maze-ish but once we found our room it was fine. There is a nice business lounge to use computers and print boarding passes. Also the location is prime and the staff was super friendly and helpful. It seems like there are several nice touches but there seem to be a few things missing. Something still seems a bit dingey about the place. The gym was weird which is important to my husband and I as we tried to get a workout in (2 pieces of equipment were broken or not functioning properly, TV was ripped off the wall) The floors in the hotel are very squeaky and you can hear people above you. Free coffee/tea is provided in the morning which is nice although many other hotels provide free wine or breakfasts which I would have enjoyed more.

The location is great - whilst not ON Union Square it is close enough to walk to the main shopping areas as well as public transport systems like the Muni and BART. It's always one of the main things we look for in a hotel and Diva definitely ticked that box for us. The only thing we were a bit surprised about was the size of the rooms - they are quite small, although we only booked their cheapest so this may not be the same in the pricier rooms. We had been warned though that all hotel rooms in San Fran are tiny so we got over it and utilised the quite reasonable amount of storage space and it was fine. Also took a bit of getting used to having the basin and vanity outside of the bathroom! I guess a creative way to use the space. The decor of the room as with the hotel is modern and trendy which we liked. As for the price we thought it was quite good value for money, despite our 4th night being much more expensive - being a Saturday night and also over Fleet week and with the President's Cup golf on this was understandable.

The bathroom was small and the shower had a weird modern designed fixture that sprayed water all over the back of the shower and got all over the floor in the bathroom.

We ate there on the first night, and the food was OK but in our view nothing special. The organic margaritas are very nice though! The Diva has a boutique style, which is pleasant change compared to bland corporate hotels. The lobby is quite spartan and small. On check in we were told that we had been upgraded to a room on the 7th floor, and since we had been travelling for over 24 hours, that sounded great. When we got up to the room, we were a bit confused as it was really tiny. Anticipating jetlag and wanting a room of decent size, we had booked a room with 2 double beds. We were disappointed with the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dimensions, but we were just too exhausted to argue it, so we just got on with it. The room was modern and stylish, with metal furniture including a chest of drawers in the style of a filing cabinet. There is a wall-mounted flat screen TV with a good channel selection, as well as pay movies. There was an absolutely tiny closet that an adult wouldn't fit in sideways, and there bathroom was so small that the sink area is actually in an alcove in the room. It was clean and relatively comfortable, and being at the back of the hotel is was also very quiet, which was perfect for us. As the room was so small the bed was not that big either \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a standard double, which these days is pretty small. Couples of generous physical proportions would probably find the bed inadequate. There is complimentary wi-fi in the room, which is great these days when hotels want as much as USD 15 per day for internet, and as we had our laptop with us we used the net quite a bit. Breakfast was also complimentary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c coffee, tea, juice, yoghurt and Danish pastries were available in a room on the 7th floor, which you could only access using your room card key. This was quite convenient as we could grab something on the way out early every day as we went exploring in the city. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times, and we were happy enough with our choice. Its location is great, and we got a good deal on the price. Our one gripe was the tiny room. We asked about this at check out, and we were told that the 7th floor rooms had better linens and fixtures over a standard room, and that our original booking for a bigger room on another floor did not include access to the complimentary breakfast. So in some ways it was an upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but a bigger room would have been nice. We were on a nearly month long trip in the USA, and we are just gald that the Diva was our first stop rather than our last, as there is just no way we would have been able to move in the room with the luggage we had at the end!", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cclean, comfortable, affordable, stylish, just off union square\u201d", "Author": "welshmechanic", "ReviewID": "UR28188261", "Content": "I was very pleased with the diva hotel.

The hotel itself has a Starbucks and a good ramen shop next door run by Japanese that is packed every night. The plus point here is you won't be coming back to a dark/deserted street at night, which we reckon can be the case in some parts.

We had picked this very special Lily at Bonita Point Lighhouse after two attempts at veturing out in THE BIG GREEN COMMANDER to find the Marin Headlands look out for the Golden Gate bridge. I called the Diva from the plane and spoke with an Assistant Manager who combed through the trash in our room. About three weeks later we received the in tact dried Calla Lily which had been carefully secured for a long trip back east.

Here is my honest opinion good and bad of the Diva. 1st off the sign for Hotel Diva just is a diamond shape mounted to the building that just says Diva on it. The strange thing is the sign isn't above their door so be aware when arriving. Staff was friendly. Room and linens were clean but the room was VERY small and smelled. I went out to Walgreens and purchased a Glade plug in which helped alot. I don't know why the hotel doesn't do something like this themselves. The buildings in this area are very old and smell of it, just be aware. To add to the smell the floors under the carpet must be wood because they creak. The person in the room above ours kept walking from one side of the room to the other every night during our stay for about 2 hours each night with the floor (our ceiling) creaking the entire time. Drove me nuts!!!! The decor- they call it Diva Sexy, I call it office furniture. The dresser was an old 2 drawer file cabinet with a wood top. I don't know about you but the last thing I want on my vacation is a reminder of work. Location is great for the BART, cable cars and all other MUNI transportation. If you are coming for shopping this is also the place for you as just 2 blocks away is Macy's, Tiffany's, Gucci etc. I wouldn't call the location shady but it is dirty. There are a few homeless (to be expected in a downtown city) but there are more people palm out just wanting money, they don't appear to be homeless this just seems to be their day job. Every morning when we left the hotel we were asked for money at least 3-4 times in a 2 block area. We did feel safe leaving the hotel and walking East, however our last day there we made the mistake of walking just 1 block West and down to catch a bus to go to outer areas and did not feel safe at all. Thank goodness we saw 3 police officers standing a block away and felt better about our situation we had walked into. Bottom line is we paid $180 for the Diva.

The staff were friendly & helpful, the public areas of the hotel were spotless & well maintained. The rooms were excellent especially for the star rating. But the one thing that recommends this hotel above all others are the beds. They are wonderful, firm but not bouncy with the added bonus of what seemed to be a mattress topper, high quality linens & huge squishy pillows that didn't loose their shape the moment you put your head onto them. Completely wonderful. I am sure that a good bed that encourages a good nights sleep must be at least number two on the list of essentials for any traveller. The only downsides I can think of are: - The fact that board is on a room only basis but there are options for breakfast locally. - The fact that rooms on facing into the internal courtyard get very little daylight - The fact that the rooms on the side of the hotel away from Geary ajoin two noisey late night bars & an alleyway with glass recycling bins that are filled & emptied on a regular basis. This process is as noisy if not more so than the bars. We experienced this on the first night & having complained we were accommodated in a new room away from the noise with very little fuss. The hotel management say that they are in the process of soundproofing so it's not all bad news. I can not comment as to the quality of the other Personality hotels but I would definately stay at Diva again.

Not sure what some folks think when they book a room in the middle of a fairly large city. I expected the rooms to be small, I expected city noise, I expected to encounter all kinds of people, including the homeless. What I found at the Hotel Diva was a decent-sized room (which they graciously upgraded for me), not much noise (the only noise I heard was an occasional door-slamming), and some homeless folks that were actually quite friendly and totally harmless. The staff was top-notch - everyone we encountered from the manager to the cleaning staff couldn't do enough to make our stay enjoyable. The room was very IKEA-like - slick and efficient. Plenty of room for two. I liked the fact that the sink was located separately from the bathroom which made it quick and easy for two of us to get ready for the day. Plus, the room was spotless! We were upgraded to the 7th floor, which included a lovely continental breakfast each morning with coffee that rivaled Starbucks (which was right next door, by the way). As someone else commented, the lobby wasn't much to speak of but who spends time in the lobby? It was small, but sleek with a concierge that was pleasant and very helpful. If it weren't for him we might have missed our day trip to Yosemite. The tour company for some reason had our name wrong on their list, but the concierge ran out and caught up with the driver and got it straightened out - and we didn't even book the trip through him. Definitely take advantage of the wonderful (and free) wine reception offered in the lobby a few nights during the week (I think its Tues through Thurs from 4pm-6pm). Let's talk location. You can't beat the location of the Diva. It's in Union Square, blocks from public trans that can get you anywhere in the city. We didn't need a car, and at $35 a night for parking and gas at $4.09 a gallon, public trans is a blessing and a bargain. We took BART from the airport ($5.25) to Powell St. and walked to the hotel, with luggage in tow. No major hills from Powell to Geary - about a 5-block walk. Get yourself a 1- or 3-day Muni pass and take the subway, bus, trolley or cable car anywhere in the city - all right there from Powell St. You're within walking distance to restaurants, shops, nightclubs and theaters. We walked to Chinatown one evening for dinner - not a bad walk at all, no major hills involved. Honestly, we didn't have one bad thing to say about this hotel. I'm always leery booking something sight unseen and have been burned more than once, but you can't go wrong here. The price is right, the location is great, and you won't encounter a better staff.

We highly, highly recommend the Diva, and we had a great time. We stayed in a studio suite queen, which provided us 2 separate bedrooms that shared a bathroom, this was perfect for us. Complaints about noise on Geary street are valid, ask for a room in the back. The individual that checked us in gave us a choice and we did this, and the room was quiet. Our beds were comfortable. Our rooms weren't big, but weren't tiny either. We did fine with a week's worth of clothes as long as we were organized. Our bedrooms and bathroom were very clean and stayed that way throughout the week. Note to visitors, tip cleaning staff at any hotel a few dollars a day, this always goes a long way. The staff were sociable and helpful 100% of the time, including cleaning staff, and several staff members made it a point to be engaging to my children. My kids weren't ignored and were treated well. I greatly appreciated this. The hotel does appear to be marketed to adults, but my kids fit in fine and we did not feel out of place. I noticed they have many specials, several geared towards kids The lounges were great, I liked the style and appreciated having computers and morning coffee available. Are there homeless outside, yes, and they are all over San Francisco as well. While I don't care for being hit up for money every 5 minutes, neither was I harassed, and one homeless gentleman even directed my daughter towards the inner sidewalk when she was unsafely heading towards the street. Polite homeless folk? Only in San Francisco! I truly don't understand some of the negative reviews on this site. I've traveled a lot. Was our experience perfect? Well, I found a piece of lint once, and the screen saver on the computer in the internet lounge jammed up from time to time. Twice the coffee in the lounge came a little later than I wanted (I was on NY time and was up between 4-5am most mornings) So what? Any complaints I might have are minor in comparison to the major issues I've experienced at other hotels. You want perfection and someone to jump when something minor bothers you? Pay 5 times as much and go to an expensive chain hotel. Stay in NYC sometime and you'll see what I mean. Our experience at the Diva was much, much better than average and I would happily stay here again, with my family or on my own. It was a great experience and a great value.

Flat panel TV, a lateral file cabinet for a dresser, curled steel as a headboard, great toiletries, condom in the safe (safe sex!), removable tatoos, clock radio with MP3 player connection, coffee maker, and best of all - FREE WIRELESS INTERNET access! + The beds were very comfortable. + The front desk people always greeted me when I arrived and left. The wine reception at night was a nice touch. Loved coming \"home\" and being greeted by wine! - My room had windows that was not facing Geary, but the other street (is it Palmer?) is noisy on the weekends thanks to 2 popular nightclubs. One had an overflow crowd on the sidewalk waiting to gain entrance, which means a lot of loud talking, laughing, etc. BUT during the week, it was relatively quiet. - Yes, there are homeless people hanging around Geary, but geez....this is SF Union Square and there are homeless EVERYWHERE!

I will say the bed was extremely comfy with nice down pillows and soft sheets. The pictures on the website definitely make the place look better. We also found that the computers in the business center and on the floors were extremely slow if they were working at all, which did not please my husband at all. The drink machine also took our money on 2 seperate occasions.

If you can get a decent rate (say, $120 or less for a king bed room), I'd wholeheartedly recommend the Diva.", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood Location...Unresponsive staff\u201d", "Author": "80'sbaby", "ReviewID": "UR6138365", "Content": "We checked into the Hotel Diva after a great stay in Napa. I decided that we would spend a day in San Francisco to see the city, since I had never been. From the website the Diva seemed like a good choice for a place to come back to after a day in the city. It's in a great location close to all the shops. I had booked directly from the hotel's site and at the same time signed up for Personality Perks. That's their frequent guest card that allows for special \"perks\" during your stay. One of the perks being a free room upgrade, upon availability. Well when we got to our room it was a box. I must say that it was very clean, but the pictures on the site are very misleading. There was barely enough room for two people to walk around. The king bed took up 80% of the room. There was a view of a brick wall, and a tiny bathroom. Only one person could stand in it at a time. The only perk I noticed was the free Wi-fi. Which would come in handy later. I knew that this could not have been an upgraded room!! I mean how much smaller could they get. So I went down to the front desk and asked about an upgrade due to my membership in this \"perk \" program. Romy was the attendants name. He stated that I should have gotten a card and there is no record of me in the system. I offered to show him a confirmation email, stating I had in fact signed up. But he said it was o.k, and he had to go and check with the corporate office. Conveniently, they were located just behind him in an office around the corner. I mentioned that we were only there for a day and wanted to get a jump on things. He said he would take care of it ASAP. So I went upstairs to my room and waited 20 minutes. That's when I opened my laptop and started to look for other hotels in the area because ASAP is not 20-30 minutes later!! In fact I was never called back about the upgrade. I was very upset and decided to checkout. I mentioned how I had waited to find out about the room upgrade and some of the other perks that I was supposed to receive upon check-in. Never heard back from that guy. Actually, there were now two new guys there who checked us out and said we would be refunded the full amount. All they asked was \"is this your first time here?\" You would think they would try to rectify the situation at that point. I was much happier spending my money at the Westin down the street.

The location was excellent - just off Union Square, to avoid the hordes and tacky restaurants, but close enough to walk there in 3 minutes and surrounded by excellent dining and cafes (the gourmet Mexican / Pan-Americas place was very good). The rooms were stylish and very comfortable, as were the bathrooms. The staff were professional gentlemen who were all too happy to accomodate stuff like looking after luggage the next day while we shopped, etc. I'd say the rooms could have been a bit bigger, but for the comfort, quiet, location, and price, it was the best deal I've seen in San Fran for quite a while.

The price through their \"Cheap is Chic\" special on their website was $109, which can't be beat for the central location. THE GOOD: Cheap!! Great Location!! It's within walking distance to everything around Union Square- The square itself, the shopping, the theatres (it's right across the street from one), restaurants, the Market-Powell Cable Car line (takes you to Fisherman's Wharf for $5/one way), Chinatown, Civic Center, Nob Hill, etc. There's a drugstore (it was either a Walgreens or Eckerds) about a block or less away which is convenient and there's a Starbucks right next door. There's also a Borders bookstore several blocks away, about a 6 minute walk. The decor was great (although I did overhear an older couple complaining about how it was \"too modern\"). It's decorated in greys, blues, with punches of orange and a lot of metal (the furniture and \"headboard\") (you can check it out on the website). The room and bathroom were both super clean and well equipped. There are a selection of magazines (NYLON, a local fashion magazine, etc.), the toiletries smell amazing, and there's a cute little welcome bag with freebies and goodies in there like emergen-C, toothpaste, an energy drink sample, Nivea face body cream, etc. There's also a distinct \"DIVA!\" theme or \"personality\" (as they call it) throughout your stay, which may strike some as being over the top and definitely oriented to a young, hip, female crowd. (I thought it was fun and a welcome change from stuffier hotels but my fiance definitely rolled his eyes a couple times). There's a small desk and chair, a comfy bed (super smooth sheets), a dresser (it looks like a lateral file cabinet) and the tv is wall-mounted (like in a hospital). There's an iron and ironing board, safe, and full-length mirror in the closet. The bathroom also had really nice modern fixtures. There are \"offices\" on several floors with a computer and internet access (but no printer). There is also AIR CONDITIONING!! A lot of places in San Francisco don't have air conditioning since it's usually pretty cool but it's nice for the rare \"heat wave\" like the one they had recently. The service is incredible! The concierge was helpful for arranging our transportation to the airport, as well as fielding our questions about the area. THE \"BAD\": Note, most of these observations aren't unique to The Diva since they pretty much apply to any of the boutique hotels in the area. The rooms are small, but any decent hotel in the Union Square area at this price will be small- Even then, it's only really small if there are two people staying in the room. And the decor more than makes up for it. I would rather stay at a nice, clean, modern place than get a larger room in a depressing motel-ish place. Try to get a room away from the street- Our room faced Geary Street and it gets pretty loud at night. Turning on the air conditioning / fan helped mask the noise and it didn't bother my fiance but I slept with earplugs. (It didn't bother me enough to ask for a different room). There's no minifridge and the cable TV options were pretty poor (although, again, you're probably not in Union Square to sit around, eating from your minifridge, and watching a lot of TV! The one thing that was kind of annoying was how dark it was since the lamps weren't that strong. The location is perfectly safe- There are a lot of affluent shops around Union Square so people forget that San Francisco has a huge, HUGE homeless population and a huge, HUGE drug problem. And that it's a pretty dirty city (like NYC dirty but better since there aren't as many people). You may smell the distinct odor of pee on one street and then you'll be standing in front of a swanky shop. You're going to be aware of people asking you for change, food, etc. It's not like you're on the streets of Calcutta, but you'll pretty much see a homeless person or junky on every street. Occasionally, someone might start going crazy and yelling at someone or no one in particular on the street (this happened to me). But there are tons of people out and about (due to the theatre-goers and restaurants and bars) so we felt comfortable, even relatively late at night. Most of the hotels lining Geary street have 24-hour doormen or people at the front desk, which gives you the comforting sense that there are at least several eyes and ears open at all times to the street. Who Will Not Enjoy Union Square / The Diva Hotel: If you are looking for quaint, warm, or traditional, you probably won't like The Diva since you may feel the decor at the hotel is too industrial or \"cold\" and modern. And on a delicate note...If you're part of an \"older crowd\" used to staying at large established chain hotels, you may not like The Diva since it definitely has an almost aggressively youthful \"tone\" which can be interpreted as fun, or annoying, depending on your point of view. Also, like my fiance's parents, if you're going to be uncomfortable staying in an area that is vibrant and centrally located but definitely urban and somewhat seedy looking on some streets and with a population of homeless people and drug addicts, then stay at the hermetically sealed (and very nice but expensive) Westin in the area, or at one of the nice hotels on bucolic Nob Hill (trust me, no panhandlers will be trekking up those ridiculously steep hills).

I was staying for a week on business, so I had to make sure I was going to enjoy it. It looked good, so I booked a room. I ended up getting one towards the inside/back of the hotel, which supposedly is quieter and includes a king beg (vs. a queen bed). One key point to note: this hotel is in one of the best possible locations in downtown SF. Check-in was smooth and the staff was courteous and well-dressed. Actually, most of the clientele tends to be younger and somewhat hip. I think the hotel is trying to go for that anyway, so that's good (I'm a twenty-something myself). I walked into the room, and was disappointed (at first). It was a glorified dorm room. Very small, and you walk RIGHT into it. The bathroom is small, and the sink is outside in the room. On the plus side, I got used to these things rather quickly, and it wasn't a huge deal. One thing to note though: if you leave the door open after taking a shower, the steam will drift into your room, as there is no fan in there (something to keep in mind as you use the bathroom other times). The king size bed is very, very comfy. I've been to the Hard Rock Chicago which sports a king size pillowtop with down bedding and pillows, and Diva definitely took the take. Wireless Internet was wonderful, and seemed to be rather fast most of the time. It's unsecure, just something to keep in mind. SF seems to have free Wi-Fi almost everywhere, though. During my stay, I asked the main clerk working the desk to recommend a good lounge for me. I took his advice, and it turned out pretty well. He also seemed to have a good feel for the area too (doubled as a concierge, I suppose). Check-out was smooth as well, and I was billed correctly. Would I go there again? Probably not, but I don't regret my stay.

Excellent location right on Geary in a perfectly safe neighbourhood. Free internet access was also available and the fitness centre whilst small was very much appreciated. Now, the not so good. If you have a room ending in 20,21 or 22 you will not sleep. These rooms overlook Geary and the hotel has done NOTHING to try and reduce noise. I am used to staying in city hotels, even in SF, but the street noise here was unbelievable. Please, if you are anything other than a very heavy sleeper get a room at the back. Next problem, housekeeping. Being woken up at 745am (when the do no disturb sign was clearly on the door) was not my idea of service, however it got even worse when the next day housekeeping left my door ajar all day. Not good enough - when I contacted the front desk they said they would record the matter and hung up on me. My final problem came when I tried to extend my stay. Whilst they were able to extend my stay one day the hotel was completely booked the next day. Fair enough - it was late notice. However it would have been nice if they had contacted another of the personality hotels and checked with them. all in all the hotel is ok but there are MANY better options in the city.

The TV worked and the range of channels was cool. The internet facilities on my floor worked and the connections were quick. The staff on the front desk were friendly and helpful.

While the internet was nice and convenient and I was happy to get tons of airline miles, the hotel itself left a lot to be desired. The floors creak like you wouldn't believe, and when your \"neighbor\" takes a shower at 6 AM it sounds like a loud freight train, making it impossibile to sleep. Speaking of 6 AM, I must mention the morning they gave me an unrequested wake-up call at 6 on a Saturday. A SATURDAY. The one morning I was able to sleep in and they screwed it up. The room and the entire hotel had this really strange odor which never really went away the whole time I was here, and the TV had far fewer channels than practically every hotel I've stayed at before. The excercise room was okay. Nothing special but it had everything I needed (treadmill and stairmaster) so I can't complain too much about that. As I mentioned, the in-room wireless internet was nice but it sure did break down a bunch, at least twice a day. It was always back up and running an hour or so later, but still an inconvenience. I should also mention that the room was pretty quiet (besides the creaky floors and loud pipes), since they gave me a room that faced the \"courtyard\" instead of Geary Street, but I've heard it can get really loud if you get a room facing the street so definitely keep that in mind if you decide to stay here.

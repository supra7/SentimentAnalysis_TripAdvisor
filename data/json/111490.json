Service was cordial and competent throughout my stay. Check-in was easy and fast. I forgot a couple items, mentioned it to housekeeping, and they were at my door within minutes. Bellmen were quick to give tips and directions. Room was comfortable. It might have felt tight with two people, worked fine solo. Wifi is a nice benefit of being part of the Kimpton Plus program. Of course, it was clean. Public spaces are beautiful. Burn ham is a landmark building, well restored. The Atwood feels like a classic downtown restaurant, fun bar, and accommodating to solo visitors. Fitness room isn't much, a few tired machines in a small space. If a health club is important to you, probably better to go with one of the chains. Location works for business and touring around. It's a few blocks' walk to into the financial district. Heading in the opposite direction, you hit the lake and Millennium Park, and just south of there, the Art Institute. Terrific running for miles along the water. All worked for me. But I can see someone wanting to stay near Watertower Place, Michigan Ave. shopping, and Rush Street saying Burnham's too long a hike, and picking a place north of the Loop. Same as all Kimpton hotels, Burnham is a good deal. Not a budget place, but less than the chains, and way less than the super-luxury places. I liked it a lot, and will stay on my next visit.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cFirst come first served..

I stayed here for four nights and it was one of the worst serviced hotels of my experience. The room was not well maintained and not clean enough. On the first day I was there, even though I put a please clean my room notice on the door, it was not serviced at all. On that same first day, I called for breakfast room service and was told they had no cereal. On another day, it took me 45 minutes and three phone calls to get a juice and a pot of coffee for breakfast. There was a lovely young man at reception who appeared to be constantly on duty.

I took advantage of the late afternoon wine reception, which was a very relaxing and elegant way to end my long day in Chicago. The Starbucks coffee the next morning also was a lovely touch. The lobby and the tile work leading to the stairs were beautiful. Because I was alone & traveling for business, I did not take advantage of the Atwood Cafe, which shares downstairs space with the hotel. It looked gorgeous, and I would have loved to eat there, but I couldn't justify splurging on a meal only to eat it alone in a nice upscale restaurant. I discovered, somewhat belatedly however, that almost right next door is a wonderful little Italian coffee joint/cafe, Lavazza. That was convenient and delicious. The location of the Hotel Burnham is also wonderful -- easy walk to the major sites downtown, and right around the corner from two El stops. I took the El from O'Hare and walked to the hotel -- it couldn't have been easier, and I am not very good at navigating urban transportation systems! My only complaint on the location front, and this was no fault of the hotel, was the group of \"drummers\" who had set up shop on the sidewalks in front of the Macy's. That incessant banging on plastic containers is fine if you hear it briefly as you pass by, but in my room that afternoon and evening, it was like the drums of hell, beating beating beating beating into my brain! Thank goodness they knocked it off around 9:00 before I lost my mind. I used the exercise room while I was there, too. This is always an important feature for me. I was impressed with the quality of the equipment: it was new and the same machines at my gym. Cardio equipment (except the bike) had tvs built into them, so bring your headphones. There were 2 treadmills, an elliptical trainer, and a Spin-style upright bike. There also were free weights and some bands and bosu balls, etc. Towels were provided, and they were fresh and clean; spring water & apples also were provided. The room itself, however, is quite small, so if were being used things might get cozy. I was the only one there for the hour I spent in the morning on Saturday, so I had it all to myself. All in all, I felt pampered and valued at the Hotel Burnham, and I had a fantastic stay. My expectations were exceeded. I wish I had more time to stay and visit Chicago.

Everything from the Atwood Cafe, to the elevators to the opulent hotel lobby features the charm that Chicago is all about. Another huge bonus is the location of the Burnham. You are literally a stones throw from the Lake subway on the red line, another block to the blue line. You can get to either O'hare or Midway airport with ease using public transit if you wish. With the location and decor aside, the main part of this hotel that sets it apart is the service. Whatever we needed at the Hotel Burnham, we got. The front desk was sincere and helpful. The housekeeping staff left personal notes and did an excellent job cleaning up our suite. Everything from check in to check out had a personal touch that you just can't get at a Radisson or major hotel chain. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed the nightly wine receptions. This hotel exceeds any experience I've had at a city hotel, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Bend, IN", "Title": "\u201cNutcracker Dreams\u201d", "Author": "SuzyQSB", "ReviewID": "UR122299731", "Content": "I was in Chicago for one night during Christmas week to attend the Joffrey Ballet.

The room was small but entirely charming and perfect for short stays. THe bed was comfortable, the entire hotel was clean and full of character, it's in a phenomenal location (we went to the Christmas market in Daley plaza) with plenty of shopping and restaurant options and it's a short 3 block walk to Grant Park and the attractions near it. The staff were some of the friendliness I've ever encountered. Valet was quick and non-problematic. The restaurant was small and cozy. Be prepared for complimentary hot cocoa with marshmallows upon arrival in the winter, complimentary Starbucks coffee in the morning in the lobby, and a wine hour in the evening. They offer a number of complimentary items if you forget (including a humidifier and heating pad), and others for a nominal fee (between $2-$4). The room had plush robes and sock slippers, a nicely stocked minibar, a mini safe, and great Aveda shampoo/conditioner/lotion/soap products in the bathroom. The only negatives were that there isn't a lot of room in the front for valet parking and the bathroom is small with a small shower and an odd placement of the door! Also, there IS internet but it's not free and there are no special bells and whistles like an iPod docking station or in-room coffee pot.

We were anxious to try the Burnham because of the building's history and detailed restoration, and because it is situated in the Loop, the downtown area of Chicago that has so many interesting buildings (our favourites--the Rookery and Mies van der Rohe's two Federal Buildings and Post Office branch), plus some of our favourite haunts--Millennium Park, the Art Institute, Chicago Cultural Center and Chicago Architectural Foundation. The Burnham is housed in the Reliance Building, built in 1895 by Burnham and Root (who also designed the Rookery), and Atwood. The building, one of the first steel-framed skyscrapers in the city, housed retail shopping and professional offices. By the 1940's, the building was in disrepair. The city reclaimed the building in 1994 and began its loving and meticulous restoration; by 1999, it was the Hotel Burnham, a Kimpton hotel. In my opinion, some of the Kimpton brand's style elements can be a bit kitschy, but this has been toned down a bit at the Burnham in deference to its historical elements. It was quite fortuitous that the Chicago Architectural Foundation offered a guided tour of the hotel on the day we checked in--we received our keys literally 5 minutes before the tour began. It became quite clear how historically accurate the restoration project attempted to be--what could not be salvaged and restored was reproduced using old photos and what not. The attention to detail is amazing--the wrought iron work around the elevators (which were originally open cages), the mosaic tile floor by the elevators, the several varieties of marble and the way the veins in each slab are mitered to match adjacent slabs, the preservation and reproduction of a quatrefoil design element (a stylized four leaf clover) in fixtures throughout, the restoration of the original doors and frosted glass windows (now opaqued for privacy) in the guest halls as well as the marble wainscoting and mahogany trim. Even the guest room door knobs have \"Reliance\" on them, plus the original mail slots and ornamented hinges. Our room, a king, was on the top (15th) floor, so we were able to admire the exterior terra-cotta tiles not only on the sides of the building but on the underside of the roof as well. The room's \"Chicago window\"--a large central pane with 2 smaller panes on each side, allowed in plenty of light. Looking down Washington St., we could catch a glimpse of Frank Gehry's Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park, with the Lake beyond. The room was not large, but comfy. The robes were leopard or tiger print. If you join Kimpton's In Touch Program, you get free Wifi, plus $10 credit from the minibar. There is some noise from the CTA trains. There is what seems to be an original marble staircase with wrought iron railings from floors 7-15. If you are interested in the hotel's more historic elements, I would recommend a room on floors 8 and above, which seem to have more of the original fixtures intact. The hotel has a small fitness room. The \"business center\" is a computer and printer in the hall in the basement (per minute fees). There is coffee and tea in the morning in the lobby, and a wine reception nightly. The Atwood Cafe is open for all meals and seems most popular at lunch. We tried it for dinner one night and were not terribly impressed by the food, although the space itself and decor are charming. If you are a Rick Bayless fan, he has a tortas place in Macy's across the street, in its fancy food court on the 7th floor. Hotel staff was uniformly friendly and outgoing.

Our room, on the second floor, was lovely. The appointments were luxurious. We enjoyed the Aveda products in the bathroom, the well-priced gourmet snacks in the mini-bar, the comfortable desk, the chaise lounge, and the lovely curtains, linens, and upholstery.

We are reasonable and understand that the bed is under the Burnham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control, the parking garage is not. We got used to the bed, but the first night was a bit restless. The historic features and fixtures are enjoyable and make for a unique experience, but the attention to detail in the here and now are what really makes the Burnham a standout. Easily reachable from the airports by rail, the Burnham is centrally located to all the best in downtown Chicago. It was a five minute walk to Millennium Park, another ten minutes through the park to the Art Institute, a ten minute bus ride from the Burnham to the Shay Aquarium and Adler Planetarium, a fifteen minute walk to the river and a fifteen minute walk to the lakeshore. We had to take a taxi at night to and from Navy Pier, but the flagship Marshall Field (now Macy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) was caddy corner on Washington and State Streets. The Burnham has a restaurant named the Atwood Caf\u00c3\u00a9. We dined there one evening for dessert and one morning for breakfast. The food was good and so was the service and setting.

There are also a few areas in need of minor improvement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from my perspective as both interior designer and traveler. I must say the location and the building itself are terrific! The hotel occupies a renovated office building built in 1895 and many beautiful architectural features remain. We stayed in suite 804 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c below is the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s old office door and the charming 8th floor elevator lobby. The common areas on the first floor are equally beautiful. The small lobby hosts a wine reception each evening, a Kimpton trademark. I adore the orange chairs! Note the contrast welt and cutout back on the lobby sofa. Details make a difference! The largest rooms/suites at the Burnham feature a bedroom and living space, separated by French doors. Unfortunately, the French doors only have sheer curtains, so anyone trying to sleep in the bedroom is subjected to light from the living area. The king bed is very comfortable. There is a canopy of sorts over the bed, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have any relationship to the room, although it does camouflage the smoke detector and sprinkler head. The ceilings are quite high, adding volume to a small floor space (the French doors scrape along the side of the bed as you try to close them). The left corner quarter-round side table is stylishly delightful, but the lamps in both rooms appear under-scale. The seating area features a fabulous mirror and a tiny settee. Sadly, the settee is uncomfortable for one person, and impossible for two! The only other seat in the room is the desk chair. Also, that little settee does not turn into a pull-out, which seems a lost opportunity for flexibility, especially for a hotel as friendly to children as the Burnham. The bathroom is very small but well appointed. Aveda toiletries elevate the experience. Of course, the trademark Kimpton animal print robes are at hand.Suite 804 had windows on two sides, both with excellent downtown views. The hotel is easy walking distance to many Chicago attractions, including Millenium Park, the Cloud Gate (jellybean) and the Jay Pritzger Pavilion, seen in the background below. Service at the hotel is generally quite good and always friendly. The restaurant, Atwood Cafe, serves a wonderful breakfast. Service here was outstanding in the morning. In the evening, we did have dinner here once, and service was not as good. Also, the menu is fairly eclectic, making it tricking to feed a picky young diner. There are better nearby options for dinner if you are traveling with young children, but adults would thoroughly enjoy the fare. Any place that serves up Red Velvet Cookie Dough for dessert is worth a try in my book! One personal difficulty at the Atwood: the banquette seating at the tables closest to the windows. It's hard to see in the picture below, but the banquettes look terrific with an asymmetrical back. Unfortunately, the lower side of that back provides zero support for diners and hit my back at a painfully low height. Just a word of caution for anyone above average height. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Burnham. However, after a week, the room issues I mentioned were looming large for our party of three. I do recommend the hotel, but would myself opt for a larger space in another hotel next time. The Burnham's rooms are ideally suited to a maximum of two travelers.

But if you can appreciate the beauty of a lovingly restored Chicago landmark and value service above all else, this will be a perfect fit. Among the many ways the staff went above and beyond: my husband & I visited for our anniversary and had reservations to dine in the hotel's Atwood Cafe (which is very good). My husband can't drink alcohol so I went down to the bar in the morning to ask if they served non-alcoholic beer so we could toast each other at dinner. It turns out they did not have any. I asked if I could bring my own and gentleman behind the bar said they would procure some for us by supper time. About an hour later I asked to speak to the manager so I could tell him how impressed I was by the staff's willingness to get the NA beer for our dinner that evening and he said \"Oh ma'am, we already picked it up - it's chilling in the refrigerator and will be ready when you dine with us\". Now how's THAT for service? It used to be that when I traveled to Chicago I found the cheapest rates on Expedia and stayed wherever it sent me. That's how I found the Hotel Burnham. However, after having stayed there the first time, it is now the ONLY hotel my husband & I stay in when we visit Chicago even though we can find better rates elsewhere. We have now stayed there several times and the service has never disappointed and the rooms are always clean, airy, and neat. The hotel is also conveniently located a few blocks from the Art Institute , the opera house, Millenium Park and a manageable walk to the Miracle Mile as well as other local attractions.

I booked a room at The Burnham as the Palomar (in which I have stayed in twice this spring) was full. The location is still good for tourists. The hotel is located in the Loop area blocks from Millennium Park and the Geary stage, near the Art Institute, and close to all the major museums and aquarium. Nordstrom Rack next door, and Starbucks a few doors down. The hotel is a great historic building and so the room sizes vary. I paid and signed up for a Kimpton upgrade online. I was told it was granted (via email) but surprisingly when I checked in at 6:30 pm, the room I was given was smaller than the rooms I typically have occupied at this hotel. It was the smallest double I have ever seen!! It certainly was NOT an upgrade and when I mentioned it to the front desk that it was a low floor, no view, and really tiny, they said it was all they had. I found out later that it wasn't the case and another employee admitted it wasn't an upgrade and the hotel wasn't full. I don't know if I was given such a dinky room since I checked in so late in the day, but I had business meetings since my arrival on a 8:30 am flight that morning and didn't have time to come to the hotel earlier. I had to remind the staff that I was a Kimpton In Touch member and ask for the coupon that usually is handed to a member on arrival. They tried to tell me I wasn't an In Touch member (which I found funny since I had stayed in a Kimpton hotel twice in May--Chicago and DC) but they finally located the envelope addressed to me with the coupon. They didn't apologize. I spent the evening outside the hotel at a private party and then dinner--at RL which is one of my all time favorites. When we returned, I wanted to go have drinks with my sister and found out that the hotel restaurant and bar closes at 10 pm. Since it wasn't busy, apparently they were closing at 9:45 pm instead--it seemed rather early for a Friday night.--and couldn't give us a glass of wine to take to our rooms. So I asked the front desk for a recommendation but they said they didn't know anything in the area that was open. So I asked about room service--thinking we would order a bottle of wine. The person at the desk said his colleague (who was standing next to him) handles room service and referred me to him. Problem was that the colleague was on a personal phone call right at the desk! I literally waited over 4 minutes listening to him talk to his friends loudly and finally just gave up and went upstairs. I was only there 1 night (flew in for business, checked in at 6:30 pm, immediately left the hotel for dinner and returned at 9:30 pm and then checked out the next morning and went to O'Hare) so it didn't really matter but I will not be staying at this Kimpton in Chicago again. I admit I am disappointed as I used to love this hotel and raved about it to friends, but the service seems to have fallen. Don't get me wrong, the hotel is adequate but merely average. I stay in Kimpton hotels around the country and their standard is so high, that the average stands out as below the bar. Next time I will be staying at the Chicago Palomar whose service is up to the usual fantastic Kimpton standard.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redondo Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding all around!\u201d", "Author": "allthegoodonesaregon", "ReviewID": "UR115264319", "Content": "The hotel itself is an amazing piece of history and wonderfully renovated while still maintaining the original charm.

I never received any confirmations as promised and after the second day, I called and was transferred 4 times, cut off, and received a recorded prompt to leave a voice message. In a professional and courteous manner, I did just that. Four hours later, no call back from the hotel. I then called back on three occasions and it seems like everyone is a manager when you ask for one. Another important aspect of this is was the fact that I was booking direct through the hotel and not via a third party which can cause conflicts. I am shocked frankly. A four star hotel messes up reservations placed on a credit card twice. Then to top everything, when I went to book the rooms, the special group rate of $118.50 per room jumps to $190 and the arrogant representative on the line states, that is the best I can do. Luckily, I went to another hotel a block away, received rates for $90 for a better upscale hotel, and received an email confirmation within minutes.

I am from New York City and have never been to Chicago. There is lots to do (too much for one weekned) and it is a beautiful place full of nice people! I chose the Hotel Burnham based on trip advisor reviews and I liked that it was a historical building. The place is really beautiful. I loved our rooms. They may be a little small but I have never had a very huge hotel in the middle of a city before. The beds were really comfy and the ceilings were high. The room felt really cosy and elegant. Also at night you didnt hear any kind of street noise. Really awesome considering we were on what is considered a busy street! This hotel is in \"the loop.\" Like I said I have never been to Chicago so I had no idea what all these neighborhoods meant. What was the difference between magnificent mile and the loop? or lincoln park? well... the loop is the business center/ theater center. it is also right next to Millenium park which is a nice place to walk around. chicago isnt that large so you can walk around to just about any area and the subway is really easy to navigate so that is a big plus. There was plenty of \"regular\" shopping such as H&M, oldnavy, walgreens, macys (marshall fields), gap, ny and co, and more. If you want highend shopping you go to magnificent mile. The staff was so friendly and welcoming. Reginald greeted us and after we checked in gave us the tour of the room! The staff seems small (which is a great bonus to being in a boutique hotel) because they all knew who we were and we knew them. They were all really helpful with recommending places to eat, calling for reservations, and giving directions on where to go. When my moms wallet was lost they looked up phone numbers of the taxi companies so I could call and see if it was found. The hotel has a small gym but it was up to date and never crowded. The restuarant Atwood cafe had very busy lunch and dinners filled with locals. We only ate a breakfast there. It was good and really pretty inside.", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clinton, IA", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel.

The room was clean, however there were stains on the cover of the chaise lounge. The hotel has the history of being a medical office building that was converted into a hotel. The coversion was done well and gives the small hotel a unique ambience. Each room had been a doctors office or suite (ask about the connection to Al Capote).

The hotel was quiet with a slight buzz of outdoor activity during the day as you'd expect in any city hotel. The bed was comfortable, and the room had a thermostate with a specific tempeture setting. The disappointments included a lukewarm shower each morning and a bad television (very dark picture on an old fashion anlog TV) which could not be seen unobstructive over your feet as you lay in bed. (I did not complain about the water tempeture thinking that it would be corrected each day). Yes they have free coffee in the lobby but for some strange reason it is removed prompty at 9 or 9:30 am, and there is no coffee in the rooms. They have a strange policy of hanging communal ladies under garments - leopard printed teddy and panties - in your closet for use by the guest. This has to be the strangest hotel perk I've ever seen.

The physicality of the hotel stands out: it is stunningly gorgeous and its meticulous renovation (it is a historical site formerly known as the Reliance Building) shines. Elegant, exposed wrought iron stairs, marble wainscotting, and period light fixtures all add to its understated elegance. The standard electronic room keys were replaced by keys on brass rings. The rooms are attractive and spotless (many have chaise lounges in the bay window), cozy but not cramped, and are equipped with stereos, and, by request, a goldfish for the lonely traveler. The curtains are elegant, sporting excerpts from Mozart scores. Newspapers appear at your door, gratis, free morning coffee is available in the lobby, and there is a daily complimentary wine hour which features quality wines. Wake-up calls are performed by the staff rather than the electronic way, adding a human touch. The staff will also print your boarding pass! While the hotel is a quiet one (I am sensitive to noise), I would recommend requesting a room on a higher floor (above 7) that faces Washington Street since State Street often has street performing drummers.

The hotel is located downtown, within minimal walking distance to subway stops, the public Library, Millenium Plaza, and the Museum of Art. My first experience wasn't very positive. I had called to verify that a crib would set up in a room and I was told the reservation was only for two adults and that there was no way they could add a child to the room. The woman stated there were no other rooms available and it was against policy to put a crib in the room, yet after speaking to management they decided that by raising the room rates they could accomodate us in that room. In the end we spent 299.00 a night before fees and taxes for 3 nights and 209.00 a night for our final night. So needless to say I didn't go in thinking this would be a smooth visit but fortunately the staff that we encountered were all very friendly and professional. When we checked in we were actually allowed to go to our room early. The rooms aren't huge but it was larger than I expected. The building is a converted office building so it's architechturally very interesting. There are a few downsides to the building- the elevators are VERY slow and at night we could hear a lot of traffic and sirens coming from outside the windows. Forget renting a car and parking it. First of all there is nowhere to park downtown unless you are willing to shell out an arm and leg. It was over 40.00 a day to park at our hotel. It was much more reasonable to utilize the subway system and taxicabs out to things like the Shedd Museum and Aquarium. The restaurant downstairs frankly wasn't worth the prices. There are far better places to eat, all within walking distance of the hotel. You can sometimes print coupon deals off the Kimpton website to get the continental breakfast for just 1.00. Considering it was over 13.00 for a bowl of fruit, piece of bread and glass of juice the coupon is an excellent deal. The bartenders were friendly and the service was quick but it was 23.00 for one glass of Champagne and a small Bloody Mary- not including tip. Overall we were pleased with the hotel. The crib was very nice- it was an actual crib instead of just a pack and play. We did learn that some of our friends stayed at a place down the road that was just as nice and far less expensive so I do believe that next time we might have to check them out.

When I opened my window to ask if this was the right spot, it took a minute to get someone's attention, even though there were two doorman and another uniformed attendant standing about three feet away! When I parked and got out, nobody offered to help with my luggage, and I had to wait in line for at least five minutes in the freezing cold to get a ticket for my car. The valet attendant was definitely on the rude side. But thankfully, it all got better once I walked into the hotel. The lobby is tall and beautiful in the art deco style. The front desk attendant was friendly and quick getting me checked in. A bellman took my bag and led me upstairs, giving me an orientation to the hotel along the way and then getting me settled into my room. They use actualy keys here, not key cards! I had chosen a queen deluxe suite since the rooms looked small, and I am glad I spent the extra money! I ended up in room 1003, which was on the State Street side of the hotel, right on the corner of Washington. I had two bay windows, one of which looked right down Washington Street to Millenium Park and the lake! The living area had a comfortable love seat and chair with ottoman, coffee table, closet, end table, and armoire with TV, CD/tape player/stereo, and honor bar. French doors led to the bedroom area which had a small bedside table, desk & chair, TV, and dresser. The bathroom was down a short hall off the bedroom and was small but nice and had Aveda products. The bed was definitely one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel, and there was a selection of pillows so I didn't even end up with a crick in my neck from sleeping on flat pillows! The shower head was high, so there was also no backbend for washing my hair. The window curtains were heavy, so except for a few cracks around the edges, it was nice and dark for sleeping. I could hear some traffic noise and drums from a sidewalk performer, as well has the whoosh of the el, which is one block over, but it didn't disturb me at all. If you sign up for their free Kimpton In Touch program, you also get free wi-fi. The connection felt quick and smooth. I ordered room service for dinner, which comes up from the Atwood Cafe downstairs. The prices were typical for hotel room service, but the food was delicious, and the service was fast! They had told me 25-30 minutes, but it arrived in 15 minutes. I felt safe walking the block over to the Oriental Theatre and back at night. Checking out was also quick and easy with another very friendly desk clerk, and they had my car pulled up to the curb in only a few moments. They also loaded my bag in the car this time, and the attendants seemed much more attentive than they had the night before. I will definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to just about anyone!", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel in Chicago!\u201d", "Author": "MrsWalsh", "ReviewID": "UR27498820", "Content": "I have been lucky enough to have gotten this hotel via priceline three times and now i'd pay whatever to stay here.

My mother and I came to celebrate her 60th and my 37th birthdays with a fun filled weekend of theater ('Wicked' which was spectacular) and endless shopping! Because we came at Christmas time (Dec. 12th-14th) the hotel was beautifully decorated with a sparkling Christmas tree and my mother couldn't get over how thick and gorgeous the wreaths were spread through out the hotel, just lovely. Our view was amazing, we stayed in room 302 and sat for hours just watching all the shoppers rush back and forth on State Street...so much fun! Everyone that works here is polite and wonderful, especially Taka, Anthony and Reggie. There was another gentleman who accomodated us by bumping us up to a room with two beds which helped us to sleep more comfortably, but unfortunately I neglected to get his name, but it was because of him that our stay was even better than expected! My mother commented that the bed and pillows (which by the way...they have a pillow \"Library\" TOO CUTE) were so soft and she hadn't slept that good in her life, which really made me happy! I only have a few MINOR complaints that may or may not make a difference to some who are contemplating on staying here. The towels are NOT soft at all - in fact they are hard and scratchy, which for this level of hotel was extremely disappointing (I've had nicer towels at the Comfort Inn!). I forgot my cell phone in the car the night before so I had to use the phone in our room to call across the street, they charged me a $1 per local call which is RIDICULOUS because I don't know any hotels that charge for local calls anymore! But after I had let them know that even at 4 star hotels in Paris I was not charged for local calls they removed the charges. Then upon returning to our room late in the day we were happy to see that our room was cleaned and straightened beautifully, but that they left dirty towels in the shower and on the towel rod. I just think if you're going to clean it, then do it all the way, it was just weird. Especially because the woman left a notecard with her first and last name on it stating that if we needed ANYTHING at all to let her know (which from my younger years of working in the service industry means \"it's okay to leave me a tip for my services\") which would have been fine had she accomplished her job completely, don't ask for a tip if you are not going to finish the job completely. Needless to say my mother and I had a WONDERFUL time and will DEFINITELY be back again.

The hotel is in the heart of the loop--at the corner of State and Washington. Given its location, I was a bit concerned that it would be too busy, or too loud. I found none of this to be true. Instead, when you walk in the doors, the enticing yet compact lobby really silenced the outside. If you are looking for a grand ballroom of a lobby, this is not your place; but I never felt cramped as I enjoyed their beautiful furniture. The whole building is Old Chicago style with strong touches of Art Deco throughout. Every touch was perfect--and the choice to keep the upper floors true to the original design of the building was genius. Not only was the decor beautiful, the beds were comfortable, the shower and amenities (L'Occitaine) were upscale and the internet was fast and had wireless options. The free wine reception in the evening was a great plus and got you ready to head out for a nice dinner. The hotel's location is perfect for walking or taking the EL to your dinner/entertainment destination, and it is only a leisurely 10 minute stroll to the lake. The free Starbucks coffee and tea in the morning was a kind way to smooth me into my day and the breakfast in the hotel restaurant was good fare that came quickly to our table. When we were informed that the gym was undergoing renovations, we were initially upset--but before that could settle in, the front desk staff immediately told us that all of their guests could use the gym at a sister hotel (another Kimpton property 3 blocks away). Since exercise was the goal, we were happy to walk there--and were treated well by that staff. Overall, this is a very nice boutique hotel. Details are a priority here and the staff is some of the best I have encountered. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!!\u201d", "Author": "beachyluv", "ReviewID": "UR19078260", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just returned from a wonderful weekend stay at the Hotel Burnham.

Everything else was top-notch. The staff greeted me with a warm hello whenever I walked in and told me to \"enjoy your evening\" when I walked out. I ordered room service one night while I was there and they sent up a complimentary dessert! Granted it was a chocolate mousse-type dessert, so it was probably due to them having a few extra and the dessert generally not storing well. But it was a nice gesture at any rate. And it was a tasty treat! As for the photos people have attached on this site, they do not do the Burnham justice at all. It is a very nice place! Marble everywhere, very clean, great restaurant, good water pressure /hot water...like I said, everything was great. And the location is just about as good as you could ask for. As for the internet...I connected via broadband plug the first night to what is listed as \"complimentary internet\" and was promptly charged a $10 access fee to my room. This charge terminated my internet the next evening and did something to my laptop so that it would no longer connect to the internet at all. I called their tech support line (which is not in the city) and they spent a great deal of time trying to get it working again. It started working (ie, connected to Google) and they hung up.. I attempted to go to hotmail and it cut out and would not connect again...I called tech support and the next guy told me just to \"wait and try again in 45 minutes or so\" . I even attempted to use the wireless in the lobby but my laptop wouldnt' connect to their service at all (I have never had any wireless problem EVER). I assume that since they charge a $10 fee per night for internet access (although it is supposed to be complimentary) if you don't pay for ALL your nights at the same time, the system somehow excludes you from using the internet again...a poorly designed glitch.

We had a King Deluxe room that included a comfortable bed with your pillow types of choice, a comfortable sized bathroom with L'Occitane bath products. There was a desk with free internet access. There was a mini bar and refridgerator. Not a lot of storage areas though. We were on the 11th floor and we even had a sliver view of the lake. Our first visit at this hotel included impeccable service at every level. The staff was very welcoming and went out of their way to make our stay more comfortable and enjoyable. I ordered flowers via the concierge to be in our room when they arrived. The hotel added chocolates and a nice bottle of red wine. The hotel itself was very peaceful...great for afternoon naps. Room service orders arrived in 15 minutes like clockwork. The hotel's restaurant, Atwood Cafe, served excellent food. The best Cobb salad that I've had. We paid $176/nt...a rate that I found on Travelocity which the hotel price matched. I highly recommend this hotel. It is centrally located near Millenium Park on the corner of Washington & State St. Great if you'll be visiting the Art Institute. Cab rides weren't more than $5 to $7. Only downside was the L is only two blocks away and you could hear it at night...nothing a glass of wine or a Benedryl didn't solve though. Great choice for a romatic getaway.

Now the Hotel Burnham prides itself on being old school. In other words, it doesn't try to blow you away with a fancy, decked-out lobby. They stick to long time standards that still work today. Like great guest service and hospitality. They've conserved the building that has been around for many, many years but it's so cozy. The restaurant in the lobby was real good. Parking is sky high so don't try driving in. Besides, you really don't need a car if you're staying in and around Chicago. Especially downtown. My room was small but again, that's to be expected in an older building. I still felt comfortable and the area was nice and clean. During my stay (April 2008), renovations were going on downstairs so I advise you to request a room as high as you can get. My 10th floor location was good enough. The location is hard to beat. Right next door there is a Walgreens and if you bank at Bank of America, they are only 2 doors down. Not bad! Millenium Park is across the street and you can pretty much walk to most of downtown.

We considered it a great value for such a charming and well located hotel in Chicago. The Burnham is relatively small, but the hotel is very pretty and has a classic look. The lobby is quite small but cozy, and there is a complimentary wine reception there from 5-6 pm everyday. Most of the lobby area is taken up by the Atwood Cafe, which is a very popular (and expensive) place to eat. The hotel maintains many of the original touches from when it was built in 1895, like marble stairs, doorknobs, and iron work. Kimpton Hotels made it into the Burnham in 1999. The decor is modern feeling but not overwhelming; just cozy and inviting. Our room was a standard queen on the 10th floor. The bed was nice and the view was impressive: our huge windows overlooked the corner of State and Washington, including Marshall Fields and the Chicago Theater. The bathroom was tiny and the tv and radio were a little dated, but these were not negatives for us. Everything was very clean, and the bath amenities were L'Occitane. People have complained about construction noise from the huge project going on across the street. We stayed directly overlooking the construction and didn't hear a thing. Not only that, but Looptopia was going on below us late at night and we were not disturbed at all. I was worried about this a little, but no issues to report. The location is excellent for shopping, bus and train access, and walking to and from Millennium Park/Michigan Ave. The only complaints we had are: one of the elevators broke down the Saturday we were there, which made it impossible to get down from the 10th floor. We had to walk down the stairs all day. Also, the business center is way overpriced (although wired internet is free in your room). Ultimately, these things kept us from giving the Burnham 5 stars, but this a strong 4-star hotel in our mind.

On this occassion, I had back-to-back meetings (Mon-Tues) and did not want to return home only to head back to the Loop a few hours later. I found a great price at the Hotel Burnham. My room was small (queen-size bed, tiny bathroom), but the location was only three blocks from my office and the quality was much more than I expected. I was impressed by their attention to detail (\"I see you've requested a quite room, I have a room that's very quite, but there is no view, which would you prefer?\"). The NY Times outside my door and complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby was a nice touch. Since my needs really only included a place to \"crash\" for the night, this hotel exceeded my expectations and I'd recommend it to anyone needing a great place to stay in the Loop. The only recommendation I have for hotel management is to add dead bolts to the locks on the doors.

My fear was I had read that the construction was going on and that it might be loud and a problem. How wrong I was on that count as my gamble paid off and we got as a great reward and an increadible experience. It is a Kimpton property so it should come as no surprise that the customer service was top notch and that the hotel and rooms were unique to say the least. We stayed on the 10 floor and had two rooms a corner queen and a king room. The queen was smaller than what I expected but having stayed in New York it was not a prison cell either. The Queen rooms are smaller but the one we had was a longer than wide and made use of that space in ways that the cookie cutter chains just cannot do. The bed and canopy was great and the bathroom was roomy enough for us but not huge either. The king room my folks stayed in was considerably larger but no less unique. It was not a corner room so it was more square than retangle queen room but if space is a concern the price for the king is not that much more. They only had the king and queen available so that is what we took but my finace and I loved the queen room though smaller but we spent so much time on the go that it was a cozy spot to curl up after a long night on the town. If size is a concern go king but I am a big guy and we had several bags and liked the queen room and it's corner location. We had a delay to retrieve our bags at O'hare following the Cubs game and had only about 40 minutes to check in and change and get to Soldier Field for the Sunday night Bears Cowboys game following our treck back to the airport. They zipped us in and got our bags upstairs in no time and had a cab waiting for us upon our return downstairs for the game. We made it just in time for kickoff and a Cowboys win! I cannot say enough about the staff and all their help and recomendations. Even at night when the street work was going on they let the cabs around the barracade to the front door. It is a very short walk to the red line and another block to the blue, perfect for seeing the town. The building takes you back in time and I almost felt like I was in a black in white movie with the old window type doors and the iron works on the walls. I really do not have the words to describe just how unique the building and hotel is but maybe this is the best way to put it. The Burnham is a true \"old school\" gem with the touches of 2007.

The Burnham's staff members have always been extremely gracious and helpful. This is my favorite Kimpton property in Chicago - the Hotel Allegro and Hotel Monaco are nice, but the Burnham is an extra step up. One caveat: it's an old building, so the rooms aren't huge. The building has great character and everything is spotlessly clean and modern, so to me the room size isn't as much of an issue. You also won't be in the prime shopping district, but it's very easy to take the bus or a cab (or a long walk) up to the shops on North Michigan Avenue. It's fun to do the walk all the way up Michigan Avenue, so bring some comfortable shoes and enjoy the scenery!

Upon arrival via taxi from Midway airport, we were greeted by Reggie, who took our luggage and directed us to the front desk. Check in was extremely polite and very fast. Reggie then showed us to our room on the 14th floor (of 15). He detailed a bit of the history of the hotel, and pointed out the various amenities. Our room overlooked State and Washington streets with a full view of Macy's (Marshall Fields) flagship store, the old Chicago Theatre (pretty at night, see pics) and in the distance the Marina City towers and the State Street bridge over the river. The room was adequate in size (bigger than we expected) with a queen bed, settee by the window, entertainment unit with stocked honor bar. It also featured a very nice Panasonic radio/CD player with quality sound. A desk was bedside with free high speed internet connectivity. The entry way/foyer allowed room for setting up the provided iron. A hairdryer was also provided. A safe took space on the floor of the closet, and was large enough to hold an oversized laptop computer, a good sized camera, and just about anything else we wished to put inside. The bathroom was of economy size, but was immaculate, and provided L'Occitane toiletries. The linens and towels were of high quality, and they weren't stingy with them. Temperature control was individual per room also. The hotel itself (outside of the room) was amazing. The detail, and history provided a nice sense of time and place. It was built in 1895 as an office building and was one of the original skyscapers in Chicago (post fire I guess?). The trim, iron works, lighting, and carpeting were all wonderful. Starbucks coffee was provided every morning in the lobby, and there was a wine tasting available every day at 5pm. The sitting area was small but quaint. The on site restaurant (The Atwood Cafe) always seemed to draw a crowd. Other than breakfast or drinks at the bar, however, we did not dine here. The breakfast, albeit pricey, was large and fulfilling and the service was a step above. A special notice should be made as to the service we received at every turn. From the doormen to the front desk, concierge, room attendants, and restaurant, we were made to feel welcome and that our business mattered to them even though the site was full all week. Very special thanks to Reggie, Alyssa, Keith, David, Antwon and Gus. The noise mentioned in earlier posts does occur, but we found it minor and not consistent through the trip. There is a new tower being built right across the street from the rooms facing Washington/State, but it is now reaching 20+ stories in height. Most of the noise came from the construction at road level on the street. The experience here was excellent and we highly recommend this hotel. Everything was in walking distance or a very short cab ride. Two thumbs up. Tips: Food: Cafe Iberico on N LaSalle. GREAT Tapas. VTK (Vong's Thai Kitchen) Lou Mitchell's for a classic Chicago Breakfast - All eggs double yolked! Sites: The Art Institute of Chicago - Could spend several days here.

It can be quite loud day or night and one simply cannot count on much tranquility. There were jackhammers in the afternoon and quite a lot of banging at 2AM.

I generally prefer boutique hotels to boring corporate places, but this property didn't have enough charm to compensate for its shortcomings. The location is pretty good; in the loop, close to many office towers and on the same block as discount shopping (Nordstrom Rack, H&M, Sears, etc.). However, it is also across the street from a very large construction site, and that street is reduced to one lane. When my cab from the airport dropped me off, it briefly blocked off traffic completely, resulting in a symphony of honking. Check-in was fast and easy - I asked for a quiet room, and the friendly clerks gave me a room with a queen bed \"facing away from the street.\" What they did not mention was that it faced an airshaft. That evening, it wasn't much of a problem, but by the next morning, I had to ask to be switched to a room with more natural light. The desk staff on that occasion and subsequent occasions were polite, but not particularly warm or welcoming. The common spaces are nice; a small lobby, partitioned from a restaurant. The first floor I stayed on did not have any historical or architectural hallway touches; the second floor did, and the lamps, doors, and trims were indeed quite pretty. The biggest problem I had with this hotel was that the rooms were quite small. I'm from New York - I have a very high tolerance for small spaces. The reason both rooms I stayed in (like most of the hotel's rooms) had a queen bed was that a king-sized bed would not have fit. Indeed, there was only enough room on either side of the bed in both rooms for small shelves, rather than nightstands. I looked on the emergency exit maps on both floors, wondering if my rooms were substantially smaller than others, but they appeared to be average size. The rooms were high-ceilinged and nicely furnished in gold and royal blue, with gorgeous drapes and velvet throws, as well as several mirrors (likely to make the rooms seem larger). The room had good high-speed internet (not wireless) for $10. The first of the rooms did not have a desk lamp, and because the room was so dim, I very much needed one to do any work at the desk. The bathrooms were less impressive - utilitarian furnishings at best, with scuffed wallpaper. The bathroom in the first room had only a pedestal sink - there was simply no place to put toiletries at all. The bed was very comfortable and the bedlinens were quite nice, but the bathtowels were skimpy. Regular room service ended at 10pm, and although the hotel had 24-hour room service, the late night menu was horribly skimpy, consisting of a soup, a sandwich, about 2 salads, and a few small snacks. The room service fellow helpfully brought up a menu for one local place that delivered a full menu until late at night - but it had a one-hour wait for delivery. The food from both the hotel's late night menu and the full menu (ordered the next evening) was okay, but not great. Before I arrived at the hotel, I had booked rooms at it for a few nights on consecutive weeks, based on these reviews. After I got home from the first stay, I canceled the second stay. The main reason I canceled was that I knew I'd be arriving late again and couldn't stand the idea of eating the same late night room service. If I did go back, however, it would only be to stay in one of the hotel's few king bed suites - the queen rooms are just plain too small. One last concern. The elevators are also accessible from a doorway to the street that was not visible from the lobby or the front desk. In addition, in keeping with the historic furnishings, the doors opened with plain keys rather than card keys, and there were no safety chains or bars inside the doors.

They also had us on a pet-friendly floor - so presumably you could also make sure you were on a floor without animals if you had allergies or something. The pet friendly rooms did not smell wierd or have anything wrong with them, they seemed just like all their other rooms - just, presumably, away from people who didn't want to be by animals! The location is fantastic - you could walk to all the great downtown spots from here, and you are smack in the middle of the theatre district. The rooms are small - but have very high ceilings and practically floor to ceiling windows, so they feel much larger than they are. Nicely decorated, that is the Kimpton hotel \"thing\" - all their properties are funky, boutique, edgy but always comfortable. Great bed at the Burnham, which I have luckily also had when staying at other properties of theirs. We didn't eat at the restaurant because we had other plans for our meals while there, but it was always full of people and the menu looked appealing. Staff was very friendly, even when our dog woofed at those wearing hats (she's a Shepherd mix, what else can I say?) and helpful (with directions and similar). We paid $152 + tax and valet parking - and again I think this is one of the best values for the money in downtown Chicago. We have stayed at a number of downtown hotels over the years - and (with or without our dog), this is definitely a hotel we would come back to next time.", "Date": "December 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston, ma", "Title": "\u201cpretty nice\u201d", "Author": "1234554321", "ReviewID": "UR6317397", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights this past week.

She was in a conference and I was on my own to sight-see during the day. Paul, the Concierge and all of the Front Desk staff were exceptionally helpful to me with planning where to go and what to see. They had numerous suggestions ranging from inexpensive to pricier ideas. All were well thought out and fun to do. One of our favorite and cheapest outings was supplied by James the Head of Housekeeping for the Hotel Burnham. He took us to a fantastic and FREE rooftop to show us a phenomenal view of the city! We were able to take panoramic shots of every point of interest in Chicago. What a beautiful sunset! The doormen were always wonderful and happy to see us safely back after our adventures. On our final day, we sadly contacted the front desk to see about weighing our bags (so that they weren't over 50 pounds for the airplane) and James the Bellhop promptly arrived in our room. He was able to reassure us that our bags weren't too heavy, and said he would be happy to deliver our bags to the lobby. After checking out, James asked us if he could load our bags in our vehicle for the airport. We explained to him that we were going to take the \"Blue Line\" train to O'Hare and that we'd just be rolling down the street to the underground train terminal. After a moment of stunned silence, James replied that there was \"no way\" he would allow us to lug our baggage that far and down that many steps. (We had 8 large pieces between us.) James enlisted the help of our favorite doorman Shimon and between the two of them, they carted all of our luggage a block away, down two flights of stairs, through the turnstills and explained how to purchase tickets for the train. We tried to help, but they insisted that they would do it, so Karyn carried her purse and I carried Shimon's hat. It was the least I could do. James and Shimon wished us a safe trip back to Washington State and to please come and visit Chicago and the Hotel Burnham again sometime.

I am usually the easy going guy who gives places the benefit of the doubt and ranks them a little higher than most because I have more tolerance than most. I am also the easy going guy who is liked by the doormen and the porters and the waiters because I treat them with genuine respect, tip them more than most others, and don't act like I am any better than they are because I know I am not. I was just luckier in life than they were. So maybe it was just a statistical fluke. Usually one strike and your a little down in the count, three strikes and your out, but eight strikes is a little bit much. The room was beautiful, the hotel building is beautiful. I called ahead for my car and cleary said 327, they repeated and said 327, I confirmed and then went down 20 minutes later and they had brought car 307 and the valet clearly had trouble with the english language. This resulted in my being late for a meeting and throwing the schedule off for the whole day. If this were the Ramada Inn I would take it in stride but I was paying over $300 a day for a suite and not using coupons. At dinner my chair was bumped from behind 4 times by the busboy who never apolagized even though when I looked my chair was in the central aisle and there was 6 to 8 feet of room behind it. We happened to be at the cornor of 2 aisles and he was cutting the cornor way too close. Once is understandable. 4 times is absurd. Especially when there is that much room behind you. My wife and I finally picked up the table and moved it inward so it was out of line with the other tables so I couldn't be bumped again. During a 25 minute period 3 sets of plates were dropped with a crash that was so loud it made your ear hurts. After the 3rd time everyone was sitting waiting for the fourth. Every business has its bad days and even the best have a 1 in a thousand horrible day by sheer bad luck. Perhaps that is what happened. If there are no more reviews like this I will say it is bad luck. If more reviews like this begin to appear I'd say they are beginning to cut cornors in their hiring practices in order to save money.

Great hotel that's in easy walking distance to many attractions. PROs: Beautiful building with well-appointed rooms. Very comfortable beds. Amenities include iron/board, safe, daily paper, complementary wine in the afternoon, L'Occutane shampoo/gel/conditioner, radio/CD player, lush velvet bedding. Had an Executive Suite (two rooms with king bed in one room and a small parlor in the next, French door dividers). Within walking distance of Ford's Oriental Theater (currently running Wicked -- The Musical which was very good), the Chicago theater, Millenium Park, Art Institute, shopping, restaurants, and if you're in reasonably decent shape, you can even walk to the Field Museum and the Chicago River (for Wendella Boat tours - highly recommend). Had an excellent dinner at the Atwood Cafe at the hotel. Pricey but good portions. CONS: Parking is $35/day and you have to pull up to the hotel's front (in the midst of traffic) and let the valet take it from there (valets were very professional however). Bathrooms are small (it is a historical building) and elevators are slow but it's really nothing that takes away from an all-around great hotel. No coffee makers in room - but they do have Starbucks coffee in the lobby every morning. However, I really believe the other guests would NOT want to see me pre-coffee. Even Holiday Inn Expresses have coffee in the room now, so should Hotel Burnham. Huge construction project across street (50-story office/shopping/hotel building) -- will kill views. Construction runs Monday through Saturday. Higher the floor, less noise you'll hear. Was only disappointed slightly with two incidences (and they would NOT keep me from coming back). Number One -- Had some problems with check-in. We arrived early and was told our room wasn't ready which we fully expected - we were then told that they would give us a call about our room by the usual check-in time of 3:00. Stayed in lobby in direct sight of front desk and waited an hour. Meanwhile bellmen were falling over each other trying to please a group of single women who were also waiting for their rooms (can I get you a drink, would you like a paper) but we were pretty much ignored. At 3:20, no phone call received, and we had watched several people who arrived after us get their rooms. So I had to go back to front desk to find out the situation. It was only then that they told me that the previous occupants were still in our room and had late checkout. To the hotel's credit they immediately upgraded us to an Executive Suite but this wasn't that big of a deal because we had already reserved a Deluxe Suite (no french doors, queen size bed). I understand snafus can happen, but I think they should have known when we got there that our room wasn't going to be ready at the check-in time of 3:00, and change the rooms then - why make us wait for a call that didn't come or ignore us in the lobby for almost an hour and a half. Number Two -- concierge staff was a little underwhelming. I had already set up all the tickets for everything we wanted to do (Wicked, Wendella Boats, King Tut exhibition, and Blue Man Group - all fantastic). All we needed were recommendations to a restaurant in a certain area but he had no clue whatsoever. The concierge couldn't have been nicer, but all he could do is google the info and print us out a map (well heck I could have done that myself). For a hotel of this caliber, the concierge should know the city backwards/forwards, know all the logistics for the main attractions, and be ready with suggestions for dining/entertainment (or at least know someone who does). I guess these very minor things just seemed really glaring to me because the hotel is ranked so high (and for the most part it's deservedly so) and the reviews have been so glowing. I really wish I could give it 4.9 stars. Just a little touchup in check-in procedures and concierge services, and it's easily 5-star. We'll definitely be back, but will probably get a standard room. We were able to peek in a few and they look just as nice as the suites (if smaller) and are much less expensive (gotta save that money for parking!!)", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westcliffe, CO", "Title": "\u201cHotel Burnham...alway a treat\u201d", "Author": "WestcliffeBob", "ReviewID": "UR5615695", "Content": "My wife and I spent four nights at the Hotel Burnham in early August.

Building has an interesting history of restoration which is nicely documented on the first floor public area. Cons: I got the room via Priceline, which requests a non-smoking room but does not guarantee one - good thing, because I was stuck in a second floor smoking room (202). The air conditioner running full blast cleaned the air, but it sure stank when I first entered the room; otherwise, the hotel was sold out, so no change was possible. If you nudged the desk/table between the beds, the whole thing shook back and forth, I thought it was going to fall apart, the phone wasn't plugged in correctly, and the lamp wasn't plugged in at all. The ambient noise from the streets below might bother some people. The \"complimentary Internet service\" in the lobby is at the check-in desk - you stand next to the incoming clientele - no chair, not sure if it was attached to a printer. Not that this mattered, because the server only worked on the evening I arrived and not for the rest of my stay; they told me a serviceman was coming to fix it on the day I was leaving; it was obviously not a priority. Thanks to Tonya, one of the concierges, who allowed me to use her desk's computer to print out boarding passes for the trip home. And be forewarned, hotel guests have no priority at the attached Atwood Cafe - if you don't make dinner reservations you're toast. I did have breakfast the first morning I was there - greasy eggs and sausage, coffee and OJ for $19.50. The elevators in this building made the ones at the Ambassador East seem jet-propelled. Here being on the second floor was an advantage and the stairs worked fine. I wouldn't ever pay their advertised rates to stay here, and if I got the place via Priceline again, I'd sure be more proactive in ensuring satisfaction, instead of expecting the hotel to provide it outright. This place has a serious case of unwarranted smugness.

The Burnham must have been an old office building because each hotel room door has that 1940s style look to it--as if there's a bookkeeper or accountant behind the door. And they give you a real key--not one of those credit card things. I must admit to being a big fan of the real key. (Hopefully they get them back from everyone upon checkout.) Thirdly--the wine in the lobby from 5 to 6 is really great. A friend of mine was meeting me at the hotel at 5:30 and she was late, so I was quite blissfully enjoying my shiraz in the lobby when she finally did arrive at 5:45. What else--the beds are really comfortable and don't have those horrible dips in them as if you're the 20 millionth person to sleep there. The stereo in each room is a really nice touch. The curtains are FANTASTIC! They block out all the light and you'd think it was the dead of night at 2 in the afternoon. (This was great with my jetlag.) Also, they give you a robe and have a turn down service with chocolates on the pillow. Aveda bath products. Free Internet access if you bring your laptop--ethernet cables are provided in the room.

We were soon whisked into the hotel and the wonderful James appeared -Bell Captain ? - and waited while we checked in. We were several hours early, but no problem, we were told we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Suite and there would be a wine reception in the foyer at 5:00. James took us up, regailed us with amusing stories and got us settled in to our 15th floor room. We had great views along State Street and Washington, with the Millenium Park and the Lake in the not far distance. We went off to explore a little and came back to find a note congratulating us and a bottle of champagne and some chocolates. We never heard our fellow guests, or the elevator, though we were away from it. The Concierge service was excellent and as we were determined to sample as many different restaurants as we could, their knowledge was great. Our beds were turned down each evening and chocolates placed on the bed, the Sound System set to play soothing music, and the Ice Bucket filled at some point, but we only noticed this on the last day. Everyone on the staff we met made a point of talking to us, a rare thing in most hotels. When we were too tired to eat out, a call to the Cafe in the Foyer always met the same response. Well we are fully booked with Pre-Theatre customers until 7:30, but when asked if they could call us if a table became vacant early, we were sitting at a table within 15 minutes on both occasions. The food was great, the service superb and my only criticism was that some of the tables have small sofas for seats, and for my diminutive bride, this meant she felt like a child at the dining table. The curtains in the rooms are dark, thick and almost light proof. You can sleep in without knowning it's morning. The air conditioning is excellent, not an after thought and my main worry from the photographs on their web site is unfounded. It looks as if the original marble floors were uncovered from the photos, but in fact they are covered with a carpet that mimics the style of marble, so don't worry about footsteps from the other guests. As a British Citizen, I find the taxi cabs in America Strange. They are usually huge great Fords, which have no more room inside than a European or Japanese mid range car, yet there is a partition which makes the passengers feel like sardines in a can.

Kind of whimsical and fun, the whole thing is light and airy and beautiful. The beds were soft and comfortable and everything was clean and the service was superb.

From finding me a historic Babtist church to attend Palm Sunday services, to getting me the blintzes I love. I felt like it was home, and everyone knew me. Smiling and waving as I went out in the morning and welcoming me home at night. The location was perfect. Fifty feet from the subway, across the street from Marshall Fields, across the block from the theater. About three blocks from the Art museum. I could see the Walnut room, (a delicious, fun, reasonably priced place to eat in Marshall Fields) from my window, and the theater where Wicked is playing. A new network (don't remember which one) studio just opened a block away and it was fun to watch them do a live newscast from the huge glass front window. One night when I was so tired I couldn't possibly go out, I just sat on the bed with the curtains opened and enjoyed the magnificient view of the city from my 11th floor vantage. I love hot tea and they had a wonderful selection in the lobby and served Argo tea in the restaurant. The Argo shop is a block away and was also fun to visit. Everything is close. Perfect location. The only bad spot was the homeless. I didn't expect them and they always break my heart. One glorious spring day, when my conference at the Lakeside Conference center was over, I wandered out the door instead of boarding a bus.

We love Michigan Avenue but the \"Loop\" is so much fun too so decided to do that for this trip and since Marshall Field's won't be much longer, we thought we'd see the windows dressed in their theme decor one last time. This year the theme for their windows was Cinderella! From the minute we stepped in the door, until we left the next morning, everyone was very attentive to our needs and very pleasant which can be difficult in these busy times of Christmas. I think we talked with a girl named, Terry at the front desk and our room wasn't ready but she stored our bags and we took off for lunch at the Walnut Room in Marshall Fields which was way TOO crowded and the line must have been a few hundred people so we ended up at The Big Downtown at the Palmer House. As we walked in, we were handed a complimentary glass of our choice of red or white wine and waited about 15 minutes for a table (they said it would be 30). The Cobb salad was GREAT. We shopped around a bit and when we arrived back at the Burnham, Terry said our room was almost ready and we waited in a small lounge area which was glowing with Christmas finery. Someone had just finished having tea at a small table nearby and I understand that the restaurant at the Burnham is noted for it's afternoon tea with scones and the works. I think they have a wine reception every evening too but we didn't make it downstairs around that time in the early evening. Our room was ready shortly and we were on the top floor (15) and Terry gave us a wonderful room overlooking State Street and Marshall Fields as well as the German Christmas Mart not far away! I loved our room. There was a radio/CD stereo playing a soft jazz station as we walked in and the room was just delightfully decorated and spotless as well.They provided a CD also but I'd brought a Christmas CD which we played most of the time. It is a boutique hotel so the rooms will run a little smaller than the larger hotels but I love that it's not the same hotel room that you would find in 100 other hotels! The hotel is built in what looks as though it were an office building at one time. It has so much character and it's just enchanting! The lobby where you catch the elevators is marble and elaborate ironwork with mosaic tile floor. I wanted to take a photo of this but my camera's battery failed in the middle of our stay and I didn't get a lot of photos I wanted to take. Saturday night we had reservations at Petterino's. It's just about 3 blocks away and an enjoyable walk as it had just started snowing. We strolled by the German Christmas Market on our way. Our experience at Petterino's was wonderful. My husband said he hadn't had that kind of perfect dining experience in a long time! Our server even treated us to a small taste of a deep dark chocolate cake as we had our coffee after our meal! The pear salad with goat cheese was to die for and the scallops with garlic sauce was equally delicious. My husband raved about his steak as well. It was like a \"winter wonderland\" when we stepped out and walked back to the hotel. Some other quick pluses for the Burnham. Towels are fluffy and thick! Coffee in the room but also complimentary Starbucks in the morning in the lobby as we were waiting to catch our taxi. To add one more way that the Burnham went beyond what most hotels will do, I was in a hurry as we were packing to leave and as I put my retainers in their box in my bag, the bottom one fell out and must have caught in the carpet between the wall and carpet. I didn't know where it was when I got home and called and talked with Paul who directed me to Audrey in housekeeping. She had already found it and wanted to know how I'd like her to send it to me.

For transportation, the subway (Red line) is across the street, the El is a block or two away, and taxis and buses can handle the rest.

Yes - it's pricey, but it offers excellent furnishings and very good service. The concierge desk was helpful. The only glitch in service was maid service one day, when some things in the room were missed. It was reported, and didn't happen again. Lobby staff (front desk, doormen, bellmen) were excellent. The in-house restaurant (Atwood Cafe) receives very good reviews. Room service is from there. We ate there one lunch - it was good, but crowded (tables too close), service only fair, and not worth the money. There are very good restaurants in the Loop, even in walking distance. (Trattoria #10 around the corner, the Berghoff, the Russian Tea Time, for example) Other restaurants (we like Greek restaurants in Greektown and mideastern on the north side) are a taxi ride away. A tip - the Corner Bakery is a chain all over town - ask for directions to the nearest one(s). They have good pastries, sandwiches, at reasonable prices. A bottled juice from the Walgreens next door, a pastry, and coffee made in the room was a fine breakfast. Contrary to what was on the Kimpton website, this is not on the Mag Mile (that's a mile away), and Millenium Park is not across the street (it's 2 blocks to the east). There's some interesting shopping on State Street (not as glitzy and huge as Mag Mile). The views from the room (we had a corner, with views up State Street, and over to the lake) are fantastic. If you like being in the heart of a bustling city, this is a good choice. It's small enough to feel personalized, and always felt safe. (Admittedly, we were not out real late at night.)

Our room was lavishly decorated, the front desk people are friendly and competent, the location is convenient to all of downtown Chicago, and our room was very quiet. But the basic layout of the room was not traveller-friendly. One small oval table was the only usable flat surface, and it was already largely taken up with a purely decorative lamp and a lot of advertising flyers. The only dresser drawers were in the armoire, and keeping the large flap doors open while trying to open the drawers was a nuisance. And after all that maneuvering, both the drawers were already full, with 2 Chicago phone books, a large picture book of local advertising, the Gideon Bible and the Thoughts of Buddha. No room for shirts, sox, underwear, and all those non-decorative things travellers like to put in hotel room drawers. The bathroom was charming and clean, but again no thought was apparently given to what people need in a hotel bathroom. There was a lovely oval sink but no counterspace at all for even a small toiletries bag. The building is a fascinating restoration of an old office building. There is a front entrance on Washington St, with an attended lobby desk and doormen. However, the elevator lobby also has its own direct entrance to State St., very handy if you are going that direction. But not very effective from a security standpoint - anyone can come in off the street and go right up to the guest floors without passing any lobby personnel or doormen.

I pretty much walked everywhere from the hotel including most of Michigan Avenue, the Navy Pier, Milleneum Park, and the general lake/river area. I love to walk though and some of these distances might be too far for some, so a cab or train might be in order. Check in was the fastest process I've ever seen.

There was a sitting area with sofa, TV, chair, and table, along with a bedroom with a king bed, desk and TV. The bathroom was adequately sized. The room was spotless and very nicely decorated.

Thanks to TripAdvisor reviews, we decided to \"take a chance\" on the Hotel Burnham for our visit to Chicago, May 3-9, 2005. From the moment we walked through the doors held open by a uniformed doorman, we knew we were in a special place. Check in was instantaneous and we were on our way through the restored elevator lobby. As we entered our suite, I knew that life will never be the same when it comes to hotel accommodations. From this time forward, the standard by which all other hotels will be measured is that set by the Hotel Burnham. Our suite was tastefully decorated and exceptionally comfortable. While most hotels are perfectly fine and provide an adequate place to stay, our stay at the Burnham became part of the overall Chicago experience. The smaller size of the hotel gives it more personality than those of the big lodging chains. Our rooms were inviting, comfortable and hard to leave. The amenities were well thought out, down to the telephone in the bathroom. The view from the large Chicago-style windows was of Marshall Field's, the theatre district and down Washington Street past the El to Millennium Park and a glimpse of Lake Michigan beyond. To say that expectations were exceeded is an understatement. At the corner of State and Washington streets, we found ourselves in the literal heart of Chicago, within walking distance to the Art Institute, Symphony Hall, the theatre district, financial district and even boat tours on the Chicago River. Taxis, buses and the subway are right at the doorstep when you don't want to walk; the El is a block away. I didn't fully appreciate the historic status of the building that houses the Hotel Burnham until after we arrived. The turn of the century Reliance Building is an important part of the architectural history of Chicago and its design is part of the cultural heritage of the city. My only disappointment was that we were unaware that on the first (and third) Wednesdays of each month, a special 45 minute tour of the hotel building is given by the Chicago Architecture Foundation, so we missed that. The hotel's staff is very friendly and we were always greeted by at least three of them, whether coming or going: \"Welcome back,\" \"Nice to see you again,\" words we don't hear often enough. As a person who travels frequently--30 or more nights a year--I found this a most memorable stay.

We were especially impressed with the concierge, Tracy. She gave thoughtful and considered recommendations for restaurants and entertainment (e.g., local blues clubs).

In our whole stay here, we saw no pets at all in the hotel. I'm not suggesting that you can't take your pet, or that there weren't any there at the time we were: but if there were any they were never allowed to interfere with any guest's enjoyment. We literally saw neither hide nor hair of any pets! I suppose it is just an example of how well- run and staffed the hotel is. And let me emphasise that the staff are SUPERB. They cannot do enough for you. Every time we stepped back through the main door (having been out shopping or whatever), EVERY member of staff on duty would greet us and say \"welcome back\". Only a little thing, I know, but it really did make us feel good.

This after complaining that she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the open and close times of museums after being off for a few days. Later that day we felt as if we were bothering her when we asked for reservations at a popular local restaurant.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure of its history, but it has the appearance of having been an office building because the top halves of the doors to the rooms have frosted glass panels. (The glass-paneled doors raise security and fire-safety concerns.) It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grand, but it has the feel of an old hotel, sort of eclectic, or maybe it could be called \"western commercial Victorian\" in style. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smallish and cozy. D\u00c3\u00a9cor in the public spaces is kind of heavy and dark in spite of all the windows in the lobby and adjoining restaurant; the guest rooms are lighter, more stylish, and very attractive. Upholstery, drapery, and bedspread fabrics are of high quality and quite pretty. Reproduction iron work surrounds the elevators, and in the elevator hall there is a striking mosaic floor, restored. Upstairs, some of the hallway walls, ceilings, and stairs are covered in thick slabs of white Carrara marble. There are rug runners throughout, probably covering damaged mosaic tile; wall & rug colors are deep gold, accented with dark red and royal or navy blue. I had made the reservation by telephone because I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out on-line a way that a family of four (two young teens) could sleep comfortably. A King Suite for $189 was recommended: the children could use the \"sofa bed\" and a cot in the sitting room. When we arrived, however, the staff was unaware that the reservation promised beds for four, and they did not appear to have thought about how to accommodate us, although we were obviously four people. But when we requested a cot, they brought it. When it turned out that the loveseat/sofa was not a sofa-bed after all, we had to request an additional cot. This was somewhat vexing, but once all of this was settled, we were fine. In the King Suite, the door from the outside hall opens to a short hallway with bathroom and closet on either side leading to a stylish sitting room. It has a high back and high armed loveseat upholstered in gold damask, large TV cabinet with stereo and minibar, end and coffee tables, and a desk & chair. Wood furniture is dark, formal style. The bathroom is not luxurious (except for the many Aveda products), but it is adequate and attractive. There is an iron and a good hairdryer. The very comfortable kingsize bed in our suite came with an elaborate half-canopy crown in blue and gold fabric. The bed is in a small room (8\u00e2\u20ac\u2122x8\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?) separated from the sitting room by glass-paned French doors--some but not as much privacy as expected; plus, access to the bath is through the sitting room. There was 2 to 3 feet of walking space on the sides of the bed, maybe 3-1/2 feet at the foot. This was a corner room with two walls of large windows & great views; sheer roman shades and heavy blue and gold draperies that could be open or drawn. A TV is also in this room. We had a wonderful view of the Frank Gehry sculpture in Millennium Park, and of Marshall Fields across the street (fantastic dept. store). The Art Institute is within walking distance. The hotel staff were responsive and very nice, although the valet and bellman were somewhat overly familiar. The only other minor complaint might be that the rug in our suite was a bit soiled and had a wet spot in the middle of the sitting room. A plus: Guests are served wine in the lobby at 5pm--good wine, we thought. This was a very nice touch. We complimented the wine selection and were given a bottle, gratis. The hotel has an intimate feeling, and we liked the atmosphere. It was very relaxed and friendly. We had no time to eat in the restaurant, but the menu was interesting, although rather expensive; prices $18-28 for dinner entrees and at breakfast, $20 for bacon & eggs.

We had breakfast once at the hotel restaurant. Background music is Hawaiian and very pleasant. Food and service were good but there were not many diners so it's hard to say what it would be like when busier. The parking lot for guests is gated, requiring a room key swipe to open gate when entering and exiting. The device at the exit gate must have been hit by a vehicle because it is bent lower than a car window, and difficult to swipe.

The desk chair had noticeable stains on the fabric and with only two table lamps in the entire room, it was dark and depressing - no light enough to read or do work. The standalone cabinet in the bathroom was so worn the paint was coming off and corners were rounded down, it looked to be about 25 years old. The grout in the shower was dingy and the bathroom probably has never been remodeled. The HVAC system consisted of a very old in-wall unit with tiny knobs that were located at floor level - odd, considering this was supposed to be an accessible room. It did a poor job of maintaining a good temperature. Had I been paying out of my own pocket, I would've left after seeing the room, to be honest. I've stayed at nicer Red Roof Inns. I almost hesitated to write this, as I feel like one of the overly-picky reviews that I hate. I normally don't care if things are a little older, etc but this just felt dirty and not maintained.

Of course I booked the room! When I showed up, I was delighted to find it located across the bay from downtown and to find the views spectacular on either side of the place! For less than I would have paid for little more than a bed sized room downtown, I got this beautiful spacious room complete with a balcony overlooking the beautiful harbor at Shelter Island! The breakfast tickets were a plus as well! Real, sit down breakfast each day, with a decent selection to pick from and add on items available as well.

The hotel is located at the end of Shelter Island, across the street from the San Diego Bay waterfront and a sidewalk / jogging path. The back of the hotel abuts a marina. Parking ($15 a night fee) is between the hotel and the street, and note that the outdoor seating area for many of the standard rooms face the parking lot. The grounds and plantings were well maintained. Check-in was efficient and the room easy to find. Fortunately, our standard room was in the last building in the complex with a small outdoor seating area overlooking a grassy area, not the parking lot. Although there were a few nice touches, such as a tiled sink area, the room was fairly typical - did not stand out positively or negatively. Carpeting and furnishings were in good shape, although some of the wallpaper in the bathroom was beginning to peel. King bed was comfortable, but not very substantial so that any movement on the bed caused it to shake. The room had a mini-fridge but no coffee maker (a cup of coffee in the restaurant to go was $3). Free wifi worked well. Use of hotel gym was $10/day per person (better off driving 10 minutes to a real gym and spending $15). There was a small 'beach' area facing the marina on the back side of the property, but even if you could swim there, you wouldn't want to with such close proximity to boats and related pollution. If you want to swim in the bay, there is a public beach about a 10 minute walk away. The property does have a nice heated swimming pool with plenty of chaise lounges. Staff was courteous and helpful. When we reported a burnt out lightbulb and squeaky door, they were fixed the same day. In short, the Kona Kai is just another hotel by the water.

They had a nice gym & bike rental area, and it was very relaxing to just stroll around the hotel, since it's right on the sand. The best part of the hotel, in our opinion, was the restaurant. We are the quiet type, so we were delighted to have dinner mostly to ourselves at the beautiful restraunt with the ocean view. We also got a free breakfast that was included in our stay in the morning (there was only a few other people that time as well). The food was great and the venue was high class. It was pretty difficult to find our room at first, but the actual hotel, which is three stories, isn't that big. It seemed like there was some interesting places to eat down the street too.

It has two sides: Marina or Bay. I think the second floor overlooking the Marina is the nicest but some may prefer the bay view. You should know that this is an older property and may not be up to your liking though they seem to want to please. Don't use the concierge service as they are more expensive than finding things on your own like rental cars and such. They do charge for parking in their lot. In San Diego there seems to be a charge and/or tax for simply everything! Since so many people here work for the Department of the Navy, this place could become pretty bad if our economy worsens to the point of layoffs here. But I guess we face that chance anywhere. They do have internet service through AT&T but it is pretty poor as is AT&T in general. I only had one good day/night of decent throughput. Most other times I gave up trying to do anything because of the dropped WiFi signals. I made several official complaints directly to them, not the hotel. The service came back after a couple hours and what AT&T told me were several complaints, but it was down again or spotty at best the next days. Since the hotel is at the end of the island, there isn't as much traffic. It is easy to get across the street to the walk along the bay which goes from the police department and Friendship Bell all the way down past the pier, the beach, and to the Bali Hai Restaurant which has a great Sunday buffet. Shelter Island has a good view of the navel complex with lots of ships coming and going. Since we were there prior to the 9/11 memorial ceremonies, there seemed to be quite a lot of incoming naval ships with some loading ordinance. Some large Coast Guard vessels too. One of the nights we were entertained by the yearly Luau with over 300 people in attendance. The staff was easy to talk to and attentive to our needs which were few. We needed the building with the elevator for my Mother who has limited mobility. The only downside that I can think of was the morning of our departure. They did not have enough staff for breakfast and many people waited a very long time for service and food. We left after half an hour and went elsewhere since our time was limited that day. The grounds are kept clean, the maid service does a good job. There is a laundry at the marina if you need to clean your clothes. Von's supermarket (best one in town) is not far by car. Avoid driving near the airport if you are in a hurry to get someplace as traffic can be very congested. We liked La Jolla so much, that we drove there three times. It is part of San Diego but residents don't like to admit it. There are way more restaurants than you'll have need for so just look at the reviews and pick one in the area you wish to visit. One place that had great food for both breakfast and lunch was called Mission Restaurant in Northpark. As long as you don't eat like a tiny bird this place is for you! Hillcrest, and downtown San Diego are all places to go at night depending on the time from what we were told. Parking is not open to the public but when the hotel is full like during the luau, it is hard to find a parking spot. Parking on the road is forbidden between early morning hours because they water the roadway to make the asphalt healthy L.O.L. (or to wash things out through the sewers and out to sea). The park across the street along the bay is often packed with people who spend the whole day (setting up tents and grilling out) and leave near or after dusk.

Made my reservation through Travelocity's Top Secret Hotels for a 45% discount. The Pop Secret deal is a gimmick that mimics Priceline/Hotwire, but, lets you know the price. Pop Secret gives you the general area, often with too broad of a brush stroke, and several guest ratings of property categories. If you can toggle to/fro the Pop Secret property review and the regular Travelocity review screen, you can get an idea of the candidate hotel. I was able to narrow down my guess to two hotels on Shelter Island, a perfect location for my needs. Within a minute of my placing my reservation for the Secret Hotel, the dramatic news was emailed to me that my winning selection was Kona Kai. What an exciting drama! My stay at Kona Kai was without drama. Just how I like it. My hotel needs are: 1. Location 2. Firm/clean/comfy bed 3. Hot shower 4. Coffee within crawling distance in the morning 5. If staff treats me well, that is a bonus Kona Kai met and exceeded my five needs. I was greeted and treated well. As several have stated, the hallways and other decor is a bit dated, but, I don't care about carpet, wall paper and wall sconces. My room was a clean, 2 queen bed with a desk and a double door armoir for clothing storage. Fast wi-fi internet is free throughout the property. Coffee maker was in the bathroom and for some, this may crowd the smallish 1 sink counter. Also, the bathroom lighting was a tad dim. My room had a nice view of the pool, grass courtyard and marina. Noticed a nice restaurant/bar with bayside and marina views, but, I'm not a fan of most hotel food. There are dozens of good restaurants within 1 mile. Their health club is an excellent facility, even at $15/day. I didn't work out, but, my tour of the club saw dozens of pieces of equipment and all in good condition. A free workout is a walk or run along Shelter Island's waterfront. Kona Kai also has bicycles for rent. Parking is $15 per night. But, the airport shuttle is free and it's a new, clean Toyota mini-van that starts at 05:30 and runs every half hour. Biggest downside of Kona Kai may be the thin walls in the rooms. I noticed some conversation next door when I first moved in. Lucky me, there was no noise at night. Maybe I should add that as a SIXTH hotel room requirement. My overall rating for Kona Kai is THREE out of 5 Hawaiian Leis. This ain't no Hyatt with 10,,000 thread count sheets. But, San Diego is very proud of their hotels with plenty of $200+ properties. At way less than $100, I will return to Kona Kai.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Clarita, California", "Title": "\u201cPretty views .................OUTSIDE your room.\u201d", "Author": "nylori", "ReviewID": "UR118676317", "Content": "After reading reviews of this property I struggled with whether or not I wanted to stay at the Kona Kai.

The guest rooms, however, leave much to be desired.. My room was in the main building on the first floor. Wallpapered covered hallway walls were outdated and dirty, as was the carpet. The room had a lovely view of the courtyard, pool and harbor and a nice gated patio, however it smelled musty and old. The explanation from the front desk about the smell was to say that it is because they are near the water. I have stayed at many waterfront hotels that have rooms that are not smelly like this one was!!. Anyway, the room itself was small, furnishings old and beat up ( the dresser drawers stuck closed and were difficult to open), carpeting gross, bed linens consisted of very thin sheets and an ugly cheap quality bedspread, and the pillows were flat with no support. The bed was very soft and uncomfortable too. Walls are thin. Bathroom was small, shower and tub could use some reglazing,hinges in bathroom door were rusty, and the towels are more like dish rags rather than bath towels. The staff and the Kona Kai were very nice, however not all seemed very knowledgeable. The rooms at this hotel are in desparate need of renovation !!

I used the complimentary shuttle service from the airport. Although the vehicle was rather small for the number of passengers (Toyota Sienna for 8 adults, some of whom were tall, some of whom were portly) we made the short trek without incident. My overall first impression was that this was a fairly nice property. When I approached the front desk the attendant asked what she could do for me. No smile, no warm greetinge; she simply wanted to get to business. It was early in the morning, so I knew there was a good chance my room wouldn't be ready - and it wasn't. She instructed me to come back at a certain time when she would assign my room. I returned at the time she instructed, she said a room was not available and that I should come back in an hour. Once again I followed her instruction. This time when I arrived, she looked at me as though she'd never seen me and asked what I needed. I explained to her that she told me to come back to check in... At this point she said the room still wasn't ready, but she would go ahead and get the paperwork done so that I could come back in an hour and get my key. I agreed, and an hour later I received the key for my guest room. Upon entering my room I found it to be quite dated, with worn furnishings and stained cushions and carpet. The mirrors in the room were obviously not cleaned, evidenced by something smeared on them. When I phoned home, I sat on the bed and happened to look behind the nightstand where there was a dirty tissue from a previous guest, I assume. When I opened the closet I was pleased to find a mini refrigerator; a bit unexpected, but it was a good thing. Clothing is intended for the armoire/dresser. San Diego can be a bit warm, and this place does not offer central air. There is an old fashioned, rather loud, wall-unit air conditioner that protrudes out onto the lanai; which by the way is very nice with its patio table and chairs. The lighting in the bathroom is awful, as is the condition of the tub/shower, with its chips, stains, and mildew. There is a hairdryer and coffee maker, along with plenty of soap, shampoo, and lotion. Somehow my toothbrush didn't make it into my bag. I called the front desk to inquire as to where I could get one after 9:00 p.m. They said they would send one right over to my room. In less than ten minutes there was a knock on my door, and I had a colgate toothbrush and toothpaste. Now that's some good customer service! (I guess it's hit and miss depending upon who is working what shift.) The actual geography around the hotel is great. It's situated right on the water, so the immediate surroundings are lovely.

The linens on the beds and the bathrooms, all seem like they have been washed about 10,000 times. extremely thin, extremely worn, and overall very low quality. The housekeeping was ok, but not great. The furniture in the rooms is circa early 1980. very outdated, but not necessarily in bad condition. Just very old. The location is great, at the tip of Shelter Island, we had a great view of the harbor, but our patio furniture was so old and dirty looking you didn't want to sit on it for fear of it rubbing off on your clothes.

The hotel is really nice and inviting on the outside. In the lobby is a comfy seating area with a nice fireplace, the pool is big and inviting, and I was happy to see they had a few lanes blocked off for serious swimmers. Unfortunately, there were a large group of families and kids staying there and they took over the pool, lanes and all. Who was I to spoil their fun, and yet, I did say I was tryng to swim in one of the lanes....I think during the week, it was probably a lot quieter. The rooms were spacious and simple. They upgraded us to an ocean view with a balcony which was really nice. No fridge in the room, and no extras, and the maid didn't even give me soap and shampoo for second night which kind of irked me, but all in all, it was lovely. If I was to be really particular, I might have told them they need to fix the screen door to the balcony, and provide a few more necessities in the room, like shower cap, and fridge. Hotel has a spa which i did not utilize. The hotel also had a lovely dining room, a Hawaiian Luau if one so desired, a great gym, and free bikes.

BUT the first thing we noticed as we entered the Kona Kai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking lot to unpack our car was that the hotel parking lot was filthy. The parking lot, sidewalk and walkways were all covered in what looked like month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of duck poop, pigeon poop and smashed berries and olives (from the berries and olive trees on the motel grounds). Our room was on the second floor, and we noticed that the stairwell was filthy and covered in more bird poop, pigeon feathers and trash. I was immediately disgusted. The bottoms of our shoes were too dirty to re-enter our car!!! As we entered our 2nd floor room for the first time, we both said WTF as a STRONG musty, moldy smell punched us in our faces and knocked us on our butts. I quickly covered my nose and was like, HELL NO, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not staying here!!! I was ready to check out and find another hotel, but then I realized that it was too late to get a refund. We quickly left the room and drove to the nearest Target to get scented candles, Fabreeze and air fresheners, to spray in the room. Upon returning to the room we quickly took our street shoes off because the bottom of our shoes was covered in bird poop, berries and olives from walking from the car to our room. We put on white socks, which IMMEDIATELY got black on the bottoms from walking on the dirty, ocean air damp stained carpet in the room. We trashed over 12 pairs of socks during our 3 day stay! The two beds looked like an adult jumped on them then rolled around on the beds. The pillows were old, overused and flat. Only one light next to the bed worked in the bedroom area, so the room was dim during the evenings. The balcony, patio table, and chairs were covered in pigeon poop. The closets smelled musty, so we left our clothes in our suitcases the entire time. The bathroom sink area is outside of the actual bedroom and is so small that you can barely sit a toiletry bag on it. The shower towels were old, overused, hard on the skin and some had permanent stains on them. We woke the next morning to be greeted by one cockroach. Then we woke up the following morning to be greeted by 2 more cockroaches in the room. We stayed away from our room as much as possible during our three day stay.

A report of roaches made to the front desk and ultimately the management yielded no results - unless you consider being shuffled to three different rooms in one night quality managing. My husband actually captured one, killed it, and took it to the front desk. We were not loud about it, but we certainly should have alerted our fellow patrons and I regret not doing so. When we actually spoke to the supervisor the next day, he simply brushed off our concern with the weather and were told, \"you should be familiar with these type of roaches.\" What did he mean by that??

We stayed for 5days/3nights with two kids under 3, and grandparents and enjoyed sitting on the balcony mornings/evenings watching the boats, helicopters and other water traffic on the bay. Room: Room and linens clean. Good size with balconies with view of bay--nice. Not all rooms have this view so if you want it, ask for it. The pillows were flat wafers and the beds are worn. The bathrooms are very small--squeeze between toilet and vanity to close the door to get into the shower. Each room has a refrigerator. There was no closet door on our closet, the bathroom door was splintering at the bottom from prior water damage, the floor tile was stained, and the bottom of the bathtub needed a thorough, aggressive scrubbing. The towels were clean but very thin. Facilities: Good size sparkling pool and jacuzzi. The pool towels are like kleenex so take your own or get several from the front desk. The play area is just a slide. We did not eat at the hotel or order room service. You will pay $15/night to park a vehicle. There is no elevator so if you want a room with a view you have to climb stairs. Service:The staff was functional but not overly friendly.

I checked in with a young lady who seemed confused and seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. It took at least 20 minutes for her to locate my reservation once she found someone to help. After waiting 20 minutes, I was told the room was not ready. She asked me to have a seat until the room was ready. I waited almost 40 minutes in the lobby watching people come in and out getting room keys and not be acknowledged. Had I known it was going to take over an hour I would have left to enjoy the city since it was a nice Sunday afternoon. I asked if my room was ready and she looked aggravated that I was asking. I then asked to speak to a manager and she went somewhere in the back and came out and said the manager was in a meeting and not available. When I asked her to have the manager come speak to me after her meeting she said \"if she's still here, I'll have her come out.\" I continued to watch her give keys to other people and even watched a shift change in agents. Finally, I could not handle the frustration, I attempted to see the front desk again. I asked her again and she told me it would be 45 minutes. Im not one to complain but after seeing so many other people get rooms I had to say something. She apologized and said to have a seat and she would help me in a bit. 25 minutes later, I saw the young lady run off with her belongings to leave. I tried to remain patient after being so upset, when the new agent who arrived Crissy, saw me waiting. She asked if I was waiting on a room and I explained my situation about waiting and how the manager was surprisingly unavailable. Instead of waiting the 45 minutes, Crissy immediately found a room for me and even offered a full view room at no additional charge. She was very pleasant and friendly and a complete turnaround from the gal before her. Crissy had suggested a few things to do while in town and even had great suggestions on some sales for shopping. After speaking with her, I was really excited to go about my day and had forgotten about the negative experience I had first encountered. Later that night I encountered another issue when trying to order room service. I was unable to reach room service as the phone just kept ringing. Another 45 minutes later and numerous attempts to call, I went downstairs to the restaurant and saw no one there to help me order. I waited 10-15 minutes and saw not even one worker so I decided to go back to the front desk to see if I can find help. At the front desk I saw Crissy helping a line of people and she was the only one helping. This hotel must be short on staff because with a line like that, I would assume one would be highly overwhelmed. Apparently, after eavesdropping, I gathered their flight or plans were cancelled. I thought my day was bad until I heard some of these peoples horror stories of not having a decent meal since 7am! Watching people venting frustrations and upset people taking out on her, Crissy maintained a polite and positive attitude. Finally, her back up came and they managed to check everyone in within 10 minutes. When she finally noticed me standing there she asked me if I was ok and I explained my issue regarding room service. She and Patrice seemed apologetic and they took my order and walked it over to the kitchen. They said it should be half an hour and my food came in less than half an hour qt that point. Thank you Crissy and Patrice! The grounds seem like it has alot of potential, surrounded by water with amazing views, however, it seems dated and can use some renovation. The hotel has a Hawaiian theme however the buildings (according to the hotel map) are named after Mexican cities. Cabo, and cozumel, cancun? Doesn't make sense. The furniture in the lobby and in the rooms seem old fashioned and I don't understand why or how it fit the hotel motif if it even had one. The bed was an older bed and felt like it had to be 20 years old. The hotel definately needs some updating and renovation, once that is done I'm sure the hotel would be a great resort. Also, if the staff is more trained and anything like Crissy and Patrice, I would come back because they seemed very sweet and helpful. Until then, if i were in the area, I would probably go to another one of the 4 hotels in the area.

For the rest of our 5 day stay the door was propped open which gave access to anybody to enter. At the same time, they had locks on the inside doors to the ice machine, so if you forgot your key you got locked inside an area surrounded by hotel. When making the reservation, I was told breakfast was included in our rate up to $36. per day and that it would be taken off our bill at the end. They also stated that parking was included. When checking in they gave us coupons for breakfast.. We found the restaurant used special menus for the coupon people with a very limited number of items, only five items. I ended up eating the same thing every day as most of the menu was made up of high calorie fattening items. I'd say check if they have renovated yet as they told us they were going to do that soon and find out the room rate without food. Some complained about the parking.

We had made plans to watch the Hawaiian Luau show that Kona Kai runs on Fridays in the summer and then stay the balance of the weekend. First off, checking in and parking were a breeze and very efficient. When I entered the lobby to check in, the first thing I noticed was the warm Spanish Villa styled lobby area. The huge fireplace, cushy chairs and couches, and warm tones immediately put me in a good mood. We were greeted by the manager Dennis Vinegas who assured us that our stay would be memorable (and he was right). Our bellman, then helped us to our room and took care of our baggage...he was so fast that he actually beat us to our room (I still don;t know how he did it!). When we got to our room, we noticed that we had a great view of the main courtyard and pool, as well as the marina (and a nice balcony to take it all in)...what a specatacular view. After settling in , we saw the Luau/Hula show which was fantastic...the food was delcious, in particular the Kahlua Pork and the Lomi Lomi Salmon..I have to admit I went back for seconds and thirds! The show was very nice, with children and adult perfomers and even two fire dancers...The next day,(Saturday) we awoke and had breakfast in the main dining room. Again, it was a very comforting place, with it's vaulted turret ceiling and beautiful views of the Shelter Island Marina...and the food was plentiful and freshly prepared..and most importantly, served efficiently and courteously. The wait and bus staff was qucik to cater to our every need. Later, we went to hang out at the pool and jacuzzi and spent the bulk of the day just lounging and relaxing. The hotel has a pool cocktail/food server and we definitely took advantage of their services. The Calamari and the Mojitos are a must-try.by the pool. We had dinner offsite that night (another story which is not so nice...I won't mention the place). But we made it back in time for a nice evening soak in the jacuzzi and for our daughter to play on the playground adjacent to the pool before heading to bed. Thewre were other families in that area with a fire going in the firepit on site which gave the evening a real \"clambake\" celebratory feel...a very nice night. On Sunday, we again had breakfast in the dining room (we ate breakfast there every morning)...then did some sight-seening down by Seaport Village (a short drive away)...it was warm outside though, and we found ourselves back at the pool again by early afternoon for more swimming, mojitos and calamari! The whole experience of this place was perfect for us...the hotel has so many areas where people can gather and play cards, visit with family etc.(there were many family reunions and a few weddings that weekend...but there was always plenty of space on the hotel grounds to do your own thing)....The decor and service at every level invited you to relax, and enjoy...and that is really what you want out of a mini-vacation...the bottomline on our trip is that we intend to return and make more family memories very soon.

Well our room was onto the beach but it is a manmade beach which leads to the Harbour which I didn't appreciate, this aside our first night was spent listening to a group of teenagers hanging out on the beach followed by the constant echo of doors slamming into the night. To be fair the staff did say that we could move rooms but as the majority of rooms are in a similar position and we'd now unpacked there seemed little point. The included breakfast was for two only, apparently children don't need to eat in the USA and the cost of additional breakfast orders were ridiculous. We opted to use our vouchers for all of us then head to Dennys for the remaining mornings. The other nasty surprise (should have checked trip advisor first) was the $15 a night parking fee. This was not mentioned on our booking confirmation and so we were totally unaware of it. Also the addtional cost to use the gym, had the staff been a little more pleasant at the time of check in we would have thought 'oh well our mistake' but the arrogance of the check in clerks especially when i mentioned about the parking and the breakfast costs, immediately made me wish to spend as little money in this hotel as possible.

They also seemed to have the ability to reduce or in some cases eliminate the advertised $15.00 parking fee for those who had rental cars. There are four resorts on Shelter Island. The Kona Kai is the last one in the line maintaining what I would see as the prime location. During the weekend we walked along the island many times and saw the maintenance and landscaping work being performed at the other resorts, especially the Bay Club. I hope the Kona Kai begins their projects soon. The resort is beautiful, but it has the potential to be so much better. Neglect is a harsh word though ignored is descriptive of their grounds, the decorative vegetation appeared to be attempting self-sufficiency. We had rooms on the ground floor, our patios opened onto the grassy area by the pool. The building was bordered by Bird of Paradise bushes, always a fascination to those from the northeast, these however needed some attention. Fortunately the bed area had small stepping stones as a walkway by each door that allowed you to walk through the mud and water caused by excessive irrigation. My daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room was at the low end of the line and the irrigation combined with the drain from the ice machine formed a moat in front, a constant source of enjoyment for my three year old grandson and his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismay. In general the landscaping needs work. It has promise but has not had attention in a long time. The interiors of the hotel were clean and in good repair but seemed to be in need of something. I do not know the age of the Kona Kai but it gives the impression of an old resort that needs some TLC. Overall our stay was pleasant. Maid service was sufficient, although not efficient. Perhaps in keeping with the tropical theme the staff worked on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153island time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Our group for the wedding numbered about 80, all from out of the area, and the majority stayed at the Kona Kai. Most of us found that the dining options at the Kona Kai restaurant were a bit expensive for our tastes. I only ate one meal in the restaurant, breakfast on the last morning and while the meal was very good the cost exceeded what I would normally budget. Fortunately there are other options off premises, some within a pleasant walk. The only truly negative aspect of our stay occurred on Sunday evening. We had closed down the wedding reception and had gathered in a few groups, in rooms and by the pool, as we had done on the two previous evenings without issue. Obviously a new night security guard was in place this evening and recognizing the possibility of a noisy gathering he took interest. I fully understand his job and the responsibilities he has to the facility and its guests, however he needs training in the art of tact and diplomacy. His confrontational, disrespectful and threatening initial approach caused to escalate a non-existing situation. Fortunately a compromise was reached; we were given an area to continue our conversations and celebrations and even assisted with some of the amenities, the evening continued without incident. When I return to the San Diego area I probably will not choose to stay at the Kona Kai. It is a beautiful location and a nice facility but is far from its potential.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!!1\u201d", "Author": "guniey", "ReviewID": "UR62207259", "Content": "We made our reservations with Dennis Vinegas, a very nice gentleman who was very helpful and able to accommodate what we were looking for .

We love to walk along Shelter Island's Shoreside Park - the view includes downtown, Coronado Island, Point Loma, navy ships and cruise ships and an abundance of beautiful sailing ships! On an early morning walk, we can hear reveille being played at the Naval Station on Coronado and soon thereafter, the Star Spangled banner at the Submarine Staion on Point Loma. The walk on the north side of the resort is my husband's favorite. It follows along America's Cup Harbor and Marina where hundreds of sailboats are docked. He enjoys watching them sail in and out of the harbor. We've stayed in rooms on both sides of the resort and all have beautiful views. We enjoy the friendly and helpful staff, including the waiters in the large, beautiful restaurant where breakfast is such a treat! Oh, yes, that's a favorite of mine - the restaurant views are incredible and oatmeal brulee is delicious. In the gorgeous San Diego weather, we sometimes eat outside on the patio. The swimming pool and hot tub are beautiful and welcoming and the grounds are lovely! The beach area is a great place for children to play and there is another playground across the street at the park.

One thing that I did find unusal is that my cell phone charger wouldn't fit in the wall socket next to the AC, so I had to plug it in the bathroom wall socket, but definitely not a deal breaker. The only thing I didn't like was the hotel makes its guest pay for parking at $15/day and you had to pay to use the gym. I think parking and the gym should be free for guest.

(no elevator - had to carry bags up two flights of stairs) Room was the quality of a truck stop. Old furniture, small tv, few cable stations. Bathroom had light so dim, you couldn't see yourself in the mirror. If you were over five feet two inches, you had to bend down to get under the shower nozzle. Opening the closet door, we were once again hit with animal urine smell that since it had been closed up, it was so strong that it made me start coughing. Asked for another room. Got another one in the very same condition. Gave up since we had been traveling for twelve hours to get to the west coast and we were exhausted, so I asked them for room deodorizer spray. The faucets on the sink twirled in 360 degrees, so you had to keep turning them to get them to come on and shut off. Took a shower in the morning, and water wouldn't heat above luke warm. Walked out of the room and noticed the dirty dishes left on trays in front of two rooms next to us were still there from the night before. Headed off to go sight seeing and returned that evening, the dishes were still there and the hallway was very smelly from food left on the floor. Asked the front desk to have them removed. After two more calls over two more days, I finally called hotel manager and he seemed perturbed at the request. Said he would get them picked up immediately. Came back to my room in four hours, and one tray had been picked up and two others still remained. The hallway stunk, the room stunk... we stayed out as much as possible. The bed coverings also had animal urine smell.... I know that smell because I've had dogs all my life, and I know it well.

It was quiet, beautiful, and relaxing all in one. Dennis Vinegas, an employee there, set the reservation for the room for me. He set me up with the perfect room with an awesome view (Many thanks to Dennis!). The room was itself was cozy and comfortable, but it was the balcony that really did it for me. It was so relaxing just to sit on the balcony area and look out on the bay. Sleeping, we just left the balcony door open and let the bay breeze blow in to cool us down. Living in Vegas now, staying at the Kona Kai made me remember some of the things I truly miss the most about San Diego. The pool at the Kona Kai was a delight too. It was just as quiet and relaxing as our room. A pet peeve of mine is to be trying to relax at a pool while a bunch of young children splash you with water and scream the whole time. This was most definitely NOT the case here. Dining at the Kona Kai restaurant went just as well. My boyfriend and I couldn't resist and ordered 4 breakfast plates between the 2 of us. We opted to sit outside on the patio where the host told lead us to the table with what she dubbed as \"the perfect view\"....and she was right. We enjoyed our breakfast with a perfect view of both the bay and the hotel at a table with just the right amount of sunshine and a gentle breeze.

We tried looking online, but all of the rental car companies were charging an arm and a leg so we explained our predicament to the bellman, James, and he called around and got us a rental car for 1/3 of what other places were quoting us! He shuttled us to and from the airport. The hotel staff was incredibly helpful! They got us anything we need, from toothpaste to extra towels to reservations at restaurants. We opted for the $5 breakfast which was actually great! It was a full plate of food and compared to the other prices on the menu it was a steal! The restaurant staff even let me substitute toast for fruit without charging me $4. We had an issue with the screen door on our balcony not closing all the way and the front desk has maintenance there within 5 minutes! The grounds were beautiful and very well maintained. The island was so relaxing. It was great for a jog every morning. They had bikes you can rent for $5 for a half a day! To use the fitness center is was $10 a day, but between the pool and the mile long island you don't need to go to the gym. I truly can't say enough good things about this hotel. I loved it so much!

I was suppose to stay there for 2 nights with the wedding party I was with, but I only stayed one night and went back to the Kona Kai because I was so disappointed!

This charge should either be included into the room price, or absorbed by the hotel. This is a hotel without parking! Also, after dinner my wife wanted some water and ice. I covered the entire second floor of our building looking for an ice machine. Then I went downstairs to the lobby and asked about the location. I was told if I go down to room 115 and look for an exit that would be the ice machine. I gave them my special look and the receptonist took my ice bucket and went to the kitchen and got some ice for me. I thought that was nice, but I still didn't have the water. I went back looking for the ice machine. There was NO SIGN indicating that there may be ice and soda machines anywhere. Very poor service indeed! After a while I found the machines. They were hidden outside by the pool. I was on the second floor and there were no services available on our floor and NO signs directing you to the services either. The rooms were clean. The furniture in our room was well worn. I will say this for the Kona Kai and it's location: it was a very quiet place. The view of the city from our room was blocked by trees. So we got to look across the water at what appeared to be a military installation. Not too pretty. We did enjoy watching the fishermen retrieving pots and speculating on what they were catching. We also enjoyed the sounds of the seals barking... All in all, we had a good time despite the difficulties given us by the Kona Kai.

My fellow co-workers and I were there for a conference that was held at the resort and felt it was best to stay on premises. Looking back, I would have stayed off-site and rented a car to attend the conference. Upon check-in, the front desk staff was friendly and attentive. However, I was highly disappointed with the room. The room was a 1/2 step up from a typical motel room and for this being a \"resort\" I expected more. The bedding and carpet looked worn, lighting was horrible throught the room and bathroom. The paint in the bathroom needed to be re-done and there were signs of mold on the ceiling. The back of the bathroom door was peeling and the wood was exposed. The tub itself was stained and looked like it needed to be replaced. The bathroom counter was decorated in green tile and was the main decor of the bathroom. However, the grout was cracked and in need of replacement. My co-workers saw these same conditions in their rooms ( approx 4 other rooms). None of us used the gym facilities due to the additional $10 per visit charge. However, we did tour the facility and the equipment was in good condition. The Kona Kai website states that they are a beach resort. Yes, there is sand bank in the back of the resort that leads to the marina. Yes, you can lay out on the hotel provided lawn chairs but the water is very shallow and crowded with boats and you can not swim or walk in the water to cool off. I did not eat at the \"resort\" resturant since it was expensive. I know they catered some of the conference meals and the food quality was average. The banquet facilites were spacious and the outside landscaping was well maintained. In reference to the title of my review. I checked out of the hotel at the mandated check-out time ( 12:00pm). Upon checking out, I realized I had left some articles in the bathroom ( including jewlery). I returned to the hotel approx 3 hours later,..not the next day...not two days later...but shortly after our room had been serviced by housekeeping. The front desk attendent, front desk manager,security and houskeeping staff claimed that nothing was found in the room or turned in. At one point they told me they did not know who had cleaned the room, but then they told me the attendent that cleaned the room did not turn anything in. Not sure how they could be sure of that since they \"did not know who cleaned the room\". Finally after the run around and lack of response from the \"resort\" staff, I informed the front desk manager that for insurance purposes I was going to file the items as stolen with the Bay police. The front desk manager then insinuated that I had no grounds for filing a report since I had signed a form when I checked in that I would not hold the hotel responsible for lost/stolen items. I still filed a report and the Bay police are investigating the situation. Overall, I would not stay there again.

Another point to make is that this hotel charges you $10 just to use the gym!! I have never stayed anywhere where this occurs, what a nice perk for guests that was!

Plenty of free parking ont he street. Lille kids playground on their beach. Cons- Noisy at times at night. The walls do seem a bit thin but mostly when my neighbors ran water, it was very loud in my room and would wake me up. It was a Pro for me but could be a Con for you that the hotel is at the end of the isalnd and sort of removed from everything. Easily solved by renting a bike or car, though. One day the maid forgot to make up our room. :( The staff was fine but not overly friendly. Shuttle driver gave us good advice on places to eat.

Some tour buses and trolleys will pick up there, but if a taxi is needed, it's about $25 to downtown, Oldtown or Seaport Village. Not sure I'd stay there again, since it's not a great resort hotel and too far from sightseeing locations if you don't have a car. (Parking costs $15 per day) Would rather try one of the other hotels on the islnad that had equally great views.", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful location\u201d", "Author": "jstruck33", "ReviewID": "UR6034588", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights following a cruise to the Mexican Riviera.

Every time it was closed, it made a loud bang and it kept me up late and woke me up early. There was no other room available so I had to put up with it. Also, this hotel doesn't have a nice pool if that's one thing that you're looking for. The only plus about the property is its location. It has a nice view of the harbor.

I was worried after some of those reviews that I made a bad decision, I even had other hotels staked out incase. I did not have to worry. This was the perfect spot for what I was looking for. Though there was a mustiness to the hotel room, it did not smell BAD, opening the sliding glass wiindow onto the patio took care of that. The bathroom was small and yes a little worn, but it was clean. The pool was great but if you want some quiet, don't go on a weekend, too many teens and children. The room service was excellent, we ordered dinner twice and breakfast - it took 20 to 30 minutes just like they said and everything was hot. Their restaurant was very nice inside and out, I especially liked it outside as it overlooked the bay and felt private. Their bar was nice but it seems they only take your orders at poolside on Saturdays. However, a little cooler with drinks is perfect, the ice machine is close enough. We had initially booked the Marina View, that wasn't ready at time of check-in and received a room in the 210-217 portion above the lobby. This was great it was the closest to the Bay, laying on the bed we could see the water and a little patch of green. We had a great time sitting out on the porch watching everyone walking with their dogs and enjoying themselves. I looked around and a lot of the ocean views had too much parking lot as part of it. I recommend this part of the building highly. Because this hotel is at the end, it gets less car traffic. I spent a lot of time walking around the bay and marina - it is pretty enough that if you choose not to go anywhere you still get to be out of the hotel grounds and enjoy the scenery. I never once thought this place was noisy, I'm not sure if the people by the doors and ice machines felt the same way, so you may ask and be sure you are not in a traffic path. I was looking for a quiet and laid back place with no frills but clean, this was it.", "Date": "July 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "WestMItraveller", "ReviewID": "UR5419991", "Content": "I was a little worried about this hotel after reading some of the very negative reviews, but our stay at Shelter Pointe exceeded my expectations. The location of the hotel is perfect, it is a 10 minute drive to anywhere in San Diego. The rooms were clean and nice, a little humid, but very nice. It is true that it isn't extremely quiet in the hotel, but we didn't hear any conversations or get woken up early in the morning. You can just hear kids outside by the pool and doors slamming in the other rooms, but it is not too bad. The hotel grounds are so beautiful, it is located in a great spot. Basically any room you have would be very nice. We reserved the cheaper room and were on the first floor with a patio out to the pool courtyard, and this was great. The pool and beach are very nice, it seems like a great place to take a family. It is annoying that parking is an extra $15 a day and they don't warn you about this, but it is really nice to park just outside the door of your building and not have to hastle with street parking or anything like that. We never ate at the hotel restaurant, but there is plenty of good dining nearby. Downtown is only 10 minutes away, and you can find anything you would want there. We ate at Miguel's Mexcian restaurant one night, it is on the corner of Scott St. & Shelter Island Drive, it was good and inexpensive. So if you have a reservation here, don't cancel it just because of those negative reviews. I was very impressed with the hotel and the grounds, and there is so much to do in San Diego that you'll never be in your room anyway.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cHidden charges\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5338112", "Content": "They are one of those hotels with annoying hidden charges.

The beds were double sheeted--a nice touch, because who likes to touch hotel blankets?! We never heard any noise from adjacent rooms. The resort is situated in a beautiful location--Shelter Island. Both sides have views of yachting marinas. The pool area was beautiful---a good sized pool and hot tub, tons of nice cushy lounge chairs, etc...all with a view of the marina. I didn't have much interaction with the hotel staff, but the housekeeping was always thorough and timely. The location is also good...the island feels intimate, but you are very close to Point Loma and about a ten minute drive from downtown, the Gaslamp Quarter, Old Town, etc. Overall, I highly recommend this for couples and for families---a nice little playground on the premises and another just a short walk down the island.", "Date": "May 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cIncredible\u201d", "Author": "mikeyjgross", "ReviewID": "UR4595570", "Content": "Stayed here on a quick vacation swing through San Diego.

The gentleman at the front desk offered to lower our rate for the trouble, yet he lowered it to the regular rate of the room we ended up in.

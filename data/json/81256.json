Also, not human-friendly from what I can tell. Okay, I admit that I did not end up staying at this motel, however, I did try. Now that I've met the staff, I will never stay at Rodeway. I had a negative experience with the male/female couple operating the front desk tonight. Basically, I was already staying in a nicer hotel around the corner, and took my dog out for a late night stroll. When I noticed the Rodeway sign, I remembered that I had a 'dirt cheap' coupon for it in my tourist packet. I went to the night-window to ask if they allow dogs. They turned me away, which isn't a big deal, but it was the manner in which they did so which frustrated me. I realize the area is crappy, and there are 'crazies' lining the street at night, but I come from a upscale neighborhood and I hold a graduate's degree. I know that doesn't make me more important, but I suppose I'm not used to being dismissed in such a way. I was respectful of them and would have liked them to reciprocate that etiquette towards me. I don't know what I expected from a cheap motel. Perhaps other people already 'bothered' them by attempting to bring in a dog earlier tonight. Perhaps they were having a couples' squabble. Perhaps my hair looked disheveled because I decided to walk Ginger one last time before bed. Perhaps it's a cultural difference and they make awful faces at everyone.Perhaps it was because they are just plain rude. :-| The bottom line is that I stopped by as a *potential future customer* and I left offended. There are polite ways to tell people their motels don't allow pets, especially considering that pet-people might return to San Francisco without their dogs one day. Rodeway Inn left such a bad impression on me that I feel compelled to let reviewers know about it!", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR639641546", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "30somethingVegan"}, {"Content": "Still a good deal...barely Can you still get a decent room with free parking in a safe neighborhood within a mile of Moscone Center in San Francisco for under $100? Yes, but just barely, on most nights, if you get here early. That\u9225\u6a9a because the parking is limited, so if you get in late on a full night you may have to park on the street.

I could hear noise from the street outside but no more than I would expect in the middle of the city. There were homeless people around but the ones I met were friendly and it wasnt that much trouble to turn down thier requests for money.I had a little over 5 minutes to the Muni at either Van Ness or the Civic Centre, busses ran from Van Ness just round the corner and a couple of days I walked in to Union Square, about 20 minutes. I had to be aware of where I was when in the Tenderloin but I never felt in any danger at any time.I only slept in the hotel, I left early and came back late but the horror stories dont ring true for me.

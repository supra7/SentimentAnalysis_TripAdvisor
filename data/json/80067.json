Though I skipped it I was informed of a free breakfast buffet from 6am to 9am in the morning. Getting to my room involved walking up three flights of stairs (no elevator located in the hotel) and I was initially concerned as the lobby, stairs and hallways smelled of cigarette smoke. Upon entering my room I was pleased to find that it smelled normal and there was no trace of smoke. The bed was amazingly comfortable (they added an aftermarket pillow top cover) and the three pillows per bed were also quite comfy. The hotel provided free Wi-Fi and satellite TV with many channels. The bathroom was normal with the average soaps and shampoos provided though I used my own. The only caution would be the surface of the bathtub/shower was slippery and I almost fell once. There are no bars or surface features to catch yourself should you slip. All in all for the price I was impressed. I had a good nights sleep in my quiet room and I would stay again.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cMr. Rocky E Mountain , Quality Hotel Manager\u201d", "Author": "jeffscottbecker", "ReviewID": "UR121810509", "Content": "I had 3 day\"s to prepare for a trip from Alabama(my home of 12 years) to my home state of California. Everything about the trip was on the fly... Through a random set of circumstances I ended up in Mira Mesa, It was late and I decided to stay near S.D. airport, instead of with the Family in Huntington beach, putting me 1 1/2 hours closer to my end destination. Once again, I luck up on a great deal. The room at the Quality Inn was cleaner than my suite at Hyatt place the previous week and $30 cheaper. The cleaning crew does what they are paid to do,they make it clean! They don't just make it look nice, right down to the dusting. Most people don't pay attention the details, Good Job Ladies! A good sized room, w/ VERY COMFORTABLE King bed and a large desk for a workplace. Also a smaller round glass table w/ 2 Fat chairs`and an television in its entertainment center. Plenty of storage space for the traveler, (i.e Closet, Drawers, and Shelves.) Everything was well placed, very effective use of space, well thought out or they just got lucky... Also the location, right off the 15 freeway, was perfect! $1.50 washed and dried a load of clothes, detergent is $1 at the front desk. The staff, Professional and friendly, just like Mr. Rocky E. Mountain. Please show this to your staff, sir. They should know their hard work was noticed and appreciated. Thank You.

I must say the rooms are very nice for the price. In fact they are very large almost like junior suites and they give you 2 seperate bedrooms. We had 4 adults so it was very nice. It even had a sofa that one of the adults liked sleeping on. They have a basic but nice pool area and a hot tub next to the pool that was relaxing. The casino is smaller by Vegas standards and very smokey. For some reason they really must cator to smokers cause every slot and video poker machine had a smoker at it. Because of the casinos smaller size the ventilation system cant handle it and the smokey haze is all over the place. The buffet was small but very cheap like 5 bucks for breakfast. One nice alternative is that Arizona Charlies is only a couple of blocks from Boulder Station and Sams Town Casinos. They are much larger and much nicer. They have huge buffets that are the same price as Charies but way nicer. So simple sleep at Charlies cause it is nice. Then spend the rest of the time at the other places a block or 2 down the street. The folks that work at Charlies are very nice and work very hard.

There's a new Walmart Supercenter across from Sam's Town. Hotel: The hotel has several buildings. We think they are in good condition. We had a (big) corner room facing the (cold) pool. We were pleasantly surprised as this room turned out the a two room, two bed 'suite'. Though there's not a lot of furniture in the rooms..there's a sofa and two tv's. The bathroom is ok, but the fan is really(i mean REALLY) loud (goes on when you turn on the light). The carpet was brand new and we noticed they were replacing carpets in other buildings to. Icemachines are not located on every floor so prepare to hike... Pool : Small, but has a hot tub as well. Plenty of good seats and beds, both in shade and sun. Towels are provided, but we found the box empty most of the time. A call to housekeeping was enough to fill the box again though. Parking: Though quite a pain at night, during the day there's enough parking availabe. At night just use the free valet service if you don't want to wait for a free spot. Casino: We didn't gamble here, but found the casino a bit cramped and smokey. Registration is in the Casino. The other reception they used to have south of the hotel towers is closed now. Buffet: We were pleasantly surprised. We had breakfast here and the quality of the food is good. They cook eggs to order and have fresh donuts.

Access to a vehicle is a must, esp. in the summer. The temp. was triple digit teens the whole time we we there. A few large Casinos are nearby but everything is a drive. The Rooms- They are as the other reviews state; nothing fancy.We rented two King Double suites. Two rooms,Two beds, T.V.'s couch,table and ample storage for clothes. We kept Three bicycles in one suite with room to spare. The corner suite was a little bigger. And the sink in the room was funky. I tried to be critical of everything knowing that I would write a review, and really could'nt find anything wrong. No mystery stains, comfy beds and sanitary toilets. Tokeing housekeeping got fresh towels. We paid rack rates , thur arrival and Mon. departure and it came to $400 total for both rooms! Such a deal. If you're a family traveling on a budget, this is a very good value for your hard earned cash. The Casino- Plenty of Penny and Nickle machines. Lots of video poker and keno. Most are older (1 or 2 years) It was never crowded, and finding a machine was pretty easy. A small but decent Race and sports book. It closed early though, so if you like to play Harness, go to Sams Town down the street. Bingo can be had 24-7. We played a few times. Games called rather quick Payouts were good. Table games were small and a seat could be found even at peak times. Only two crap tables. Lounge act was rather silly but better than the drone of slots. No live Keno. Not too smokey. Lots of locals. The food- Basic eats. The Buffet was inexpensive, Hot food, Fresh and plenty of it. We ate at least one of our meals of the day there and everyone walked away full, even the picky teens. Same for the 24 hr.Sourdough Cafe. Try their Strawberry shortcake. If you eat the whole thing and get sick, it's your fault. The Staff- I did'nt find a single Grouch. Everyone was happy and helpful. A rare thing indeed. Overall- Because the Hotel is separate from the Casino, One must walk outside to and fro. This creates the problem of walking around at all hours with large sums of cash in hand. the staff has provided Armed Security Guards on bicycles roaming the property.

That takes alot of patience - you don't often see much of that in the customer service industry anymore. Thanks again, Elenora! The property differs slightly from the Decatur location as all of the corridors and buildings are outside vs. being enclosed. The decor of the rooms is a little more Mediterranean vs. southwestern, as the Decatur location is.

The bedroom had another tiny TV/amoir, with a fair mattress, and the sink (single) RIGHT NEXT to the bed. The pillows were small, and the linens were stingy (only two bath, hand and wash towels). 5) We called the front desk to get some additional pillows around 6PM, and no one ever came.

Almost all the rooms were sold out in Las Vegas for the days of the convention. The few that were available were going for $400 plus, so this seemed like a good deal for $39 (through hotwire) a night during a busy convention week. We stayed Tuesday-Friday. LOCATION This is on Boulder Highway, far off the strip, and they do not have shuttle service to the strip. We had a car, so location wasn't that big of deal, but don't stay here unless you have a car. Boulder Station and Sam's Town are on either side (long walk or short drive). CHECK-IN We checked in about 11:30 AM. The clerk first told us they were completely booked, and all we could get was a double room, and no rooms were ready yet. We slipped her a $20 and she found a King/double smoking suite that was ready for check-in. Note that the front of the hotel is under construction, so you need to go through the casino entrance and check in there. ROOM The room was barely adequate, but can't really complain for the price we got. First, the good. It was spacious. It was close to the pool, but looked out on the parking lot and the 7-11 next door, but was pretty quiet with little road noise. Fairly clean, with a stain here and there on the carpet. Also the windows open up, which is nice for fresh air and a breeze. It had two rooms. A large front room with a double bed w/end table, sofa w/end table, coffee table, armoire with drawers, and small tv (reception was clear for us, but only 8 channels, no HBO, etc. you could order movies.) The second room was a bit tight with a King bed, a corner unit with another small tv, and a sink stand. It also had a large walk-in closet. I found the bed to be fairly hard, and the pillows were very uncomfortable. The bathroom was tiny with a toilet, and a tub/shower combo. It was dingy and old with some mildew in the tile caulking. Shower pressure was ok, but not great. Shampoo and lotion for products. Be aware that the rooms have no amenities except for an alarm clock. There is no hairdryer, iron, ironing board (although i guess you can request them, although they don't make this known, but i did see one housekeeper removing one from a room), coffee maker, fridge or microwave. There is only dial-up internet access, with a 75 cent per connection fee. Also, there was only one ice maker that I could find and it was at the opposite end of the complex, there was no ice maker near the pop machine at our end. THE GROUNDS The units all surround and open up to a courtyard. There is landscaping and paths to the casino, with a courtyard sitting area toward the casino end of the courtyard, a fountain in the middle area, and a pool area w/hot tub at the far end. There is always security around on bikes, so the grounds seemed safe. We used the pool twice and it was very uncrowded considering the place was full. They have lots of deck chairs that you can use in the sun or in a shaded area they have. The hot tub wasn't very hot, but was ok. (I noticed the reviewer below said there was no pool, but I think she must have been in the wrong area of the courtyard, because there most definitely is a pool). CASINO We were in the unit farthest away from the Casino, but I didn't find the walk through the courtyard that long to get there; I have walked farther to get to the casino in large strip hotels. The casino was fairly small by las vegas standards. But gaming is cheap and it was never super crowded. Video Poker makes up the majority of the machines. There aren't that many tables, but I rarely saw them all full. We won some, and were up a couple hundred on our second day there, but managed to lose most of our gambling money by the end. Cocktail service was good and friendly. Lots of locals seemed to game here, and they were all friendly and fun. RESTAURANTS There is the Wild West Buffet, The Sourdough Cafe, The Yukon Grille Steakhouse, and a deli for sandwiches and fast-food type stuff. The prices for food are extremely reasonable, and friendly service. We ate at the Sourdough Cafe for breakfast several times and a couple other meals. The ham and egg special for $2.79 is huge. They also had a steak and egg special for $2.99, the steak was a little tough, but had good flavor. My bf's favorite was the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes he had one night for $4.99. We also tried the Yukon Grille Steakhouse one night, it was reasonable, but underwhelming. I had the small filet medium rare, which was overcooked and tasteless, and my bf had prime rib, which he didn't enjoy at all (I have a feeling you could do the prime rib in the studio cafe for $7.99 and would get the same thing). Each entree was about $18. With a bottle of wine, salads, two entrees, and a shared dessert, the total was only $75, but I would rather spend more for really good steak. Overall, I wouldn't stay here again unless circumstances required it. But if you are doing las vegas on a tight budget, it is not a bad value for your money.", "Date": "April 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bakersfield, Ca", "Title": "\u201cRun to Another Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "gameday95", "ReviewID": "UR4591604", "Content": "We stayed with my daughter's soccer team and it was awful from the beginning. We got there late Friday night and when we checked we assumed we were getting a non smoking room but when we went to our room , it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches in the room. The TV was from the 1980's and had only a few channels and ghost image on one of the channel's. Try watching Jay Leno with a ghost image of him in the TV. I called to change room and the from desk stated that no room were available until the next day. I stated to the from desk that I wanted a non smoking room and the from assured me they would be room available. I called three different times , the next day and they told me to call later. That the room were not availAble yet. I went downstairs, by elevator which has no up button , you can only press the button to down The front desk person got a non smoking room for me. I walked back to the room with the smell of fertilizer and view of dead grass. The suite's bathroom was the size of a closet and i had to dry off in the bathtub for more room. Need I say more.

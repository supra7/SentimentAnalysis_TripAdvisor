This was the perfect hotel, and I can't recommend it strongly enough. The price was very reasonable -- obviously there are tons of great hotels in the area, but for the price this one can't be beat. Location is two blocks off Canal Street, and threfore two blocks from the French Quarter. It was a very short walk, totally safe at night, etc. It is also close to the Harrahs casino, which was a plus. The staff was EXCELLENT. In particular I want to name Sarah, who worked at the front desk, as being extremely helpful. I hope they know that she is a superstar and put her on a manager track -- otherwise they will lose her to the Ritz or one of the other top hotels around. But she was teriffic - helpful as can be at every opportunity. But honestly, that applied to the entire staff, the managers, etc. Everyone was teriffic there. The rooms were nice and spaceous. I had a jacuzzi suite, which cost the same as a standard room at the Marriott just two blocks away. It was well worth it. My one complaint was that I didn't love the bed, but it wasn't awful or anything -- just not my own bed that I love. As a comparison, the first two nights of my trip (April 5-6) we stayed at the Iberville Suites, which is a sister-hotel to the Ritz Carlton. I would recommend the Omni Royal Crescent over the Iberville Suites in a heartbeat. Thanks to Sarah and the rest of the staff at the Omni Royal Crescent for a fantastic experience. It's a great hotel, and I'll stay there again next time I'm back in NOLA.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "missbeckah83", "ReviewID": "UR128410424", "Content": "I have stayed here twice and absolutely love this hotel.

My first complaint, though, is the failure of this hotel with regard to me being a black-level Omni guest. Black is the highest level with Omni hotels and one of the benefits to being black-level is the complimentary double-upgrade provided. Essentially, this should guarantee getting a suite at the time of check-in. While I just recently stayed at the hotel, I have made reservations several times in the last couple months only to be told that \"no suites were available\". If I can book a suite online, there is a suite available - the hotel, however, seems to have a policy of stating they are all booked to avoid giving the upgrade. So of course when I went to check in this time there were no suites available. I know the above may sound snobby, but I travel extensively all year and whether it is airlines, hotels or rental cars, I have one or two brands with whom I deal exclusively due to the perks associated with my membership. I find it very frustrating when hotels choose to deny those benefits - it makes one question why one is loyal to that brand. Moreover, I was given a room on the second floor without even a window. I simply find it hard to believe there were no suites available on a Wednesday night. Otherwise, the hotel is a great location - on a nice, quiet street just a block off of Canal. The casino is a few blocks away, as is the French Quarter, the Superdome, etc. The decor of the hotel was classic and well-done - certainly had a nice luxury feel to it. The gym was lacking for anyone who takes working out seriously. If going to the gym involves a treadmill or elliptical machine for you, then you are fine. If you like lifting weights and really \"working out\", don't plan on using the hotel's gym. I found the hotel staff to be professional and polite and the service overall was excellent. My review of this hotel would have been 100% favorable if I were not at the highest level of their loyalty program but in a standard room without any windows.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morgantown, WV", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Alternative to Big Conference Hotels\u201d", "Author": "Sunster1", "ReviewID": "UR128242391", "Content": "I chose to stay here instead of the Sheraton where my conference was because they offered a government rate within my per diem.

I stayed in a King room (250 sq ft) with plenty of space and a large well appointed bathroom with a whirlpool tub. It was very clean and comfortable with many pleasant touches (bathrobes, nice amenities, good coffee, and unobtrusive evening service) The front desk staff and bartender made me feel so welcome - remembering my name all week and responding to every request I had. I will stay here every year for this meeting and encourage others to defect from the huge hotels. The only thing I did not love about the room, was the lack of a window made me feel a little closed up, but I had requested a quiet room so that's probably why I was placed in an interior room.

The new room was large and comfortable with three nice windows. Then I found out the WiFi doesn't work in room 501. The staff is very friendly and helpful about some things, but they insisted I call an 800 number to fix the WiFi.

The hotel is in a convenient location - close to downtown, Canal Street, the French Quarter - we walked everywhere. Arrival and parking were easy.

There is no pool at this hotel - there is a sundeck on the 5th floor. There are chairs and a hot tub. The fitness center is also located on the sundeck (inside) - it seemed small, but we didn't use it. There were a couple of not-so-great things about the room. The sconces on the bathroom mirror had fallen slightly, so there was jagged mirror around the lights (they were high enough and on the mirror that it didn't matter). The shower doors were also strange - it is less than 1/2 covered with a glass door - water got all over the floor - easy to work around with extra towels.

We are staying here as I type this, Easter Sunday 2012, to celebrate out wedding anniversary with a trip to NOLA and a Jacuzzi suite. The room did resemble the one on the website in a tired and worn out kind of way. I took the bed spread off the bed put it in a closet and went to go put the blanket from the plastic bag in the closet on the bed. There was a short dark curly hair on it (I am a dark blonde, it was not mine). I had room service bring another and as I was turning down the bed I found that THE SHEETS WERE STAINED. I would think they would take stained sheets out of circulation. I had to ask for another. I went to take a shower and the Jacuzzi tub had black mildew in the grout along its edges and covering the caulking. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imaging what would be in the pipes. On our way back from dinner I bought a large bottle of bleach at the cover CVS and poured it down the walls, and in the tub (mildew was growing around the jets). It did help some.

One more thing, they give you beads to put on your door. Red for do not disturb and green for maid service.

The plusses -- it is on side street that is very quiet with little street noise. The bed was fairly comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and service-oriented. It is in a great location for accessing the French Quarter and also for catching streetcars. The negatives -- the room is quite small and space is lacking to store things in the bathroom.

It looked like half a shower door was missing, but this was obviousy the intent as there were no screw holes on the other side. Every time we took a shower, water splattered all over the floor, leaving puddles. Also, the towels, though thick, felt like sandpaper. The shower took about 5-10 minutes before the water got hot, it was lukewarm before that. TV reception on several channels was marginal.

For example, there was absolutely no counter space. There is barely enough counter space for one person's toiletries. We ended up having to put things on the top of the toilet. Also, the shower is tiny and there was a large, immovable bench in the shower. This is a great resource for the elderly or disabled but, for us, it was just a nuisance. Forget about taking a shower with your partner! The towels were very big, wrapping around the entire body, but they were not soft. It felt faintly of sandpaper. The room itself was small, the curtains didn't open all the way, the windows didn't open and there was a very bright light shining directly into our room from a parking lot across the street. There were no convenient outlets near the bed unless you moved the end table away from the wall and unplugged either the light or the alarm clock (I chose the alarm clock since I use my phone alarm). There is no breakfast or coffee in the lobby. They just have fresh water with lemon. Internet access is not free. It's around $10 a night.

It's a free signup and only takes a few minutes but they don't tell you about this right away. Finally, valet parking costs $30 a night.

Generally we couldn't hear people in other rooms with the exception of one room being particularly loud late one night. We could also hear trash being picked up on the street early in the morning. This noise never woke either of us up in the morning, but if we already happened to be awake we could hear it. I'm not a light sleeper so the noise never bothered me too much but I'm guessing if you are a light sleeper that it would be difficult to sleep late at night or early in the morning.

We planned this trip at the last minute and therefore our choice of hotels was understandably limited. We like luxury properties and Omni seemed like the best value for our travel dates. Handwritten welcome note was a nice touch. There wasn't much character here (unlike their sister property) but the location is fantastic and the room was spotless. They accommodated my request for a high floor but put us right next to the elevator when I requested to be away from it. We didn't say anything because I knew how busy it was and figured they did the best they could given their availability. Our loyalty club preferences also included extra pillows and the local newspaper. We got neither. Again, something I could've flagged but for a luxury hotel especially, I don't think I should've had to. Certainly not dealbreakers at all, just an observation. When the tub didn't drain they fixed it straightaway (we are human and things do happen) but when we mentioned the Internet was faulty the response we got was not very hospitable: try it again and if it doesn't work someone will look at it. I got a similar less-than-hospitable answer when I inquired about needing a cab to the airport. That said, the evening front desk agent was only too happy to help us with dinner reservations. Overall, if you're looking for a nice hotel in a good location, this is a good choice. If you're expecting a four star hotel WITH consistent four star service there are better options. On a sidenote - the day before we left I noticed availability at their sister property opened up. I did ask about switching our reservation but was told it could not be done which I thought was odd. Also, their sister property offers a complimentary new years party for guests - Omni crescent guests are not invited even though the room rates are the same. Would I stay at Omni again? Yes.

I was hesitant to stay outside of the quarter only because I considered the area a second home, but I was SO glad I made the move. The price was cheaper, my room was bigger, the staff is incredibly nice and it's close enough to the quarter to feel like you're in it, but quiet enough to know that you're not. If you're a first-timer to New Orleans and are looking to have fun and be part of the action, I would recommend the Omni Royal Orleans. But, if you still want to sleep at night and avoid the crowd that the quarter attracts, this is the best hotel you can stay at across Canal. I do have a couple of complaints though, hence the 4 stars....if you're looking to work off those po'boys and gumbo, don't expect to do anything but run in the gym. The room is incredibly small and only really has cardio equipment. The pool is miniscule and is basically a hot tub. The roof-top pool at the other Omni is great and offers a beautiful view of the city but for some reason they're unwilling to let guests from the Omni Royal Crescent use it.

Therefore, the whole bathroom is wet after every time someone takes a shower. b. There is no fan/vent in the bathroom c. One day we were left a towel with what appeared to be dried blood (or some other red spots) on it. d. It's quite a small bathroom 4. Housecleaning is okay (based on 3c above) and while they changed our sheets, they did leave a pillow case with some holes in it (could be due to moths or cigarette burns). 5. The water bottle in the hotel is $6, and there's no wireless but the staff was happy to let you use their computer in the back if you needed it. 6. The fitness center is just okay- 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals and 1 bike. We weren't in our room that often so it wasn't too bad. It didn't make our vacation better or worse.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, terrific value, would definitely stay again\u201d", "Author": "DavKat", "ReviewID": "UR118373032", "Content": "Lovely smallish (approx. 90 rooms) hotel just a few blocks from the French Quarter.

However, my stay was rather mixed and I want to highlight both the good and the bad. Good: the aforesaid fantastic service. The location is close to both the French Quarter, the Warehouse District, and only a block or so from the St. Charles Ave. streetcar line. My room was clean, with modern decor and a comfortable bed. The bathroom shower had lots of pressure. Bad: No doorman or bellman that I could see, but i didn't need one. My room did not have a luggage rack, so I had to call the front desk. One was brought immediately. My door squeaked loudly, so I again called the desk and, again, it was taken care of immediately. The air conditioner controls are rather basic (low, medium, or high) and the air blows right on you when you're in bed. The bathroom layout is horrible and there is no way two people could be in there at one time. There is only a half glass panel for the shower, so my bathroom floor flooded every morning. My biggest complaint was the noise. The windows are not double paned and so I heard every car with a stereo that drove by. On Saturday night there was an insistent bass thump coming from somewhere so at midnight I finally had to put the earbuds in my ear and fall asleep to R.E.M. Yes, it's quieter than the French Quarter, but that's a rather low bar. I was looking forward to 4 nights of great sleep and didn't get much more than in my noisy apartment back home. My room was next to the ice machine and the linen closet so during the day it was non-stop door slamming by the cleaning staff, which seemed to start rather early and precluded any naps. This is not a bad hotel by any stretch of the imagination, and has many advantages. If you're a sound sleeper, it's great.

We received emails and phone calls prior to the trip to see if there was any thing we needed to make our stay better. We were upgraded to a suit at no additional charge. I booked a great deal thru the Omni website that included breakfast and valet parking. The corner room was very large and comfortable with large sets of windows creating a panoramic view with lots of sun in the day and city lights at night. Very clean every where. It was also quiet which can be challenging in New Orleans in certain areas. It is just a few blocks off Canal St. in the Central Business District among other tall buildings which provided a city view from our high floor. The area seemed exceptionally safe even late at night. Being a fitness enthusiast, the short walk to The French Quarter is nice because of all fantastic food that is available everywhere. We parked the car using valet parking and did not use the car again until we departed. The bellmen were friendly and great with ALL of our luggage and bags. We had 2 carts of baggage due to an extended driving trip from Georgia to Texas we were on. The room allowed for lots of storage space without being cramped in the least. The breakfast buffet was sufficient and maintained by a great staff. The only issue I had with the room is the 'shower door' was a hinged panel of glass that only enclosed the shower a little over half way. It was impossible to take a shower without soaking the bathroom floor - good thing the bathroom was huge and there was an 'powder room' in the living room of the suit. Also, the refrigerator did not get very cold but they may simply be a feature for energy efficiency. Some of the decor could be updated to match the parts that have been remodeled better but it is sill nice. I really didn't like the mirrors in the hall by the elevators - it makes it feel dated - but it is all well maintained. THE STAFF IS THE BEST! We met the General Manager at check-in. He was standing at the front desk greeting people and working along side his staff. I'm not sure I have seen that at a hotel before but will say that I believe he is the reason his staff is so outstanding. The saying goes 'stuff rolls down hill', that applies to GOOD as well as BAD.

This hotel is beautiful, and it looked like it has been renovated not too long ago. I think the selling point of this hotel is their customer service and location. The hotel is out of the French Quarter and is in a quieter part of the CBD, but when booking this hotel please request that you get an upper floor room because the windows are old and do not block out much street noise. My trip started off HORRIBLE. My partner and I were driving into New Orleans for a concert, and we got stuck in some serious traffic and delayed our arrival by about two hours. Both of us were in a rush to get checked-in and get ready so we could head out to the show. With that being said, you could only imagine how frustrated I was with the numerous amount of delays. The icing on the cake was when I finally made it into New Orleans, the street that this hotel is located on (Gravier St) was closed because of some construction or something. We could not park in front of the hotel, so we had to drive several blocks away just to even park our car to check in - AND it was raining. Now, I know this is out of the control of the hotel since the city blocked off the street, but what annoyed me more than anything is that when I checked in to see what my parking options were (since obviously it wasn't going to be valet), the lady, who I believe was named Sarah, told me that I could drive around again and give my keys to to the valet guys at the LaQuinta across the street. She suggested this because supposedly both the Omni and the LaQuinta use the same parking garage for their valet service. WTF? How is this valet? It was very inconvenient and I felt very uncomfortable giving my car away to another hotel. We decided not to even do that and self-parked at the Whitney Bank garage instead. This was not fun and we had to make several trips back and forth from the garage to bring all of our luggage in. I only wished that the hotel would have called me to let me know that there was going to be trouble getting to the hotel since the streets were closed, so I would have taken an alternative route and made adjustments for parking. Other that that the hotel is nice and is great for the money we paid. The hotel is small, but it felt more intimate than some of the larger hotels in New Orleans (Sheraton/Marriott). The staff is extremely friendly and will greet you everytime you pass through the lobby, but it can be a little superficial after a while. The rooms are very nice, and are comparable to The Roosevelt Hotel (Waldorf Astoria) in New Orleans. The furniture was of higher quality than of other chain hotels as well. Biggest tip that I can give you is to sign up for the Select Guest rewards program through the Omni website. This allowed us to get free internet, morning beverages, and a newspaper.

Relatively speaking the value for money is good too. We stayed a total of 4 nights in two separate stays. Our first few nights really left us with the impression that management wasn't around much. The front desk staff were superficially polite but very slow to actually help. I called ahead to arrange a crib in the room, which wasn't done. When we got to the hotel I asked again and hours later it still wasn't done. Asking about local tours or restaurant options wasn't something they were very helpful with either. They were basically there to just check people in and out and not much else. You really got the feeling they were going through the motions and doing the bear minimum. Getting a luggage trolley was also very hard. We had many items and on more than one occassion they had no idea where to find it. One staff member claimed to have never seen one. We accidently left an empty suitase in the closet of our room. I called 2 days later to find that they had no record of any such item. It just vanished, and they weren't too concerned about it. So, be very wary of leaving anything behind here. Odds are it will disappear. I checked in again 3 days after my original stay and had a very different experience. I was greeted by what seemed to be a manager who was very attentive. Our previous stay really left me with a poor impression of the hotel. The facilities themselves were fair, just a bit run down. Chipped furniture, and cracked sinks aren't such a big deal if you have good people running the hotel. By all means if you know New Orleans very well and just need somewhere to lay your head choose this hotel. If you want a hotel with a friendly, conscientious staff who can help you with your stay, this is not the hotel for you. There is an inconsistency in the quality of staff.

Trolley stops along Canal Street make it easy to get to most tourist spots within the city, including the cemetaries, garden district and riverwalk. The trolley from Canal Street to the French Market is under construction this summer, however, it is really not far to walk through the French Quarter to Cafe du Monde and the shops. The hotel staff are some of the best I have ever encountered. Anna was especially friendly and charming throughout my multi-day stay. The hotel reflects an aged elegance and is quite cozy. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. My only real issue with this hotel was the noise from the street (there is a night club a couple of doors down from the hotel) and noise from nearby rooms. The second night I was there a couple with children checked into the room next to mine and one of the kids screamed ALL night and everyone at our end of the short hallway endured it. I travel with ear-plugs and they could not even block that out. I had never experienced this level of noise from a nearby room. Had it not been for this incident, the only noise would have been from the street below--which I assumed was due to the old windows which may be part of the original facade and therefore un-fixable in a historic district. However, noise from nearby rooms and the hallway should be dealt with. Another caveat is the room I had was VERY small, which was not a problem for me as I was traveling by myself to a conference, however, might be a problem for a couple. But then again, the hotel may assign rooms based on number of people staying in the room and therefore a couple would not be assigned to a very small room. The historic details of the rooms (odd shape, floor-to-ceiling paned windows, moldings etc) were part of the charm of the hotel, so if you like old buildings you will probably enjoy your stay here. Were it not for the noise issues I experienced while staying here I would have given the hotel 4-stars, however, due to the noise I am not sure I would stay here again and therefore don't want to give it too high a rating.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cQuiet Friendly Oasis\u201d", "Author": "FoodNomad53", "ReviewID": "UR114802659", "Content": "This is a relatively small, almost boutique-like hotel just two blocks from Canal Street and the French Quarter.

The hotel is exceptional in every way. Let me just point out how they achieved this distinction. Before I even arrived at the hotel I had experienced a reservation agent who was kind and helpful. The rates were outstanding for New Orleans but especially for a hotel of this class. A couple days before I arrived there was an advanced check-in offered. When I arrived at the hotel it took me about 3 minutes to get to my room. My room was small but it was comfortable and spotless. The bed was very comfortable. The air conditioning worked well. The bathroom was spotless and well equipped. I had the usual amenitites such as robes and a nice coffee pot. The maid left me extra coffee every day. I asked for a refrigerator and it arrived in about 5 minutes. So check this out. I had some friends staying at a nearby hotel who wanted to come over and drink some excellent old wine they had brought for us to try. I needed a wine decanter. The front desk checked with the restaruant and they did not have one. So the front desk folks went to work and found a great substitute for me. The polished it up and even provided some clean filter material and wine glasses. This is above and beyond the call. When I wanted to print my boarding pass they did not just point me at a public computer. They printed it for me and had it at the front desk for me to pick up. They have wireless internet and it was free to club members. (Club membership is free also by the way.) And the internet was pretty fast unlike most hotel wireless. THe restaurant is small, great food and affordable. I was not very hungry one evening so the chef made me a moderate sized dish of red beans and rice with cajun sausage which was just right. You have to try their hamburgers by the way. They are excellent. Every member of the staff had a smile for me and many remembered my name. I really felt at home and well cared for. I travel a lot and I believe hold the bar pretty high. This hotel really got my attention. When I return to New Orleans I will not even think of staying anywhere else.

It is only two, tiny blocks from Canal Street and so it is quiet, but still in perfect proximity to absolutely everything you need in NOLA. Here is the scoop: Check-in: Flawless and instantaneous. Fresh apples and flavored ice water to greet you. I needed to change the credit card I was using and I noted later when I checked the card online that the refund on the one card I no longer wanted to use was quick. I was particularly impressed with this because I have had problems with other hotels in the past who have double-charged, over-charged, and so on. Room: The hotel was sold out because of the conference I was attending, along with the NOLA Jazz Festival and I arrived in my room, which I had specifically requested not be near the elevator because of the noise factor. The hotel has a no smoking policy throughout, but this room clearly reeked of smoke. I called the front desk and Jessica told me that she would show me various rooms and move me, but warned me that the only rooms were near the elevator. A bit disheartening, but I settled on a lovely room on the seventh floor that was just around the corner from the elevator. The good news was that not only was the room quiet, but over a five-day period, I heard almost no one at any time. NO elevator noise, no people noise, no employee noise. Just blissful silence! The room was generous in size and nicely appointed. Lots of space to unpack everything and hang up clothes. Great size safe to stash my laptop (not that I was worried, anyway!). Tons of towels in the bathroom, an extra blanket for the bed, and amazingly fluffy, feather pillows. Complimentary Internet for Omni Select Guests, so join up! Room Service: Excellent Caesar salad and shrimp remoulade. Generous servings of both appetizers and I could not even begin to consider any more food. If you join Omni Select Guests, you will receive your choice of two beverages at no charge every morning. I loved the gourmet tea and fresh orange juice. Only complaint: they used to include a complimentary breakfast bread such as a croissant, but now they charge for these. Bathroom: I travel in Europe quite a lot and for some reason, those annoying, 1/2 glass shower doors have migrated across the Atlantic and into American hotels. (Sofitel properties use them in Europe and now the Kimpton properties and Omni do in America!) These things DO NOT keep water off the floor and this creates not only a danger to you when you step out, but a massive flood that has got to be bad for the walls, the floors, and everything else that gets hit. It took 3 towels every morning just to soak up the mess. Talk about a colossal waste of resources--the water and the towels. Other than this daily annoyance, the bathroom was beautiful and had high end bath products--something I really appreciate. General Comments: Every time I called and asked for anything, the front desk was quick to take care of things for me. Taxis, requests for room cleaning, whatever. I appreciate the can-do attitude and the attention to the guest's needs.

Amenities: The sixth floor has the a rooftop deck with wading pool, exercise room with TV, and sauna. Even two yoga mats were available. \"Dress It\" is the on site restaurant. They offer a breakfast buffet for $14.99. It may sound pricey but there was a vast selection of breakfast foods to suit any desire. Taxi Service: The hotel can make arrangements with a taxi company to take you to the airport once your stay has ended. Just let them know what time you require a taxi the night before. Cool hallways: Although not very necessary in March, I can see how having ultra cool hallways can be a relief in those humid summer months.

All our accommodation was pre-booked for our party of 4 with two rooms: described as a double/deluxe for my husband and I and a twin for the other two. We stayed in five other cities and were always provided with appropriate accommodation (ie two beds in the room requested as a twin). That was except when we arrived at Omni Royal Crescent where we were informed by front desk staff that both rooms had one bed only, that there were no rooms available with two beds and that a rollaway could be provided at a cost to us of $30 per night. Having booked the accommodation 12 months in advance (!) and paid well in excess of $200 a night (for each rooom) we found this expectation unacceptable. The young man dealing with us kept repeating the phrase \"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\" and offered some implausible explantion about 'twin' referring to the dimensions of the bed, the implication being that the misunderstanding was ours alone, despite the fact that all the other hotels we stayed at in the country understood twin to mean two .

We did consider contacting the manager via his cell phone, (as others noted, this was provided after checking in) however we decided just to get out and enjoy New Olreans rather than spend further time and energy expressing our dissatisfaction.

Our room was a King non-smoking with a jacuzzi tub. When we checked in, the front desk staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. The guy practically insisted -- in a nice way -- on helping us with our bags. Later we realized that was the hotel manager! We were greeted with a personal hndwritten note welcoming us to the hotel from the General Manager, with his cell phone number, should we have any problem during the stay. Oyur room was spacious, with very high ceilings, on a quiet cul-de-sac of a hallway. Others have already commented on the weird set-up of the bathtub and shower. The shower points at the bathroom floor, just beyond the tub, so that if you don't close the curtains tightly, it's almost impossible not to wind up with water all over the floor. But, really, who cares? Love the red and green Mardi Gras beads they use for maid service and do not disturb door hangers. The elevators are small and sometimes take a while to come. I hate the water bottles and spray starch (!) that charge you if you use them, but that's just me. THe hotel is pretty old. Out of our window there was an ugly view of a light shaft, but we weren't looking out the window much. It would be nice if they had some afternoon cocktail hour (this is New Orleans, isn't it?). And ice is located on just a few floors, but the maid brought around ice every afternoon. (A really nice touch.) The place is almost perfectly situated for quiet and easy access to the Vieux Carre. The staff went way beyond what they needed to do to make us comfortable and to help us negotiate the neighborhood and the various tourist sites.

After checking the conference rate at the Sheraton I looked online and found I could book the Omni king jacuzzi suite using the AAA rate for cheaper than the conference rate at the Sheraton. This was a refundable rate booked several months in advance. My room was a standard size king hotel room but the bathroom was larger and had a big jetted tub where a normal size bathtub would normally be. I used the tub three times during my two night stay. It was a deep tub with strong jets. There was an issue with the tub - basically whoever installed the plumbing fixtures picked the wrong ones because they did not fit the tub. The tub filler barely got the water into the tub it aimed more or less on the side of the tub. But an even bigger snafu was the shower above the tub. When the shower was turned on full blast, the water sprayed over the tub and out on to the floor rather than into the tub. Rather than having the shower fixture on the side, it was centered on the wall facing out from the tub. There was a shower curtain on rings on one of those poles hanging from the ceiling. One had to keep the shower curtain completely closed in order to keep the water from ending up on the floor. Fortunately there was a drain on the floor right where the shower water would hit the floor. I wonder if it had to be put in after the bad plumbing job or if it was already there. Given all the fresh towels the shower snafu was a minor annoyance compared to the large tub. My bed was very comfortable and the room was recently renovated with clean and up dated carpet and furniture. The room faced into a side wall so no street noise. The door was not hung all that well and there were gaps around the door which meant more hallway noise despite being at the end of a cul de sac. I sometimes wore earplugs so as not to hear the halway noise. One nice touch was the free delivery int he morning of two beverages of choice - for frequent hotel stay members. I ordered room service once it was fine. The restaurant is not fancy it is a gourmet sandwich shop. I would have prefered a more tranditional restaurant and room service menu but at least the prices were reasonable and the quality of food good. The breakfast buffet was fantastic. High quality and good selection. It costs about $16. The woman working the bar at night was very friendly. She offered me specials like a 2-1 during happy hour wiht the second well after the happy hour. She also had some suggestions for what I could order that was not a sandwich sort of slightly off the menu. Overall the staff was excellent. My room came with two robes. There were really nice high end robes with terry on one side and smooth material on the other. I used the gym twice it is tucked away behind the pool/jacuzzi on the sixth floor roof. You go outside and then through another door into a smallish gym area. The Gym had some cardio equipment and separate mens/womens saunas. There was a TV and a keg of ice water. I used the elliptical it was in good working order. The gym smells somewhat of mildew it was the only mildew smell I noticed at this property which is pretty good for New Orleans where mildew seems to permeate almost everything. My rate for the king jacuzzi suite was $162/night plus tax. I was quite satisfied with this given that the conference rate at the sheraton was closer to $200. The restuarant turned out to be a great place to work in the evening. Plenty of table space, well lit and free wifi.

Flat screen HDTV was nice, but I'm still looking for the Holy Grail of actually finding HD programming in a Hotel. We weren't there to watch TV, so I didn't care. Bathroom was beautiful, but one nit....the shower glass only covered half the shower so invariably there was water on the floor. The bed and linen looked great, but the bed oddly sloped to the middle. They just need some slightly firmer mattresses. As an Omni select member (sign up for free) we got two free beverages each delivered to us in the morning. Normally I would say who cares, but after partying every night in this town, you need some serious hydration. There was a city wide water pressure problem our first night. We returned to the hotel and the water didn't work in the toilet, sink, or shower. It worked the following morning, but the city had a boil drinking water warning for the entire next day and a half. The water problem was not the hotels fault and probably effected every hotel in the city. The hotel supplied lots of bottled drinking water for us upon request. The open sky Jacuzzi pool on the 6th floor was a great surprise and the wife and I were able to hit it in private! Wifi was free for Omni Select members too.

On the one hand there were so many things I loved but.... Overall though, from the personal note found in the room, to the check out I felt that they were really trying. First, apart of it was my fault, I planned the 7 day stay during a weekend the Falcons played the Saints -poor timing. Also I was with my daughter, so I required a sleeping arrangement that isn't condusive to their set up, which seems ideal for singles or couples but not two people who don't want to sleep in same bed, and one of them needs a desk. They have this interesting adjoining room set up that is perfect, but during my stay (timing) the few rooms they had like that were booked, so I had to move three times (my choice) However, the first two times I moved the staff made no offer to help, the third time they did. The last move I had to wait until after 3pm and even after that I had to wait in a different room, which caused a major problem later with the internet connection. Also, the double room I was finally in had no running cold water (they did compensate) Overall I felt the staff really tries to make it work. They are cordial and maintained professionalism throughout. Folk have already mentioned the showers, now that is weird on so many levels... when I got into the fully glassed in shower (one of adjoining rms) I found that if I didn't want to wash my hair it wouldn't work for me-at 5'6\" the showerhead is directly over your head and has almost no range to move...and then there was the half glass that is just messy. Both of these bathroom issues are solvable 1) Put flexible hose showerhead 2) Add shower curtain inside half glass. Even though no pool and I don't do public hot tubs I found the patio comfortable/relaxing and my daughter did too. To me this hotel works best for couples and singles. Oh wait, the bathrobes are not the same in all rooms, but the ones with terry cloth and silky cotton outside are fantastic (Waldorf quality) and unlike many hotels they are size Large, so roomy.

The only minor complaint I had is the same as mentioned in a previous review - the shower has some sort of half glass door, and water gets all over the floor. Also, the hallways were extremely cold, so maybe the A/C could be taken down a notch. However, not a big deal at all, considering the fantastic deal we got for such a great hotel. Also, as a tip to fellow travelers, if you need to park your car, just go down a couple blocks where you can pay $15 overnight. Ask the concierge and he will point you in the right direction.

We requested a few extra towels and they were brought up immediately. The room was large and spacious with a big closet. It was on the street side but we managed to sleep through any major street noises, nothing noticeable since the hotel is located on a side street. It was a short walk and easy access to Bourbon and the French Quarter. The riverfront was a few more blocks away. The fitness center was on the rooftop, where there was a small pool/hot tub and a beautiful large sun deck for tanning. The fitness center offered several treadmills and other equipment and was empty every time I used it. My only complaint about the hotel was the half-shower glass curtain, which at times made for more spray on the floor than in the tub, but with a few extra towels on the floor this wasn't really an issue. I thought that this was an excellent hotel for the price, and would stay again in a flash.

If I had to return to New Orleans I would stay here in a heartbeat. First, I think I got the best pricing of any traveler for a king size room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well below $100/night\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it was a momentary blip on their pricing radar screen as even the staff was amazed at the rate\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but the price only made a great hotel even that much better. The staff was amazingly friendly, helpful and courteous\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6always with a smile. Because of the great rates, especially compared to those of the convention I was attending, my entire office booked there and the management went above and beyond to assist our group. When our team leader sent flowers to one of our office members ahead of time to congratulate him on a job well done, the staff rejected the order when delivered because the flowers were sub-par/drooping and arranged to have a new order placed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention to detail. The rooms ranged from compact to really big. While I had one of the compact rooms, it was large enough to have decent walking space around the king bed and the extra high ceilings added to the comfort. While I have read some reviews about street noise, I did not have all that much and I was on the second floor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I think the rooms on Camp St. may get it worse than the ones on Gravier St. The bathroom was a decent size and adequate but I did have one of the remaining rooms with the half glass shower door. Having lived in Europe for a number of years, I became adept at managing to shower with this type of arrangement so it was not a problem but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never dealt with these before it can be tricky especially since the shower head has limited range of motion. The only complaints, if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they are, is that the bathroom tub was a little damaged on the porcelain and the toilet has an infrequent yet annoying habit of flushing itself/running periodically. The best deal is joining the FREE Omni club for the beverage service and free wi-fi\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a stellar value for 3 minutes of signing up time. Beware, the beverage delivery folks may not always knock and let you know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waiting outside so you may need to check. While I did not use the gym, I did check it out and it looked basic but the pool area is more of a glorified hot tub. I guess it serves a purpose for cooling off rather than doing laps. The best deal was the continental breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which we were expecting to be boring but had a good array of meats, dairy, carbs and lots of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take with\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd items like breakfast bars, apples, etc. The location is ideal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6tucked on a side street close to the French Quarter but far enough away from the insanity. The location was great for the convention center\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a healthy 10-15 minute walk but even better for the French Quarter, post-convention activities which started only 2 blocks away.

This impressed me and demonstrated the manager cared about his/her guests' experience, and that is what convinced me to choose the Omni Royal Crescent. We were not disappointed. The staff was wonderful, and they made check-in painless, even though we arrived right around 3:30 p.m. We didn't have a great view, but then again, that wasn't the reason why I chose the hotel. Much more important was the fact that Harrah's casino was a two-block walk from the hotel, and Bourbon Street was a mere three blocks in the opposite direction. We walked to Jackson Square, the Riverwalk Mall, and saw everything in between without much exertion at all. I used the workout facility and was impressed with the quality of the elliptical machines and treadmills. There was even a sauna! However, I was disappointed that there wasn't a hot tub on the roof/deck area, and the pool wasn't heated so that was not available to us since it was cold during our visit. I definitely echo the other folks who suggested becoming an Omni preferred member so you can get the free wi-fi and other perks.

Rooms were clean, bathroom was spacious, clean, and up to date, beds were comfy and the staff were very nice.The only problems I did have was the shower in my room would not turn in different directions. It would only stay straight causing my shower to be a big mess since the water shot right through the curtain onto the floor. I didn't make a complaint because there was already a drain on the outside of the tub, which I thought was weird but obviously It was there for that purpose (to catch the water). So I figured they know about this problem and that was the solution. Also I asked for a computer room and they offered a small area behind the front desk.

Check-in was a breeze and again, the front desk staff was very nice. Yes, the rooms are a tad small, but why are you spending a lot of time in your room?? The bed was extremely comfortable and I loved how clean everything was. Cleanliness is one of the most important things for me - I want to feel like I can walk around barefoot in the room and not get grossed out. This hotel definitely passed the test. We did not try to use the downstairs restaurant so I can't comment on the food. I loved the turn-down service they offered - when we got home from Bourbon street, the lights were turned low, the sheets turned down and a chocolate on the pillow. Nice touch! My only complaint is that the water temperature in the shower was only luke-warm - I mean, it barely got warm. So that was disappointing, but I didn't bother to mention it because what difference would it have made since we were only staying one night? We called around 3:30 a.m. and asked for a late checkout, which we recieved. Then when we checked out we wanted to go get something to eat and the front desk was very accomodating on keeping our luggage and holding onto the car for us until we got back. The hotel is within walking distance of everything you would want to do - the Superdome and the French Quarter. There is no need to use your car once you get to the hotel. However, you are far enough off the beaten track that you don't hear outside noise! The doors/walls were a tad thin and in the morning I could hear people talking in the halls and outside our window. But it is not located on a \"party\" street so you won't be kept up all night by any noise. I would definitely stay at this hotel again!", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointing\u201d", "Author": "anonymousreviewer10", "ReviewID": "UR21881923", "Content": "If this hotel were billing itself as the equivalent of a Hampton Inn or Quality or something similar, I would give it a good rating. However, this property has no business selling itself as a luxury hotel. The location is great, let's say that. It's on quiet side street across from the Swedish embassy (yes, really). It's a block from the St. Charles streetcar, two blocks from Canal and right off Magazine St. It's a quick walk to the French Quarter or Riverwalk. The building itself is a lovely older structure. The room was impeccably clean, but tiny. The decor was nice enough, but unremarkable. It wasn't luxury by any means, nor was it up to the standards of, say, Loews. It was about what one would find at the Marriott or a nicer Comfort Inn. The health club is a lot worse than what one would find at the Marriott, too. It's almost impossible to find, hidden away behind a door at the end of a hallway on the sixth floor at the end of the rooftop deck. It's advertised as being 24 hours, but when I visited at 5 at night, it was completely dark and desolate--not an attendant anywhere in sight; not even a light on. It didn't seem like a safe place to be alone. Considering they had a grand total of FOUR machines, I guess it wasn't much of a loss. Oh, and that pretty pool, which looks so nice on the hotel's website? It's the width of a single lap lane and about eight feet long. I suppose if you had children you could let them wade but I'm not sure how they can claim this as an actual pool. Then we get to the part where Omni acted like a real low-budget operation: when the clerk attempted to bill my credit card for $125 more than the cost of my stay. When I asked what was going on and the credit card company kicked it back, I was told it was a credit for \"incidentals\" that might be run up in the hotel. The charge was NEVER mentioned to me beforehand--not during the booking process, not on Omni's confirmation email to me, not when I was standing in front of the clerk in the lobby, and not on the itemized invoice that I had signed. They also claimed the charge was $50/night...I'm not sure how that worked out to $125 for two nights, but maybe I'm the one with the fuzzy math. I guess Omni just decided to run a random unauthorized charge and then expected me not to notice? I've stayed in hotels all over the world, including some very exclusive properties, and nobody has ever done anything similar. The clerk claimed that \"any hotel in New Orleans\" would levy the same charges, which simply isn't true. When I mentioned that I'd stayed in the city before, including the Pontchartrain (my NO hotel of choice before it closed), he insisted I must have paid cash at the other hotels. When I told him I had not, he quickly amended his statement to say \"it's an Omni policy.\" If this is truly the case, and it was not simply blatant discrimination on the part of the clerks against a guest who did not appear to be \"upscale,\" then Omni needs to actually MENTION IT at some point during the booking process or check-in. It sort of boggles the mind that they itemized the .75 cents for newspaper delivery and somehow forgot this one. I made it clear to the clerks I would not authorize anything above or beyond the cost of my room, and I finally settled the matter, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I think I could have stayed at the Holiday Inn and had a comparable time. And wow, do I miss the Pontchartrain.", "Date": "November 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Astoria, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "InQueens26", "ReviewID": "UR21477319", "Content": "I wa ssharing this room with two female coworkers (I am male) since we were going on business and wanted to extend our stay a few days.

I used the bathroom at 5 am only to find a mouse frantically running loops around it trying to get out. I began yelling to my husband while putting my feet up on the toilet. He banged on the bathroom door, scaring the little guy, so I could escape to the bedroom. We figured we would call housekeeping at a more reasonable hour to have them take care of it. Well, DH has to use bathroom, so we decide to try to get mouse out of room ourselves. By now he was hidden in rolled towels that are in a basket on floor. Shake him out, hold bathroom and room door open - well, he decides it's too bright in hallway and scurries back under room door and ends up climbing the drapes. Call front desk to tell them situation; guy comes up w/sweeper thinking we meant dead mouse. He told us he would have mgr call when he got in at 7 am. Of course, I cannot get back to sleep, diligently watching floor, see mouse exit room into hallway. 7 am comes and goes, no call from mgr. We called front desk at 8:30, told manager is busy. 9 am - hear from mgr, tell him situation (man w/sweeper must never have shared info) and he offers to move us, but it won't be for a few hours. Finally, after much discussion between DH and I, we decide to stay in this room (only had one more night) figuring mouse could be in any room at this point and where's there's one, well, you know, there's probably a pretty large contingent of them. We ask them to just please really, really clean room, especially bathroom where contained, freaked mouse left droppings. We left and upon returning found droppings still on bathroom floor. Now, droppings were not numerous, but we knew they were there and we knew housekeeping did not sweep or wash floor. We went back down, spoke to manager, who was pleasant and did apologize and said he would see to it that housekeeping would take care of it. Left again, and returned only to find dirty bathroom floor still. I ended up cleaning it myself w/towel - yuck!!! My big issue - manager never checked back in with us and did nothing to compensate us for problems. Also, upon checkout, no apologies, nothing from desk clerk - our situation should have been noted on our ressie!

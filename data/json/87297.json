It was a wonderful move, but quite a bit more costly. In exchange though, at Alii a guest doesn't have to pay $20/day for parking or a \"resort fee\" of $25/day. We stayed in room 114 (not sure what building); bottom story. It great to stay on ground floor; we could just walk straight thru back sliders to pool area and beach. Our condo was one bedroom with murphy bed in living area. We were told we would have two beds, so a little disappointed to find out one was murphy, but it was workable; just felt staff should have been a little more forthcoming with that info. Also, mattress on bedroom bed needs replacement ASAP...it has a serious dip in the middle....so bad we had to put pillows in middle of bed so we wouldn't roll into it. All the condos are different, so be sure to ask a lot of questions. 114 doesn't have a den area, but has large bedroom, beautiful bath, and nicely decorated living area. Also has a small dining area, which we didn't use because we ate on veranda. Full kitchen with granite countertops was such a blessing because I get a little tired of continually eating out, especially in Hawaii where a resort breakfast can run an easy $50/couple! Kitchen was welll appointed with all the necessities. Blender was an inexpensive model, that leaked like crazy when I was making smoothies, but better than nothing. There was all varieties of pots and pans, so finding necessary tools to make a meal was easy. We used common BBQ area one evening, it was clean and well appointed as well. Nice that they have silverware and supplies available so guest doesn't have to haul so much out to utilize feature. Housekeeping freshened up daily and was generous with supplies. Grounds were well maintained and stunning; complete opposite of deferred maintenance at Westin next door. Condo units are very well built....little, if any neighboring or upstairs noise. I agree with other reviewers, that folks who claim a chair by pool early in the day for use several hours later is irritating. There is also an issue with all the kids playing in adult pool. Part of problem seems to be staff doesn't have a person walking the grounds and monitoring pool situation; It doesn't seem like guests should have to be put in the uncomfortable situation of asking another guest to please play by the rules. Its so nice that they offer both pools, both of which are beautiful, just wish other parents and guests abided by rules. I also agree it was great not to have to carry around an ID card to get towlels or use chairs on beach. Workout room is stunning...if you have any inclination at all to get in a workout, its worth it. Busy in the morning, but I was alone in the afternoon. Equipment is new, clean and easy to use. Lots of freeweights and benches are available as well. Beware wireless internet is NOT available in-room. You must go to pool area to receive wireless. There is wired connection in room, but that seems more inconvenient these days than walking to common area. NOTE: Starbucks has shop next door to Alii at neighboring resort...thats a great plus! All in all, if you have to stay at Kaanapali Coast, this is an awesome option. Just be ready for CROWDS and NOISE. Not the Alii's fault, its just the nature of the beast in Kaanapali.

The grounds are immaculate, and the facilities are up-to-date. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location on Kaanapali beach is ideal. I was impressed with the hotel staff, always willing to help, and always smiling and friendly. I also enjoyed the resort's towel policy: Trust. No wrist bands, no towel card. You want a pool towel? Just go pick one up. I'm sure there are some towels that don't get returned, but I imagine the towel return rate is close to 100 percent. It's nice being treated like a responsible adult. Our room (123) was great for our group (three couples). It had enough room that we could invite others over for dinners and gatherings. The suite has recently been refurbished with modern appliances and lighting. This was not an \"ocean view\" suite, so we also had the construction noise from next door as mentioned in a previous post. However, I can't hold the Alii responsible for that. The noise was a bit bothersome if you stayed in your hotel room all day, but who does that? And we actually enjoyed the Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Luau music. My only complaint is the tiresome invasion of pool-chair trolls. These are the troglodytes that run out early in the morning, place a book and towel on chair/lounger, and expect everyone to respect their territory the entire day. The Alii needs to get aggressive against these lower life forms to prevent chair saving. Just up the beach, another hotel (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember which one) has signs posted around the pool area which remind guests that pool chairs are for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153active use\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd only. This means if a chair is left for more than 25 minutes, the staff removes any personal items that the Chair Hogs have put there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that it was impossible to find places to lay out in the shade or sun; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that the nicer spots under umbrellas were always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by these squatters.

Without any doubt we have loved each stay and had no complaints. This year due to the unavailability of our usual favorite we rented a 3 bedroom in building 1 facing the Westin, unit 143. We had views of the Westin and it's waterfall pool which were ok, but still had nice ocean views including Black Rock, from the lanai and bedroom. We really had no complaints, we missed having the courtyard view and sunsets but felt that the cooler afternoons on the shaded lanai were a nice tradeoff. The condo is laid out very similarly to 223 (our \"usual\") except that the 3rd bedroom/den has a nice wrap around couch and flat screen tv, around 42-48 inch size. Nice touch! It is stocked as well as expected, the safe in the master bedroom worked, and beds were comfortable. We were happy to have the same large lanai as we love to eat all 3 meals out there and spend quite a bit of time socializing around meals. Unfortunately early in the morning on the 3rd day into our stay construction work started up at the Westin just outside of our unit and all day long we had jackhammers and loud construction noise driving us off the lanai. Even with all doors and windows closed the noise was unbearable. My brother in law was along with us on a working vacation and was quite unhappy with losing the quiet working environment he expected. Once the workers quit for the evening and we were looking forward to a nice relaxing dinner on the lanai the Luau from the westin started up, just under the lanai again! While we love the Hawaiian music, drums, and luaus in general, the speakers were so loud and must have been pointed directly at our condo as we couldn't even hold conversation over the music. It was like being at a really loud concert or wedding, and we gave up eating dinner outside. On top of this all, my husband and his sister were both coming off of a very difficult year health-wise and looking forward to a peaceful, healing time in Hawaii. After putting up with this unrelenting noise daily we finally called Maui Beachfront Rentals and complained that we were not happy with the status quo. Having paid the amount of money for an expected quite and restful Hawaiian vacation we were having anything but. I must give Maui Beachfront a shout out as they responded quickly and did what they could to assuage our negative reaction, offering a move to a different condo or a refund of one night and a free night on our next year's rental. I felt that Maui Beachfront Rental didn't have prior knowledge of the construction noise and didn't rent unfairly. The luaus would have been bearable if we hadn't been unable to use the lanai all day also. So as it stands, the condo itself is in good repair, located on the shady and cooler side of the building, clean and comfortable. I was told that the construction will be ongoing through April so if you are planning to rent, beware or check up on this. I can't really complain about the Luau music as it was just an annoyance caused mainly by following up on the heels of the loud jackhammers, etc. We hope to be able to return to our favorite on the courtyard side next year.

The property also offers two hot tubs and ample lounge chairs in both sunny and shady locations. The indoor exercise facilities looked nice (but I don't understand why anyone would be running on a treadmill when you have a beautiful beach and paved walkway right outside). The Alii also offers early morning yoga three days a week on the lawn overlooking the ocean. If you're lucky, as I was, you'll be able to see humpbacks diving right off shore as you do your own downward dog. There were other fitness classes, too, but I can't comment on those.

So, while they do offer poolside food, it's quite limited with only pre-made sandwiches and cookies that are brought in.

The beds were extremely comfortable (even the sleeper sofa was nice - - usually hotel sleeper sofas are not so nice when you unfold them), the kitchen was modern and fully equipped, the bathrooms were pristine, and the condition of the overall unit was excellent. The highlight of our accommodation was that our 3rd floor lanai was literally 30 yards from one of the most beautiful beaches we have ever seen. Great for swimming and people watching as you had surfers dealing with some challenging waves while mostly newlyweds strolled the walkway extending the entire length of Kaanapali Beach ending at Whaler's Village on the north end - - a very nice shopping plaza (we saw an excellent and free hula show there). As for the kids, they didn't even miss the lack of a pool slide that a few other nearby hotels had - - dancing in the waves and attempting to body surf in the ocean right in front of the hotel was more than enough entertainment for them (and us parents as well). So when you add it all up - - central location on a beautiful stretch of beach, pleasant staff, immaculate and spacious suites, wonderful views, great amenities - - it's one of the best places you could stay at without sacrificing a bar of gold for the experience.

The landscaping and flowers were stunning, and at night the pools are lit up in blue with plenty of torches along the walkways. The pool was just across the beach walk from the sand and ocean, and they provided towels and chairs for us to use on the sand as well. The beach walk provided great access to Leilani's, Tropico and Whaler's Village and was great to take morning walks/runs. You can't beat the Alii for a great time in Maui! It's so nice to have space to spread out and not be cramped into a tiny hotel room. The location is perfect for everything that you'd need on the island, the staff is great and the views are just breathtaking.

I did some research in advance and wanted to make sure that the place was set up for the kids when we arrived. On Trip Advisor, I read about Akami Mothers which is a service on Maui that rents baby equipment at very reasonable prices. We had cribs, high chairs, beach toys, jumperoos, etc. delivered, set up, and in our room when we arrived. Upon entering our unit we were amazed at the spacious size. Nearly 2000 square feet!!! The kitchen was totally up to date and user friendly as we ate most meals at home. The Safeway in Lahina is about 3 miles down the road and was where we did all of our shopping. There were flat panels in all rooms which was nice. Our particular unit did not have wifi which was a bummer but not the end of the world (it did have internet). The furnishings were a little outdated and the showerheads were not the best, but for the amount of space and overall comfort of the unit, I didn't think twice about it. Every unit is different so check on yours before renting. We had an oceanfront view from our lanai, and ate breakfast many mornings out there watching the day get started. Moving to the property itself, parking was crowded but I always had a spot. There is a convenience store on the property for last minute items which is great (we ran out of milk one day and made an emergency run for the kids). The pool is absolutely terrific. The kids pool is not fancy but a terrific space for young children like ours. We met other families easily, and my daughter always had someone to play with. The pool can get a little crowded as seating in the shade is limited, but everyone is nice and will make room for another chair. There were plenty of barbeques in the pool area and people shuttling down the elevators with their marinated meat and fishes. There were some flat panels by the pool, flavored water, and towels with chair covers available. The beach is right there, and if you don't want to rent their cabanas think about renting your own chairs and umbrellas (we did through Akami Mothers). I believe they have chairs on the beach available too for free but we spent most of our time at the pool. I don't know where else on Maui you will find almost 2000 square feet at these prices. If you like a spacious apartment feel, cooking, and a laid back clientele across alll types (young families, teens, retired, couples) this is the place. No Evian spritzes or bar service, but homemade margritas and wine in environmentally friendly mugs that you bring. Or, walk down to one of the many resorts and enjoy a drink poolside....With our children asleep, we took a stroller walk down the beach front to the Sheraton pool bar, and enjoyed the afternoon. The Alii has agreements to charge drinks and food at many of the resorts back to your room. If I lived on the West Coast, my wife and I would love to own a property like this. Before having kids, we loved vacationing at luxury resorts like the Four Seasons. With kids, comes the need for kitchens and space. Why spend $1,000-$2,000 a night when you can have more space, the feel of a home, and a prime location with a terrific pool.

Either the tile or the carpeting was so dirty that our feet were black if we walked barefoot in the unit. While using the disposal for a small amount of apple peels, the sink clogged so badly that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153snake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had to be used to clear the blockage. It resulted in a maintainence man being in the unit one hour in the evening, producing a strong odor when the blockage was removed. If this was a premier room, I would hate to see the condition of a standard room. I could not wait to leave the property. My husband and I did not complain to the desk clerk on departure as there was a long line of guests. We travel to Maui twice a year, one week at our timeshare and the other week staying at various other properties around the island.

HOWEVER, when we booked 6 months ago we booked a 1 bdrm premier ocean view unit with a lanai. We got here and when we got to our room we were in a room facing the golf course? We did have one window that had a partial view of the ocean. The manager and staff person were not very helpful in dealing with our frustration. The manager also admitted they have had this problem in the past where people booked a room they thought was a ocean view and it was only a partial view so 2 months ago they retitled their room categories to reflect this. She said that the room I booked (1 bdrm ocean view lanai premier means that the ocean view is only from the lanai. She said others thought they had a view of the Island of Lanai which meant a total ocean view. So after several hours dealing with our travel agent we were unable to upgrade unless we wanted to eat the cost. Since these are personal owned units they are bound by contract and cannot offer upgrades, etc which we totally understand. So when you book be sure to be very very specific what you want. All units have a lanai and they have renamed the unit category that we now have to be \" 1 bdrm partial ocean view premier.

It was also technically a 1 bedroom with a den but the den was a second bedroom with an en-suite bathroom. The condo was completely renovated and the kitchen had everything we needed (except for a cocktail shaker but we brought one along assuming it isn't a standard thing). The condo was spacious and the master bedroom was separated from the rest of the living area which was great for my daughter's nap time. The den area (second bedroom) had a pocket door so it was completely separate from the living room. We had to be a bit quiet in the living room when we would first put my daughter down for the night but most night we spent our time on the lanai anyway. The only real negative I had with the condo was the bed in the master bedroom. It seemed really nice at first but it felt quite lumpy after only a night. There were definitely indentations where people normally sleep. We ended up sleeping sideways on the bed each night and that was the only thing that made it comfortable. The double bed in my daughter's room was really comfortable though. I think the master just needs a new mattress. The condo has a washer and dryer which was wonderful. They even give you detergent for the washer and dryer. I probably did a couple of loads of laundry while we were there and ended up coming home with mostly clean clothes and not a pile of laundry. The staff at the resort is wonderful. The bellman that showed us to our room was very friendly and gave us quite the introduction to the resort. The pool staff was friendly and ready to help. Most places I have stayed get really weird about pool towels (handing in passes, keys, etc to get a towel). They were very laid back about it. They have chairs on the beach you can use for free or you can rent a cabana for $40/day. We rented a cabana a few days and loved it. The BBQ area at the resort is really nice too. They supply the tools, foil, paper plates, plastic silverware, etc. There are 6(?) huge grills and we never had any issue using one. It does get busy down there around 6pm though. The fitness center at the resort is really nice too with top of the line equipment. Each cardio machine has a tv on it and an adapter for your iPod as well. The location of the resort is the best for Kannapali. It is a 5 minute walk to the Whaler's Village- shopping, restaurants, fast food, ABC store, etc. The Westin is right next door with a couple of restaurants (and a fantastic Luau) as well. Black Rock (great snorkeling) is about a ten minute walk up the beach. There is a boardwalk that runs from the Hyatt to the Sheraton which is great for people watching and running.

We have had premier oceanfront, ocean view, and lanai ocean view and all have been beautifully decorated with granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, etc. It is so much nicer to spread out and have a kitchen, and living area to relax in rather than stay in a hotel. We haven't cooked a meal at the Alii but the condos are all well stocked with dishes, utensils and pots and pans. There are also BBQ's and outdoor dining tables near the beach. The beach in front of the property is the best beach along Kaanapali. It is very big and open. They have someone who takes your beach chair out for you and picks it up when you leave. You can also check out a towel for the beach around the pool. The Kaanapali Alli staff is very friendly and always eagar to help. They have housekeeping that makes your bed, straightens up your condo, and leaves fresh towels everyday. The newly remodeled and expanded pool is gorgeous along with the grounds and the new gym is state of the art. The location is right near Whaler's Village which has many shops and restaurants including a small food court with McDonalds. A new addition to the Village this past year is Yogurtland. Lahaina is just 5 minutes away with a nice Safeway store and a Starbucks. We buy all our groceries here and don't miss the fresh papaya. Lahaina has lots of shops and great dining options. There is a lot to do in the area also. We parasailed this last trip with UFO parsailing company and it left right near the hotel. It was a real thrill and we loved it! We also jet skiied. You can play golf, go visit the volcano, take a train ride, horseback ride, snorkel and sail, or take a drive to Kihei and shop at the Grand Wailea Shops. Watching the sunset here is also one of the best you will ever see. Our favorite restuarants include Hula Grill, and Leilani's on Kaanapali Beach, The Plantation House in Kapalua, Cheeseburger in Paradise, and Kimo\"s in Lahaina. We have traveled a lot as a family, but no matter where we go, Kaanapali Beach and the Alii has always been our favorite vacation spot!

Main room had a wrap around couch, tv and a lanai (we had a partial ocean view...pretty nice). They all have a washer/dryer, fridge, dishwasher, etc. Full kitchen and dining room. The rooms are large as well. We stayed in the smaller option for a condo and still had 2 full baths. TIP...before you go grocery shopping, take a look around the condo. Ours already had detergent and drier sheets. Pool: For those that dig their pool time, the KA has worked out a deal for guests to use the pools at the Sheraton (15 minute walk towards black rock), the Westin (next door) or the Marriot (also next door). It appears that the KA pool will be very nice once it is complete. Beach: Great beach. Surf was high when we were there, but normally the waves are fairly small. KA has free beach chairs to use and cabanas for rent. At times, you could hear some of the construction equipment from the beach, but for the most part it's hard to get distracted in paradise. Staff: Very kind and helpful. They do it right. Rooms were always clean, concierge service was good and the guys down by the beach handing out chairs were always eager. Construction: Seemed to me that the Alii was pretty upfront about their construction. They covered all their bases though by arranging for passes to other pools and even setting up grills by the beach (their old grills were near the pool area). You can definitely tell it's going on because there is a perimeter of black tarp around the side of the hotel facing the beach. I hear it will be complete soon, so should not be an issue for future travelers. Weather: Take the weather reports you see on tv and in the Maui Daily News with a grain of salt. They predicted rain every day and it may have rained once at night at the KA. To be sure, it does rain frequently in Hawaii, but something about being on West Maui helped us escape a lot of it on our trip. Crowds: Also found out that early November is a pretty quiet time in Maui. Got the impression from the locals that tourism is down this year...may mean deals are out there if you look hard enough.

They do not enforce the restrictions. Otherwise, we have always found the staff to be more than helpful especially the front desk, and security guards.

I agree some of the rooms are becoming rather unkempt. and in need of a remodel, but you get what you pay for. The property itself is wonderful and the setting great ( long, beautiful beach for walking and shopping ).. It is an older property so one must tolerate some water shut offs, etc. for repairs. However, it would be nice to be informed before making a reservation. Regarding Brian, one of the pool staff - he has never been anything but helpful and polite. However, we have seen unruly and undisciplined children around the pool whose parents have not taught them any manners. I expect this might have been the case in one of the reviews I read complaining about Brian. If anything, we have sometimes found the pool staff to be a little too tolerant of ill mannered adults who disrespect the rules (bringing beer bottles in, and undisciplined children throwing balls and other objects around (also against the rules) in the pool area.

We felt compelled to offer a different perspective. We have stayed at the Alii more than 10 times and, with each visit, grew increasingly more uncomfortable as kids (or even aggressive adults) took over the property. Signs around the pool indicating no jumping or no running were constantly being ignored and the staff seemed unwilling or oblivious to step forward and enforce their own rules. The pool is not large yet kids and their parents would think nothing of throwing balls back and forth in the pool or watching as they hit the pool deck and wait (or ask) for others to throw their balls back in (ballplaying in the pool is \"supposedly\" prohibited). The hot tub is another example. When we first started visiting the Alii, the rule was that no one under the age of 13 (?) was allowed in the tub. Slowly the rule was relaxed and eventually it seemed like even the smallest of children (frequently unsupervised and often wearing diapers) were frequenting the hot tub area. Eventually, we decided that while the property and location are lovely, the lack of enforcement of rules and the lack of cooperation on the part of many of the guests meant that we should look for other accommodations--which we did. In doing so, however, we let the management know why we felt that we could no longer return to the Alii. The bottom line--we applaud the efforts of the management to enforce the rules and encourage them to keep up the good work.

Premium rooms are not updated/upgraded. This trip, we were in room 111 and found it disgusting! Having gone to the Alii for so long, we were aware that the owner has never put a dime in this unit, it is all original work when the Alii first opened. The stove had rust on the bottom drawer, the washer/dryer sounded as if they would come through the unit after us and worked so poorly that the detergent didn't rinse out of our darks, so we had 'streaks' on our clothes. The microwave was terrible, to cook frozen vegetables, it was double the time and still not completely done. Forget popcorn in the microwave! The dishwasher never did get the dishes clean. In the bathrooms, the caulk was either cracked,missing or had mold on it. We just didn't feel 'clean' in this unit. We had put towels from the pool area down on the sofa and chair. To the staff's credit, I went to the front desk to ask to see a premium room and mentioned to Glenda we needed to see the difference and mentioned our concerns. She showed us the higher priced room and what a difference! To the Alii's credit, we were given our $$ back for one night's stay, which was not really necessary. It was our choice to stay in a standard room vs a premium. I did ask Glenda about 'standards' the Alii has and she said, yes, room 111 is one of the last units to be rented out (no wonder we could get a room in September for the Christmas holiday at the Alii and only had to stay 7 nights instead of the mandatory 10). Glenda did tell me that each comment card a guest fills out, the general manager copies and forwards to the owner. The owner of unit 111 is very much aware of the negativity concerning this unit and still chooses not to do any updates.

We enjoyed breakfast and lunch everyday on our balcony (lanai) while watching the surfers try to catch a wave. We loved the spaciousness of our unit. We had about 1900sq ft and, with 2 kids, we used it all! The kids slept in one bedroom and they took over the den as their playroom. The in-room laundry was used everyday-so nice that they provided detergent. The housekeeping staff was very good and provided us with regular towels and tidied up the place.

Thank goodness we left on a snorkel trip early that morning but when we came back we found a note that the water had been shut off all day. We called the front desk and they told us that we could shower in a couple of rooms they were holding over at the Westin or Marriott and that there were port o potties located outside each building. Ha! We have 2 young potty trained kids and are not going to go all the way downstairs and outside to use the potty EVERY time they have to go! The management also delivered two 5 gallon water tanks to use for drinking only. We used it for more than that. We ended up spending our evening over at the Westin-we all showered (much better water pressure in the bath than our drip drip shower at the Alli) and then ate at Ono restaurant and then fed the flamingos and fish and listened to music with the kids. Good thing the water was turned on the next morning. Another small complaint was all the construction, window washing, tree trimming that was going on while we were there. I know it has to be done but it was kind of disruptive especially the tree trimming in the front lobby.

There were two adults and 4 \"kids\" between 17 and 24 from two families. I thought by booking the most expensive unit, I would have the best unit. It does not work that way. From all of the reviews, I expected a unit with 2 bedrooms and a den with a foldout couch or bed. When we arrived, we were told that the oceanfront units DO NOT HAVE DENS, and the couch in the living room was not a foldout, so we ended up with people sleeping on the couch and an uncomfortable rollaway in the middle of the living room. The situation was not ideal. I left a message for the manager on day 2 that was never returned. The other worst aspect was the lack of noise insulation or privacy. For some reason, probably moisture control, all of the doors to the bathrooms are louvered and very thin. We could hear everything that everyone did in the bathroom. There was a lot of wasted space in the units (enormous entry hall on a big L). I would have prefered the den that I expected. (I was told by the front desk that fewer than 5% of the units have dens, which is odd, since almost everyone that reviews these units raves about the extra den/bedroom.) Groceries are very expensive ($8 a gallon for milk, $4.50 a dozen for eggs, $8.00 for a small box of cereal, $6.50 for a 12 pack of sprite cans). We concluded that by the time you buy the stuff to go with a meal, like A1 ($7.00), salad dressing, etc., it was cheaper to go out to eat. We really liked breakfast at CJ Deli and Diner (a mile away - turn left as you get on the highway), and China Bowl in the same mall. We also liked Penne Pasta in Lehaina, also inexpensive, and Kobe Japanese Steakhouse. We grilled a few meals at the highly touted gas grills, but if I went back, I would cook less, if at all, and probably stay at the Westin, Marriott or Hyatt in Kaanapali, with much better pools. The premier oceanfront unit was more than $1000 a night. I could have had two hotel rooms and more service and privacy. The kitchen was well stocked and even had some spices.

Although this is a gorgeous resort in beautiful Maui, our stay was anything but relaxing. First of all, there is only one working elevator at the resort for each set of two buildings. We were told that this will be the case for at least the next five months while they are upgrading the elevators. This made going up and down a sometimes lengthy event. In fact, some members of our family resorted to the stairs even though we were on the 8th floor. On day one, we were informed that there would be loud construction noise in the building between 10 and 2 Tuesdays-Thursdays due to work on one of the units (think jackhammer). On day two we were awakened at 8 AM by constant beeping and construction noise from the just-begun construction at the Marriott next door. This continued on all weekdays from 8 AM to 5 PM. On day seven we were awakened at 5:30 AM to the sound of lots of feet and moving above us. It turned out that they were moving all furniture from the unit above us to begin construction there. By later that day, the noise level from the construction (gutting the place) above was so loud in our unit, that it was impossible to be there. Also, small pieces of ceiling were falling from the vibrations. Did I mention that water started coming in through the bathroom ceiling? Thankfully, we called the front desk and they took care of it. The noise from above continued for the rest of the stay. Additionally, we received notice that there would be no water in the building for one of the upcoming days since they had to turn it off for construction. I spoke to the manager at the Alii and was told that owners can renovate whenever they like. The Alii is not given specific dates for each unit renovation, and therefore, it is impossible to predict which units will be affected by the noise.

The master had a king bed and the 2nd bedroom had 2 queens and the loft off of the family room had an additional queen bed. We had 5 in our family and kids each had their own beds and plenty of space. We had 16 for dinner one evening with extended family staying in Napili and 10+ for lunch several times as well. We were able to entertain and have plenty of room for everyone. The kitchen was nicely upgraded with granite countertops and did I mention how much room there was??? We had daily maid service and she did an excellent job of keeping up the kitchen and floors, making the beds and replacing the linens. Boy, did I LOVE the daily maid service, on a place this large, without the help, I know that I would have had to spend much more of my vacation time keeping the place picked up. The pool is small but the padded lounge chairs and terry cloth covers make up for it a bit. They do not open the pool until 8 am which mean that people are not running down in the wee hours of the morning trying to reserve a space as with other local hotels. The staff keeps the ground immaculate and the pool area offers a shaded courtyard with TV, Ice Water and lemonade as well as cups. We also rented surfboard in Lahaina and they stored them for us in a secured location near the pool area. Gym is small but functional and the bell service upon check-in was top notch. I loved having a ground floor unit with a huge patio area and not having to wait for an elevator. Our location had easy access to pool, beach and parking. This place is classy with a capital C.

From the moment we walked in, we were not disappointed. We stayed in unit 143, which is considered an \"independent\" unit through Maui Beachfront Rentals. (Despite the unit number, it was a 4th floor unit.) The non-independent units are managed by Classic Resorts. The main difference is that CR runs the property. If something goes awry in the independant units, you will need to call Maui Beachfront Rentals to fix it. Other than that, the check in, etc is all the same. The staff was A+, especially Jere (front desk) and Henson (bell person). Housekeeping is weekly, not daily, which I actually prefer. We had viewed our unit online in advance, and while it appeared nice, it is not a remodeled unit with granite countertops, etc. We were fine with that, we have 3 boys, so we prefer non-museum quality digs. But to our surprise, the unit was much much nicer than it even appears on the website. Full kitchen, equipped with all dishes, cooking utensils, breadmaker, ricecooker, can opener, coffee maker, etc, etc. It even had a wine cooler!!! The washer dryer were accompanied by detergent, an ironing board, a utility sink ( for sandy beach things!!) etc. The master bath had a hair dryer. The 2 bedrooms were HUGE, and could have easily accomodated cribs, playpens or more rollaway beds. Each bedroom had a TV in it and a full bath next to it, tub /toilet /bidet/shower room separated from vanity, which is nice. Den had sofa bed and TV. LR had a sofa bed and music system, complete with cd's and tapes. Lanai was huge. I think this unit was approx 1900 sf. Our unit faced the Westin, to the north. We had both a view of the beach to the left, the mountains to the right, and the waterfall at the Westin straight in front of us. The waterfall was rather soothing, since Kaanapali is heavily populated with tourists. On occassion the Westin would have a party below, but it always ended at a decent hour, and was not unpleasant to us. We found this unit through More Hawaii 4 Less.com. We compared 4 properties in the immediate area, including Maui Ocean Club, and this was by far more bang for the buck for us. (Of course, availability affected prices, I'm sure.) We were quoted more money for much less in accomodations. We really took advantage of being able to eat in as needed, and made full use of the washing machine, so we had a lot of room for souvenirs, etc. We did stop at Costco on the way, but truthfully we would probably have done better at the Safeway. Even with a family of 5, we had leftovers of the Costco sizes of things. I would highly recommend getting meat /milk/fruit at Costco. I have to warn you, it was a zoo, full of pushy mainlanders, just like at home. We did pack our own cereal, snacks, coffee, crystal light, seasonings, pasta, etc in our luggage. As promised, the barbeques at KA are the nicest on the beach, and we and many others made full use of them. The pool is plain, but does the trick and has plenty of lounge chairs. They also have sand chairs for the beach in front of the complex. You can also rent the big covered chairs (they call it a cabana) for a very reasonalbe sum of $20 per half day. Well worth it, and you get full sun coverage. If your kids want floaties, rings, etc... just NICELY ask the pool shack guys if they have any leftovers from the tourists. There is a bin behind the pool shack with tons of stuff leftover, and they happily gave us some gently used swim rings. The Hyatt Regency is a few properties to the south, and is worth a visit. If I ever win the lotto, I will stay there! Do as we did, walk around, have some coffee and fresh pineapple at the little coffee stand just off the lobby. You can sit outdoors and enjoy their Koi pond, parrots, pengiuns and african cranes while sipping an inexpensive coffee. Then you can go back to your spacious condo. Whalers Village Shopping Center is just 5 walking minutes via beach pathway from KA. There is an ABC store ( Hawaii's version of 7/11, only with more souvenirs.) in the center, for milk, soda, liquor, condiments, etc. There is a Louis Vuitton, Tiffany and Coach store in this center as well. I will warn you, we thought the food court stunk. The coffee stand we liked, and we had excellent cocktails at the Rusty Harpoon. Try the Ginger Mango Martini, YUM. We enjoyed coffee and breakfast on the lanai every day, and I still miss it. The birds we saw were incredible, and sang to us all day! The KA is not an inexpensive property, but we waited 13 years to take this trip, and it was worth every penny. We highly recommend this property to larger famiy groups. Although there were many families staying there, we found it to be fairly quiet property, other than an occassional screaming tot. Not a lot of young single partiers. Location was good, and not far from the activities we chose. Traffic, compared to SoCal, was never evident. We visited Kula, Ma'alea, and Lahaina and had no trouble getting to them in a rental car. We highly recommend the following activities: Warren and Annabelle-Lahaina. Excellent grown up activity. Surfing Goat Dairy in Kula. Fun, GREAT cheese, and we fell in love with Kula. UFO Parasailing and Banana Boat Ride. Hailamaile General Store, which is really a restaurant. in an old general store. Excellent. Trilogy Maui to Lanai Cruise. Amazing, and we will definately do it again. The crew was the absolute best ever, the trip was well worth it for us. I plan on writing reviews for all of the above as soon as I can, here on trip advisor. We will definately be saving us to visit this property again. We hope you have as much fun as we did.

My husband, myself & our 3 year old daughter. I miss it already. We stayed in 332 a 3rd floor \"premier garden view.\" We felt it was very worth the money spent to upgrade to a \"Premier\" unit. Our unit was a 1 bedroom with a \"den\" (2nd bedroom which was open to the living room.) This unit had a pretty good view of the ocean and the mountain, gardens and a parking lot. I was really surprised that we were able to see the ocean and the mountain (mountain when on the patio.) Our unit was very nicely decorated. Beautiful granite and fully stainless kitchen. Our room was extremely clean. Every day our housekeeper would vacuum, mop the floors, clean the bathrooms, replenish towels and make our beds (They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do dishes.) Our house keeper remembered our names even when we would see her on the grounds away from our room she would always say \"Hello Mr. & Mrs. Taylor\". That really impressed me. On our 1st full day of staying at the Alii we found a note from management stating there was going to be loud construction for several days from 10am-2pm. We were really upset at the thought of having tons of noise close to our unit. Much to our relief, we heard very little noise the entire stay. It turned out that it wasn't a big deal at all! If I had to come up with one complaint about our unit it would be that the sectional sofa was old. It had some small holes in it and it smelled like B.O., and the carpet needed a good cleaning.... (Okay that's two complaints...both minor.) The entire facility far exceeded my expectations. The staff was exceptional. On our day of check out I called the front desk to see if we could check out later then the normal 11:00am. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us free of charge. They allowed us to stay until 2:00pm, which allowed us some time at the pool that morning. The grounds were gorgeous. They were very lush. Lots of flowering trees. The grounds were very well maintained. The pool was nice. It is not as big and fancy as some of the neighboring properties, but it was fine for our needs. My daughter could not get enough of the pool....especially the baby pool. The baby pool was just deep enough for me and my husband to sit in (water up to my shoulders) while my daughter played in it. It can get quite full with all the kids and parents, but it was fun to chat with the other parents while the kids played. The pools (big & baby pools) are tiled and were a bit slippery. My 3 year old slipped on a step and bumped the back of her head on the edge of the pool. The patio area around the pool should probably be redone. It looks pretty, but is also slippery and is starting the crumble. Be careful when walking with wet feet on the pool deck! They have more than enough pool loungers with nice lounge chair terry clothe covers in addition to nice thick beach towels for all of the guests. They have a water and ice machine, along with pop machine and complementary lemonade (afternoons only for lemonade) available in the pool area. There is also a concierge person located at the pool. She was able to book all of our activities with only a days notice. We found we paid less going through her, rather then another activity planner. They actually work for Expedia and we saved quite a bit of money with them. We really enjoyed staying at the Alii. It was located on a nice beach, which wasn't overly crowded. It is just about a 5 minute (or less) walk to Whaler's Village, which has several nicer restaurants and a few food court type places to eat. Whaler's Village has a nice mix of shops; including an ABC store which seems to have just about everything we needed (milk, bread, etc.) There is also a Safeway grocery store, about a 10 min. drive away in Lahina. To some it up, the Alii was a wonderful place to stay. It's in the center of everything you want to do, yet far enough away to avoid to problems of city life.

We usually put our dishes in the dishwasher ourselves but the last day we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and housekeeping took care of it. We grilled out at the complex grills and always found them to be very clean. The location of the complex was great and never felt crowded\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we walked down the beach toward the Sheraton, and that was really crowded. We were happy we were staying where we were! In the Whalers Village area, we ate at Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Tropico and hit the food court several times. All great food! It was nice to have an ABC store nearby\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if you need extra milk or yet another pineapple! The beach was pretty rough for our kids (10 & 13) while we were there. The waves broke right at the shore and they got the wind knocked out of them several times. We bought boogie boards but only used them one or two days. Body surfing was much safer. We saw that over and over again (with other people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c young and old alike) while we were there. If you walk down towards Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village, the ocean seems to get calmer. One of my ONLY complaints about the Kaanapali Ali\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i was the chair situation at the beach. There are no complimentary chaise lounges for the beach. They have complimentary beach chairs (sand chairs)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and then they have cabana beach chaise lounges for $40 per day (2 chaise lounges with shade). The problem is they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough lounges for everyone there. You have to reserve the day before to get one the next day. The pool attendant said that people line up at 8AM the day before just to reserve the cabanas for the next day! We thought that was ridiculous for the money you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying to stay there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6why not trade out the beach chairs for chaise lounges??? We reserved the cabana beach chairs one day but found that our kids went back and forth between pool and beach so much that they just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the money (we felt since we paid for them we should be using them!) There ARE complimentary chaise lounges at the pool which we ended up using every day. We never really had a problem finding open chairs. Yes, there are those people who go down early and put their towels down. But the pool staff usually clears them out after 2 hours (which is great!) During the day, there was complimentary coffee and cold lemonade down by the pool. There was also an ice machine with a water dispenser and a soda machine (we ended up using only half of our bottled water because fresh water was so readily available down at the pool). There was also a big screen TV down by the pool and shade for those who just had to see their sports (the Final Four and Masters were on while we were there so it was a great touch!) We took two boat excursions while we were there. The first was with Aqua Adventures (a snorkel/snuba trip to Molokini and Turtle Arches). They were top-notch with good food and service. There were about 32 people on board which made it one of the smallest snorkel operations out there. The second was an all-day sail to Lana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i with Paragon. This was our favorite trip. There were less than 24 people on board (I think the boat holds 49?) and we were never crowded! We sailed over to Lana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i, snorkeled an hour and then we were taken to a beautiful beach for about an hour and a half to have a deli lunch and swim in the ocean. The sail back was a fun, wet one (if you wanted it to be) and we saw whales breaching and flapping their fins. It was great! Other restaurants we ate at were Roys (love their Dark Chocolate Souffle), Pacific O (the best meal we had!), Hali\u00e2\u20ac\u2122imaile General Store (we ate their on our last night before heading to the airport). All were great meals. We also did the Old Lahaina Luau and it was wonderful. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to several others over the years but this one is our favorite. Its very authentic, has wonderful food and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hokey. Our kids really enjoyed it.

We opted to stay in a condo because we were travelling with our three college-age children. We booked through Royal Hawaiian Condos which we found online. Though we booked many months in advance, a premier unit was not available. However, we were assured that if we were dissatisfied with our room, an acceptable unit would be found. When we arrived at the hotel, they very graciously told us that a premier unit would be available the following night. Because we had an all-day hike planned the following day (Maui Eco-Adventures: Highly recommended!), they advised us to leave our packed bags in the first unit's foyer and upon our return, we would be completely relocated to the new unit. The first condo was somewhat dated, with stained carpeting and barely acceptable bathrooms. The premier unit was absolutely magnificent, similar to others described on this site. The upcharge was a mere $35/night, and we were relocated effortlessly--and, to the 10th floor with a view straight up to Black Rock and across to Molokai'i, compared to the other unit which was on the 3rd floor in a different building and offered a limited ocean view. From the moment we checked in, until the moment we left, every staff member was extremely friendly and accommodating. The condominium was huge--ideal for a family of our size--and should really be regarded as a 3 bedroom rather than a 2 bedroom as described. The grounds are meticulously maintained and quite lush. Though the pool is relatively small compared to neighboring hotels' elaborate layouts, the Ali'i has plenty of chaises and ample availability of towels and chair covers. There's always ice water and lemonade available poolside. In addition, attentive staff members are never too far away. A limited continental breakfast is available poolside daily beginning around 8 AM. The location is ideal and offers the perfect blend of condo living with hotel amenities. Having a washer/dryer available in the unit allows you to pack less (and leave room for purchases!), which is especially important considering airlines' strict baggage weight limits. Individual air-conditioning controls in each living area were a huge advantage, with this caveat: If you don't completely close the sliding doors to the lanai, the a/c shuts off, an understandable design feature. We grilled fresh fish (ono, hebi, mahi mahi, opah--purchased at The Fish Market located on nearby Lower Honoapili'ini Road) and had delightful sunset dinners on our lanai. The process of cooking on the world's cleanest grills was thoroughly enjoyable, allowing us to meet fellow guests from all over the world, some of whom were returning to the Ali'i for their 10th year! We have taken elaborate vacations with our family all over the world, staying in 5 star venues, and can heartily endorse the Ali'i as being in a class with the best we've seen and experienced. Comments by others who stayed here regarding water shutoffs and other disruptions due to construction were accurate, but the hotel handled these extremely minor inconveniences in a fine manner and our stay was in no way affected. We regard the Ali'i as a true \"find,\" and breathed a great sigh of relief as we settled in and realized that what was once a complete \"wild card,\" turned into the major factor that made this the best vacation ever.", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Alli....Gig Harbor, Washington\u201d", "Author": "phscoach", "ReviewID": "UR5491374", "Content": "We stayed at the Alli for 10 days in late June to early July.

The hotel is on the southern end of Kaanapali Beach, between Whaler's Village and the Hyatt and Marriott resorts, so it's quiet and not crowded at all. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. There's a pool, but we never used it. The beach is just a few steps away!!! Secondly, the staff is wonderful. Before we drove to the hotel, we stopped at Costco to stock up on groceries and snacks, so in addition to all our luggage, we had boxes and boxes of food. The staff took care of it all. They unloaded our car while we checked in, valet parked our car (at no charge), and when we were ready, gave us a tour of the grounds and escorted us to our condo. Housekeeping staff was friendly and kept our condo immaculate. Thirdly, the condo was huge! It was 1500 sq. feet, which is bigger than some people's houses. It had one bedroom with a king sized bed, two full baths (yes!), a fully stocked kitchen (utensils, pots, pans, glassware, serving dishes, dish soap, everything!), living room, dining room, another small area with a sofa bed, a laundry room (with detergent), and a great lanai. I paid about $450 per night, but it was worth it, considering all the space and amenities. A 360sq. ft. room at the Westin next door would have cost the same. Of course, not everything can be perfect. There were a few things that could have made our stay even better, such as: 1. I should have booked an updated unit. Our condo was nice, but it was starting to look a little old. The bathrooms could have used a remodel. 2. I had booked a full ocean view and paid a premium for it, but what we got was more like a partial ocean view. From the lanai, you kinda had to crane your neck to see the ocean. We had a better view of the West Maui mountains.

This was our second time at the Alii (see 1st post on 7/8/04) and we had a magnificent time. Our visit was 6/25-7/2/05. When I booked the room, directly via Classic Resorts, I mentioned that we were repeat visitors and we were given a discount! We requested a high floor, premier ocean view room. Having stayed in '04, we were quite familiar with the layout and knew which building would give us the best view and requested Bldg 4. Upon arrival, we were told that there were no high floors available, but they could move us to a higher floor in 2 days. Rm#424 was absolutely beautiful and totally upgraded; only problem is that it was on the 2nd floor (only view was of the roof near the swimming pool). We were allowed to preview the room (2 bd/2bth & Murphy bed in living room)before we were moved in and it too was upgraded (#393). Although it wasn't in the bldg we requested, it was a premier ocean view nonetheless. The management was very accomdating during check-in and moving to another room. No attitude, no negativity, no disrespect. My advice is to remain calm & treat others as you would like to be treated and there should be no problem. There were units being renovated during our stay, but was not an imposition at any time. We took the Maui Princess Dinner Cruise + Luau (Royal Lahaina Luau) combo. Both were fantastic. We saw Warren & Annabelle's Magic show (matinee), which was quite entertaining; just getting into the auditorium was \"magical\"...you'll have to go to find out how much fun that is (remember to use logic). We went on a Submarine ride (educational as well as fun). Hubby enjoyed golfing @ Kaanapali Golf course, across the street (our son got a kick driving the cart). Otherwise, we stayed near our condo, walked to the Whalers' Village, had dinner at restaurants near the Alii, tanned at the beach/pool. Kids did their own thing, keeping in touch via cellphone. Hubby & I walked the path to the Sheraton, had a drink and walked back; it wasn't as far as it looked. We were able to leisurely enjoy party spots and quiet solitude and not once did the kids complain! They're ready to do it again...I wonder, when will they take us to Maui? Tip: we wanted to have a meal at Bubba Gumps, but late afternoon and evening was always busy with nearly 2hr wait; so we went for late lunch, which was easier to get a seat and water view. Front St was less crowded, so we were able to browse w/o the usual crowds. The only thing we didn't get to do was the Road to Hana and parasailing...uhmmmm, seems like another trip is required! When going to Maui, will always stay at the Alii. It's the best of both worlds...again, the pool is not as grand as other hotels, instead it's quite simple, but serves its purpose. Try it and you won't be disappointed, some may think it's pricey, but where else in Maui can you get 2bd/2bth condo with full kitchen (upgraded w/granite counters, dining room, stainless steel appliances), free parking, restaurant privileges, with Alli vouchers, located right on the beach w/magnificent views and rooms 1500-1900 sq ft., for under < $600/nite?

A big kitchen, dining room and living room with a huge master suite with a king size bed and a smaller 2nd bedroom with 2 double beds. There were very nice TVs in the living room (with a VCR/DVD) and also in each bedroom. We went with our 3 teenagers (18,17 & 15) and there was plenty of room to spread out.

The kitchen looked to be original from the 80s, not very modern, but clean and still very nice. The furniture was nothing fancy, but again, comfortable. It was great to have a full kitchen for breakfasts and lunches. They have 8 gas grills by the pool where you can barbeque at either lunch or dinner. The pool area is not huge, but good size. The pool is free form, again, not huge.

Unit #112,---------, is ocean view, first floor, easy access to pool, beach and parking, and BEAUTIFULLY decorated! The unit is a two-bedroom, though seems slightly smaller than the ~1500 sq ft recommended, but is ample space for a family of four and offers two bedrooms, two baths, which is very convenient! The baths/kitchen are nicely appointed with granite and tile, travertine flooring throughout (except carpet in bedrooms) and the living areas have comfy furniture. We chose to eat in for several of our meals as were traveling with our 2yr old son, who was adjusting to the time zone differences and needed extra rest and peace and quiet to avoid being too overwhelmed - groceries can be purchased ~2.5mi south at the Safeway grocery at Lahaina Cannery Mall. Bring your Safeway/Von's/etc. card so you can get the sale prices! The Kaanapali Alii grills are stainless steel built-ins and very nice and clean, so worth getting some meat/fish to grill out at least once during your stay. Otherwise for cooking in, the Alii #112 has modern stainless appliances and a ceramic flat top cooking surface, in addition to a microwave, coffee maker, and even a blender for making your own Lava Flows! The pool was nice and not overcrowded, though we traveled during an offpeak season. Lots of nice people at the resort who helped with any questions we had. The beach is a bit steep as noted in other reviews, but is silky soft sand and still enough beach to enable playing and getting your feet wet without dropping off into the deeper areas. We recommend that you move over just to the south end of the Alii resort beach area, as is more shallow and seemed to have less coral in the shallow waters as well. The building, like many hotels, can get a bit noisy as seems walls/floors are not well insulated, enabling sounds from condos above and around to be heard, but not so much as to be distracting overall for your peace and quiet. Other points of interest: The Royal Lahaina Resort's Luau just to the north is perfect for those traveling with children as offers a kids' menu of chicken nuggets, French fries, hot dogs, etc. And, the food overall at the Luau was delicious! Lots to offer and all was wonderful. The show itself is also quite good. It was misting rain while we waited in the line outside and the resort/luau management were kind enough to provide plastic ponchos to all guests which I understand at others were offered at a charge! Kimo's Restaurant in Lahaina has great prime rib that melts in your mouth! And, do try the Hula Pie, though recommend that more than one person share it as it's huge! Cheeseburger in Paradise was nice for a lunch out, but recommend Bubba Gump's for similar, but better, food and a very fun atmosphere. Lahaina Fish Company left us unimpressed overall for its seafood, as wasn't the best, or near the best, that we have had, but others seemed to like it well, so might still be worth a try depending on your tastes. If you are interested in a bit more of a drive for seafood, we have been told by several that Mama's Fish House in Kuau is the best - we opted out as again traveling with a two-yr old, so didn't spend a lot of time driving in the car.", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey Shore", "Title": "\u201cA great place for families\u201d", "Author": "travelgirl88", "ReviewID": "UR3931398", "Content": "Our family of four stayed at the Ali'i for five nights.

Shocked at her rudeness, I questioned her further. She said that 12 of the condos are maintained separately and I had one of them, which meant no weight room, no yoga, no housekeeping, no privileges at the Westin, etc. It also meant that mine was quite out of date and that there was no full ocean view, as I had paid for. No big deal, but just be aware. She handed me a beautiful brochure and told me that next time I might rethink who I book through. Also, she told me that the water would be turned off the next day to renovate another condo, and that cable workers would be in and out of the condos Monday through Friday. The clerk walked away without telling us which building we were in and where to find it, and where to park. We were very kind and were shocked at the way we were treated. It is for this reason that we won't return to the Ali'i. The pool was also closed for at least 24 hours because someone had a big accident in it. We worked around all of these issues and had the most wonderful vacation in Maui and Kauai. The Ali'i was only 5 out of our 11 days in Hawaii.

What a treat. We are a family of 4 with 2 children ages 9 and 11. The Alii gave us space and comfort and our view from our 1 bedroom 2 bath accommodations gave us front row seats for the most gorgeous sunsets. The condo offers maid service every day, which includes making the beds, new towels, vacuuming, dishes, and optional turn down service. The condo is large, large enough we could have easily shared it with another couple and 2 small children. The complex offers an average size pool (no slides or beverage service) but new and beautiful barbeques for everyone to use. The ocean is at your door and the beach there is #1. The staff was very helpful. And did I mention top notch tennis courts with lights. As I sit here and write this I am half tempted to see if they are booked for an October just Mom and Dad trip. I would highly recommend this complex if you are a family and would like to save a few bucks by having the option to have a full kitchen that enables you to have breakfast and/or lunch in your room. Which is pretty easy since there is a grocery store just a short car ride away and worth the trip just to have a wonderful table at sunset - just you and your family with wine and or kid drinks with umbrellas.

I used Royal Hawaii to book and was not disappointed. The 1st trip in April of 2004, I booked a 'premier' condo. This means it was recently updated with tile, subzero fridge, updated kitchen and bathrooms. Unit 372 was very nice. This most recent trip in July 2005, I did not reserve a 'premier' and was concerned. However, when I arrived, condo #3112 was also very nice. While not as updated as the premier, it still met all of our needs, was clean and had a beautiful ocean view on the 11th floor. The owners of both units have taken very good care of their property. Since the units are 1500-1900sq ft, they may be too large for a single or couple who don't need or want that space or a kitchen. However, if they want quiet, the Alii is very quiet. I have never heard people in other units. Unlike a hotel with paper thin floors and walls. The employees at Kaanapali Alii were helpful and friendly. No complaints here. They even have security people near the beach to ensure the safety of resort guests. Location, location....the Kaanapali Alii is on the beach, has a pool, exercise room and gas bbq's. The Alii is just a short walk to the major hotels such as the Westin and Marriott. Thus, fine dining, nightclubs and shopping is within walking distance. Two resort golf courses are within walking distance and the lovely town of Lahaina is a short 5 min drive down the road.

My husband's family has been coming here almost yearly since the 70's. (I think they keep coming here for old time's sake). The pros of this hotel are: -The location (right in the middle of everything in Kaanapali. Five minute walk from Whaler Village) -The beach is pretty uncrowded compared to the big resorts nearby, and it's nice clean sand. -Very roomy condos. Nice sized kitchens and bedrooms. We have four small children and need all the space we can get. (We have stayed in a 2 BR each time) -Very clean and everything in good working condition. -Fully equipped kitchens are great. (one year we even made a full Thanksgiving dinner in ours!) Though you won't save as much money as you'd expect since groceries are so expensive. $8 for a box of Fruit Loops at the Lahaina Safeway! We brought boxes of cereal and baby formula in our suitcases last time to save $. -Having a washer/dryer is a dream. Also means less clothes to bring on your trip. (Leaves more room for groceries! LOL!) The cons: -The rooms need serious updating. They claim that most rooms have been recently renovated, but I've never managed to stay in one. On our last trip our family had three condos in different towers and they all looked like something out of a \"Three's Company\" episode. -The pool is nice but nothing great. Compared to all the fancy pools at the nearby hotels, my kids were kind of let down. There is a nice little kiddie pool for the very youngest guests. Small pool area also means the \"5 a.m. beach chair scramble\". Not enough chairs to go around! -No restaurants on site. Either you have to cook in your room or walk somewhere else to eat. Kind of a drag when you're in the pool and just want a quick bite. The Marriott next door delivers, but it takes forever. -Nothing fancy about this place. No artwork, no gorgeous landscaping, not even a real lobby! Call me petty, but when I pay this much money I want something special! Especially when the nearby hotels are so fantastic. If the condos were cheaper it would be worth it , but for this price they don't seem like a good value. The Alii is not gross or run down, just nothing great. If you have your heart set on staying in Kaanapali (though most of our friends stay in Kihei and really like it.) and want the space and convenience of a condo, you can try the Kaanapali Alii. There are lots of comments from people who've stayed in nice units, so you may want to try requesting one of those, if you can find out the #.

Hawaii in general is very pricey, but it is great to stock up the condo with food and save some money each day. It is incredible to eat breakfast each day on the balcony and come in for lunch after a tiring morning of swimming, snorkeling and lying in the sun and not have to wait for food to be served to you at a restaurant. Then, we could splurge on a nice dinner at night. This place is great for families and there is plenty of room. The rooms are pricey here, but if you have children, you are saving money in the long run -- one condo, plus eating certain meals in is less than buying two hotel rooms and eating out every meal. This place has luxurious units, but it feels like a home. It never gets too crowded and it creates a very easy vacation. It does not have a hotel feel at all -the pool doesn't have waterfalls and slides like the other hotel resorts and you won't see swans on top of koi ponds.

Plenty of room in the kitchen to bring and store lots of food. Our kids enjoyed the nice little mini golf course, and playing shuffle board, and everything is centrally located around the clubhouse - so it was all there in one area. Pool area is nicle; however my kids had one complaint- the depth in both pools was only 4 feet. Not a problem for me - was great for cooling off while lounging by the pool, but they wanted to jump and dive, etc and got bored of the pool pretty quickly. There was an outdoor hottub next to the pool. No indoor hottub, but we used our in-room jacuzzi, which was a very nice one, located in the master BR. Now - here is the BEST part of the whole trip: We checked out of our unit and went to spend our last few hours at Silver Dollar City before heading home. As we were headed out of town, we realized that we had left behind an ipod touch in the room (we figured out that it had fallen down into the crack of the couch). My husband said we would never see it again - but I called the front desk, she took my number to call me back after checking with housekeeping. We decided to drive back to the resort to see if they would let us check ourselves, since we thought we knew what happened to it. Very pessimisticly, we entered the front lobby, began explaining our story ..... and the lady was grinning and very slowly lifted her hand .... holding my pink ipod!! Housekeeping had found it, and had actually returned it!! I was so very pround of that housekeeping lady at that point - she could have easily kept it herself, as it was worth several hundred dollars.

We were told at Big Cedar (south of Branson) that 2pm is no problem for check in if you just ask. We called and asked at 10:30 and were told they'd do their best. We showed up at 2:30 and were told that they would do what they could. During the check in/concierge briefing, we brought up the Big Cedar salesman's comment and were told that since they had our cell phone the concierge was sure we'd be called any minute. We finally got in at 3:30. 60 minutes later is not \"any minute.\" My point to this is, if you are not going to do something special for a customer, don't make them believe that you are. Just say \"No. That's not our policy\". Don't give a sense of false hope on the assumption that when the customer calls back all ticked off, *you* won't have to deal with them. Anyway, on to the actual resort. The 2 bedroom unit was nice but there were enough things broken that made me question the quality of the place. i.e. three lights burnt out, toilet seat busted, dirt in the corners, etc. Plus the fact that they allow smoking on the property pretty much ruins everything for me personally. Sitting out on the deck in the morning? Nope... smokers. Playing mini-golf? Nope. Smokers. The mini-golf was very easy but it's nice to not have to worry about hitting into water hazards or things like that. The outdoor pool is small and usually crowded with kids so if you are looking to sit around the pool and relax, this isn't the place. Unless 25+ kids screaming is relaxing to you. The indoor pool was very cold. The kitchen was very nice and spacious as was the living area and the bedrooms are nice.

The other studio is a small, dinky room with a full size bed, a super small microwave that barely fits anything, a small tv, and that is about it. We have to call in advance to ask for access to a laundry, which means we have to haul our clothes all over the complex. If we want to cook, we have to go up to the clubhouse and use their kitchen. Since we were planning on saving money by cooking most of the meals for the week, it is even more disappointing. The time we will waste running up to the clubhouse any time we need to heat something up is a great way to ruin a meal. I am so disappointed in this studio.

We had one one-bedroom suite plus an adjoining studio room for the girls. The units we had shared a common entryway that also enclosed a utility closet with full-size washer-dryer. Our one-bedroom condo was clean and quite spacious and was obviously designed for access for those with disabilities and/or wheelchair use. The only 'cramped' area was the tiny corner-style shower stall in the master bath. Off-setting that was a huge two-person jacuzzi bath in the master bedroom. The furnishings in general were on the low-end side but functional with the exception of an extremely uncomfortable sofa (for sitting, at least - it was a sleeper-sofa). There was, however, a nice large flat-screen TV in the living area and a smaller one in the bedroom and the studio. The bathrooms and kitchen were clean and well-stocked (only one night's worth of coffee supplied, but we bought our own so that wasn't an issue). Kitchen was surprisingly well-appointed with coffee-maker, microwave, blender - the works! Refrigerator had an icemaker that worked well. Plenty of towels and extra toilet paper and such. Of course being a condo there was no daily maid service so you're using the same linens your entire stay, but so what? At the end of your stay you strip your own bed and pile your towels in the bathroom and take out the trash - a small price to pay IMO. Although the unit was a little difficult to locate, in the end it was a great location - far enough away from 'The Strip' to be nice and peaceful, but close enough to get to just about anything pretty easily. To give you an idea, it is on the south-west side of town just off of Hwy 165 and about a mile south of the 'Yellow Route' (Green Mtn. Dr.). There was a convenient Sonic just up the street, and also a little shopping mall that had a fantastic Japanese-style restaurant (Shogun Steak & Sushi - recommended!) and also a Shorty Small's just to the south. Just north on 165 is the Yellow Route, and a little further north is the Hwy 76 'Strip' - east to Branson proper and west to Silver Dollar City. So overall a very good location, depending on what you're there to do. My main complaint about this property besides the somewhat cheesy furnishing and spartan decor is the noise from adjoining rooms. We were on the lowest floor and could hear the slightest footsteps from the room above us. I'm sure the folks above weren't 'stomping around', but any walking around was heard loud and clear. Depending on how many people are in the room (I think I saw 5 people going in there once), it gets pretty noisy. Just be aware. And as someone else mentioned the heating & air unit wasn't exactly 'whisper quiet' - more like an airliner taking off. We used both the heat and the A/C while we were there and were able to stay comfortable - I'm sure being on the bottom floor helped in that regard. The complex also had other amenities that we didn't use during our stay, such as a mini-golf course, sports court, pool tables, playground, etc. Overall a nice place with lots of large trees/shade and as I said fairly secluded. I'd recommend this facility, with a caveat about the noise.

Our original purchase was at Big Cedar and that is the resort where we had intended using our points. Unfortunately it is next to impossible to get a reservation at Big Cedar so we were forced to stay in Branson at the Falls Village. We traveled with our son and his wife and 3 children ages10, 5 and 4. As always they were looking forward to a lot of pool time. The pool was extremely cold and when we asked if the temperature could be increased I was told \"we have to keep it no more than 81 degrees, because when we had it warmer it was causing damage to the pool room\". The kids spent about 5 minutes in the pool and about 5 minutes in the \"hot tub\" which was the temperature of bathwater. I was in the water in both areas and can speak from experience. We were ask to attend the \"informative session\" the next morning and were offered gift money to attend. I declinded firmly. Never the less we were disturbed at 9AM the next morning with a phone call offering more money if we would attend. We still declined. At 9:50 PM we received a call from the front desk that there had been a complaint about too much noise. We had a suite under us and also over us. When we made the reservation they asked how many children were with us. This is what we were doing at the time they called us. The 4 adults were sitting at the table speaking in normal tones, the TV was off. We do not drink, so alcohol was not involved. The children were in the floor playing with stuffed toys and playing hide and seek. Our shoes were off. Anyone who has been around 4 and 5 year olds know they run instead of walk and laugh . The problem is, the floors squeak every time you walk across the floor and the the walls vibrate every time you shut a door. We could hear the people up stairs too.

Also lots to do at the resort itself. such as pool, playground, basketball, hot tub, swimming pool, indoor and outdoor. We are bluegreen owners and did our review in exchange for a $50 visa card. Well worth it. The lady that gave the review, although of course she tried to sell us more points, was very nice, and was not rude when we declined. We went to the Wax Museum, which we could have skipped, it was neat but pricey for only being in there for 25 mins or so. We also went to Ripley's which I really liked! Very interesting and neat if you like that sort of thing. By far our absolute favorite thing we did while in Branson was Ride the Ducks. It was very fun, our Captain, Captain Crunch was very friendly, funny, and outgoing, he really made the trip fun. He even gave the chance for anyone to drive the boat, our 2 yr. old did and loved it!

The other reviews of parking though are correct. If we got back late from a show, we had to park at the far end of the lot away from our room.

After the fourth day of listening to pretty much constant loud footsteps, children running and jumping, the ceiling light fixtures rattling when people were walking overhead, whirlpool above our bedroom running at 3:30 - 4:00 in the morning - we were finally given the option of moving to another unit but only after numerous calls of complaint to the front desk. By this time we were completely exhausted from lack of sleep and not able to enjoy daily activities with our children. The new unit we moved to was located adjacent to the pool area and the first night in that unit people were extremely loud outside of our unit until 1:00 sounding like spring break in Florida or something (somewhat better than 4:00 a.m. but still irritating). Management did nothing to quiet the revellers. Starting around 7:00 we got to listen to the nonstop clanking of the metal gate being shut leading in and out of the pool by staff and maintenance workers and then later by guests.

They wish it was a little deeper. The kitchen was very well stocked with table setting for six as well as all the pots, pans, etc. If you are going to be cooking for many you may want to bring an extra saucepan. There is one large pot and one small saucepan, plus two skillets. The kitchen made our stay more affordable since we ate most of our meals in the room. It has a two burner stove top, a microwave and small refrigerator. The tv/dvd was a 28 or 32 inch. The girls and I watched the Academy Awards show while the guys played games. Our son brought his Wii from home and hooked it up. We went to the Ralph Foster Museum and the play Seussical the Musical at College of the Ozarks. The Museum is free to high school kids and younger and just $6 for adults. We spent two hours there. Very interesting...lots of Ozark history...music....guns....dolls...Kewpie exhibit.....birds and animals....etc. There is also a mill, fruitcake and jelly operation, and several other places to visit on campus. We will do some of them next time. I was able to visit the one bedroom model while there and will rent it next time. It is much, much bigger than the studio and has a 54 in TV as well as a jacuzzi tub in the bedroom. It has a sleeper sofa and a full kitchen. It also has a porch to set out on, which the studio doesn't.

It was a little hot and humid (90's) all week so the air conditioned rooms were appreciated. The six of us (husband and I with 4 children ages 15, 13, 10 and 7) had 2 units that combined would sleep 8. The kitchen/living room area was huge. Our room had a king sized bed and a heart shaped whirlpool tub. The bathroom was also huge. The only thing I didn't like about the unit was that there were so many light switches all over the place - I never did figure the system out without trying them all to get the one I wanted. But that's a minor complaint. An issue that may affect some people is that the resort is quite spread out on a hill. It's quite a climb if you end up staying in a building unit that is at the bottom since the pool, office, etc is at the top. Because of my husband's bad knees, we always request a first floor unit whenever we stay places. I did the same this time not realizing that it was on such an incline. We should have asked for a second floor unit since that was level with the parking lot. First floor guests had to go down stairs to get to their units and third floor guests had to climb up stairs. (not sure if all the buildings are that way, but most that I observed were that way. I assume that if your building is on the top of the hill by the office, then the first floor units would be the ones with no stairs for access.) The \"A\" unit that my 3 daughters had to themselves was like a hotel room with the kitchenette and beds in the same area. Still nice though. It had a fold-out couch so could sleep 4 adults if needed, but would be crowded. The \"A\" and \"B\" units shared a washer and dryer in the foyer which really helped us a lot. I washed clothes the day before we left so when we got home I had less to do!! We only ate out one night while on vacation (I didn't mind cooking and eating in - it saved us a lot of money and we enjoyed cooking and eating as a family for once!). We bought a bunch of groceries at Jubilee and took picnic lunches with us when we went sight-seeing. If you have a large family like we do, I suggest bringing a larger frying pan. Between the two rooms, we shared some of the dishes and cooking items, but still could have used a larger sized fry pan. The resort has an indoor pool and hot tub as well as an outdoor pool and hot tub. Basketball, shuffleboard, playground and mini golf are a few other amenities. There is no daily maid service but you can request an exchange of towels mid week. The room has a vacuum, broom, etc to use as needed.

We signed up for this tour at BassPro. We were initially told we would tour Big Cedar Lodge, but when we received our confirmation letter it stated we would tour the Falls Village and would stay at the Radisson Hotel. I called the toll-free number to confirm our stay. A few weeks later I received another letter from BlueGreen stating they received our confirmation. However, after carefully examining the letter I noticed we were no longer staying at the Radisson, but the Grand Oaks Hotel. I called BlueGreen and they told me the Radisson no longer participates in their program (which I understand why now). We didn't want to stay at the Grand Oaks so I asked if the Clarion still participated with BlueGreen and was told they did. I was told by the BlueGreen rep that the Clarion would be calling me back within 48 hours to confirm our stay. I requested a king-bed and was told this would not be a problem. I allowed 72 hours to pass and received no calls from BlueGreen. I called them to confirm our stay at the Clarion and they told me we were not staying there that we had been upgraded to stay at the Falls Village Resort. I specifically asked if we would have a king-room and was told yes. Had I not contacted BlueGreen we would have tried to check-in at the Clarion and weren't even scheduled to stay there. Upon checking in at the Falls Village we got to our room and it was a full-size bed. I called the front desk and received their answering machine/voice mail and explained what happened and asked for them to return my call. I let one hour pass and no one returned my call. My husband and I then had to go back to the main lodge (during a tornado watch) and explain in person what happened. The front-desk told us her hands were tied that she couldn't put us in a king room. This was something done by BlueGreen's marketing department and she had no control over it. I explained to her that we were told we had a king room and she still told us she couldn't do anything about it. She said, \"I can give you marketing's phone number and you can call them.\" She should have offered to call them for us, which my husband finally asked her to do and she acted put-out that she had to contact them. Forty-five minutes later marketing still could not change our room so we insisted they put us up at the Clarion. They put my husband on hold and came back and told him the Clarion didn't have any rooms available so I called the Clarion. Well, they did have rooms available, so BlueGreen lied to us. With this being said I would not stay at this property again, or purchase one of their time-shares.

There was not enough parking to accomodate being able to park near your unit. 2. The refrigerator in the unit I had would not keep things very cold, even though it was turned all the way up. 3. The carpets were very, very filthy. My granddaughter walked on them with her bare feet and we thought perhaps it was just from wearing sandels all day, so we washed her feet and not 10 minutes later, her feet were black as coal again. The carpets definitely need a deep cleaning or replaced.", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Falls Village Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d96584-Reviews-Falls_Village_Resort-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$107 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">200 Creekside Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65616</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "96584", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/dc/4d/dc4de473e7bca4c7629ed5399ceaab255large.jpg"}}

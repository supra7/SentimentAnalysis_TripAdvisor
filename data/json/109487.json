We always go for Best Western due to a very exceptional experience in Houston. First, this is the first Best Western that doesn't have a typical hotel building (all rooms in a single building). I didn't know that it was formerly a Days Inn which we are also familiar of. That probably explains why we have to go out for the continental breakfast and why the walls are so thin. ACTUAL REVIEW: Price: cheap considering it is in a city. Location: very convenient to the places we wanted to visit. Cleanliness: Rooms are clean. Bathroom and bathtub are clean to soak in. Staff/ Service: They are courteous but nothing beats West Chase at Houston. Nobody went up and beyond to make sure we comfortable, not that they didn't take care of us. Just not superb. Rooms: The walls are thin. Our room is on the ground level and every step of the occupant upstairs are heard. I didn't sleep good due to this. Continental breakfast: Average menu plus a waffle maker. Safety: The area felt safe, it's the other guests that makes me nervous. They are very noisy in the middle of the night. TV/ Internet: Very average.

We explained that we just wanted to grab a quick bite without traveling very far and hit the room! She told us of several places right on the other side of the highway, and there was a restaurant in on the other side of the parking lot that she recommended and supplied us with a menu. It was a bit pricey so we opted for going across the highway. We were pleased with our King room. It was clean and inviting. The bathroom was a bit small - it was fine for one night, but would get old after a week's stay. The only complaint I would have if any was the noise. We had a group next door to us that hung out outside the room chatting. Also a HUGE pickup truck right outside our door that cranked up at 5am and rattled the windows! The lobby area for breakfast was also very small. Just a few tables so if you don't time it right for breakfast, there is nowhere to sit.

I stayed here because the price was right for the amount of time that I was staying for. (Over 1 week and about $56 bucks a night). Like I stated in my title, you get what you pay for here. The room was a standard motel room with a bed, small pullout couch, ironing board, small microwave, small fridge, ironing board, and basic toiletries. The room for the most part was clean. When I was in the bathroom, I did not see any mold in the shower and the toilet was clean and functioning. The sheets appeared to be clean and the room did not smell. However, the people next to us I believe were smoking in the room and the smell was seeping through the walls a tad but not to the point where it was nauseating. The entry ways to the rooms are all exterior so just be aware of that when booking. The neighborhood appears to be ok that the motel is in. The motel is loctaed next to the freeway and right off the service road so it is located on a very busy street. There is a small free continental breakfast in the morning with cereal, fruit, powdered scrambled eggs, juices, coffee, and make you own waffels. If you are looking for a quick, non fancy bite to get yur day going, its really not that bad.

This fits that bill, but not much else. Feels very much like the old Days Inn it used to be. The lobby has certainly been cleaned up (isn't it always?), but the rest leaves a lot to be desired. Beat-up parking lot and stairs, gross pool area, generally dingy feeling from the moment you exit your car till you enter your room. Room was...a room. I don't say that in a hotel snob way, but I have seen plenty of budget places nowadays that do it much, much better. My room was cleanish and functional, with two key exceptions that you count on most: First, had a case of the classic motel A/C that's mounted under the front window and mainly blows behind the billowing curtain without actually cooling the room. I had to weight down the curtains with some shoes to avoid sweating all night. Second, the shower pulsed between hot and cold most of the time. Not ever scalding or freezing, but just enough to remind you that you wanted out as quickly as possible. I probably could have lived with all that, but the final nail in the coffin was the Buzzbrews 24-hour restaurant about 50 feet from the office. The restaurant itself is good, but be aware that it can draw the post-bar-closing crowd. My first of 3 nights (a MONDAY, not a weekend) was interrupted by a bunch of drunken \"woo-hoo!\"'s in our shared parking lot from 2:00 to 3:30 AM.

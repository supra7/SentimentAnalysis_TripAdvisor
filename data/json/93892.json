When I arrived the exterior looked like a youyh hostel or a homeless shelter wpeople milling around outside the front door. The check in went well, the clerk was pleasant and helpful. The one way street outside was full so I had to use \"valet\" parking. My room was almost clean, the bed/bedding was clean but the floor was in need of vaccuming and it was not stocked with towels. The longer I stayed, the more I noticed. I found jelly beans, shredded paper and crumbs in various areas of the room. As I checked the bathroom I found hair from previous occupants in the shower. Luckily for me, I carry Lysol disinfectant cleaner in my bag. During the night I heard what sounded like garbage trucks and other noises throughout the night. Checkout was an unpleasant experience with a confused and frazzled young trainee working the front desk apparently alone. Other employees were out searching for cars that had been \"valet parked\", previously. At that time I was told that I should have called 30 minutes before I needed my car. As I waited I watched kitchen staff/cooks(?) come to the lobby to hang out. One look at their clothing and hair and I was so glad that I had not partaken of the \"free breakfast\".

I left my car in the Hopkins garage and used the hotel's complementary shuttle each day. I was offered a discounted Hopkins rate on my room, which was delightfully un-fussy (no faux-art or foolish frills), with a very nice galley kitchen, king bed, free wired or WiFi Internet connection, and excellent soundproofing. It was meticulously clean, and with a charming view toward Mt. Vernon Place in historic Baltimore. The bed was fabulous, and I am fairly particular about beds.

The neighborhood feels pretty safe and there are several restaurants and bars on Charles Avenue, right next to the hotel. The room was excellent. I had a fantastic view of the city (my room faced north), the bed was very comfortable, the wired and wireless internet worked really well and it was very quiet, cozy and comfortable. The hotel staff were nice and helpful, able to give directions and give advice and information on area attractions and restaurants. The casual lobby concept was very cool. There's a front desk area, but the common area is mostly couches and a few high tables, with a TV at the center. This is where breakfast is served. The breakfast was very good, and above the standards of most free hotel breakfasts. They changed the main dish each day but had toast, muffins and oatmeal as staples throughout my stay of three nights. Additionally, just like other Hilton properties with free breakfasts, there's a sort of condiment bar that includes dried fruit, brown sugar and other items, to compliment the oatmeal or cereal. I had a great time in Baltimore and I think at least part of it was because of my decision to stay here.

When I made the reservations online (directly through the hotel's website) I requested to have our two rooms either next to each other or across the hall from each other. They did not have two queen suites together available, so they upgraded us for free to one king suite with an adjoining queen suite. This worked out even better, since we were traveling with the children we put them in one suite, popped open the doors between the adjoining suites and there was plenty of space (and a little privacy) for all of us! The suites themselves were a very nice size with decently sized kitchens including fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, plates, cups, utensils, etc. Everything was very clean. The hotel as a whole was clean, fresh and modern. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Complimentary continental breakfast in the morning was just enough and there was a decent selection both mornings. The hotel offers a valet parking service of $25 per day. We opted to park the car and either walk everywhere or hop on the city's free bus, the Circulator, which picks up about a block away from the front door. The hotel is about 8 blocks/1 mile from the harbor area and it isn't a bad walk at all. We made the trek up and back several times with the kids in tow at various times of the day & night.

It lived up to its reputation -- a funky little hotel in a very convenient location. Got a really reasonable AAA rate online. The room was a spacious little suite with a decent size fridge (w/a big freezer), a microwave, and even a dishwasher. There was a sign that we could get an electric hotplate and skillet for free if we wanted one. There were enough dishes etc (and even a bottle opener and measuring cup) for us to have dinner the first night in our room. Decor is very IKEA like, and we could move the ottoman, table and rolling chair around so that we could eat in the room and then play a board game with our kids. We opted to let staff valet park our car (it was supposed to snow, even though it never did) and used the Circulator for our entire stay, since it had a stop right around the corner. Staff was friendly and helpful. Only negatives: 1) there were no luggage carts that first evening when we were trying to check in and transfer our stuff from the car. Ended up making several trips to get luggage up to the room. 2) Walls are paper thin (wasn't a problem for me since I am a fairly heavy sleeper, but my husband said he heard some interesting things! 3) And this is really the one that was the upsetting one - breakfast is included, but it is only served until 9 am, and if you don't get there early, you don't get anything. On our last morning, we got down there at 8:30 and EVERYTHING was gone. No bagels, no bread, no donuts, no english muffins, no eggs, no yogurt. When I inquired about staff replenishing these items, I was told that there were none that were \"defrosted,\" so there was nothing else that was going to be put out.

While they are nice, they are very corporate. With the likes of Aloft by W Hotels, along with Element - Hilton had been ignoring market trends and pricing. I stayed at this property for an work event at the convention center. The walk to the Harbor and Convention Center area is about 1/2 mile downhill (on the way there....) and very do-able in the morning, however, when the sun goes down the sense of safety and security disappear with the daylight. I've been traveling to Charm City for work for five year now, and as the recession has been prolonged, the crime in the city has sky rocketed. However.... the neighborhood around the hotel is very safe, and I wasn't afraid at all to walk in the neighborhood at night. The hotel is fantastic - the concept is totally different than anything else that Hilton is doing. The property has a very small and comfortable feeling - while having hundreds of rooms, there only 9-10 rooms on each floor - so it feels very small. The breakfast service is a game changer as well - it's a departure from a buffet style, and yet there is still something for everyone. The rooms are very well appointed, spacious, and geared toward the extended stay traveler - they are well suited for a night or a month. It's great having the kitchenette in the room. The decor is very trendy and comfortable! If you are planning a stay in downtown Baltimore, I definitely suggest the Home 2! Great stay, friendly staff, and fantastic rooms! I had a AAA rate of $103 - and instead of paying $25 a night for Valet parking, I parked a couple blocks away in the garage next to the Basilica - and that was only $24 for two nights. I parked in front of the hotel, took my luggage to my room, and then moved my car to the garage. The garage is very safe, well lit, and easy to access. I'm not a fan of Valet parking - I want my car when I want it, not when the valets have time to get it. As with nearly all hotels that have a food shop available in the lobby - everything is very over priced, so avoid it if at all possible. The only negative was the ice machine on my floor wasn't working.

I can't speak to the value of the hotel because we got such a great deal using points. We booked our room, and then subsequent family members booked an additional block of rooms, I think it was 9 all told, this review will cover both our experience, and a bit of information from the others staying in our group. The hotel has been open about six weeks, and we were visiting at the height of tourist season, on an Orioles two game weekend, so we were expecting crowds, but we were also expecting a hotel that was a bit more equipped to deal with them. The hotel is tucked on a small one way side street, with only an awning to distinguish it from other buildings, the only parking options currently are valet or self-park (ie find a garage yourself and risk it), and there is no dedicated valet, it is apparently a corollary duty of the desk staff, there is no place to pull up and unload baggage except for the one parking space in front of the hotel, so if someone is there before you, you get to block traffic or try to find an on-street spot from which to unload your bags, the staff was not particularly well trained to deal with this, as we were told that we couldn't park in a \"pay spot\" despite a valet vehicle sitting in the only spot the entire 20 minutes we were checking in. Due to the size of the elevators and the aesthetics of the hotel the only baggage carts available are the SmartCart style that you see for rent at airports, they are good for loading about one large piece of luggage and a carry-on. This seemed highly impractical for what is described as an extended stay hotel, we were finishing out a 10 day trip, with several formal events and even as light packers it took us 2 trips to bring our things up to the room (all the while blocking the 1 parking spot), there are no offers of bell service either. We just beat the rush of people checking in, so while we didn't have much of a wait, others behind us did, it took the desk agent about 5 minutes of logging in to finally get to the screen where she could process our information. We requested a high floor King bed room, away from the elevators. We got room 1101 out of I think 14 floors, and all of the rooms are near the elevators as it is a narrow site and each floor only has 4-5 rooms. The door was heavy enough to block out all but the loudest hallway and elevator noise. Our room had lots of counter space, with a desk/dresser area and a sizable kitchen area running the length of the room, the work space would be ample to put in a full day's work from the room, and the clothing storage space was generous. The dresser/work area did lack a mirror, which would have allowed it to double as a vanity area for those who don't like to do their hair or makeup in a steamy bathroom, instead I ended up perched on an ottoman in front of a poorly lit full length mirror in the living area of the room. The room had a queen sized pull out sofa and a movable ottoman. The ottoman was tucked under the TV when we entered the room, it was the perfect spot for a luggage rack, which was also apparently eliminated from the room for not matching the aesthetics (none were available at the front desk either). The room was very soothing with grays and greens, it was nicely decorated, but not wholly practical for anyone but a single traveler. The biggest issue we had with the layout was the impracticality of the \"barn door\" type bathroom door, it seems to be a bit of a trend in boutique hotels of late, to mount a pocket door outside of the wall to function as a bathroom door, some places do this well and the room benefits from the space saving design elements, but this was not one of those places. It seems that there was a design/installation mis-calculation, and the depth of the wall tile was not calculated into the clearance for the \"barn door\" to close flush with the wall, as a result, the door was off of it's bottom track, leaving about a two inch gap between the wall and the door, and allowing the door to glide open far too easily. This meant no privacy for the person using the bathroom, this flaw was universally commented on by our group (granted, they are a home building sort of group). The bathroom was a decent size, with a stall shower, and wall mounted Neutrogena Rainbath and Shampoo dispensers (one of ours was empty the entire stay). 3 towel hooks were provided and the sink top space was not extravagant but was ample for two of us. The toilet is a water saving dual flush model, unfortunately ours was not very water saving as it ran for about an hour after every fourth flush or so, seems like something that shouldn't happen in a brand new hotel. The bathroom is very white tile, so any housekeeping oversights are quite obvious. Otherwise, we found the roller sheers and roller blackout shade in the room to work nicely as a window covering, it didn't leave the typical hotel room curtain gap, and provided enough room darkening to sleep in on the bright morning after the wedding (we had to provide 2 wake-up calls to my hung-over parents). The other compliment for the room is that it had some of the softest sheets we have yet encountered in a Hilton hotel. Other hiccups encountered: One of the main reasons the rest of our family elected to stay at this hotel over others was because they told us that their shuttle service would be up and running by the time our group was staying (this was about 6 weeks earlier) and that they could make a shuttle available to take us to the wedding at the Inner Harbor. Upon check-in I was informed that their shuttle van was still broken, and would not be available at all for the weekend. There was quite a bit of confusion about the availability of other shuttles, and one staff person began looking for other options, which was a laudable effort, but which instead of being free, would end up being far more costly than even taking cabs. While she was doing this another staff person was calling different rooms in our group trying to figure out when we needed cars (despite me calling her directly with my room number, and introducing myself and requesting that cabs be called half an hour before our departure) for Friday evening, the end result of the many calls was that when everyone gathered in the lobby the cabs that I had requested she call had not been called at all, so a mad scramble for cabs ensued. Car confusion continued throughout the weekend, despite the best efforts of the staff to provide cab access as readily as possible (including running uphill to a main street in 100 degree weather to hail a cab for my sister and I who were running late for the wedding and in formal wear). The efforts of the staff were very much appreciated, although they were far more effort than just having the functioning shuttle service that was originally offered as a service. Breakfast also ended quite early relative to most Hiltons, it was over at 9 am on the weekend, and the coffee carafes in the lobby were empty as often as not, the breakfast was a fancied up low end hotel breakfast, not as many options as the Hampton, but some fresh options that pleased our light eaters. The last thing, and I am not sure that there was anything that the staff could have done about it, other than deal with it cheerfully, but upon returning from the wedding around 1 am we stepped into an elevator and found that someone had urinated all over the floor. Charming. We called the front desk when we got to our room and the desk staff actually responded with \"Fabulous, we will take care of that right away\" without an ounce of sarcasm, which I give them great credit for! Other observations from family members: Those on the lower floors found their rooms to be quite loud, and a number of them up to the 4th floor had trouble sleeping due to urban noise. I believe they were in even numbered rooms, we were in an odd numbered room on the back side of the hotel and had no noise issues. My parents also mentioned that they found the noise between rooms to be troublesome with rude neighbors next door, they had a toddler throwing a tantrum and screaming at the top of her lungs for about an hour on Saturday morning, and they could quite clearly hear her and her mother yelling at her. Another relative was pleased with the proximity to the new free Charm City Circulator bus. Others said it took them quite some time to check out around 10 am, I can't vouch for what it looked like at check out time on Sunday. All in all, it was a decent hotel for the space, it was an ok location, their staff seems to be earnest, but it does seem that perhaps they are not getting all of the tools and training they need to make this hotel a success. As a traveler who has lived in hotels for 4 months out of the last 2 years, I would say that the amenities offered outside of this hotel room would make an extended stay a challenge, if you were planning to stay for a long time you would want to prepare most of your meals in your room yourself, which would mean microwavable food for the duration. It is a stylish looking hotel, and hopefully they will iron out the wrinkles, and price the hotel at a price point where people aren't using the elevators as a bathroom, but perhaps not at the same expensive price point of other chain hotels in Baltimore.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cNew Hotel\u201d", "Author": "wsesmom", "ReviewID": "UR116306098", "Content": "This is a beautiful new hotel.

The work space was big, and the WiFi worked wonderful! The bathroom was a good size. We had a walk in shower, no tub. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the free city bus that runs down to the Inner Harbor. We had no problems during our stay. Our room was cleaned daily, the housekeeping staff was wonderful! They do have laundry facalities in the hotel. The best part is they are free! Breakfast was great! I did notice towels in the excerise room, unlike one post I read. The Wii room was always clean, the excerise room was clean, and the laundry area was also very clean!

Hotel is full of bright open lobby space and a very simple room that has everything i needed to work and enjoy my stay. A wall mounted pull out large LCD tv that swivled to my desk or bed was great so I did not ever have to mvoe furniture or be uncomforable in bed on the laptop just to also watch tv was great.

I try to run at least one morning of my travels and the fitness center here was great....every piece of equipment had its own TV and the area was spacious...like it was actaully built to have a fitness room....(sorry, but too many hotels fitness rooms are an afterthought with crappy equipment...and this was an obvious exception!!!) anyway, I'll be back....kudos on a well thought out hotel.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat property, would not stay anywhere else in Baltimore!\u201d", "Author": "grizmt", "ReviewID": "UR115790847", "Content": "What can I say that's not a commercial except for kudos to the front desk staff!

It was very hot and the only alternative was to be deafend by the aircon unit which had been poorly fitted - gap had been partially filled in with cardboard and tape. What it would have been like in high summer does not bear thinking about. A problem arose with the TV and they offered to swap room or change TV. As we had only effectively one night left we opted for the replacement. This produced an even bigger CRT model that almost completely filled the top of the Chest! It did work though!! I did not see any other rooms so cannot comment. I have a suspicion that as we had booked through online travel firm( the hotel website had no vacancies) we may have come at the bottom of the pile.

Originally we were supposed to be staying across town but the Icelandic Volcano had other ideas so we changed our plans and stayed at the Milner instead. After browsing some of the reviews I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about staying at the Milner but due to the last minute nature of our arrangements, we couldn't exactly be piccy about our accomodation. The first thing I'd have to say is that the Milner's location is excellent, especially if you are only in Boston for a short time. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from Boston Common and the beginning of the city's famed Freedom Trail. Bus and T connections are frequent from Boyleston station (located at the edge of the common and also within close proximity to the hotel). Secondly, I'd like to dismiss some of the ridiculous claims about customers being unable to move due the size of the rooms at the Milner. Yes they are small, but the hotel doesn't ever claim that they are large and I think it's important to remember that the Milner was built in the Civil War era and not exactly with 21st century needs in mind. So yes, don't expect king-size beds, vast expanses of carpet or faceless furniture fittings - that is all part of the Milner's appeal. If you want all that then go to a large coporate chain hotel (in fact there is one right across the street). In fact I was marginally impressed at the size of the hotel room (not to say that they're large but by the number of over-the-top references on here about the room sizes I was expecting something resembling a shoebox). I have travelled extensively in Europe and the rooms at the Milner are typical of what you'd expect in a similar-type guesthouse in Paris, Rome or Barcelona for example. Having said all that there isn't much space in the lobby or the dining hall (which can be a squeeze on busy mornings) but like I said, that's all part of the Milner appeal. There was plenty of choice for a small breakfast buffet and even a chance to have a go at making your own waffles (this may sound strange but for me and my partner this was a first). The rooms were more than adequate for what me and my partner required which in no particular order wasp; a comfortable bed, plenty of cupboard space, an iron and ironing board, a TV with plenty of channels, adequately-fitted bathroom, towels and a few flyers/magazines about what to do in Boston.

Even then, at nighttime, it is sketchy being on the fringe of the combat zone. I ended up staying here because it was the only place left with a room because of a Microsoft convention. I checked out the next afternoon after I spent hours calling other hotels in town and got lucky with a cancellation. Moving to a Holiday Inn felt like the Four Seasons. This hotel is filthy and rundown. It reminded me of a seedy hotel from a horror movie. There is a mildewy odor in the air throughout the lobby which follows you into the room. I stayed in room 208 where there was an air conditioner in the window which was not doing much to cool the room despite all the noise it was making. To my dismay, the window in which the unit was sitting had no lock. There was a fire escape just outside the window which went down to ground level. I was sitting in my underwear when some man appeared right outside the window next to the bed on this fire escape. I asked the front desk for a stick to jam into the window so noone could open the window. I ended up using coat hangers. Furthermore, there was no chain or alternative lock to the door. I normally do not worry about these things, but felt unsafe after seeing some stranger outside my window. This place reminded me of a youth hostel you might stay in while backpacking through Europe. Actually, it was worse than that. There were dark stains on the dark carpet which also felt damp. The bathroom was nasty. The faucet handle came off every time I tried to turn on the water. There was cracked paint and mildew everywhere. The front desk person was some apathetic, mindless shift worker who was obviously there because they couldn't find a better job.

I stayed in a single room with a twin bed on the 5th floor ($108 including tax and breakfast, booked via Expedia.) The room was quite small, modestly furnished with a sink/mirror in the bedroom and a private bath with a toilet and shower stall. The room also had a window air conditioner, a TV, and free wired internet access; but it had no desk, so I worked at my laptop while seated on the bed. Oddly, the floor was not level, with a distinct downhill slope from the bed toward the bathroom. The bed was comfy--though tilted slightly to one side, like the floor beneath--and the room was cozy and quiet, so I slept soundly. Concerns: the lobby, elevator, hallways, and breakfast room were not air conditioned and felt quite uncomfortable in the July heat. I went downstairs for breakfast, and like other reviewers I enjoyed the make-your-own waffle iron, but it heats up the already airless breakfast room and makes it miserably hot. There are a couple of tables in a little alcove just across from the breakfast room where it's a little cooler. An air conditioner in the breakfast room would be a big improvement. The Milner is comparable to a 2-star hotel in Europe, which is to say it's fine for one or two night's stay on business, but I wouldn't go there on vacation and I certainly wouldn't take my 70-year-old mother there. It's one of the most modest hotel properties I've seen in any major city in the US. Still, the low price and convenient location are big plusses.

This was our second choice as the hotel we normally use in Cambridge was full due to some conferences in town.

Wnen we checked in we noticed that the window AC unit was not cooling (I used to do comercial and residential HVAC work, so I checked it out myself before alerting the front desk). After I determed that is wasn't working, I told the person at the front desk about the problem. She assured me that theywould take care of the problem. When I got up in the morning I told the Morning person at the front desk about the problem. She assured me that she would report it to maintenance. When we arrived back at our room that evening, it han not been looked at. I know this because we put folded up papers to hold the air fins (they were broken too) straight. These papers hadn't been touched. The room was blazing and the weather was calling for 90s the next two days. The person at the front desk said they didn't have a room available to move us into and said there was nothing he could do. My wife called the other hotel we usually use. They had some cancellations, so I told them we would be right over. When I told the front desk attendant that we were leaving and that I would not pay for the second night, they suddenly found another room. After quite an argument, they decided not to charge us for the second night. Additionally the ice machine didn't work and they seemed to be unable to do anything about it. If you luck out and get a room to your liking and with everything working, it would be a servicable low budget hotel in a great location. However, if you have any problems at all, you can forget about anything getting fixed. My advice is that if you are willing to roll the dice, then go ahead.

I lived in Phoenix for 10 years and have stayed at this property a few times and been to a few events there. Right as I walked in the door, I regretted moving to this property from the Scottsdale Embassy Suites. There wasn't a soul to be found other than a guy at the rental car counter with his feet on the desk playing with his phone. They did have a little bell on the counter.. Ring Ring....The girl at the counter was pleasant, made a comment she was new. I asked about a bellman and was told they don\u2019t have any? Don't have any? Hmmmmmmmm......More than 3/4 of the rooms are on the 2nd and 3rd floor with limited access to an elevator. So, if you are older or traveling with kids it\u2019s a big pain to haul your luggage up several flights of stairs. My dad is in a walker so I have no clue how he could have stayed here. Anyway, the room wasn't bad; it was clean just a tad outdated. Typical, 2 room suite with fridge, sink and a microwave. Couches and chairs were rater uncomfortable....Bed was a bed\u2026\u2026 I called housekeeping arounf 9am when I was going out for the day and asked for my room to be cleaned so that when I return with guests it\u2019s, well, clean\u2026lol Returned at about 4 pm and room was never serviced. I called and a lady showed up 20 mins later, nice lady just don\u2019t like to be in the room when they are cleaning it. I still tipped her. Breakfast was pretty good, but the wait for an omelet was too long so we just ate the pre-cooked eggs and bacon\u2026. The area is sketchy, hotel is just off the I 17 in North Phoenix. If you are looking for a place to lay your head for a day at most this place will do, however this is not were you want to stay to enjoy Phoenix on a vacation. You can email me for other options. The grounds were well maintained. Pool looked nice and was heated. Room service is a disgrace and I am being kind here. From the order taker, to the chef, to the delivery guy. ALL INCOMPETENT\u2026..We ordered room service and paid $16 to watch a movie, yes $16 dollars\u2026LOL\u2026.So, I ordered a filet medium-well,( yes I know, however it is how I like it). They have 2 sizes of filet, the guy on the phone never asked me what size, they offer different sauces, never asked me what kind, they offer different sides, never asked what type. So after I did his job for him the food comes and we are missing a salad. The waiter runs back to get it and brings it back. In addition, my steak is rare. Instead of complaining my friend offered to switch her entr\u00e9e with mine, she had ribs which were pretty good. What\u2019s the big deal? The next night we ordered again, again the same idiot on the phone. I informed him that my steak was undercooked last time and gave him explicit instructions MED WELL NO PINK, I even told him top butter-fly it if need be. So the guy brings the food and says \u201cCan you check your steak before I leave\u201d So all I had to do was touch the top and could tell it was AGAIN rare. He says to me how can you tell without cutting into it\u2026.Oy Vey\u2026.So I cut into it and wahla RARE. So this guy takes the tin top from the room service plate, stabs my steak with a fork and plops it in the tin top and says he will be right back. Are you kidding me? 20 mins latter he returns with only the steak, no mashed potatoes or veggies\u2026.Hmmmmmm, was I supposed to keep them warm in my microwave? At this point I am done with them. To my amazement they steak is still undercooked. I call back and tell them that it\u2019s still undercooked and I am not paying for it. 40 mins later he\u2019s knocking on my door to pick up the steak because the manager needs proof in order to take it off my bill\u2026.What a joke. The high points were a few of the staff members. A girl who works at the restaurant noticed us waiting for the bar to open at 4 and the bartender was late so she got the keys and made us some drinks, very nice of her as she could of easily just said she works at the restaurant or ignored us. She is a big Steelers fan. When I went to go print out my boarding passes early in the morning, none of the computers were working and this guy turned his monitor towards the counter and gave me the keyboard and mouse to print them out. 2 shining stars out of a bunch of incompetent people.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cOutdated\u201d", "Author": "Tazman57", "ReviewID": "UR121531298", "Content": "We were greatly disappointed when we got to our room.

It was 2am and I was getting ready for bed; ready to lay down, I moved my pillow and there it was!!! A small, not so tiny bug started crawling toward the corner of the bed. It had to be 5 cm long, I could see its legs moving, and it had black stripes on its back/butt or whatever. I do not know if it was a bed bug because I never encountered that situation before, so before killing it I took a picture for my record. The picture did not come out to well because it was small and I couldnt capture it well. So afterwards, terrified and shaken, I looked at the corner of the bed and there were stains on the sheet. Disgusted because it looked like they were dark stains, possibly from a bloody finger or something, the stains weren't too large or small, and the sheets even looked like they were put on inside out. This was a horrible experience!!!! So, I called the front desk and the guy offered me to look at other rooms. Security came and showed me another room. I went straight to look at the beds and there on top of the sheets was a small spider!!!!!!!!! Maybe because the room was unoccupied and it was about 2:30am now the insects were out!? Disheartened now I wanted to check out but was sooooooo tired, I just ended up looking at a 3rd room with Security. Security thankfully took apart the bed, moving the sheet, pillows, mattress and all to make sure there were no bugs and it looked clean...enough. So, my girls and I packed up and went into the 3rd room (my BF was at the casino this whole time). By then it was past 3am and I could NOT go to sleep. Even though Security did a bed check I was traumatized that there might be bed bugs!!! I never had this experience staying at Embassy Suites before and was SO sad because my daughter loves the pool area and my BF loves the complimentary breakfast.

It is very different than any other Embassy Suites I\u2019ve seen and it is older. However, I\u2019ve always loved this hotel and this last stay was better than average. First, let me explain how this hotel is unique. The locals tell me it was originally built as a hotel called \u201cThe Fountains.\u201d Unlike most Embassy Suites, it was built as a low rise building centered on an outdoor recreation area. This includes an outstanding pool, lighted tennis court, deck and pavilion for special events. Facilities also include a workout room, laundry, and beautiful lobby. Consistent with its original name, there are several fountains on the property. Access to all rooms is via outside corridor. I prefer this arrangement to the typical Embassy Suites, which is usually based on the idea that all beauty is manmade. This hotel has gorgeous park like grounds that I really appreciate. Moving on to the specifics of my stay: my room was recently remodeled with fresh paint, new furniture, and new carpet. This was a big improvement over the room I had last year. The bathroom was very small, but it was in good shape and was adequate.

I will start with the good things about this hotel... Nothing. The bad things just pile up. First of all, what kind of hotel doesn't have Wi Fi in the rooms in 2011? There is wired internet in the rooms, but many computers don't even have the ports for wired internet anymore! Wi Fi is available in the lobby, but only if you can find a clean place to sit during or after free happy hour. The lobby is not cleaned until about noon, and happy hour is a 5pm the day before. If you try to do any sort of work in the lobby during happy hour, it is like trying to do work in a fraternity party. Not everyone can get away from school work or business, even when they're on vacation. Also in the lobby, there are three to five computers for visitor use if you want to print boarding passes or check flights, email, whatever. Don't even bother using this computers. The ones in the lobby are so slow, I eventually gave up after 30 minutes waiting for pages to load. The ones in the business center have sticky keyboards that don't work well enough to really do anything. The pool is disgustingly dirty and during our stay (we've been at this hotel several times now, all in March) it is constantly full of screaming children and teenagers. The hot tub is not patrolled so if you want to relax in a nice, warm hot tub, good luck doing that here. Even late at night, the tub is full of kids. And thats if you can find somewhere clean to put down your clothes, books, or towels. The towel supply at the pool is almost always empty, might want to bring towels from your room. Free breakfast is nice, but only if you get there around 7am. Get there at 9am and you'll be fighting about 300 people to get food. Good luck finding a table to sit at. The one time I chose to brave the crowds, I had to sit at a dirty table, next to other people's half eaten foods. I know it can get busy and its hard to keep things clean, but maybe this hotel should consider hiring more personnel for the month of March. There is always food plates sitting in the walkway to the rooms, sometimes even as late as 7 or 8pm (and these are obviously breakfast plates, not from dinner). Gross. Road noise is horrendous and even when we asked to be moved to a room closer to the lobby (two of the people in our party were disabled and we were given a third floor room at the very end, probably a quarter mile from the lobby and pool) we were denied. Failure in the customer service department. I would recommend you stay somewhere else.

The main lobby is quite nice, and the restaurant, Lafitte's, was delicious and well-priced. The pool is nice, but there were no umbrellas on any of the tables which I found weird considering the scorching 100 degree sun. Basically this is a once-amazing hotel that has aged and gone into disrepair a bit. If they were to reno the rooms, and upgrade, they could return to prominence as a choice hotel.

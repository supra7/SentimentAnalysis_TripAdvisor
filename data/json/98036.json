The room was clean and comfortable, however the only concern was the lack of storage or drawers in the room. The closet was certainly large enough to hang coats, shirts, pants and so forth but there was little other space for socks, underwear, t-shirts, etc. Storage space aside, the beds were very comfortable, pillows fluffy and the comforter kept us warm while we ran the a/c cool during the night!! I was pleased that the full house did not translate into noisey neighbors or wild ones running the hallways. Breakfast Saturday and Sunday morning was satisfying and a good value. Coffee (regular, decaf and robust) is hot and fresh with a chioce of cream or coffe mate creamers. I knew if the coffee was good, everything else would be fine! One can choose from a variety of breads (toast, bagels, english muffins, muffins, pastries), cereals, waffles, eggs and bacon, fresh fruit, yogurt and juices.

The beds are doubles. They are still very comfortable, however. You can get a King study room if you have small children, which includes a king-sized bed and a small pull-out sofa bed, but this option will only work if your children are small enough.

However, I noticed that the doors seemed to close and catch, but when you looked closer and opened them they were not completely closed and were NOT locked. So when I opened the door in the morning, I discovered that it had not been locked all night. I didn't think too much about it, and we stayed at the same hotel a week later on our way home. The next morning we had to get up at about 5:30 to leave, and I heard screaming next door, and didn't think much about it. I just figured it was kids having fun, but I heard, \"HELP! HELP! Get OUT, get OUT!\" in the hall, I opened the door and saw two middle aged ladies in nightclothes screaming. My husband went out in the hall too and when we asked what was the matter, they said a man in his boxers had come into their room when they were sleeping. When they woke up and screamed for him to get out, he wouldn't, he just walked to the window and told them to, \"Shut the F*** up!\" He didn't leave until they ran out of the room and we came into the hall. I immediately went to the phone and pressed zero and got the desk. I thought she would call the police like I asked her to, but she came upstairs. When I got off the phone and got towels for the ladies, since they were in their nightgowns, they were standing behind my husband in the hall and talking a mile a minute. My husband said the man had come out of the room and when into a room across the hall. When the front desk lady knocked and he answered he denied having been in the ladies room, but my husband and the ladies both said he was the one. He came out into the hall in his underwear and appeared to be under the influence of something. I felt so sorry for those two ladies to be further abused by this bad man on top of being scared to death and who knows what else. I felt like the front desk lady did a really good job of not letting the situation get further out of control, but she should have phoned the police! I hope those two ladies did.

We went for Memphis in May MusicFest and in our rush out on Friday night, forgot to close the door to our room all the way. It closed behind us but didn't lock shut, when we got back we discovered that one of the guy's bags with his laptop was missing. They couldn't have been less helpful, blamed us for the loss, including telling Memphis PD that we \"left the door wide open with the laptop just laying out.\" They also don't allow walking around the hotel at night, and accused us of having an underage drinking party in our room, simply because we're 3 college kids in town for music.

Something about a problem with the remaining King rooms. Not a big deal. I was offered a free in-room movie for the change but didn't use it. Memphis is muggy in the summer, even with a drought. Steam from the shower set off the smoke detector. It went off again at 1:30 am. I had to keep the A/C on the \"Only penguins like it this cold\" setting to keep the detector silent. When I mentioned this to th morning manager, I received no response at all. Breakfast was the typical Hampton Inn breakfast. Lots of bagels, doughnuts, muffins, yogurt, cereal and fruit. It was difficult finding a place to sit. The hotel was pretty full and the breakfast/lobby area is not very large. All in all, the hotel served the purpose of an overnight stay, but I wouldn't want to be there any longer and probably won't go back, mostly because of the smoke detector.

Yes, this place has been here for a while, but it has been totally updated and was pleasant to stay in. Check-in was a tad slow, the desk clerk didn't see my HHonors status so it didn't go as smoothly as it usually does at Hampton. My room was small but efficiently laid out, and the rehab included a paneled alcove near the window for a desk on casters, recessed lights and a tiny closet (adequate for one, watch out for two). Nice redo to the bathroom with all the current Hampton touches (desk vanity, new fixtures, extended shower rod, massage shower head). Free WiFi in the room, 11Mbps but flaky at times. Beds were new Hampton, a bit soft for me but if you aren't me you would love it. Comp breakfast was usual Hampton standard, and that is good. I noticed that there were stone counters in the lounge, good for solo working and eating. Housekeeping was thorough. The big downside to where I stayed had nothing to do with the hotel per se. Poplar is the main drag of Memphis, and there was abundant traffic noise, including a nearby train track with frequent trains (and frequent loud train whistles as they went through this heavily trafficked area). Ask for a room at the back of the property (believe it or not, near the elevators) if noise might be an issue for you. Otherwise, I would stay here again.

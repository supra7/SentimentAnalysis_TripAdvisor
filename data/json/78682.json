It still has its boutique hotel feel that sets it apart from a standard Holiday Inn Express. Stayed here for 2 nights on the weekend for a short trip. The location is good if you need a place near Hollywood Bowl, Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame and many other North Hollywood attractions. They have shuttle service, free wi-fi, on property restaurant, pool, spa and many other standard amenities. No problem with the service. Check in was easy and the staff was courteous and efficient. Room was quite small. You really don't get a lot of space to roam around but they do have a nice cozy balcony. The bed and pillows were reasonably comfortable. Because of the location right next to the highway, the room could get noisy. I didn't have trouble falling asleep but I suspect some might.

Nice location within a mile from Universal and they provide a free shuttle that runs every hour in the morning and every 15 minutes in the evening. The staff was very helpful and the room was clean. I would recommend a room on the pool side however if you want to avoid traffic noise from the freeway. We ate breakfast every morning at Tula's, which was good and kids 12 and under eat free. We also had a couple dinners there, which were also tasty with great service. Only complaint is the parking fee, which is $15 per night. We did receive $3 off of that because we are Holiday Inn Priority Club members; however, still don't like the fact we had to pay for parking.

We checked in after a very hairy and scary drive from LAX (our first time driving in USA!) and the staff who checked us in were so lovely - giving us directions to the local supermarket and advising us of all the amenities available to us at the hotel. We were given room 222 in the El Dorado building and when we opened the door, I was pleasantly surprised. This hotel has to be at least 40 years old yet our room was spotlessly clean. I used to be a housekeeper years ago and always look for the faults of cleaners in hotels and this room had none. The bathroom, though a little weary, was so clean and sparkling. We used the free shuttle to Universal Studio's the following day and it is a very short 5-8 minute ride and they drop you right at the door and let you know when they will be back (on the hour - every hour). We went back to meet our driver and there he was - right on time! What a great service. As all the rooms and balconies are smoke free, we used the area downstairs a lot which was really pretty with tables, chairs and big gas heaters. We went down the road to the local Ralph's supermarket each afternoon and bought our alcohol supplies and filled up one of our garbage bins in the room with ice (from the free ice machines on every 2nd floor) and sat around the courtyard having a few drinks and that was no problem at all. I approached the front desk to ask if they supplied shower hats, and they gave me one of every sort they had (3 in total). Nothing seemed too much trouble for the staff here at all. My husband used the pool and jacuzzi but it was a little too cool for my liking to go swimming in February and they had a lovely fireplace burning in the pool area - very cosy! We used their onsite laundry - $3.00 for a full load of washing and $3.00 for a full load of drying and that was very handy after being away for 2 weeks! We also ate in the restaurant Tula's - a little on the pricey side but the food was very good. For a hotel of this age, it is extremely well kept and looked after and we would not hesitate in returning if we are in Los Angeles again.

The staff at this hotel offered us to stay in the suite we wanted for a good deal (it would have cost us alot more to upgrade). They kept insisting they wanted us to be happy. The room was beautiful and very large. I must say they have very honest housekeeping staff. I put out money for a tip and they didn't touch it. I finally had to put a note that said \"Tip\" for them to take it. The pool wasn't heated but the whirlpool was nice. They have generous pool hours. This isn't a Holiday in express so no free breakfast. Tula's was a bit expensive but we just went there for coffee and dessert. The dessert and coffee was amazing!! The hotel is located right by the freeway and a block away from Studio City. My sister in law said that is where all the celebrities tend to live or hang out. There is a free shuttle to take you to Universal Studio City Walk. Parking is about $15 a night but the front staff asked if we wanted to sign up for their Holiday Inn reward card and got $3 off of parking a night just for signing up.

Our only two complaints: the gift shop was supposed to open daily at 9AM (we're Diet Coke drinkers & the soda machines were out hence the need for the gift shop) and the two times we showed up at 9AM it wasn't open yet and the bar didn't open until 4:30 so you could only get beer and wine in the restaurant. No liquor until 4:30. :-( We could hear the highway noise, but got used to it after the first night; however, it was very loud with the patio door open.The pool area was really nice and I'm assuming it was heated because we often saw people swimming day and night. We had one of the best hamburgers and chicken sandwiches we've ever eaten at the hotel's restaurant!

It was warm enough to sit outside on the patio for breakfast and late in the evening at the bar. The hotel has a courtyard with little cabanas and the same type of flaming heat lamps that greeted us upon arrival . When we stayed before, the laundry facilities were not great, but they have changed the location and added two additional washers and dryers with lots of natural light and close to the pool.One night it rained and there were guests still in the pool and jacuzzi enjoying the pool area which has a lovely fireplace to sit beside and get warm. Our room was clean and well stocked with fluffy towels and the bed is one of the most comfortable.Our room attendant creatively arranged all our bathroom \"stuff\" and kept everything orderly during our stay.

They will also drop you off at the Metro - it is only 1 stop on the metro red line to end up in downtown Hollywood! Lastly, when I left LA to travel up to San Francisco I had left my digital camera behind in the hotel room, I contacted the hotel and they FedEx'd my camera overnight to my hotel in San Francisco and in what was an extremely nice gesture took care of the delivery charges.

I was very happy with my stay. It was a great base of operations for sightseeing. It really does look like an oasis stuck between the freeways and concrete of busy Los Angeles which is fantastic after navigating 405 traffic from LAX. Loved the trees, topiary and other nicely landscaped plants. The pool was lovely with its fireplace and comfy seating. The location is great very close to major roadways and a short shuttle ride to the Universal Studios metro. Just remember to tell the driver you'd like the metro. The shuttle goes back and forth from the hotel to Universal Studios but it will stop at the metro in between if you need it. The trick is to remember to call the hotel when you come back on the metro because the shuttle won't stop there automatically. It also appears that the shuttle won't pick you up from the metro unless its near the time it leaves on its normal cycle. So make sure to bring the schedule with you. I did have a rental car which is convenient in the sprawling mega city, but if i didn't have one it would have been easy to use the metro to get in and out of the city. The parking rate isn't too steep and if you are a priority club member you get a discount. I ate at Tula's restaurant twice during my stay. It was clean, had a great selection of dishes and very tasty. The waitstaff was a bit short staffed during my stay and it did take a while for them to notice you, however once they did they were very friendly. The rooms were very nice and large. I was on the 3rd floor in Portola. I didn't realize that the hotel is actually made up of two buildings with rooms behind a main building with a business center, front desk, lounge. There are several other structures on campus as well. The Ballroom, the theater, the pool and sauna and the restaurant, and tennis courts. It was a charming, old school set up that you don't see much with the mega hotels having everything in one massive structure. The one downside to the multiple buildings is it takes you a bit longer to get your key cards fixed if they deactivate during your stay. You actually park your car near your building so if the key doesn't work thanks to being too close to your cell phone you have a short walk back to the main building. Not a major problem and the hotel does have lots of ramps and well lit walkways. The room decoration was a bit Spartan but it was clean and everything worked and I plenty of space. It would have been big for a family of 4 as well. The one thing that does need upgrading are the bathrooms. Not sure if it was just my building. The bathroom was very clean just some of the fixtures appeared to date back to the1950s and were a bit tricky to turn on first go around. The beds were very comfortable and they give you the choice of hard or soft pillows which is always nice. The walls are not soundproof so I did have a few nights listening to the neighbors TV. But I did not here much traffic noise which was a great surprise. The Beverly Garland was a great base of operations if you are sightseeing. It was peaceful, clean and had a great location.

The BG Holiday Inn is located basically on top of the US 101. Of course, this guarantees that there is a continuous roar of cars and trucks from all areas of the hotel. I stayed 1 night in a standard room. I was originally allocated a room on the fifth floor. This room had a delightful view of the freeway. However, more disturbingly the sliding glass door on the balcony would not close in this room. The room was therefore very loud and smelled of car fumes. After complaining, I was allocated a room on the second floor. Like a punch in the face, the second room smelled of cigarette smoke. It was, however, marginally more quiet than the old room so I settled for the better of the two evils. However, the noise was still loud enough to make it difficult to sleep. The beds were comfortable but the hotel in general was poorly maintained and the decor was extremely outdated. The furniture was old and tarnished. The room was very unclean. The carpets were stained, there was pubic hair all over the bathroom floor and the bath/shower drain was blocked causing the bath tub to fill up when the shower was turned on. The bathroom tiles were cracked and required an overhaul. While the hotel does provide a complimentary shuttle service to Universal Studios, the Hilton and Sheraton appear to be far newer than this hotel and are located at the park.

After reading the positive reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to book my stay here. I was not disappointed. My stay was perfect. I arrived about 3:00 p.m., and my check-in was very smooth. My room was very clean and spacious, and a haven to return to after busy days of sightseeing. The bed was extremely comfortable, and I always got a good night's sleep. Although the weather was a bit too cool for me to use the pool, it was so inviting, and the restaurant, Tula's, was very good. The hotel staff at the front desk were always very friendly and helpful, as were Terri, Barbara and Maria in the gift shop. There were safety deposit boxes available, as well as two computers for use in the business center and free WiFi throughout the hotel. I was taking the red eye home on my last day, and my luggage was safely stowed through the day so I could take advantage of all my last day exploring. As a single woman traveler, safety, comfort, and ease for getting to and from the sights of LA were very important to me. I felt very safe at this hotel, it was very comfortable, and unlike many reviews written before, I found that the location was great for getting to the sights. The hotel provides a free shuttle to and from Universal Studios and the Metro station, which are just a short drive down the road. The bus (#156) to the center of Hollywood (Hollywood and Highland) stops right across the street from the hotel, and returns to doorstep of the hotel. The concierge will provide you with the schedule both to and from town. I used this bus a great deal, and could not have asked for more. The ride is about 20 minutes and very few stops were made along the way. To me the ride did not seem overly long for public transportation. What a delight to get off the bus at the Kodak Center (right in the hub of the Hollywood attractions). My very first view was of the HOLLYWOOD sign from the Kodak Center! To be dropped at the door of the hotel on the return trip, especially when returning after dark, was such a positive! I used the hotel shuttle to go to the Metro to get to downtown LA to visit Olvera Street and the Los Angeles Historical district. It is a direct route on the red line to the last stop at Union Station. This line also stops at Hollywood & Highland, Hollywood & Vine, and a near the theaters in downtown LA. There is a free tour of the historic district that leaves from the office next to the fire station. Once downtown, the DASH bus is also available to visit the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Staples Center, Little Tokyo, etc. Fare for the buses and the Metro is $1.50 one way or an all day $5.00 pass. I didn't use public transportation to go to the other places I visited, but am sure that with a bit of work, it was doable. One review stated how long it had taken using public transportation to get to Long Beach and Santa Monica. I rented a car for a day to go to the Getty Museum (definitely go here), Long Beach and Santa Monica (the pier at night is beautiful). The car rental price was reasonable, and great to be on my own schedule. Even with a car, the trip to Long Beach was about an hour and a half one way (although I did take a few wrong turns even with a GPS), so I figure 2 1/2 hours on a bus that another review stated it took, is probably par for the course. If you have a car and have the time, take Multiview Drive in Hollywood Hills (Muholland Drive) for bird's eye views of Universal City, the Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood sign and downtown LA from the Scenic Overlooks. The Drive starts just a short distance from the hotel and winds up into the hills. I really enjoyed this short excursion. For my other exploring, I booked the Citysights LA Hop On, Hop Off bus - poor choice! I wish I had paid more attention to Krisrose's Trip Advisor review dated 9/11/2011 about this company - ditto to everything she stated!!! My booking did however include a Movie Stars Homes and Beverly Hills tour which I enjoyed. The hotel had recommended Starline Tours - perhaps this was the way to go. On my last day I visited Madame Tussaud's. The wax figures are incredible, and the museum is very interactive. It was so much fun! The hotel offered 2 days for 1 at Universal Studios (also available on-line). If you don't have or don't want to spend 2 days at Universal, you can purchase your Universal tickets at Madame Tussaud's and get entrance to the wax museum for free. For me, this was a great deal. I am a planner, and since I don't want to waste one minute while traveling, I like to have a good grasp of what I am doing and how to get there before I leave home. As stated in many reviews, LA is very spread out, and so planning was definitely much more challenging. Exploring LA in sections: Hollywood, Universal City area, Beverly Hills, Downtown LA, the beaches, etc. is the best way to go. Knowing how much time is needed for each attraction is also helpful in being realistic about how much you can not only see, but also, enjoy. I definitely recommend the Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn. It was a great place to stay, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "sportwife", "ReviewID": "UR120756010", "Content": "This is one of the nicest Holiday Inns I have ever stayed in.

The hotel is comfortable and rests in a quiet corner of Vineland Av., despite the proximity with the 101 Highway. Decoration is in colonial style, most likely original from the 70's, with a few interventions here and there. Rooms are very comfortable, large and with good beds and pillows, but the bathrooms need some refurbishment. There are IR lamps on the bathroom ceiling with a timer, so you can warm the room before you get out from the shower, which is an extra comfort I liked (I stayed in Jan '10 and it was freezing in LA!). The hotel has two buildings and I stayed in both. I recommend to stay at the building facing the reception, for there are no rooms under the street level, which are colder and more humid in the winter (these are in the Portola building). There's a good pool, jaccuzzi and sauna for amenities, with the hotel providing extra towels for the guests. They sell bottled beer in the pool as well. Breakfast is served at nearby Tula's Cafe and is reasonable, nothing to complain at all. In the same facility, there's also a bar/lounge, pretty regular and good if you don't want to drive to have a few drinks after work. Through Vineland Av. at left, you walk 4 blocks and find a Rite Aid Pharmacy and a Starbucks Coffee for last-minute items, which is very good in a city you have to do everything by car (that annoys me!). Staff is attentive and helped me whenever I needed.There's a free internet center with two computers and printer. I didn't remember if there was Wi-Fi in the hotel. You have a good parking lot, which is charged apart from the daily rate, as far as I remember it's something around $ 10 a day.

Also, if you request a taxi, can I suggest that you go to reception about 10 minutes before the time you requested it for as, through no fault of the hotel, they seem to pull in, wait for a few minutes and then disappear and you end up having to wait until another taxi can get there.

The shuttle bus isn't the largest but it will return for guests who are unable to be facilitated immediately. It allows you to have a beer or two at Universal City walk. The room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was efficient. However, I found the buffet a bit bland and not exactly inexpensive. Although kids eat free the menu for this is limited and we found we had to pay for breakfast our kids would eat. The hotel is not far from the freeway although it is very easy to miss the turn-off if coming across from the Highway 5 and the Hollywood Freeway as you have to cut across very quickly once it merges with the 101. The hotel is within an easy drive of Warner Bros studios which I'd highly recommend.

It's listed at $240 a night, but we got a deal through Priceline. The only surprise was the extra $14 we had to pay for parking. But hey, it's L.A., so I guess that's appropriate for the area. The Beverly Garland hotel is the perfect solution for families visiting Universal City Studios and other Southern California attractions. Hollywood & Vine, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Madame Tussaud's Hollywood Wax Museum, and so much more are just a brief drive away. Or take the complimentary shuttle, which will take you pretty much anywhere, even to the Metro subway (I felt safe riding it with our kids, by the way). Kids' Suites are what make the Beverly Garland hotel perfect for families. We stayed in the Deluxe Kids' Suite room (it's huge!), which has a partitioned-off area that gives kids the sense that they have their own room. Its kid-friendly decorations, separate TV, CD player, video games, and bunk beds made our kids feel right at home. The freeway is nearby, but it didn't bother our sleeping at all. In the \"adult\" part of the room (by itself it's twice as big as a regular motel room at least), there's a king-sized bed, dining table and chairs, another TV, wireless Internet, coffee maker, refrigerator, microwave, comfy sofa, and more. So both us adults and our kids had an area to ourselves to take a break from being together 24/7! Nice. The kids enjoyed the pool and the nice play area.

The hotel is close to Universal Studios, and is a bit out of the way from the other main tourist areas of LA, but it is a very nice hotel and not overly expensive either. The hotel has a pool (did not use as it was too cold, but it was big and looked good), a gift shop and a restaurant (Tula's Cafe) which was surprisingly cheap. There are not so many places to eat nearby, so unless you have a car or want to eat at Universal StarWalk, you're pretty much left with Tula's. The hotel offers a free shuttle to Universal Studios (it runs approx every hour), and if you ask, they can drop you off at the subway station which is on the way to Universal (and presumably they will pick you up from there too if you let them know which bus you want to take back). The room was a decent size, and even though it was right by a main road, I had no problem with traffic noise in the room. I even had a little balcony that would have been nice in the summer. I couldn't work out how to use the heater in my room, and I asked at reception and they sent someone to help within 10mins. The bathroom was a decent size too with all the usual amenities you'd expect. The bed was comfortable. There was room service available, but I just ate at the cafe (dinner x 2 as I had a late flight out on the day I was leaving and breakfast x1). As I mentioned before, the cafe was surprisingly cheap for a hotel restaurant, and it had a good variety of food. The service there was very good also - but as it wasn't peak season, they weren't so busy. Oh, there is also free wifi at the hotel - bonus. Now, to the reception staff - they were fantastic! I arrived quite early (around 10am) and I was able to check in to my room straight away (again, this was off season). The girls were more than happy to answer all of my \"stupid\" tourist questions (like how much are you supposed to tip, and how do I work the heater hehe) and they were great when I left my camera in the lobby after my airport transfer turned up 30mins early - they had it sent to my hotel in New York.

The following day we went to Universal studios and took advantage of the free shuttle bus to the park. The following day we bought the 'hop on hop off' tickets for 48hours which was absolutely brilliant. The buses are a bit old and shabby but to see all the sights, it is worth every penny. We took the free shuttle to universal then from there you can get the starline shuttle to the depot and join the red route around all the main sights or transfer onto the yellow route to go all the way to santa monica which took about two hours in total.

Soemwhat dissapointed in the suite as the kids area was simply a partition around 7 feet high. Nonetheless the room was big and clean and suited our needs. Arrival and checkin relatively smooth however receptionist missed that parking was included which was simply careless. Very comfortable bed but fierce aircon sitiuated right next to it. Following morning found a large number of dead and dying flies in the bathroom...very unpleasent but hotel took t seriously and dealt with it quickly. They offered and upgrade which we declined as it was a a kids suite and in any event we did not have time to repack and unpack. Breakfast was at alst a buffett in a Holiday inn and worked well but again the rubbish kids menu that is standard fayre in HI was given to the kids.. Rate included tour of Hollywood but we had to pay extra for the two kids. Wished we had not as the tour was terrible with a driver who simply talked about anything and nothing for over 5 hours. Day 2 breakfast was a disaster. Hotel had closed restaraunt but did not tell us. A conference room was used and at 8.30 it was chaotic. The staff were inundated with guests, there was no food and no plates or anything else for that matter. By 8.50 managers arrived and started clearing tables and finally food arrived. I cannot begin to tell you how bad it was. Had to be on 9.30am bus to Universal so cut breakfast short and waited for bus. It arrived 9.45 and we were left behind with all seats taken by those with sharp elbows and a desire to push. As a result I complained to the duty manager in private but very firmly and left him in no doubt of how I felt. Given I was paying close to $400 a night I expected and required far better than this. It was left that the hotel should make somesort of gesture to make up for flies breakfast and buses. Great day at Universal and we left the next morning following an uneventful breakfast. Noted that the bill had been adjusted by $200 which I thought generous and refelcetd that the hotel is trying and takes things seriously.

Public spaces are very attractive with lounges and a firepit. The fitness center is better than average for a hotel as well. The free shuttle to Universal is a good deal, but I didn't really need it. The not so good: The freeway noise. It's really loud. At times it can drown out the TV in the room. Every room has a little balcony, but there is no way to enjoy it with the loud noise. Make sure you ask for a room that does not face the freeway. Also, $14 for parking? Really? In the middle of suburban North Hollywood? That's just greedy for this area. The menu in the restaurants is fine, ate there a couple of times and service was hit or miss. Even though the place is always empty, sometimes the waiter just dissapeared. The food is priced very reasonably and not too bad. Front desk service is at best courteous, nothing to write home about.

We bought the accommodation via that website Priceline.com, and that gave the receptionists the right to think we're not worth being treated with courtesy and good manners. When my husband approached the reception to check in, he literally heard \" WHAT DO YOU WANT?\" , hotel was empty but we were given a horrible room, first floor facing the noisy freeway, so uncalled for! We paid for full breakfast in advance, the receptionist never gave us the BF vouchers, he simply assumed we weren't entitled to it and never bothered to even ask, confirm or let alone apologise after we were refused to eat and had to chase whoever could finally confirm we had pre-paid for breakfast.... this is all making our Universal Studios fun day start very late. Restaurant /Breakfast staff also stink like tobacco, it all added up to an expensive stay that was not worthy at all. I'd be happy to pay the 16 dollars a day for the car park if it was a clean, safe place. It wasn't. I left my phone number and email at the check out but never heard from anyone. I can easily remember the names of the worst customer service people in Hollywood too.

The hotel is very close to Universal and, since it's literally right off the freeway, is convenient to almost everything. The room met our needs. It is a converted double room, with a \"fort\" in place of one of the queen beds. The kids thought that having their own little \"room\" was cool. In it were bunk beds, a TV, and a bookcase containing a video game system and some shelves with baskets for clothing. Parents, keep in mind that what I've been calling a fort does not have its own door, and the kid on the top bunk can actually look over the top of the fort (if they try) to see your bed, but it did provide a nice divider between the kids and the queen bed. The Kid Suite does come with a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. We found the room clean enough. What we liked about the hotel beside the Kid Suite were the free shuttle to Universal Studios, the pool (particularly the \"Dive In\" movies shown poolside Thurs-Sat nights), and the restaurant (free meals for kids). The hotel has a fitness center but no spa; however you can arrange to have an in-room massage by Tamera. A few things mentioned in previous reviews were true: the sleeper closest to the AC will be freezing, there was no fan in the bathroom, and you really can't go out on the terrace without hearing the freeway, but these issues were manageable. If you kept the terrace door closed you really couldn't hear the noise. My only other comment was that there were not enough shuttles coming back from Universal in the evening. The 8:15 PM shuttle filled up and the driver had to make TWO more trips to pick everyone up. I would recommend either a bigger shuttle or additional evening pickups. Other than that, we found the Beverly Garland a good place for families to stay while in North Hollywood.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cNo mini fridge\u201d", "Author": "princesspea01", "ReviewID": "UR78049646", "Content": "There is no mini fridge in the room which we missed.

The hotel is right next to freeway 101 which makes access really easy, but does mean there is constant traffic noise 24x7. Although our room double glazing was good and kept most of the noise out, it does mean you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sit on the room balcony as it is too noisy The petty things that really spoilt our stay here are:- 1) There is no fridge in the room. You can hire one on a first come first served basis for $10 a day. This seems really petty. I think every other hotel room I have stayed in in the US has had a fridge and many of those hotels were of a lesser category (and cost) than this one. 2) We booked our room for 4 people through hotels.com. The booking said \"Full breakfast\". But the hotel would not honour this booking condition and would only give complimentary breakfast to 2 people in each room which I thought was quite extraordinary. I have never stayed anywhere that offered free breakfast to only half of a room's occupants. We questioned this with the management but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t alter that position.

It's retro, 1950s and 60s, but clean and well-kept. The grounds communicate rest and relaxation even though the hotel is near the hum of a major highway. The hotel is apparently still owned by the family of the late Beverly Garland, which gives it a genuine Hollywood connection. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is pricey ($18+) but first-rate (and kids eat free). On the downside, you pay for parking, and service at the front desk can be SLOW (even if there isn't a line). One more thing: Beware of the special offers on the hotel's website. They may not be what they seem! Thinking of returning to the hotel with my family, I recently booked a Best-4-Breakfast rate that the website claimed was bundled with their breakfast buffet. But after I actually confirmed the reservation, I noticed small print on the confirmation page saying that actually each room gets one coupon worth $20. If you are staying there alone, that is just barely enough to pay for the breakfast buffet plus tax. But if you have your spouse with you, this coupon isn't going to provide a breakfast buffet for both people in the room. I just confirmed this by calling the reservation line. I consider the hotel's description of this rate is HIGHLY misleading. In my experience, \"Breakfast\" rates typically mean breakfast for everyone in the room, or at least for two people in double-occupancy rooms--not breakfast for only one person. The reservation person said she would communicate my concern to management. It will be interesting to see if the hotel corrects its website. Since this \"breakfast\" rate does not actually include breakfast for more than one person, the \"savings\" of this rate is non-existent. You will save more money by ordering a single room and then ordering breakfast separately, especially if you are a member of a group like AAA that gets a room discount.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel close to Universal Studios\u201d", "Author": "DeeLittleHobo", "ReviewID": "UR65749459", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in May as part of a multi-city vacation in California and Nevada. We chose the Beverly Garland based on other reviews and were not disappointed. The hotel is situated in North Hollywood, close to Universal Studios which is only a 5 minute drive away. The hotel has a minivan which takes guests and picks them up from Universal Studios; this service is free and we used it without any problems. The staff we encountered were all very nice and helpful including LaTanya who works in the gift shop and the waiter in the restaurant (I think his name was Milo?). The rooms are comfortable and clean with good quality linens and towels. There was no in-room safe but it is possible to \"hire\" a safe in the business centre by the hotel lobby. Basically you pay a deposit for the safe key (I believe this was $25) and get it back when you return the key at the end of your stay. There is free wi-fi in the room (you need to ask the staff for an access code). There is a good sized pool and hot tub plus a sauna and a gym. The pool area is really nice and there is even a fireplace which is especially handy when you have a dip after dark and you feeling a little bit chilly after getting out of the water. The pool area is open till 10pm. There is also a laundy room on the lower ground floor of one of the buildings with a coin operated washer and dryer. You will need quarters for these, about $1.25 for the wash and $1 for the dryer (or vice versa - cannot remember). It costs $14 a day to park in this hotel. I believe this is the norm with many Los Angeles hotels especially ones near tourist attractions. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would recommend it without hesitation. My one word of advice is to ask for a room that does not face the freeway (if you are a light sleeper). The first room we were offered faced the freeway and I knew straight away that this would not work for me. We went down to lobby again and asked for a room change, which they did graciously and without any hassle.

We ended up going down to Hollywood Boulevard and a company offered us pretty much the same tour for about 1 third of the price so don't waste your money booking through the hotel. You can also get around using the Metro system as well, the bus stops outside the hotel and the train is a short walk from the hotel. It is a great location for Universal Studios and there is a free shuttle from the hotel to there. We had a kids suite, the room had been renovated which was nice but it had an adjoining door to another room which was made out of paper almost as we could hear everything the family in the next room was saying and their TV which was annoying. Also, the kids suite is right next to the freeway which is very noisy. That was also annoying as the kids suite costs quite a bit more than the standard room and it is in the noisiest part of the hotel. The kids suite really just has a little wall around bunk beds, my son liked it though, he thought it was fun. It costs you however to use the games in the room.

They obviously want you to get the buffet, which was standard continental, which you get free at very many other hotels, but was on the pricey side, and more expensive than the dishes on the menu. If they want you too order that, then they need to make it cheaper than the other breakfast's. They also boast on the website that kids eat free.. but then they dont give the kids a kids menu so they have to order the adults meal, and then the free meal doesnt apply. I didnt think the rooms were noisy, in fact our room had double glass doors but then I find the sound of the freeway relaxing and a part of vacation.

They also arranged our transport from the hotel to the airport when it was time for us to leave. The hotel restaurant served excellent food and the staff in there were very pleasant. We ate most of our meals at the hotel restaurant on an evening. We did have two breakfasts at the hotel also. The breakfast was a little overpriced however. The hotel rooms were kept lovely and clean and were very spacious. The beds were also extremly comfortable. Although our air conditioning unit in our room was a little tempramental so it did get a little warm in the room on an evening. There was no safe in the hotel room though, so we didnt really have anywhere to store our valuables during the day whilst we were out. The hotel pool was nice and relaxed, although there was still some building work going on at the pool during our stay.

He also discounted the parking from $13 a night to $11. Our room was located on the fifth floor in a building towards the back of the complex.

Within the hotel complex are a gym, swimming pool (which we didn't use as the weather was a bit cool!) and a small shop at the hotel. There is also a restaurant which we only used the restaurant once for breakfast on the first day of our stay. The breakfast was a choice of typical American buffet (cereals, pastries, toast) or ordering a cooked breakfast from the menu. As far as the food itself was concerned - the breakfast we ate was fine - nothing spectacular but nice all the same. Located in the same building as the restaurant was a coffee shop and internet point, although the internet was not free to use. The location of the hotel was very close to Universal Studios (about 5 min drive and about 10 min drive (depending on traffic) to Hollywood Blvd.) Also drove to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Venice Beach which were about 30- 40 min drive away depending on traffic (which can be very heavy on the freeways close to L.A. at times) I would warn you of a guy who stands outside reception (he works for the hotel) and tries to sell excursions.

Generally ok but this has to be the worst experience. At first glance this seemed ok. I stayed with family who booked a short break during the New Year period, using their Priority Club Rewards points. We had 2 interconnecting rooms; both with 2 double beds and the usual facilities. We even had free parking. Staff were ok; and actually the hotel is in an ok location. We missed the shuttle to Universal City and ended up going most places by car as it's conveniently located just off the highway. Downtown LA isn't far at all. On the first night we had a bad experience though. I was woken up gone 4am by the sound of a hotel door closing. At first thought it was another room in the coridoor then thought it was too loud and I checked the door to my own room. To my horror, I found that the door had been opened but the only thing stopping anyone coming through into the room was that the security latch was on - I could see that it had been pushed in. I phoned the reception straightaway as I had a child in the room and told them that someone had tried to access my room, thinking that perhaps they had issued someone a keycard for the same room in error. They rang back to say it was probably security doing their checks. Left it til the next morning to follow up but we were extremely unhappy and couldn't get back to sleep that night with worry. They sent someone up the next morning to check who had accessed the room by reading the card reader. It turns out it WAS security who had tried to check the room as 'routine' part of their checks during the night. The reception maintained this was legitimate normal practice and that the room had accidentally been checked out of their systems so it showed the room was empty. It can't be right that a member of staff walks around accessing rooms in the middle of the night. We had locked the door and put the security latch on, but imagine if we hadn't and someone had openly walked into our room during the middle of the night! We felt this was an unsatisfactory answer and escalated the complaint to the general manager. The receptionist we spoke to later was apologetic and offered us a complimentary dinner or breakfast which we tried to take up but when we did the assistant manager tried to rescind the offer of dinner. We settled for breakfast in the end but felt as though the hotel didn't take our complaint seriously.

There are many other places to eat dinner in the area, so it's not a big deal. Breakfast and lunch menus are fine. I see others complaining about breakfast, but, for the price, it's a great deal.

I mentioned that we would like a room away from a lot of noise and was surprised to find that this hotel actually has rooms specifically set aside as 'quiet rooms'. This hotel is not new, but we found it to be well maintained and clean. All rooms have a small balcony with a couple of chairs and a cocktail table. We found it very relaxing to sit on the balcony and have a drink after spending all day walking around Universal Studios. The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from Universal at no charge which I thought was nice. We also ate the buffet breakfast each day at Tula's which is on site. The staff was friendly and the food was good. It was a good value as well ($24 for two for breakfast including OJ and coffee) Some things to note: You have to pay an additional $13 a day for parking on the hotel's secure lot. Not a big deal, but something to consider. The AC/Heat in the room is one of the old school built into the wall models. We personally like these units because the fan stays on all night without cycling off and on with the AC. Some folks might not like the noise, it's just something to be aware of. The pool is open until 10 pm which I thought was nice. It's a small pool, but it was nice to have the option to use it so late. Las Vegas hotel pools are nearly all closed by 6 pm. Also, for those of you that are Nick at Nite fans, the actual house used to film the outside shots of the Brady Bunch is literally only about a half mile from the hotel at the end of Klump Ave. The trees are a little taller and there is a fence in front now, but it's the house.

I took the time and read the reviews regarding the hotel and took everything in. Some people stated on the reviews that the food was horrible and that the area wasn't safe. Here is an honest review that I hope helps everyone from a frequent hotel traveler. The hotel is outdated and is in need of a few face lifts including new carpeting in the hallways. The hallways could also use a bit more lighting but it isn't scary. The room was clean and came with a coffee maker, hairdryer, tons of towels (we had 4 adults in our room) and an iroining board etc. Our room was kept clean and we never had a problem. We stayed in the Eldorado building which if sitting outside on the small balcony (large enough for two people to sit) the sound of the freeway is noticeable. BUT, once you are inside the room with the airconditioning on, you can't even hear it. Our group didn't have any problem sleeping. When we arrived we were asked about taking tours and we simply said that we were there for business so we didn't have time-we weren't asked again and I never felt pressured or pushed to attend a tour. We took advantage of the coffee shop and I experienced an \"okay\" chai latte, but not a big deal. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning which costs $11.95. I personally felt that this was a bit steep considering what was offered and felt that if it was around $7.95 that would be better-but the food was good. The eggs were egg beaters but it wasn't terrible. The area surrounding the hotel is safe. We attended an event about three blocks up and was able to walk back to the hotel at 11:00pm without an issue. The only issue that I had was that we had to pay for parking. Now, I was only charged $11.00 a day vs the $13.00 I am hearing but I still think that this is ridiculous since I was staying at their hotel and already giving them money via the hotel room. This wouldn't make me not stay there again, but I would look for a place that maybe didn't charge as much. The location is not far from Universal Studios and there is a shuttle that is offered by the hotel to get you there. The shuttle does not pick up at the airport-please keep that in mind when making plans.

Location: The location of the Beverly Garland is good\u00e2\u20ac\u201cjust off the freeway with easy access to Disney (took us about an hour but the traffic is crazy). There are a number of Hollywood/LA tours you can book right at the hotel. The bus stops at the hotel to pick you up and you really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to travel far. The shuttle to Universal is great BUT when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re returning home at night remember that a ton of other guests will be returning as well and there may not be room for you (which means you wait for the next shuttle). FYI: spend the extra $$$ and take the VIP Tour at Universal. Great value for money and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book it you will probably spend your day hating those (and yourself) with the VIP cards who go right past you in line and who get to get off their trams and explore the sets while you sit on your tram and simply drive by. While at the Beverly we spent a day at Universal, a day touring Hollywood and a day at Santa Monica Beach (not a bad drive at all considering it is LA). Rooms: No fridge but otherwise fine. Nice, simple accommodation. You probably don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a room on the ground floor since these rooms are actually \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdownstairs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and really only have a view of the hill they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re built into. We started out on the second floor and had sewage back up in the tub (gross, but they moved us immediately, no problem) and ended up on the first floor right near the pool. Very convenient. There is laundry in one of the buildings. Pool: Small but nice. Always loads of loungers. Snack bar and towels. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hot tub and sauna too but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use these. Food: I liked Tula\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The menu had loads of variety and the prices were reasonable. Concerns: My concerns are not so much about the hotel but have more to do with the fact that I booked this hotel because of its review in Frommer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Frommer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stated that kids under 12 eat free. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen for us and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why\u00e2\u20ac\u201cI was just told that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that package. Maybe Frommer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s should indicate you have to buy a special package to get this. Also, Frommer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indicated Free Parking. That also did not happen\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwe paid $13 a day I believe. Minor things, I know, but these were two reasons I booked here so I was annoyed. This is a very pleasant family hotel and a good location from which to sightsee.

The walk from-to the subway takes about 15 minutes.

To enter in the rooms block you don't need to pass in front of the reception if you don't want, they have a separate access and you can enter only with your key-card. They have a swimming pool. They also have a restaurant very close to it, you can reach it in a very short walk. they offer breakfast and dinner ( the only thing is that the menu was always the same, but that's it ). Beside this restaurant there are not very close places to eat or to shop. Anyway, they also have free shuttle to and from the Universal Studios. Anyway, we suggest this hotel to people with a car because is very close to the freeway but we had no problems even if we did not have a car, so if you don't mind walking from and to the subway, it is a nice hotel.

North Hollywood is a beautifully clean area, that is a lot safer than other parts of LA. Service- Very professional. Everything was slick and polished! Friendly front desk and doormen. Amenities- We did not end up trying the pool, sauna or tennis courts, but they looked good! There is also a gift shop on site which comes in handy. Tourist info- You can book tours and get area info from the gift shop on site. Food- The hotel has a on site restaurant/cafe which has excellent food and very friendly and eager to please staff. They are very good with handling children too... There was also a splash bar on the property. A 5-10minute walk down the road to supermarket and some takeaway shops. Room- Regular size. Nice beds. Good maid service. Advice- If you're planning on playing on the tennis courts you must be wearing proper tennis shoes, otherwise you will not be allowed on. The laundry room is a bit hard to find, so ask for specific directions. Most tour companies will pick you up from this hotel. The front desk is always busy, so try using their quick check out.

Actually, ALL the staff were extremely friendly AND professional! Tula's restaurant onsite has excellent food and value. I had a breakfast and lunches at Hilton and Sheraton during mtgs and there is no comparison to Tula's yummy factor, service, portion and price. For dinner one night took waiters suggestion of chefs special (duck) and recommended wine pairing--great meal and evening. Re location: it's a pleasant 10 minute WALK to supermarket, chinese restaurant, starbucks and I felt very safe. I went for a dessert and coffee walk after late meeting at 1030pm and it's indeed an okay neighborhood to walk. Stayed 3 more nights a week later in August in a different wing and here's my take on the rooms, both times on the 5th (nonsmoking) floor: 1. Bldg on the far left behind lobby is where I stayed for first 5 nights. Bathtup didn't work for baths so had to shower but all else was great--room size, comfy king bed and pillow choices, quiet location (facing garden/lobby). Probably due for remodel/update in future. 2. August stay I was 2 bldgs behind the swimming pool/sauna area overlooking parking lot. Think it might be much more quieter and private than first bldg. This room was larger and nicely upgraded and seemed more like rooms I get when on corporate business account. Example of staff service, efficiency and personableness: I was stranded waiting for a cab company that kept saying \"it'll be 15 minutes\" and an hour and 4 phone calls later I was still waiting in the sweltering afternoon heat. At my wits end I called the hotel and Robin at the front desk expertly handled panicked guest (me), figured out where I was, called the cab company they usually use, had me wait in a specific area and a cab arrived 10 minutes later. During the 10 minute wait she called bacl to make sure I was where instructed to be and asked that I please let the front desk know when I got in so they knew I was okay and back at property.

It seemed like a good idea and we eventually made it work for us with some mishaps and adjustments. This suite is for KIDS, toddlers only if you are forewarned. Basically, these are baby proofing issues that are not the norm for older kids. As always with toddlers, lots and lots of supervision is necessary. Most hotel cribs are too small for a toddler so she would have ended up sleeping with us in a normal room (hence the king). We ended up having to go out to buy a safety rail so she could sleep in the lower twin. Once the safety rail was in place, everthing was fine. The reading lights attached to the wall for the bunk beds get very hot, and curious 2 year olds can burn their fingers. I ended up unplugging the whole contraption. You HAVE to put the latch over the door, because even \"locked\", they can get out and they are off. Then, if the latch is on and they try to open the door they could get their hand/fingers caught if the door closes. Ah, yes and the bunkbeds. On day 3, she discovered the ladder...it is NOT detachable. Now for the plusses. Yes, there are quite a few. The queen bed was very comfortable. Being able to put our daughter to bed in a separate area of the room and still read or watch tv was a real treat after other hotel stays. The restaurant food and service were very nice and other than the usual hassle of dining with a toddler, we enjoyed ourselves. The staff was very helpful, friendly, polite, etc. We got plenty of clean towels, the hotel was clean and attractive, the grounds were pleasant and attractive. There is a grocery store within walking distance if you need supplies, not just a minimart. Room service was handled well. One minus outside of the kid stuff. The terrace outside our room was on the highway side of hotel. The road noise was unbelievable. I only opened the doors once. That was enough. Fortunately, the terrace doors are sound proofed, I think. The terrace would have been nice otherwise (except I'm sure my daughter would have tried to climb the railings and I would have had to close them anyway). The \"splash\" pool adjacent to the regular pool was the perfect depth for our daughter. She was able to stand with the water chest high and after getting more familiar with it, enjoyed herself tremendously several times during our stay. Of course, most of the time I was in there with her, the rest of the time, I sat on the edge with my feet in. The diameter was about the size of a small hot tub. Unfortunately, I learned they were considering converting to a hot tub. Overall, we really did enjoy our stay.

There was four of us and the price with the advance purchase came to $136.00/per night...$155.14 with taxes. $8.00/per day to park Service was very quick and staff was friendly. The snack/gift shop has maps, shirts, snacks and you can book tours from there...example...tour of the stars homes, the shuttle will come and pick you up from the hotel. Hotel also has a restaurant. Later at night my daughter was hungry but we didn't feel like going into the restaurant to eat or pay high prices for room service, so we decided to place an order and pick it up ourselves at the restaurant. We placed an order with the restaurant and they said you can come get it that it is ready now and by the time we walked down there, it was ready, that was nice and saved us money. Nice, clean hotel and the location is safe (some areas in Hollywood are scary), it is close to Universal and about 5 miles from the Hollywood walk of fame and about 7-8 miles from Farmer's Market and the La Brea Tarpits. Negatives would be... The price of the hotel (but consider the area) and the hotel could improve/update the hallways. I was in California for about a week and stayed at other hotels if you would like to look at those reviews.

There is free scheduled shuttle daily that takes you to universal and picks you up, as well. There is a small gift shop right inside the lobby that sells shirts, souvenirs, postcards, and even stamps to mail your postcards. They also have maps and brochures of nearby attractions and also you can buy tour tickets right here in the lobby. Any additional items you may need may also be purchased at the gift shop (tampons, cigarettes, etc.) The restaurant on-site serves wonderful food at decent prices. We had breakfast there, it was wonderful!! The price is $11.95 per person and that includes your OJ or whatever drink you prefer. The buffet consists of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, biscuits, and several other breads, fresh fruit, and even cereal!! It was well worth the price. Also, they have a great dinner menu. I got pot roast it was about $10.00 and came with carrots and mashed potatoes. We also bought a fruit cup to go it was $2.99 and had cantaloupe, pineapples, strawberries, and grapes in it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyummie!! The room are great and clean. Housekeeping always had it looking great when we came back from our long day out in Hollywood. The rooms all have balconies with 2 chairs outside. The rooms have coffee makers, irons, and hairdryers. The television is neat. It has nin64 games you can purchase time on. There is also pay-per-view movies and internet on you tv screen. There is a nice heated pool, and a kiddie pool. There is also a sauna in the pool area. You have to use your hotel key to get in-so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget your key!! In the lobby, as you walk in, there is a couple of love seats right beside a flaming fireplace where you can sit and await your tour bus to pick you up. i highly recommend this hotel!!

We chose this site because we wanted to \"Do Hollywood\" and Universal. The Hotel is about 24 miles from LAX, right at Vineland exit, and good driving directions are given on the site (note to hotel: it would be more helpful to have approximate driving distances included for each stretch). Glad we made the drive late at night - those 12 lane highways can be quite intimidating. The property is beautifully landscaped - nice pool, but weather was cold and rainy while we were there so we didn't use it. Yes, the noise of the freeway was constant (I actually thought our balcony door was open when we entered our room), but we just cranked up the heater (yes, heater), which helped. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. We were rarely in the room during the day, and were so exhaused at night after doing Universal, Price is Right, a CBS Studio filming of \"According to Jim\" and Ashes and Snow exhibit (wonderful) at Santa Monica Pier (it's there only through May) that we simply collapsed at night. A free shuttle is provided to Universal. We used it and it was right on time. Also, ate breakfast at the restaurant there one morning - excellent garden omelette - huge portions. Buffet breakfast looked great, also (about $12 including drinks). Free USA Today, free in-room coffee-maker, but NO refrigerator). Our last night three guys manning the desk were rude when I asked for a quiet restaurant dining recommendation, but I blame this more on their young age, ignorance, and desire to \"show off\" for each other (\"Duh - like McDonalds?\"). Turns out we found a great restaurant nearby on our own - Zack's - turn left on Ventura and it's a few blocks down on right. Nothing fancy, it was QUIET, inexpensive, and had great food (Hazelnut chicken and salmon, two glasses of wine - under $50).

We got to the hotel around 11:30 and our room was ready! This was great news considering we just had a very long drive. My daughter noticed the cookies at check in and helped herself. The hotel has underground parking and a elevator that takes you from the parking level to your hotel floor. This made it very convienent to bring the lugguage to your room. Our room was very spacious with a kitchen. We had an ocean view. Our room was in the very front of the hotel furtherest away from the beach but the view was still great. The advantage of this front room was that we had an extra window in the front. Our balcony was very large and we loved sitting out there. The hotel is right next to a beach entrance if you want to drive your car on the beach (that is always fun). You do not need to because the hotel has a foot entrance to the beach. I did notice a strong urine odor by the entrance to the beach however. The beach was beautiful and lovely to walk on any time of day. The hotel provides sand buckets and shovels for the kids to play with. There are people that rent out beach chairs and umbrellas for 30 dollars For all day right by the hotel. There was also a food truck in front if you wanted some quick snacks. All in all we will be back to this hotel!

This was a pretty decent hotel and one that I would recommend for the cost. The negatives are not necessarily the fault of the hotel but I mention them for the sake of total honesty. Location is ok but the surrounding area did seem a bit run down with several empty businesses and even hotels nearby. Across the street is a sex shop and a tatto parlor so this area isnt neccessarily one that you get out and walk around. I think this is just an older area of Daytona Beach but the hotel is still close to many things including the convention center so I dont reflect the area too much on the hotel. First impressions were very good as the lobby is nice and clean, sevice was good and price was right. Got to the room and the room was clean but a little dated. I think the room may have had an update at one time but it was still obvioulsy an older room. There was a bit of a musty odor in the room but I think that is many times the case in an ocean front hotel, it was nothing an air freshener set on the AC unit didnt fix. Very nice ocean view and nice beach area. We didnt attend but there was a free daily happy area downstairs and a simple continental breakfast. Mattress was a bit spongy for my taste but that may appeal to some. We were there 4 nights and had no real problems. The room has a kitchenette with full size fridge which came in handy.

Possibly it is the free happy hour drinks from 5:30 to 6:30 pm everyday. Whatever the reason is one thing is for certain, people have been blinded by something to seriously overrate this hotel. It is always best to start with the good, so let\u2019s start there: -Our view off of our 8th floor balcony was wonderful. -The free newspaper was very nice to read every morning on the balcony (if you were lucky you can enjoy a cup of coffee with the morning paper, that is if your maid ever leaves refills for your coffee maker). -Lobby area was very clean. -Free liquor served from a cart everyday (from 5:30 to 6:30pm), mainly well drinks and beer but hey it\u2019s free booze! Now the not so good: -Bed was very uncomfortable, pillows had no fluff what so ever, and the bathroom towels were thicker than the blankets (which isn\u2019t saying much). -The eight-floor hallway reeked like b.o. or stinky feet (take you pick, either way it stunk). -There were light switches in the room that didn\u2019t work, lights that just didn\u2019t work at all, and a night-light in the bathroom that didn\u2019t work. -If you need to charge your phone, ipod, ect in your room good luck getting the plug to stay in the outlet, they fall right out since the outlets are so old and worn out. -Maid service was horrific, never picked up any garbage unless it was directly in the garbage can. Never left coffee refills for our coffee maker, in fact we left the coffee pot open with my coffee cup in it, and left the empty coffee wrapper sticking up in all our empty cans (that she never picked up) and she still didn\u2019t get the clue (see the photo I attached). It got comical after a while, we would put things (like an empty 12 pack carton) on purpose smack dab in the middle of the floor just to see if she would pick it up, and guess what we would get back to our room and it would still be sitting there right in the middle of the floor. Worst maid service ever! -Sand was all over the chairs on the balcony when we got there (we were on the eighth floor \u2013 i.e. they were never cleaned off from the last guests). -No ice machines, need ice you have to go to the front desk and wait for some eye rolling kid to get you some ice. -Pool area is very small, to get to the beach you get to enjoy the mutant grasshoppers as you walk through the five feet high weeds and grass. You think they could trim it back a little so people can get to the beach. -Location is not the greatest, no restaurants, just a tattoo place and adult emporium across the street. -By the end of the day the garbage by the pool is often often overflowing on the deck. We have always relied on trip advisor in the past, but this time it really let us down. In fact I really wanted to give this place a good rating from day 1, we are not picky people, this place just got worse and worse as our stay continued.

As for our room, it was pretty dingy but we had just came from a brand new resort in Orlando so we were spoiled. The sheets looked clean so that's all I really cared about. We also had a DISGUSTINGLY STINKY baseball team in the room next to us who never shut their door and our entire hallway smelled like dirty armpits. Again, not the Bahama House's fault but it put a damper on our trip. The continental bfast was decent. We never tried the free cocktails... we brought our own liquor and tervis tumblers. We also didn't bother cooking either. There is a Subway restaurant a couple miles south (as well as 2 grocery stores and several gas stations). I heard the diner across the street was really good but we were only there couple nights so we never made it. The beach was very wide and had a \"jeep convention\" one day...thousands of jeeps rode by one morning. It was pretty cool. They say you cannot have any alcohol on the beach but we had beer w/coozies and drinks in a tumbler and noone ever bothered us. I'm sure if you are a high school crew on spring break being idiots, they might say something to you. The front desk woman at the Bahama house is super nice! (Her name is escaping me).

Another thing that can easily slip between the cracks on these reviews is all the little things this hotel does. Since this is a beach hotel, people walk in and out with wet feet so you would expect the floors to get wet and messy. Not here, as soon as someone walks through the staff immediately mops up the floors. There are lot of other little things too like fast elevators, convenient underground parking, a nice pool, dry towels for the pool, nice lobby, hot tub, a secondary area below the pool area that faces the ocean with lay-out chairs, and very clean. The fact that they keep a beach hotel as clean as they do is on its own commendable. We also had a tough situation occur in which my wife lost something very important.

After checking TripAdvisor, we decided to give Bahama House a shot, and we're so glad we did. If you really need a five-star hotel, Bahama House is not what you're looking for. But if you want a great hotel, on a great beach, at a great value, Bahama House would be tough to beat. The service was top-notch. When we arrived in the room, one light had a blown light bulb and a second light blew a bulb as soon as we turned it on. We called front desk, and maintenance had both bulbs replaced in less than 10 minutes, which involved two trips to the room. This also includes the time it took for us to ask his advice on a local restaurant. After leaving, he showed back up a third time, just a couple minutes later, with a local restaurant guide that included some great coupons. (The guides were free in the lobby, but he went and grabbed one then brought it to us without us even asking. And his recommendation, Tokyo, was also a great experience.) Front desk was always pleasant and eager to please. The room had an awesome view of the ocean and beach, and we were not in one of the \"beach front rooms\". Our room was off to the side, but the layout of the hotel still allowed the room to have a great view, even from the bed. Sitting out on our balcony, listening to the waves, was such a wonderful and relaxing experience. The room included a stove top, microwave, toaster, and refrigerator, so we didn't have to eat out for every meal. There is a Winn Dixie grocery store just a block away, and a Publix not much farther. Each night's stay includes a continental breakfast with a good selection of non-cooked items. (We would prefer to have some cooked items, even if it is a waffle iron where we can make our own waffles.) Someone was there to keep it stocked and clean up the small messes. Each night's stay also includes a complimentary cocktail hour in the evening, with beer, wine, select mixed drinks, non alcoholic drinks and sodas, fresh popped popcorn, pretzels, and peanuts. This was a very pleasant surprise. The pool is heated and very well maintained. They also have a whirlpool that I enjoyed for an hour or so each night. And I almost forgot, the hotel has underground parking in the basement. We never had problems finding a parking spot with quick access to the elevators. We could go straight from the room to the car without going through the lobby, and the car was never hot from setting out in the sun. All in all, the Bahama House was the best of four places we stayed during our week in Florida (and one of the other three was a timeshare resort). I definitely recommend Bahama House to anyone going to Daytona Beach. That area of Daytona was very peaceful and calm in the middle of Spring Break, so it is ideal for family vacations.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Surprise!\u201d", "Author": "2ENVYus", "ReviewID": "UR100979222", "Content": "Having never stayed at this particular hotel before, we were unsure of what to expect...

There was a family enjoying their stay with a scrumptious meal that probably fed them for their entire stay. This is all because the rooms had a FULL kitchen and so did ours. Our room was oceanfront and very roomy. Having queen beds was a plus. The room, kitchen area, and bathroom was all very clean! Water pressure in the shower, which is a big deal for us was to die for! The best in all the hotels we've stayed at in a long time! The Manager's Reception was crowded but understandable - full cans of beer and a good pour on cocktail drinks. Our 17 yr. old son entertained guests by playing the grand piano in the hotel lobby. Only two minor drawbacks - parking is limited surrounding the hotel (but there is underground parking) and pool/beach towels- get them early or better yet, bring your own!!

I wish they would of stressed that when we booked. The lobby is very small, only room for about 20 people to sit. During most of the day and evening, the lobby was packed. Since our room was just so-so, and we couldn't get the internet in the room, and we had a very small tv- we really didn't want to sit our room. It seemed like the same group of adults were down there every evening, and that they all knew each other. We were happy that after 8pm, most people left the lobby, and we were able to sit down there and watch tv and surf the web with our laptops. We didn't bother with happy hour either. They offer free drinks between 5:30-6:30 because there were just so many people. Most of the guests were in there 60's-70's-80's. It seemed that they all knew each other and were having a great time. If you are under 60, I would suggest you look into some other hotels, unless you don't plan to really stay in the room and are just looking for a place to sleep. This place isn't close to shops, restaurants, or any of the hot-spots that Daytona Beach has to offer. We were bored silly when at the hotel, so at least that motivated us to go out and explore Daytona. We did have a few problems with our room at first, the staff took care of the problems when we told them.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeland, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat beach view with nice staff, but not cozy, plush, charming...\u201d", "Author": "pabey", "ReviewID": "UR84845733", "Content": "Service desk was great Maintenance to the room was OK.

The hotel is conveniently located far enough away from the usual Daytona Beach Boardwalk attractions to not get the loud partying college-aged nonsense, but close enough to drive and be there within 10 minutes. There is an underground parking garage underneath the hotel, which allows your vehicle to avoid the sun and ever-present beach sand while enjoying your stay. However, the garage is cramped, so be careful while driving out of it...once, we had to make a 3-point turn just to exit. When we checked in, we were quickly attended by the desk manager while the flat-screen TV entertained our sons with the Florida-Tennessee matchup. We were given an ocean-view room on the 9th floor, complete with 2 queen beds and a kitchenette. The room was very clean, especially the bathroom, which is not a common thing for a hotel directly on the beach. The refrigerator was spacious (lots of room for beer!!), but the ice-maker did not work, and there were no ice machines anywhere near our room. I had to go to the lobby and request ice, but no one minded at all, and the young gentleman that filled my cooler was very friendly about it...if there had been beer already in it, I would have given him one! Our room also had a small balcony, which gave two adults enough room to sit comfortably. Although the smell of cigarette smoke was pervasive from the adjoining balconies, the room did not smell of smoke at all. With the southeastern exposure, it was delightful to sit on the balcony before 7AM with my cup of coffee (brewed in-room), read the local Daytona newspaper (delivered outside the room every morning), and watch the sun come up with the sound of the surf below. Quite the idyllic setting! Also to be enjoyed are a decent-sized pool and jacuzzi (I liked the water temp, my wife thought it was too hot). It can't be stated enough that this hotel is directly on Daytona Beach...just walk out of your room, catch the elevator down to the lobby, walk out the back door and around the pool, and you are literally wading into the Atlantic Ocean! Next to the hotel is the entrance for cars to drive on the beach (if you're not used to this, beware!! Don't put your chairs, umbrellas, etc., in the middle of the car lanes!! It gets REALLY fun when the tide comes in...), but \"Speed Limit:10MPH\" signs are posted in close proximity. We never had an issue with a \"cars vs. kids\" moment...I was more concerned about the 9th-floor balcony railing than the on-the-beach traffic. There are many nearby restaurants for whatever food you crave: seafood, Italian, American cuisine, bar & grill, etc. There are also two supermarkets just south of the hotel (Winn-Dixie and Publix). The Boardwalk area, less than ten minutes north, offers some arcades, a pier (closed at night, apparently), taffy and ice-cream shops, and t-shirt souvenier markets. Salty Dog and Maui Nix surf shops are down that way, too. We chose to eat at Racing's North Turn on Daytona Beach Shores (near the southern end of the island, close to the Ponce Inlet Lighthouse)...can't say that we were impressed, but that will be another review. There are also three quality mini-golf places south of the hotel (toward the lighthouse): Congo River (closest, but most expensive), Hawaiian Falls (2 courses, and a $3 re-play rate!), and Pirate's Island Adventure (didn't even call this one). My two mini-golf enthusiasts both enjoyed the experience at Hawaiian Falls. There were minor issues with the room, but they didn't take anything away from the convenience or cleanliness of the hotel, or the friendliness of the staff. 1.) There was not much water pressure in the shower, so to feel completely sand-off-me clean, it was a good idea to use the cold water shower by the beach before going back to your room. 2.) The hotel offers a free continental breakfast, including all cold items (bagels, croissants, cereals, fruit). The fruit was not very fresh, the coffee was pretty weak, and the orange juice was slightly sour. The kids loved the cereal and the Sweet Sixteen powdered white donuts, though! 3.) There is a daily Happy Hour between 5:30-6:30, but the service is apparently so slow that my wife and I never got to partake. I stood in line on Saturday afternoon for five minutes, and the line hardly moved. 4.) The parking garage is pretty awkward to navigate with a mini-van. 5.) From the 9th-floor balcony on the south side, one can see the rooftops of the adjacent motels, one of which looked closed except for one door that remained open the entire time we were next to it...for all we know, a family of squatters could have been living there...there were NO vehicles in the parking lot of this place. One final note: when we got in the swagger wagon to depart for a family night out on Sunday, we realized that our car battery was dead (the interior lights were left on when we unpacked the evening before). Not only did the staff find jumper cables for us, they even used the hotel's own truck to charge our battery, and THEN let us take the cables with us for the evening in case we need another charge somewhere later! It's the little things. We will be back to this place.

The underground parking garage is also very convenient for those in & out trips. We stayed on the 4th floor and were quite satisfied. Our room was very clean and brightly colored. It had 2 full size beds and was equipped with a full size refrigerator, microwave oven and a small stove top with a sink and basic cups, plates, silverware etc. The bathroom was clean, of average size and the water pressure was very good. The beds were not firm, but were reasonably comfortable. The air conditioner worked extremely well and in fact, it got so cold we had to turn it off for a period of time. The room had a small balcony looking at the ocean from an angle and I believe this is called an \"ocean view\" room. The free WiFi internet worked well and without problems. The TV was a 27\" regular style TV and had a variety of cable and local channels. The pool area was very nice, clean and well kept. There is also a small hot tub, which we didn't use but looked nice. Of course the beach is just a few steps down and you're literally right on Daytona Beach. One of the great things about the Bahama House besides the friendly staff is the \"Happy Hour\" everyday between 5:30 p.m.-6:30 p.m. They provide free cocktail drinks, wine, beer, pop, popcorn, peanuts, pretzels etc. to all adult hotel guests. They also provide homemade cookies at the front desk. The continental breakfast is served daily between 7:30 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. It consisted of your basic cereal, toast, bagels, donuts, muffins, fruit, yogurt, milk & juice.

We went because it was 45 minutes from our front door in Altamonte Springs, and because the price was great.

I chose this hotel for two reasons: the ranking on TripAdvisor and the price. I got a GREAT deal on Expedia. I would NEVER have paid the hotel's rate for this place. The check-in was great...the staff here is wonderfully friendly. We went up to our room, and it was disgusting. There were (what appeared to be) feces smeared all over the wall and something brown dripping down the door. The bathroom floor was gross, and the tub had a ring around it. The walls are painted a very light yellow, so you can see all the dirt all over the walls. The corners had dust an inch high in them. I told my kids to sit on the edge of the bed (\u201cdo not touch ANYTHING\u201d) while my husband and I tried to figure out what to do. The front desk was very helpful and sent us to check out 2 other rooms. Not any better (with the exception of the feces.) Had I not paid through Expedia, I would\u2019ve left immediately. Finally, they gave us an oceanfront room\u2026at the cost of $50 more. It was slightly cleaner (but had dead bugs in the refrigerator). I did have a giant can of Lysol with me\u2026so we sprayed EVERYTHING before unpacking. *Later, the manager did come by to tell us that they would not be charging us the $50 because she went to check out our first room and agreed it was \u201cinexcusable.\u201d The bathrooms are tiny, and very much in need of remodeling. They are old and moldy. The walls are in dire need of paint. We went to dinner and came back after dark. Wanting to change clothes, I tried to shut the curtains. The curtains don\u2019t shut! So, anyone who might be looking can see directly into your room at night. And don\u2019t plan to sleep past 6:30am here. That\u2019s when the sun comes up, and with no curtains to block it out, you will be up then too! The walls are very thin, and you can hear everything going on in the rooms around you\u2026so sleep was difficult. When we checked out, we let the manager (a different one from check-in) know about our concerns. She didn't even apologize. She handed us a bottle of water and said, \"thanks for staying with us.\" On the positive side: the staff is super, super friendly. The happy hour is great! I\u2019m not sure how in the world this place got a #1 rating. I don\u2019t ask for much more in a hotel than for it to be clean.

This was just a weekend getaway. We read all of the positive reviews and took the tripadvisor #1 ranking and ran with it. Here are the details: ROOM: It was a spacious kitchenette right on the beachfront. A fantastic balcony view of just about everything up and down the beachfront. The room itself is a little dated with it's decor and CRT TV. The pillows and bed left a little to be desired as well. Way too squishy and old. However, the air conditioning was very adequate and they had utensils and pans if you chose to cook. Room was quiet for the most part. We managed to get in room internet while we heard others could not. Upgrades needed in the room but it was okay generally speaking. C+ BEACHFRONT: Daytona is a pretty nice beach with the exception of all the cars that park on it, especially during the weekend. They take up all of the really soft sands spots closer to the hotel fronts and the smell of exahaust while you are trying to hang out and relax is less than appealing. If you can get past that, it's quite expansive, clean and pretty much rock free right in front of the Bahama House. B STAFF: Very pleasant at the front desk at all times. The other staff members always seemed to have a geniune smile on their face which was refreshing. A newspaper was provided each day which was great for reference. A POOL: While it's a bit small, it was well kept. There was a small jacuzzi as well. B HOUSEKEEPING: We never requested service during our stay but they seemed hard at work at all times and the general cleanliness of the place was good. I read reveiws that complain about the musty smell. People just don't realize that this is a common occurrence in warm and humid climates. You can clean all day it might not go away entirely. Lighten up. You're on a beach. B+ BATH: One sink granite vanity that was pretty spacious. Again, no frills decorating but clean. B PARKING: It was congested at times but we never had to utilize the garage parking underneath. No complaints for us but I'd imagine it could be tough during a busier time of the year. B LOCATION: This hotel is located actually in Daytona Beach Shores which is south of where the action is at. If you don't have a rental car, you might not like what have immediately around you. Not a lot of anything. You could walk to the shopping district but it would be a hike. C TIPS: Do the beachfront resturant \"Ocean Deck\" for casual food,drinks and live entertainment. Good party there. If you are looking for a more intimate date night, go to \"Carribbean Jack's\" on the riverfront for great food and atmosphere w/ live entertainment/dancing. CONCLUSION: We felt for the price that this hotel was exactly what we needed for a long weekend. If I were staying longer, I might reconsider since their is no resturant or bar to speak of even though they have a \"happy hour\" of free drinks. However, it's clean and comfortable and the price is right. A worthwhile place to stay on the beach as long as keep the price where it's at.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cullman, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "GregPCullman_Alabama", "ReviewID": "UR63832257", "Content": "Stayed 4 nights.

When we arrived they had congratulations to them posted on the marquee outside and we were greeted with two gift bags. We had 7 in our party, including two children, and we were ALL very pleased with this hotel. Bahama House is THE place to spend your vacation in Daytona! We had two rooms, they were back to back as Melissa promised and our view of the ocean was spectacular. The breakfast was light and good, and happy hour was another time I really enjoyed. We spent time in the large outdoor pool and hot tub. We also meet some very nice people from Georgia while we were there. Everything was clean and looked new to me. I will have more to post with some of our photos later. I will say that Bahama House is lucky and honored to have a worker as dedicated to guests comfort and wishes as Melissa Noe!

Here are just a few of the things that I noticed: When I called (up to three times) to determine if there was availability, the young lady I spoke with remembered me each time, offered to check for the best prices and/or best deals. Was kind, sweet, pleasant and very helpful with a variety of information about Bahama House and other information that would be helpful to me. On the final call she booked me into a beautiful room that was perfect for the number of people I had and that we had a balcony, and plenty of room and amenities, like a fridge etc. When we came to check in, it was a late check in \u2013 again no problem. We were greeted and shown the way to our room, we were given schedules as to the \u201cbreakfast\u201d and \u201ccocktail hour\u201d. Everything \u2013 Everything was clean and beautiful. The room was cool and inviting and perfect. They were helpful in getting extra pillows and a roll away that evening upon check in. The attitudes of all the employees were so very friendly and helpful. The housekeeping department for our room were very thorough and very kind about coming back to do our room in the event we were still resting. Then extra blankets we requested were brought up that day and anything else we may have needed. Great attitudes. Everyone!! This was a great place to stay and your employees should be highly praised as each one of them smiled, helped, was very courteous and seemed to enjoy working there. I think I\u2019ll have to be checking in there again. I wish I had everyone\u2019s name \u2013 I don\u2019t, they deserve great praise. Just thought you would like to know!!

The hotel is a good mile from the entertainment district, so you'll want to keep the car handy or have good walking shoes. The staff is very friendly and helpful!

The continental breakfast is adequate, but I'd like to see a waffle bar or something. Word to the wise - Do not lose your room key!

It's nothing to write home about though. Times are tough and the beach neighborhood shows it. The hotel tries to compensate for its weaknesses. The front desk staff people are professional and they do little things like have warm, chewy chocolate chip cookies waiting for you as you come and go. They also give you a welcome bag as you check-in, and a bottle of water as you check-out. And a bonus--There's easy and direct access to the lovely beach! Ah, but there is a but... the hotel is not that quiet--e.g., the housekeepers will make noise to get you out of your room so they can make the beds! They'll even notify the front desk staff. I'm not sure what happens if you really just want to stay in your room. The breakfast is so so and the coffee is really BAD. It's better to drive to Publix (in Ormand Beach or Daytona shores) and pick up something from the bakery. The hotel room furniture is dated, but the pillows are soft and comfy. There's a balcony, but don't use it once dusk falls because of the bugs. There were signs posted in the lobby and near the elevators warning people not to open the doors to the room balcony because of the mosquitos and what I call, \"No see ems\" those nasty biting creatures that swarm all over you before you can do a darn thing. So the balcony is pretty useless unless of course you don't mind being bitten. The hotel is a little skimpy when it comes to the small stuff that may turn into something big (or quite annoying): *one roll of toilet paper. You have to call the front desk staff to get more! *Bad coffee---some of the worst I've ever tasted.

The breakfast it the typical cold cereal-bagel-sweets-with coffee. However the staff keeps the coffee hot and pouring, the area cleans, and has friendly smiles. You can read the free paper left outside of your door each morning while you sip your coffee or go set outside by the ocean. The rooms are large, up to date, and clean. I particularly liked the high-speed wireless Internet that was available in the room, the lobby and the pool area. There was also a modem connection in the room if you didn't have a wireless card. I booked through Expedia and check in was fast, as well as check out. No surprises at either end. The location on South Atlantic is just inside Daytona Beach Shores and is a little removed from the Oceanwalk and pier area, but if you don't want to walk up the beach that far, their is reasonable priced parking connected to Oceanwalk. You can also park free at Sun Splash Park and walk a little way to the pier or Oceanwalk.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MORETOWN, VT", "Title": "\u201cThis Place Is FABULOUS!!\u201d", "Author": "jcordoba79", "ReviewID": "UR29583708", "Content": "Be sure to join AAA as their discount pays for the membership on your first stay.

The hotel is located right on the beach on Atlantic Avenue. The outside of the building is very appealing when comparing it to other hotels in the area. There is an underground parking garage with an elevator that takes you up to your floor. There is also outdoor parking, however this is at a premium. On the inside, the hotel is very clean and charming. The staff greet you each morning as you leave the hotel with a complimentary breakfast bar with your standard bagels, donuts, and coffee. In the evenings there is a complimentary happy hour from 5:30 to 6:30pm. There you are served either mixed drinks or beer. Be prepared to leave a tip or feel ashamed. In the room, the bed was very comfortable (for a hotel bed) however the room decor was very outdated and stale. The TV was only 19 inches and very basic. The room did have a kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, and sink. The bathroom was roomy, but the shower was absolutely awful. There was no settings on the shower, only super hot or super cold. The iron also did not work properly spilling water all over my dress pants. The best part of the room is the view from the balcony. We had a oceanfront suite with absolutely beautiful views. The views are definately what you are paying for for these rooms. One downside is that to the immediate south of the hotel is an abandoned hotel called \"Treasure Island\" or something like that. It is rundown and needs to be demolished. However, directly north is a beautiful building which I don't know whether it is condos or a hotel. Anyway, if I could stay anyway in Daytona Beach, I would probably choose a more expensive place, but for the money, the Bahama House is great.

However, this year we had a much different experience. First off, despite this terrible review the hotel still has the free happy hour, is conveniently oceanside, and the staff is very friendly. As strange as it sounds, if this problem were addressed and my concern handled professionally I would go back to the Bahama House based on the courteous staff and amenities the hotel has to offer. Yet now I don't think this is the case since the GM/Owner Brian Lansberry is refusing to grant our request for a partial refund and is basically saying that our complaint is fictious. Vacation started out just as great as the year before. However, as the week progressed both my wife and I started to find bites on our arms and legs that progressively got worse in size and quantity as our week came to a conclusion. Since we didn't hang out in a \"wooded area\" or anywhere else other than the beach and pool we had a suspicion we were a victim of by bedbugs. By Friday we were convinced this was not a coincidence and were going to ask for a different room but learned from the bartender/front desk associate that the hotel was \"booked to capacity\". As a result, we just tried to ignore the obvious since we were only there one more night and didn't know for 100% certain that this was the case. In addition, I also believe we didn't want to ruin our vacation. Since both my wife and I are medical professionals we immediately had a dermatologist look at the bites when returning home. In doing so our fears were confirmed: We had been bitten upwards of 30 times between us by insects. While the doctor left open the possibility that it could have been a variety of culprits, both of us knew these welts/bites came from the mattress closest to the balcony in room 911 of the Bahama House. For our part, both her and I are upset with ourselves for not saying anything during the stay and therefore we felt it appropriate to take \"half the blame\" in the form of only asking for a 50% refund. Yet we are both not the complaining type and again, we didn't want to damper a vacation we had planned for nearly a year. Also, we don't like to make accusations without some sort of foundation for truth, so we followed up as soon as possible. After confirming we had bites, I immediately contacted Bahama House management the first day I was back home. Yet much to our dismay our complaint about the bedbugs was not taken very seriously by the GM/Owner of the Bahama House, a man by the name of Brian Lansberry. When I did speak to him regarding this matter, he tried to tell me that dogs can sniff bedbugs (one of the apparant \"tests\" he utilizes), that these insects are visible with the human eye, and took the position that my complaint was inaccurate since his hotel is checked \"twice a year by a company named Mitex\". Although he did say he would look into the matter, I got the impression he didn't believe what I was saying and was going through the motions, especially when he told me the part about using dogs. He did say that he would have the room inspected and would share the results with me, but I was not born yesterday. What's to stop him from changing the mattress, making up some false report, or doing anything else that would alter the inspection in his favor? What's more, if this gentleman really is the owner I don't think he would admit to having bedbugs since that is a health code issue and by recognizing this he would not only lose the money of providing me a partial refund (again I only ask for half of my money back) but also have to take on the cost to correct the situation. Point being, I know what my wife and I experienced, and I welcome anyone reading my review to look at the pictures I've provided and juxtapose them with bed bug bites that can be found via an Internet search if access to a doctor is not readily available. Also, please refer to a review #101 of this hotel from a past guest who had a very similar experience. Here you will also find a response to the guest's complaint in which the hotel's representative basically dismisses the complaint and suggests that this problem was due to being near \"wetlands\". Keep in mind that this guest was with the USTA, an organization that has a business relationship with the Bahama House and therefore would only be doing themselves harm by making up a complaint. Bottom line, I would have come back to this hotel and given it a decent review had I not been bitten by bedbugs and my complaint would have been treated appropriately. Being medical professionals my wife and I are extremely blessed financially and would not go out of the way to try and \"scam\" the Bahama House, especially since we like the hotel so much. However, after trying to be reasonable and approaching management for only a partial refund PRIOR to leaving a negative review, I felt the hotel showed that they really didn't care about their guests or the quality of their establishment. In closing, I have already contacted the Florida Department of Health regarding this matter and plan on following it up as far as possible. If you don't want to be a victim of bedbug bites I suggest you stay clear of the Bahama House, specifically room 911.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poinciana, FL", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Value\u201d", "Author": "Joluc76", "ReviewID": "UR28261348", "Content": "From the time we checked in, the desk receptionist , Jane's smile and attention to detail set the stage for a great 3 day stay.

With that said, it was a great stay within the price range. It was actually, from the exterior, more aesthetically pleasing than almost every hotel on the South Side (known as Daytona Beach Shores) of Daytona. I didn't have high expectations of the hotel due to some reviews and the star rating, so that I wouldn't be disappointed during my stay. The hotel was kept very clean from all my observations (and I'm pretty critical), there was always someone mopping the floors in the lobby or housekeepers on our floor. The lobby was inviting and the staff at check in was very accomidating. We drove to Daytona Beach and arrived at 10:30AM understanding that checkin was at 3PM. Before we spoke to anyone we decided to check our luggage at the front desk, change clothes, and just walk around until checkin. We asked the front desk attendant if we could check our baggage and she actually told us that our room was ready and checked us in early (without any charge). I thought that this spoke highly of the level of hospitality, so I was impressed by this (check one for surpassing my expectations). The rooms were pretty dated, which I expected, but were larger than I had anticipated. We were given an \"ocean view\" room with two double beds, which I was aware of at booking. The ocean view was just that... a view... lol. We were in the furthest room from the ocean, but did have a good view. And any view of the ocean is better than no view, in my opinion. The bathrooms were VERY tiny, but clean and there was a plethora of hot water for the shower (actually so much so that our shower did not have a \"cold\" setting and I thought it was great). The location of the hotel on the beach was perfect. It was far enough away from the Boardwalk area that it was not as busy as the rest of the beach on both sides. The beach was very clean. The hotel was only about a mile from the boardwalk/main pier, but there were plenty of places to visit along the way. We walked pretty much everywhere when we were going to be on atlantic avenue. The pool was pretty average and the hot tub was very hot, but we didn't even use either of these until at night (why lay out at a pool when you have the beach???). The hotel offered a complementary breakfast and happy hour. The breakfast was the usual cereal, bagels, coffee, danishes, fruit, juice, oatmeal that you would find anywhere, but the attendant kept up with it and the food was good. We got breakfast every morning before we started our day. Happy Hour was a GREAT idea of the hotel... Free drinks (i.e. mixed drinks with vodka, rum, whiskey and budweiser, bud light, and miller light cans) from 5:30 to 6:30 each evening. This was great and we stopped each night before we went out to dinner or out into town. The staff was very pleasant to us and even helpful in recommending some places to get drinks and dinner. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the trip. The beds were harder, but comfortable. The hotel was kept clean, but was a little dated. It was a great stay for the money and I would definitely stay here again.

It truly is a lovely hotel with a relaxing, welcoming atmosphere. The free breakfast was more than adequate and the complimentary Happy Hour was fun for both adults and kids. Our room was an oceanfront efficiency which offered a direct view of the Atlantic, the beach, and the pool. It was incredible. We never heard a peep from our neighbors' rooms nor did we ever hear people in the hallway. The underground garage offers safe parking. The \"except one thing\" in the title is an important one thing. The beds were horrific on the back. For the life of me, I can't figure out what, exactly, was the problem with the beds. They didn't seem overly firm and even seemed comfortable for the first hour. With each passing click of the clock, the bed seemed to fire upon every muscle and nerve ending in my back requiring waking each hour for a deliberate position change in order to alleviate the pain. We both had diffiulty standing upright for the first morning hour. The good news is, the pain subsided with a hot shower or a soak in the hot tub by the pool (very nice, by the way). I can just say that I felt tortured during the night so it's been a challenge to fully endorse the Bahama House. I would hesitate to return but truth be told, it's probably not entirely different than most hotels in this price range. It is a quandary... such a beautiful atmosphere, cleanliness, and incredible hospitality vs. uncomfortable sleep. I don't know the answer about whether or not to recommend. I did ask a couple of other guests and they agreed that they were experiencing the same issue with the bed so decided against discussing this with the management or maybe asking for a room swap. All that said, I guess the truth lies in the fact that many guests return, trip after trip. One family has been to the Bahama House so many times, they can outline the individual room's advantages and disadvantages by heart. They said that room 1001 is *the* best. We had a blast in Daytona and do plan to return as often as possible (just one minor reason that our economy needs to hold on so that you and I can continue to afford the luxury of travel). We recommend Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge if you're seeking an opportunity to see manatees in the wild (no charge). We took a cruise on St. Johns and a cruise off Inlet Harbor, both were fun, but we didn't spot a manatee. The service workers in Daytona know how to please vacationers and it seemed that everyone enjoyed their work and were super friendly. In a nut, they are all doing their job and realize that hospitality is the key to bringing visitors back. Because one waitress (Ryan) at Aunt Catfish's was exceptional, we returned three times and dropped a couple hundred bucks. We really enjoyed the food there as well, but she truly made us feel at home. Daytona Beach offers sun, fun, relaxation, escape, water, nature (so loved the pelicans and other birds who passed the Bahama House each day), and entertainment (International Speedway), and hospitality all in one place.

When we first got there we were given room 411. We got up to the room and opened the door and the room was GREAT, however, when we steped outside onto the balcony to have a look at our \"Oceanview\", all we saw was the hotel next door and heard loud noises from the hotel's air conditioning units. I immediately called the fron desk and told them very nicely that I wasn't happy with room 411 and asked if they had any other rooms available that had a better view and less noise. I talked to a really nice lady named Sandy and she said to come back down to the front desk and she would see what she could do for us. She was able to move us directly across the hall to room 410. The room was GREAT once again and this time the view from the balcony was BEAUTIFUL! We had a view of the ocean and the really nice condos called Ocean Vistas. The room itself was HUGE. It had a ful size refridgerator with a freezer, cooktop, microwave, Fiesta Ware dishes for four, silverware for four, coffee maker, lots of cupboard space, a few pots/pans. The closet and dresser area was very large. The bathroom was a bit small for four people using it, but it did have a lot of vanity space and worked fine for our family. The FREE breakfast each morning was all right. i wish that they would have had more fruit. They just had banannas everyday we were there. They also ran out of peanut butter and Frosted Flakes cereal the last morning of our stay and our 6 year old daughter was upset. She is very picky and won't eat much. We all enjoyed the happy hour each day. It was fun to talk to the other guest that were staying there. My kids are still talking about the Shirley Temples that they had. The ppol are was small, but very, very nice. The access to the beach was wonderful. They have a hose set up for you to wash off your feet after you are done at the beach, which I thought was very nice. The beach area is just wonaderful! It is so beautiful! I walked the beach a lot during out stay and felt that the Bahama House is located in a very nice area of the beach. There is an entrance ramp for cars that are wanting to drive on the beach right by the Bahama House. Cars are allowed to drive on the beach, so if you think that would bother you, then you may not want to stay there. It didn't bother us or our kids who are 6 and 11 at all. It was fun to watch people drive on the beach. You can only go 10 miles an hour. We also saw people driving golf carts, 4 wheelers, motorcycles, bikes - just about anything you can think of! The Bahama House also has FREE parking and an underground parking ramp. Yes, there is a tatoo parlor and an adult emporium across the street from the hotel. If that type of thing bothers you, then don't stay here. We were there to enjoy what's out behind the hotel - the ocean. It didn't hamper our vacation in any way. We had a GREAT time at the Bahama House and in Daytona Beach. We highly reccommend this hotel to everyone!

Staff was very friendly and welcoming, check in was a breeze. We were very pleased with the room. Very spacious, clean, and well appointed.

The pool itself was a decent size, and I think it had to have been heated? The water temperature was very comfortable. The hot tub wasn't that great, only two jets were functioning. We enjoyed and appreciated the fresh cookies at the front desk, and the free \"happy hour\" drinks! The Continental breakfast was ample for our needs, and served in an attractive dining area.

We were awake for hours most of the first night of our stay, listening to loud voices, banging doors, people raising hell out on the balcony, etc etc. Finally around 1AM we called the front desk to complain. We were told \"it would be taken care of\".....Well, the noise etc continued for a few more hours. Basically, our first night at Bahama House was ruined. The next morning at breakfast we discovered quite a few other people talking about the noise that this one room was making all night, there on the 4th floor. An employee overheard us, and stated that \"if that had happened on a WEEKEND the noisy/drunk people would have been kicked right out\". Personally, I don't see why noisy/drunk people should be tolerated on WEEKDAYS!! It is unfortunate that this hotel does not have more of a strict policy in regard to guests who party/make noise and disturb other customers staying there.

It wasn't a big deal, we're just posting this to notify the employees at the Bahama House of this problem. Also, we didn't know about or remember the cookies available until our last day. :( Our only other \"problem\" was the two \"fire\" alarm\" evacuations we had to leave the building for at 2:30 a.m. and 5::00 a.m. We know there was nothing management could have done to prevent these. It just happened to be our last night... we had to be at the airport at 8 a.m. and had stayed up late the night before (being our last night). In fact, I really felt somewhat protected and safe... the alarm system worked perfect. It was able to wake us up and get us out quickly. I have always wondered how you would evacuate a hotel in the middle of the night and wondered how reliable a system could be. So in a way, I could thank you...! :) And finally, what we liked the very best, was the view... oh my gosh! It was like HEAVEN ON EARTH! We felt we were practically on top of the water! We were in awe each and every day. The view was incredible! Our curtains only closed when it was dark. We left the door open most of the time because we all loved the listening to the ocean.

Their website has confusing room descriptions and no really good pictures of the outside of the hotel itself, nor of the view you get from your room. So upon checking in, we discovered our room faced the street, with the fumes and noise that accompanied the tail-end of bike week. Argued with the desk clerk afterwards, but they wouldn't take any responsibility (the website is run by a third party, they said), so we paid $25 a night to upgrade to oceanfront. Not happy there. Then I began compiling a list of minor complaints, which surprised me since so many previous guests had raved about this place. Not me here. In fact, I began to wonder about the integrity of the TripAdvisor reviews I read. The high speed internet is only wireless in the lobby area. For internet access in your room you have to deposit $35 to receive a cable, which probably retails for $10 or less, then hook it up in your room. The cable is too short to use your computer anywhere but on the bed. I never could get it to work anyhow and since trying my computer hasn't been working right. This could have been my fault but another complaint I had was with the dearth of information that came with our room. Though we received a packet of info and sundries when we checked in, there was precious little information on the high speed internet, pool hours, TV offerings, guest services, etc. A book in the room provided some information and advertising, but was a bit lacking as well. Based on a promise of free delivery, we ordered pizza from an advertiser in the book and was charged $2 for delivery. As others have noted, there are few shops or restaurants within close walking distance, unless you count the adult emporium and tattoo parlor directly across the street. The free newspaper is not the usual USA Today, but the smaller Daytona daily, which did give us the TV listings, helpful since we couldn't learn what was on HBO otherwise. We also read of the search for a serial killer in Daytona. Wonderful. Finally, missing from our room was a bottle opener that we thought would have been provided with a full kitchen, and a \"Do Not Disturb\" tag. We snagged a replacement tag from housekeeping when they came by. On the plus side, the hotel is clean and well maintained, the staff is helpful and friendly, and the views--even those facing the street--are captivating. The complimentary happy hour is popular and understandably so with unlimited drinks. Though I was expecting the type of punch bowl setting you might get at an inexpensive wedding reception, they actually have a bartender with a modest but interesting drink selection. The bahama mama is a tasty and potent potable. The complimentary chocolate chip cookies at the front desk are fresh and absolutely delicious also. For those wanting a bit more on the snack side, in back of the hotel is a beach concession area so you can order a hot dog or a funnel cake. You can rent a golf cart near there too. If you want to drive the beach in your own car, a ramp from the street right next to the hotel conventiently allows you to do so. I should note that I've never been too fond of busy beachfront resort destinations. My experiences at Myrtle Beach and Virginia Beach helped to convince me that these types of places are the definition of tourist traps. Still, I was expecting more from the Bahama House because of its Number One listing on TripAdvisor for Daytona Beach. A little clarity in advertising would have been appreciated.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "union, ky", "Title": "\u201cNice Place\u201d", "Author": "jjk474", "ReviewID": "UR14288040", "Content": "Everything about this hotel was outstanding.

The hotel is very clean and well cared for. Housekeeping did a nice job of servicing us with fresh towels when needed. They also made the beds and stacked all of our daughters' stuffed animals at the top of her bed. She loved this! The rooms are big and spacious and it looks as though every room as a nice view of the ocean. Our room was not oceanfront, (in other words, no view of pool...) but we could still see the ocean. The people here are so nice and really attend to your every need. The breakfast is okay, just a standard hotel breakfast and we didn't go to the \"cocktail\" hour. Things to know before you go: 1.) The rooms do not have a \"FULL\" kitchen as the website advertises. (Well, some might, but ours did not...) It has a kitchenette...which is 1 sink, a micro, a full size frig, and a two burner stove. There is no oven, no dishwasher, and very minimal cooking utensils. It was fine for us, b/c we only stayed for a couple of nights, but if you are used to staying for long periods in a condo or similiar surroundings, as we are, this might not be the best situation for you. 2.) There is a laundry facitlity on the 2nd floor. We didn't use it, so I can't comment on it. 3.) The pool area is nice (towels are provided without hassle) and the pool was always sparkling clean! It was heated at night to a nice warm temp., which our daughter loved! We didn't use the hot tub, so again no comment...It looked nice. Only two negatives, no kiddie pool and no ramp to the beach. There are two sets of stairs, but no ramp for wheelchairs, etc. If you are taking a stroller to the beach, it can prove very difficult. All in all this is a nice clean place with a very friendly atmosphere! I would stay here again if I was only planning to stay for a couple of nights. If I was planning to stay for longer than 4-5 nights, I probably would not, just because I am used to staying in condos and like the convenience of in \"room\" laundry facilities and a completely full kitchen. However; this is no fault of the hotel. For a hotel, it is a good value and I would recommend it to friends. :) Just a note: We travel to Florida quite frequently, but it has been a while since we have visited Daytona.

It was a bit chaotic, but the desk staff were completely in control, they were ready for us and soon we had been whisked off to our quiet room on the second floor. I highly recommend getting a second-floor room if you can. It was perfect because it had a great view of the ocean framed by palm trees, but it was still easy to walk down the steps to the lobby and not have to wait for an elevator.

What a wonderful experience. Had a 10th floor oceanview room with a balcony which had a beautiful view of the ocean. Room was large and clean. had a full kitchen, sofa, dining table, desk table as well as a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. Hotel lobby and grounds were spectacular and clean. Workers seemed like one big happy family who met your every need and made you feel at home. The continental breakfast was one of the best we have ever seen and the nightly cocktail party was a great experience. they make a great Bahama Mama! The hotel has undeground parking and a beautiful pool area--well landscaped with plenty of lounge chairs as well as tables and chairs. Great location with wireless internet in the lobby. Huge lcd tv in the lobby. Beautiful view of the ocean from the wonderfully decorated dining area. One of the best beach hotels we have stayed at in Florida!

The hotel is fairly run-of-the-mill, but may be one of the nicer joints in Daytona Beach, which is not saying much. Our room felt marginal as far as cleanliness goes, and the bathroom was pretty-well aged. The fridge and microwave were a nice touch, though. The beach-side pool and hot tub were enjoyable. The hotel offers a number of activities during the week, which makes it feel a little more like a retirement home. Not unreasonable as we were easily the youngest people there, and I'm in my mid-thirties! Skip Daytona Beach altogether and stay in Orlando, but if you have to stay, I might recommend springing for a room a the Hilton.", "Date": "July 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Bahama House\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4462008", "Content": "We decided to stay at the Bahama House based on the TripAdvisor reviews and rating.

The hotel location was perfect for our young family, lots to see down at the New Smyrna beach end, and lots of restaurants North. The previous review said it was not a \"great place to stay\"...I strongly disagree. It is simple comfort, not a five star, but excellent service from tha staff, and enough little perks, like the homemade cookies at the front desk, the FREE cocktail hour and continental breakfast, to make it a pleasant experience...If you don't like the heat, don't visit FLORIDA!

I was shocked that it was rated #1 on this forum. It is true that the onsite parking was convenient. The staff was pleasant and when we had a problem with the ice machine in our refrigerator it was fixed immediately. The hotel was just not high quality in any way. The rooms were large but the towels were thin and the paper products (toilet paper, etc.) were really cheap. The happy hour was okay but it was hot with no A/C in the lobby. They had pretzels and popcorn as snacks all three nights. The breakfast was a continental breakfast which was not expanded at all. It appeared that they got boxes of mini donuts or other small breakfast items and put them out. Many places these days make more of an attempt to have some interesting items. No Splenda or Equal, only Sweet N' Low--ick. The area was shabby and not what we were hoping for.

Now for my grips, none very serious. Main grip was shower, head was to my neck (short), very short and water pressure very bad, took about 2 min to get hot water so while you wait cold water is splashing on you. might be smart to turn on water, use stool, then when done will be warm. Also room is very small, there are a few a bit bigger but most are tiny. Also lots of airplane noise but was tired and able to sleep well. If traveling alone and goal is sleep good choice, if with more than yourself it will be tough to move about the room. Also breakfast was not terific, yet on par with other freebreakfast places. Mostly annoyed how small breakfast area was. There was about 5 people in breakfast area and it felt shoulder to shoulder, but hey, its free, if you don't like it skip it.Overall better than expected for price paid.

Each stay was for only a single night as it is my favorite hotel to stay in when I make the long drive down to Phoenix for an early morning flight the next morning. I always ask for their special rate that includes 7 days of parking for very additional cost. Overall, this saves me quite a bit over official airport parking or nearby commercial parking. Every time I have been there, the place has been spotless. Yes, the rooms are not huge, but then I am not there to spend a week of vacation. It is furnished very basically but the beds are comfortable, the rooms are quiet and I can count on a good night's sleep before I have to leave for the airport. The shuttle service is very good, but make sure you are in the lobby at least 15 minutes before it is due to leave. One time I had to wait for the shuttle to come back from the airport as it was full and I could not get on at the appointed time. They will also pick you up fairly quickly with just a phone call when you return to the airport after your trip is over. Keep in mind that this is NOT an upscale hotel and they provide just the typical basic services. Breakfast is limited, but that is typical of this type of hotel. If you need a place very close to the airport for a good night's rest AND want to leave your car, this is a great place to do so.

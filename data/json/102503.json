Starting at around 10pm on our first night (7/3), the couple across the hall from us started arguing and slamming their door. We could actually hear them word for word because they were loud and stood right in the hall. Finally around midnight, we called the front desk to complain. The front desk person said she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sending someone. About 5 minutes later, there was a knock on our door, the security guard wanted to know if everything was ok because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a complaint. We told him that we were the ones that complained! Five minutes later, he knocked on our door again wanted us to point out the people that we were complaining about. This would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been ok if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the fact that the lady that was making all the noises was standing right there in the hall way. Her spouse took off as soon as the security guard came around. Of course it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have taken a genius to figure out who these people were since they were standing right there in the hall way and a guy jumped into his car and took off. The security guard went back to the front desk without really doing anything except disturbing us even more. About an hour later, the guy returned and the arguing continued until 3 in the morning. This time, we just put up with it because it was better than the alternative. At the same time, we could hear every single foot step, water running, toilet flushing, and movements from the room right above our room (#211). At least we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to hear people yelling and cursing at each other on our second night.

On top of that, there were other problems: the ice maker didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work in our refrigerator; front desk receptionists were very unfriendly; and the plumbing back up so there were always debris in our tub.

The Residence Inn turned out to be a good stay. The location was easy to find and a 5 minute drive to the airport. Ive been to smaller cities than Philadelphia and the driving and Airport Hotel properties are just harder to find. The majority of the Airport hotels in Philadelphia are clustered in 2 areas near the airport. Adjacent to my property was the Sheraton Suites, 4 points, and Hilton. The Residence Inn looks like an apartment complex with 2 levels in an suburban neighborhood. The front office staff were nice but could have been more approachable. Even if the front desk staff tried to be more Service oriented, most people would think the staff would need more training. The lobby was clean and there was no sitting area unless you go into the cafeteria where they serve breakfast. An Internet terminal is right in the smack middle of the lobby where everyone can see what you are searching or purchasing online. Complimentary coffee is readily available in the lobby. I had a Suite on the first level in Building 14. Even though the property itself looked safe, the police was frequently roaming the parking lot talking to employees 2 of the 3 days I was there. There is also a Security Guard that walks the property constantly. The room was pretty basic. I was hoping to have a separate bed room from the kitchen/ living room area. But everything was squished in 1 big room. The shower and toilet in the bathroom is very small. It was hard to maneuver in there. The bed and Free parking was the best thing about this stay. Very soft multiple pillows made sleeping very comfortable. Overall, I would probably not come back to stay here. I paid $ 155.00 per night and it was not worth it. I had friends staying at the Quality Hotel ( not INN ) off of I 95 and they payed $ 65.00 for an economy style hotel and I felt it worth the price.

While my experience was not bad like the others on here, this is obviously one of the earlier Residence Inns built. The furnishings and cabinetry in this location looks to be about 10-15 years old. My room was clean and quiet, but smelled like a typical smoking room. Bed was comfortable, water pressure good. However, at $159 a night, you can get a nicer place elsewhere. The Renaissance (also a Marriott property) had rates of $152 for the same night, but I opted for Residence because of their full breakfast (definitely worth the $7 differnence). Upon check-in, I had to sign a form stating that I would not have any loud parties or bring kegs on the premisis, which I thought was strange. Upon reading the other reviews, I realize now that it may have been needed.", "Date": "September 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee, FL", "Title": "\u201cWorst-ever hotel experience here!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2209139", "Content": "Stayed here 6/18/04. Filthy pool, totally overcrowded with hotel employees and their friends and families, not reserved for guests of hotel.

Upstairs guests over our room had a loud party until 3 a.m. and despite our two calls to management, nothing was done to stop it. Staff generally unresponsive and surly.

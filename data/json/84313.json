The staff was very accomodating and pleasant. Housekeeping was excellant! I had 2 grandchildren with me, they were 7 and 1 year old. We had a room, thank goodness, on the 1st floor and right outside our patio door was the minature golf course. It kept them occupied thru the whole stay. Except once the 7 year old fell into one of the water traps..... The pool had live music or DJ's so that was also entertaining and the 7 year old loved the Limbo contest, and the dancing right on the pool deck. She surprised me as I had no clue she knew how to do all those dance steps LOL Guess I need to get with it and the younger generation. We all had a Great Time and I was not disappointed in our stay even after reading all the negative reviews. It is an older hotel but the atmosphere and staff were very accomodating in our experience.

Hawaiian Inn provided us with great rooms (we had two) and we scored front and center views of the rising sun and on occasion the rising ocean tides...the Hawaiian theme is throughout the hotel, from the lobby, the pool area, and equipped with a tiki bar...pool towels were always available on request along with room cleaning service. We are the type that prefer the convenience of a kitchenette and our room did not disappoint. Convenience stores were a stroll away, along with beach shops and typical food fare like IHOP and Pizza-Hut. The price for our stay was great taking everything into account. Daytona's Beach was literally outside of our backyard. Rooms were never short on AC. Areas of improvement would be the bed and pillows - definitely overdue for an upgrade, but not so terrible.

I'd heard that some of the units were privately owned and that the quality of the rooms could vary. Our room, 224, however, was quite nice, with everything we needed, except paper towels. It was a suite that overlooked the tiki bar, with a somewhat obstructed view of the ocean. Still, I could check the waves from the balcony, which is important to me, because I surf. The waves out front were up, those days, although the bottom contours of the sandbar weren't producing waves that peeled, at least very often. If anything, I believe the desk clerks who were on duty when we checked were some of the least attentive, distracted representatives I've ever known. They made me feel as if I was keeping them from sort of argument they were having about some bad data that was entered into their reservation system. Their coldness and lack of attention seemed in stark contrast to my slight expectations of the spirit of \"aloha\" that Hawaii brings to mind. Having been to Hawaii, I can say with certainty that there was absolutely no \"aloha\" spirit when I checked in. Still, I never had to deal with them again. We didn't drink at the tiki bar and we didn't go to the Ohana show. But, we did enjoy our second floor balcony. Oh, and we had troulbe with the toilet, but a maintenance man came up and fixed it. He was actually professional and friendly. The official surfing area ends right at the south end of the property. During the summer, lifeguards will call you out if you drift past this point.

Every day there was a different singer at the pool, which was very awesome because I did not see any other hotels doing this.

They have no intention of keeping the pool safe or enjoyable for guests. The only duty that they served was to make sure that patrons did not have a cooler that held more than a six pack.

I could keep an eye on the door to the room while laying out facing the ocean. It is like being at home with a pool and an ocean in your back yard.

We also played on the mini-golf course facing the ocean... very nice with waterfalls and fountains. They do require the hotel guests to wear wrist bands so it will help keep out the non-guests from using the hotel amenities, which is great.

If you enjoy Slamming of the doors, Yelling and Hooting at the top of your lungs, Banging on Every room door in the hallway, and, keeping other families awake; this is the Place for You! No Security, No Rules, and No Respect for other vacationers. For those with young children, or older, and are thinking about a vacation at Hawaiian Inn - This is Not the place for you! For if you complain about the excess noise at 3 am, 4 am, 5 am; the front desk tells you \"It is Spring Break!\" Before booking we emailed the owner asking if the murphy bed was a queen, as we could not tell by the photo. We were told it was a queen, or at least a full size bed. He has owned this property since 2004 and doesn\u2019t know the difference between a full and queen size. That should have been a sign, but we ignored it and proceeded with the rental. This person never disclosed what Hawaiian Inn is all about. It is a Condo - Hotel that caters to Spring Breakers and Bike Week partiers, and I mean \"Hard Core Partying\". It rents out other owners condo's to \"anyone.\" We rented directly from the owner of unit # 229. I thought, I did my research on this place and could not find any negatives even on Tripadvisor dating from Jan.2012 to Feb.16 2012. We left for Florida on Feb.26 2012. You can tell by the different reviews of this place that most of the \u201cGood\u201d reviews are from the younger generation. No surprise on reading reviews about the broken things in the condo's, we know how they get broken. We paid for a month stay at this place. The ad had stated a relaxing time; it also stated it had a \"full\" kitchen with a \"full\" fridge, a dishwasher, and a queen size murphy bed. What we got was a kitchenette with a \"bar\" fridge, a \"bar\" sink, a two burner stove top, and a double size murphy bed that squeaks and grinds with every move \u2013 I posted a video of this and while we are showing the bed you can hear the music coming from the other condo through the wall. The owner\u2019s ad has now been changed. The pull out couch needs a new mattress, as it has a few dips, but it was better than the murphey. In the closet area there is a heavy wooden dresser in front of the safe making it impossible to get into. There is no inside table or chairs, only on the patio. The towels are thread bare and you have bits stuck to you when drying. There is a spot on the wall where the \"smoke detector\" should be. The rug inside the condo has paint drippings and you have to flush the toilet a few times for anything to go down. We had no security with the patio door, as the lock was corroded and ready to fall off. This condo is on the second floor with only a partial wall between the patio's making it easy to climb over, or up to. It is directly across from the stairway door and is above the door to the swimming pools, so you hear the loud slamming from both sets of doors. There is no rug in the hallway to help smother the noise, so everything echo\u2019s very loudly. We arrived on Wed. Feb.28 and on Fri. Mar.2 three bus loads of college students arrived with more on the way. Having no sleep for three days/nights, our vacation was in ruins. We contacted the owner of #229 during these three days who kept telling us security was there. We even called him at 2:30 in the morning so he could enjoy what we were enjoying. There was NO security. The police were called quite a few times, but soon as they left, the students started back with the partying. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=FBQ_1uPr4zE \u2013 2am http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsGk9tX11tw&feature=channel \u2013 heated pool http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiDYfL5V53k&feature=youtu.be \u2013 hallway http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npEsueEEtkc&feature=channel \u2013 condo inside These students had shopping cart races down the hallways, they trashed the lobby and took every information pamphlet and tossed them around including the elevators, over turned the concrete tables outside. Finally, we could not take it any longer and we left on Mon. Mar.5 to find other accommodations instead of enjoying what we thought would be a relaxing time. This condo owner knew we were grandparents and not the partying type which is why he rented to us, as he knew his condo would not get trashed like the others. We did not get the vacation we had hoped for, instead of staying in one place, we had to find other accommodations which rented by the week. We stayed at #229 for 6 days and we were charged for 13 days. We were tired of fighting for the remaining weeks we had paid, as we just wanted to salvage some of our lost vacation and get rid of the stress. I have to give credit to the front desk and all who works at Hawaiian Inn. They really tried very hard in keeping this place clean during this time. They were not rude to us and were very sympathetic to what we experienced during our stay with them. If you\u2019re a student looking for an exciting time this is it.

Having said this, I had a great time. Our room was totally livable; the view is amazing... we even saw doplhins on our last day just where I had been swimming only an hour prior. It is obvious that the hotel has made many improvements and is continuing to do so. The price makes it very accessible for the average person / couple / family. I would definitely return. We had room 519 which has two queen beds and a pull out couch - it wasn't perfect but I will request it next time if I was given a room I didn't like. What I mean by not perfect is the beds are not very comfortable and although you can tell someone tried to renovate the room the work is a little sloppy... but like I said, I would totally stay again. In fact, I'll likely look into purchasing a condo here of my own at some point. Mybiggest complaint is the beds... and the awful noise of the fans from the restaurant... they are loud and woke me up every day that the restaurant was open. Maybe it was so great since I expected worse.... but in all honesty I felt welcome, safe, comfortable, and had a great vacation.

The price was unbeatable at $200 for the whole week, but as my title suggests, you get what you pay for. When we arrived, we waited at the front desk for THREE HOURS for service, and the line was not nearly long enough to justify the wait. The card readers on the doors were constantly malfunctioning, leaving us locked out at inconvenient times of the day and night. Repair service was slow, but more acceptable than the front desk service. In general, the place seemed to be severely understaffed at what I imagine is a very busy time of the year (Bike Week and Spring Break). The place was undergoing renovations at the time, so naturally that entailed being woken up to the lovely sound of jackhammers and buzzsaws at 7am, then contending with the racket for the rest of the day. The cleanliness of the rooms was acceptable, but the hallways were godawful. Dirt and grime covered everything, and I even spotted a cockroach enjoying the shade under a hallway vending machine. Granted, this was partly due to the hoards of drunken college kids stumbling around the halls, but this is no excuse for failing to do simple daily maintenance. The location on the strip was good, as was the daytime poolside programming. Additionally, the shuttle service into town for the nightlife was a great deal. The hotel is only a block or two from various grocery and convenience stores, as well as both local and chain-type restaurants. No complaints here whatsoever. My advice: if you are a college student looking for an excellent spring break deal, this is the place to be, provided you can put up with service and cleanliness issues (trust me, you can).

I was told that this is a Condominium Hotel, where-by the rooms are owned by individuals. If that is the case then New York is not the only place where there are slum lords. The folks who owned the rooms we had must be PIGS We drove eleven hundred miles to go to the TWILIGHT ZONE. I don't understand how these conditions are allowed to exist. I would hope that the other motels on the strip are not as bad. In the future we will go to someplace closer to us, perhaps Virginia Beach.

I had the air on full blast cold and I was hot the entire time. And im usually always cold. Also, the service was terrible. Most of the housekeeping doesnt speak English. And my BIGGEST complaint about this hotel is the length of the time it took to get towels to the room. They only let you have 1 per person, but the average person is going to shower twice a day at the beach. Once in the morning and once after you get out of the sea water. Three times I waited over an hour to get towels and one of the times it ruined my plans because \"all of the towels were in the dryer.\" Although there were many more small complaints, the last one I will bring up is the broken elevator. There is only 2 in the whole hotel, and one was broken. We had to walk across the entire floor to get to the elevator. And they were very hot. Dont stay here, even though it's cheap.

They say they are finishing up a renovation and only need to put in a few windows, but I'd say the renovation hasn't yet started and they need to put in a new hotel. Oh my, they provided a key to look in one of their rooms. It felt like we were walking forever. It was atleast 100-125 years from the elevator to the room. We passed rooms with a variety of doors and locks. We had to pull up our pants to walk through a partially flooded area where it appears the ice machine was either badly leaking or not cold enough to keep the ice from melting. We finally reached the room and we didn't stay in very long. It had an unpleasant must smell, and a love seat the seemed like a throwback to the 80's. The bed was uneven and squeaked loudly when I leaned up against just barely. We left out rather quickly. The hallways are long, dim, and really a bit scary. The elevator stink and my wife held her breath while on it. This is a poor place overall. Many of the units are individually owned, so maybe you luck up with a nice room, but in a crappy hotel. However, I'd expect that the privately owned, nice rooms are only available though the owner on a condo leasing site and not available if you book directly with the hotel. This is not the place to book, go to the Emerald Shores for a better room and maybe a cheaper price. The Holiday Inn Express and Suites in the 3300 block of A1A is the safest bet.

To start, we requested the same room we had the previous year because we enjoyed the location in the hotel and its accessibility. I called three weeks after booking the room, which was also 3 weeks before our intended stay to ensure that we had the room we had requested. The staff member told me that we were given that room and looked forward to seeing us shortly. Upon arrival, during check-in, the staff member at the front desk told us we were in room 222, which was not our requested room. When we mentioned the request they told me they didn't know about it, and that there was construction being done, and the room was unavailable. Later my friend witnessed guests walking in and out of the room we requested. Our room on the second floor was nice, but very inconvenient as it only had a King and a pullout Full, where the room we asked for had a King and a pullout Queen. As we put our bags down on the bed, it collapses on the bottom right side. We changed clothes and headed out for dinner. On our return back to the hotel, no more than a few hours after check-in, we stopped by the front desk on our way to the room and requested a cot and told the staff member that the bed was broke when we put our stuff down. He asked for our room number and had one sent up. The cot was only requested because the King could not be slept on. Our checkout was suppose to be on a Friday at 11am, but we decided to checkout a day early and left Thursday evening. At the time of checkout, the staff showed me all the charges that accumulated throughout the week on my particular credit card. Everything was correct, they even forgot to charge me for my security deposit. He said there won't be anymore charges on the account. However, the following Monday, I had a charge on my account for 100$. After 10 minutes of re-explaining my story to each of the staff members before they let me talk to anyone who could do anything, the supervisor told me the room had been inspected and the bed cost 100$ to fix. First off, if I had a wrench on my spring break vacation, I would've fixed the bed myself, but instead I tried to enjoy my stay, thinking the staff might have made note of the reason I requested a cot. She told me the room had just been put together and everything was new. Yet, the tile was cracked throughout the room, the sink and shower had mold around their fixtures. The maid service was nonexistent. Every day my guest and I went down to the front desk whether it was for towels to shower, or toilet paper for the bathroom. Even talking to one staff member who was recently hired told me had heard nothing but complaints since he started working there. I will not be returning to the Hawaiian Inn due to their lack of ability to inspect rooms firsthand, their very poor customer service, and their lack of communication through their own staff with things like requesting certain rooms, noting why a cot was even requested.

I would have truly missed out otherwise. I was traveling alone this vacation, so perhaps I notice more than usual, but it was all good. Let's start with the staff. So courteous and helpful you would have thought their managers were standing behind them at all times. They were at the ready with a welcoming smile and eagerness to find solutions to whatever your situation might be. Roy was at the front desk when I checked in, he was a pleasure to deal with, and had a wealth of information on the hotel itself, as well as surrounding area, and what to do for fun. Next I met Jackie on the housekeeping staff. She came by every day like clockwork, and was happy to give me the \"extras\" I requested like a few extra garbage bags, or extra towels. Finally I met Yana at the front desk. When the clasp on my bathing suit broke, Yana scurried around until she found a sewing kit so I could make the repair. I made a point to ask for the General Manager, Luis, so I could commend him on the way that both the hotel AND his staff were exceeding my expectations. Also worth notable mention was the gift shop. I met Dave there, who walked me through an entire new outfit... head to toe... literally. From my new sunglasses all they way down to my new flip flops, and a few items in between... all for a total AFTER taxes of less than $90! I couldn't have gotten that much for that little in my local mall! The food and service were also above expectation at the tiki bar, and at the grill by the pool. The couple that runs those two places are both so outgoing, they put me completely at ease, and had me so engaged in conversation with them and others there, I actually forgot I was vacationing alone. This hotel is older, yes, but it was clean, and they did their absolute best to make sure I had a nice stay. They are undergoing some renovations, which are noticeable, but also commendable. I look forward to seeing what improvements have been made by my next visit. While I was there I saw balcony replacements beginning, and stacks of new mattresses arriving. It\u2019s nice to know that they're on top of things. In closing, please see for yourself the room I stayed in, unit 119. I've attached a link to the video I took when I first arrived.

After driving 700 miles, I walk in the lobby and was informed I had a balance of $15.75, of course I had the paperwork indicating I paid for 6 days in advance and paid what I was told to pay.

The second thing was the loud DJ music coming from the pool. It was so loud, we thought maybe the balcony door wasn't closed. That's when we discovered the door didn't really close properly. The oceanfront unit we rented, as with most of the units, looks first out at the very crowded pool, then past the hut where the DJ had his amps blasting back at the rooms, and then in the distance, a bit of ocean. To top it off, the building is curved such that the neighbors on either side can go out on their balconies and look into our room. In order to gain some privacy, we had to close the drapes thus negating the bit of ocean view and darkening the already very drab room. One of the beds was what I call a canoe bed. High on the sides and low in the middle making it impossible for two people to sleep comfortably unless you wanted to sleep in constant embrace. What we didn't realize is that because the rooms are privately owned, each one is different so experiences could vary greatly. However, some of these complaints would apply no matter how nice the room. We had reserved for 2 nights, but the receptionist graciously let us out of our 2nd night's stay.

We weren't told that to get to the 5th floor there were different elevators. we got on one and realized it only went to the 4th floor. After we reached the 4th floor we left the elevator to find ourselves roaming around the floor trying to find the way to the 5th floor. Once we finally found our room, we went in ti find the room nicely decorated, but that was about it for the nice things. We had a room with a king bed and 2 futons. The king bed was pretty much like sleeping on the springs covered with fabric. The futons were like they had been used to death. The cushions on them were flat and one of them was broken completely on one end. Needless to say it was very awkward to sleep on until someone finally showed up to fix it. There was never fresh towels brought to our room. If we wanted them we had to go get them every time and then most of the time they wouldn't even have any. We ended up having to use our beach towels we brought. In the bathroom shower you could only turn on the hot water and if you turned on any cold at all it would all be freezing cold. We had a small kitchenette and all of the glasses in the cabinet were pretty severely cracked and not really usable. The pools were all pretty nasty and the indoor heated pool was not even indoors. It was only covered and the only way to access it was by going outside. The sliding door that went out to our patio wouldn't slide and all of the blinds were either missing or broken. The patios are not private at all and very unclean. There was pigeon pooh everywhere. This hotel is what you might call a party hotel.

After a 3 hour drive, we went up to our room which had HOLES ON THE WALLS. The headboard was pulled off the wall, the \"artwork\" had a crack down the middle of the glass, telephone was cracked, furniture was scuffed. I called service desk and Raoul (who is outstanding!) moved us into a different room. We waited and finally made it into the upgraded room an hour later. We were exhausted and lost vacation time during this shifting process! When you're taking care of a 16 month old, you have a schedule to maintain and this was completely ridiculous! After we finally get settled in the new room, I spotted what appeared to be \"2\" sauce stains on the comforter. DISGUSTING! So, of course I had to check the rest of the filth, and found what appeared to be VOMIT or DRIED FOOD SMEARED on the fitted sheet!!!!! Raoul again provided sheets, he did not have the key to the closet so he provided queen size sheets to a KING size. So, we had to use the flat sheet as a fitted and both my husband and I had to cover ourselves with the fitted sheet!!!!! And of course, by the time we went to bed after showering, etc. the \"KIDS\" were back and LOUDLY YELLING & TALKING - EXTREMELY LOUDLY as they paraded down the halls. Sleepless night one down the drain, we each got 3 or 4 hours sleep. The next day, went down to see what other lovely room we were going to be stuck to, and the place was crawling with cops and the \"KIDS.\" Patiently we waited, only to be told he would give us a room in about 20 minutes. Loved the fact that the gossping about the mayhem caused by these criminals was more important then taking care of the other \"guests\" as if they were the only exclusive guests. Which, by the way OUR MONEY IS JUST AS GOOD and WE DON'T DESTROY YOUR PLACE OF BUSINESS. We had plans for 10 o'clock so had no time to waste, walked back down because of course no one called, and he did not have an answer and wanted us to continue waiting!!! We said no have plans, and he said when we come back he would have something. We returned about 12:30 no rooms available yet so he would call when a room was ready. An hour went by, no call so THREE HOURS LATER we returned and stood at the counter, he saw us did not acknowledge us then disappeared and after a few minutes said he had a room. So, 3 HOURS of lost vacation finally went to the new room, after about an hour later after getting settled WE STARTED OUR VACATION! After a stressful first night and day we turned in. I was woken at THREE A.M. to a man SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS!! \"whoo-hooing\" and saying \"YEAH HAWAIIAN INN\" Obviously doing it on purpose! For a long time, extremely loud! Next my husband, then my mom, then my daughter woke up! I was furious!! Afraid for our life - because who the hell can trust a drunk individual, let alone a bunch of them - none of us wanted to go down to the service desk for risk of getting murdered or raped or whatever and we highly doubted a phone call would resolve anything. We heard them continuously throughout the night we were \"lucky\" our room was right by the elevator. About an hour later, we started smelling cigarette smoke seeping in through the vent in the bathroom. We opened all the doors to circulate some air in there the whole ordeal cost us yet another sleepless night. Raoul was the best thing out the whole experience. Sad, my husband has stayed there since he was young, and we visited several years before and loved it, thus the reason we went back. NEVER AGAIN. The place is a dive, filthy, filthy, never again we'll we return and will not recommend it to anyone, and we know lots of people.

My hubby and I had plans to go to the race in Daytona, so made our reservations well in advance, knowing the city's hotels would be full. The weather was awful (this becomes important when it comes to our room); rainy, cold (39 degrees!) and winds topping 50 mph. We were assigned to room 232. Upon traveling down the windy hallways to our room, we found moldy mattresses, trash and old curtains in the hallway. Strange and gross, but we decided to press further to our room. There, the curtains and curtain rod were lying on the bed. We had an ocean view room (which was beautiful even in horrible weather), so curtains would have been nice. The molding on the wall was pulled away to reveal substantial water damage. The sliding glass door, which appeared to be brand new, given the stickers, would not close, so the wind just howled through the room. The TV was unplugged, cable not connected, no lamps were plugged in, no lightbulbs in lamps. Not one single ice machine on 5 floors worked. Awful. We immediately called down and requested a different room. Of course, they were full, as was every other hotel, so we couldn't be moved. We were stuck like Chuck. We decided to make the best of it and went out for the night. Upon our return, around 11:00, the lights would only turn on dimly. It seemed we had minimal power. We decided to take showers when we realized there was no shower curtain. Deciding we didn't care, tried to take them anyway until the cold water tap fell off and could not be made to go back on. A quick hot shower, for sure. About an hour after we went to sleep in the brightly lit, curtainless room, the heater shut off. My hubby got up to see what was wrong with it but alas, could not turn a light on because there was NO power. None...nada. The night slowly but surely passed.

However, if you are looking for clean, simple and you are not going to spend a great deal of time in the room the Hawaiian Inn is fine. When we arrived (knowing what I read) I initially requested a room that had recently been remodeled and away from the construction. The staff was friendly and gave us the opportunity to look at the room prior to accepting it, which we did. There were a few things wrong which we discovered later but it wasnt enough to raise any red flags. The room had been remodeled with new flooring, bathroom tile, new sliding glass doors out to the balcony, new railing on the balcony and was freshly painted. We later discovered that the phone wasnt working (we had our cells phones) one table lamp wasnt working and the shade fell off. The furnishings were a little worn but not disgusting. The room did smell like bleach (bleach means clean to me) but dissipated after one night but I bought a candle anyways. The toilet ran if you didnt push the handle back up. None of these things we asked to be corrected during our stay but are certain the staff would have accomidated us. The decor was \"cutsy beach\"and all of the appliances were in working order and clean, including the dishes. There was construction going on which started at the other side of the hotel but moved over to our side. However, the crew did not start until after 8:00 AM and ended around 5:00 and that really didnt bother us. You can tell they are working hard to bring the hotel to better condition so you cant really expect them to close down until finished.

I can not speak for the hotel rooms sold by the hotel itself but the condo we rented from Mary Motes's web page at http://www.sandcastlebeachrentals.com was wonderful. The condo was well stocked, very clean and very nicely furnished, you can tell it belongs to someone other than the hotel and the owner takes care of it. While staying there we looked at some other condo's Sand Castle Rental offered at the Hawiian Inn and they were all very nice. It was nothing like the reviews I read on the hotel rooms. This hotel is under construction (only in the side buildings)but other than the fact that you can see them working we hardly noticed it. The pool, view and beach areas are all nice. They have a nice tiki bar and plenty of deck room by the pool. Even the food was good that we ordered at the tiki bar. The hotel is older but for the price of this condo well worth it. I would not stay in one of the hotel rooms that they offer but we will be back to rent one of these condos in the future for sure.

The hotel has had a luau in one form or another for some years. This summer a new group took over the luau with great results. The show is very engaging and family friendly with lots of audience participation. The food was good - although the initial portions were small. Fortunately, you can ask for refills of just about everything. The smoked pork and chicken were especially good but there are no vegetable sides - just rice. Having done the big luau at Disney World just a few weeks before we can honestly say that the dancers here at Daytona were just as good if fewer in number. In fact, we liked the band here at the Hawaiian Inn better than the one at Disney. Also, we laughed a lot more during this show due to the engaging host and band leader. The whole luau room and bar is decorated in vintage tiki style - it's like a throwback to a tiki lounge from the 50's or 60's complete with fake volcano in the far corner and black lighting. If you go with this theme and the kitschiness you'll have a great time - don't forget to wear your hawaiian shirt, mumu or other hawaiian-themed clothing. Our children had a fantastic time at the luau,too, and got to go up on stage twice for audience participation segments. If you don't have a hawaiian shirt the hotel has a gift shop that supplies them. If they don't have your size you can talk to the owners - they have 3 different gift shops in 3 different hotels and will be happy to run an item over from one of the other shops for you. In conclusion, we were very pleased with the luau and felt it compared very favorably with bigger productions we've been too.

We stayed in room 208. The hotel is nice looking for the most part, the pool area is very nice. Beach access is a little scary and the condo is mostly nice, very clean but not what we would consider staying in again. The condo is very small and was overfull of decorations and junk (magazines, ashtrays, plastic packaging, cleaning products, ect) stuffed behind furniture and in closets, ect, just not a place for a baby to be. I also didnt feel safe in the condo becouse the door lock was duck taped back to the door ( the lock that originally would take a card key) and the sliding glass doors didnt lock so there was a long wooded stick you were to use to jam the door shut) The problem I had with the place was the music from the pool area blaring all night long untill midnight all weekend. The condo was NOT sound proof so we could hear everything all night. Even after the weekend (which was the fourth of july ) people set off fireworks right on the pool deck up untill midnight, kids were screaming and laughing and were extremely loud. My finance went to the front desk about the issues several times and there was nothing they could do since the pool closed at midnight. My family also recieved 2 phone calls from the owner during our stay stating that the neighbors of the condo were complaining about the noise coming from our room, the tons of people in and out of the condo, the towels and bathing suits that we hung on the deck, stating that our clothes were falling onto the pool deck. The owner asked us to take down our things and put them inside since it is against the rules to have towels and bathing suits hanging from the balcony.....WHAT??? never heard of that before and all most all other condo balconies were covered in towels! DUH how else are these things going to dry out?? Anyway, this made me a nervous wreck and stressed me out since I couldnt figure out what the owner was talking about since we were gone most of the days so we were NOT noisy, we all went to bed (or at least tried to at around 9-10 every night) so we were not partying all night long, we took out towels down after the owner asked us to and there were still more complaints about it, and my family that lives in FL came to visit a couple of times but so what? We cant have visitors??? I just felt like I was being watched and being told what to do and how to do it even though I paid good money to stay there. We couldnt take it any longer so we went some where else to finish up the remainder of the vacation since we were getting married on Thursday. ( IF anyone wants to get married on the beach email me I know the perfect person to contact!). We stayed 2 nights at the AKU TIKI INN and it was FABULOUS!! Quiet, Free happy hour, a nice quiet pool, CLEAN!!! NO CRAP EVERYWHERE! NO ONE CALLING TO COMPLAIN about stuff that was not even happening.

We actually turned it off so that we could go to sleep at night, but we ended up turning it back on later on because it became too hot.

Although, full of excuses, the manager's were pretty nice as well. Perhaps, the main problem here is housekeeping and a non-enforced no smoking policy. The first room they put us in was smokey, the door to the balcony was broken, there were dead or dying roaches in the room and a possibly used giant dildo (no, this is not a joke) under the bathroom sink. Instead of calling, I went to the front desk. Again, the ladies there were very nice, called a couple of managers and moved us to a different room. They upgraded us to a two bedroom suite. Although the room itself was nicely decorated it was also quite dirty. The floors turned your feet black if you walked on them without shoes. The master bedroom was so smelly (cigarette smoke) that we couldn't even use it. Our entire family slept in the extra bedroom. Fortunately, we had our own pillows. The hotel's pillow cases had makeup on them, the sheets were covered in hair (that wasn't ours). Upon checkout the next day, I asked to see a manager. I had to wait about 10-15 minutes, when he appeared (from behind the front desk!!! I had to wait and he was there the entire time!) I showed him the yucky pillow cases, a washcloth turned black from a swipe on the dirty floor and some of the hair off the sheets. He just shrugged and said he'd let housekeeping know about it. He claimed there was nothing to do about the smoking in a non-smoking facility. I can say that I would NEVER recommend the Hawaiian Inn to anyone.

We were walk in reservations originally for two days, and needed to change rooms to extend our stay. You can read into this that we were happy enough with our first two nights that we continued our time with this hotel. I will say first that there were some definite pros and cons for this Inn to consider for the future. I will say that overall my family will probably consider this hotel again in the future, but other hotels in the nearby area might be a little more to our liking. Pros: * Two Pools (also a Kiddie Pool) - all very well maintained during our four night stay. I did like that the indoor pool had a row of bubble jet seats built in that allowed the warm water to blow out and massage those sitting in the area. I'm also a big fan of having steps leading into pools such as these pools have. * Moderately Clean Rooms. * Comfortable beds. * Simple 9 hole putt-putt course - clean * Large lounge / front desk area - apparently with accessible WiFi (I spotted a wireless N router and noticed many on their laptops in this area, but did not have mine to personally confirm). I liked that this area was spacious and provided a couple of tables to sit at and plenty of chairs/couches in a well air conditioned area. * Staff friendly and courteous. * Relatively quiet rooms - this is a major bonus after being at another Daytona hotel in a previous year that placed my family directly above a Karaoke bar. The design of this hotel made it so that even though we were near a heavily trafficked area, noise from outside wasn't that bad. * I'll include the pool deck restaurant / tiki bar and the indoor Wiki Wiki Cafe as Pros, even though I have no experience with any of this. They also offer Luau shows on Wednesday and Thursday to really add to the theme of the hotel. Cons: * A Bug - I'll start out with this since I noticed another guest posting about a bug problem. On the last day I saw a single bug in our room. It didn't appear to be a roach, but a single bug of any sort I don't see as a problem. What the guest described would be a very bad thing to discover, but it was not at all like either of our rooms. * Potential Severe Health Risks (Towel Racks in bathrooms of our rooms were in a position and level to leave you with a bad hit to the head. Even though normally I have no trouble with hotel bathrooms, I managed to almost get knocked out in the first room. In the second room I still managed to almost take a bump to the back of the head. These racks are around 5' high mounts and I am 6' tall. In the relatively cramped bathrooms of the one room 2 double bed suites, this is dangerous. The mounts make sense when you consider the massive mirrors in the bathrooms, but I'd prefer a smaller mirror and slightly less in the line of a health risk). * Pools close at sunset (outdoor) and 9 PM (indoor/heated) - I will say that the hotel basically closing off all activities at 9PM made for a quieter hotel, it also made me feel like I was living in a retirement community. Most of Daytona Beach doesn't really shut down during the Summer months until 11PM. I would really like to see the indoor pool stay open until midnight or 1AM since with doors closed it is not really a noise issue and this will still allow guests to wind down before going to bed. * Indoor heated pool was not very warm - I found the indoor pool room to have moderately warm air, but the pool itself was not very warm. Coming into the pool from the open air (it wasn't really hot during our stay) didn't leave me feeling like I was walking into warm waters. On a cooler day I went from the indoor pool to the outdoor (unheated) and back to the indoor pool. During this move I could tell a moderate difference. On a warmer day I actually heard a lot of people say the outside pool was warmer! * Potential problems with pools - I noticed that the pools seemed to not be measured right for the markings given on the outside. I particularly noticed that the indoor pool seemed about 3-6\" above the measurements. Also, 4' is the shortest marking either of the main pools gives. With the problem of pools being overfilled, this really narrows the amount of room younger children (or those unable to swim) to the steps leading into the 4' zones. * Gift shop on the moderate to expensive side - Prices in many of the shops we tried in Daytona were expensive. If you are in need of sunblock and don't want to go to a major store; sure, this is a good asset. Otherwise, I just avoided this store. I found most of the gifts I brought home at a store called the Big Shark.", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely atrocious!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "lionlover0869", "ReviewID": "UR8052897", "Content": "The morning after we checked into our condo we contacted our reservation agent, Stephanie Jones, to tell her about all the bugs (including in our bed and on MY PILLOW!), the broken doors so we couldn't enjoy the balcony, the rotting walls in the bathroom, and the rotting walls in the bedroom.

We arrived at the Hawiian Inn at 12:30 which was over 3 hours prior to check in. I ask if our condo unit was ready, and it was not. No problem, we were offered to use the pool facilities until the room was ready, which was expected by us, but you never know. First impression of front desk was neutral, the young lady was nice enough, but not what one would call really striving to make a good first impression. She explained the whole housekeeping issue. We had packed accordingly and bathing suits and towels were right at hand. The public restrooms were very run down and dirty looking, kind of like I would expect to see in a low class night club. I was prompted to yell into the mens room for my kids not to touch the floor with bare feet. The pool was fairly busy, but not so you could not get a chair or 4 in my case. The tiki bar was open and well stocked except for no bottle beer (understandably though). We ordered lunch from the little tiki shack which was still stocked with chairs stacked on one another (dont try to order a burger anything less than well done, state law????). We ate outside on picnic tables with umbrellas. The pool area was quite clean and appeared well maintained. About an hour later, the desk clerk informed us that our condo unit was ready. I do think that they need to invest in a bit of paint for the walkways, but otherwise, free of debris (until Friday night when their was broken glass on the ground infront of the elevator which WAS cleaned up immediatly) The unit was tired - very tired. The beds even looked hard. The bathroom was in sore need of a facelift. I needent have bothered bringing bubble bath. It drained slow also. Bathroom floors may have been clean, but looked dirty. Paint peeling around a/c vents, and they were pretty dusty. Old style windows and no security lock on the door did not leave us feeling totally secure. The pull out couch appeared new and in good shape, the kitchen was not well stocked (one frypan, no sauce pans, mismatched everything. The real corker was the tv, it was a 19\" remote from the early 90's (best guess). The unit was designed for 6 people, but the 4 of us were a bit cramped. The table seated 2 at best and was horribly scarred with ??? loves??? and various initials carved in it. The balcony was nice, although not private in any way, shape or form. There were two locks on this door tho and no screen. We had a beautiful view though. Again, the floors looked bad enough that I did not let my family go barefoot the entire stay To say that the front desk was uninformed is an understatement. We made reservations for the luau show and were not made to feel real good about it. We ended up getting free tickets to go, so although the food was nothing to write home about, we did not leave hungry, it was worth the time. The show was pretty good and I have to say that Tuiella (spelling) can really move. The show people were really nice (one of the dancers was the day tiki bartender) and afte chatting with them one afternoon, made sure we had the best seats in the house. We asked the front desk quite a few times where things were, and what there was to do, they were totally out of it and offred up nothing. The ironing board and iron that I ordered up to the room the day we got there remained there all week. For the most part, the building was quite quiet. We were not at all offended by any loud partying or screaming kids. That part was great. Be sure not to expect anything but the trinket shop to be open with any regularity. The tiki bar opened and closed when it felt the need to, the breakfast place was not open then entire stay, expect for what appeared to be an hour or so on Wednesday. Housekeeping was erratic - never there at the same time any one day and they tended to open the door without knocking. For the most part, they entered, changed towels, made beds (dont beleive they were changed) and picked up trash. There was not a sign that the vac was run or floors swept the entire time Because of all the renovations and demolition work going on in Daytona, and the fact that there is nothing left around the area except trinket shops and restaurants, I dont have any interest in going back there, and I am 99.9 % sure that I would not go back to the Hawaiian Inn even if I decided to go back.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jasper, GA", "Title": "\u201cOur church group loved it!\u201d", "Author": "amexblue", "ReviewID": "UR7479818", "Content": "We rented 7 rooms from Stephanie Jones of Condos in Daytona.

My boyfriend and I stayed for a long weekend in the Spring of 2006, and when we pulled up to the hotel I was dismayed at the falling apart condition of the entrance. I postponed judgment, though, thinking maybe the hotel had poorly weatherd one of the past year's hurricanes and hadn't completed all the repairs. When we went in to register I wandered around the lobby, restrooms, and peeked in on the restaurant, and realized it was not storm damage, but lack of maintenance that was contributing to the shabby appearance. I figured the hotel must be primarily geared to college students who were just looking for a place to party, swim and sleep. The elevator, hallways, and stairs were rusty and dirty. The whole place looked tacky, outdated, and grimy. But what a nice surprise when we got to our room! Bright and cheerful, clean, and comfortable! What a difference! I would definitely book Room 202 again. The only drawback we experienced was the TV in the sitting area was installed so high up in the corner of the room we had to rearrange the furniture to get close enough so we could both sit together and watch a movie at night. I loved the fact I could lounge in bed in the morning and have sunlight stream in through the window! The restaurant on site is Polynesian themed. We went elsewhere for every meal.

Said he had a kid to get off the bus that someone else would have to fix it. Wow, was that ever rude. It was his job isnt it? Let me say before we even got to the room, the elevators was a mess. There are three elevators, the first only went to the fourth floor. You had to get off that one and walk to the fifth floor. We were told about one that went to the fifith floor, which is funny because it didnt even have an up to date liscence in there, and it was only to be used for construction workers, and that is where the front staff sent us. At one point, my 7 year old almost had his body shut in the elevator door. The sensor does not work in it. And scary elevators is all I can say. As we approached our room, there were boxes all up and down the hall and a box in front of our door with a knife sitting on it from the workers. That made me feel safe with my young children. Water was out for one day, the bench out by the poool broke in half on my 155 pound husband. And that was never fixed while we were there. The tropical storm was coming through and we called front desk to find out what the weather was going to do and what we do if it turned into a hurricane, and the blonde at the front desk from russia or where ever told us they didnt sell them there at the hotel, go figure, I defintly felt safe now!!! The pool area was very nasty, cig butts, beer cans, trash. Nasty, wouldnt even let my kids swim in the indoor pool. Very unsanitary. Golf area was very dirty. Towels stolen by pool in daylight.

For starters the people at the front desk were very rude, they acted as if they didnt want to be bothered by anyone, the hotel itself was so dirty. They advertise as having this wonderful miniature golf course on site, but it was so disgusting the entire thing including the water pits were filled with dirt and sand. I never once saw anyone cleaning the pool/pool deck. I also didnt see anyone checking ph levels or chlorine. The kiddie pool looked like one big sandbox the indoor pool was so hot that as soon as you stepped inside, it took your breathe away, and under the benches in there I saw caked on dirt and sludge that looked like it had been there for 6 months or more. One night there was a homeless man taking a bath in the indoor pool at around 3:30 a.m. and hotel security let him sleep on top of the tiki bar by the pool. My husband and I were in the main pool when he found a bar of soap, ( probably from all of the homeless people bathing there) and floating right next to our 11 month old was a used band-aid and ciggarette butts/tobacco. Ok and now about our room.... when we walked in, the entire room smelled musty. We had the suite and the hide a bed was broken, and the mini bar was unplugged. The air conditioning didnt work and i heard of a lot of people complaining of the same thing. In the bathroom the tub was so yellow and the paint on the door was chipping and falling off into the floor. Oh and my favorite... WE HAD NO BATTERIES IN OUR SMOKE DETECTORS!!! After 5 attempts to get the front desk to get maintainence up there I finally called the fire dept.!! Our smoke detectors were fixed within 5 mins. after the fire dept. arrived. There was no water pressure in the kitchen, I called the front desk and they sent someone up to fix it, ( this was at noon) he said he had to go and get his wrench, and I never saw him again! So at 8:00 p.m. I told them to fix it or I was on my way downstairs with all of our dirty dishes and they can wash them! It was fixed within the hour. One of our days was spent with no running water in the entire hotel because a pipe busted in the boiler room. There were 2children shocked by outlets in the hotel. and we lost power in half of our suite for about 3 hrs one day.

I reported this to the desk and they said they knew and would be cleaning them up. 4 hrs later the patties were cleaned up, but not all, later that night there was still one near the gate leading to the pool area. Elevator was broken most days but we used the stairs anyways, only 2nd floor. All in all the room was great, the weather was great and the kids loved it.

Part of the group arrived before me so I told them to go ahead and see if they would be able to check in both rooms without me there. They were able to do so, but someone had to give the front desk their credit card first. In one room, the lock on the entry door did not work, so they had to sleep with the room more or less wide open. They called maintenance about it but it was never fixed properly. The room itself was nice with tile flooring in the living area and a mirrored wall to make the room appear larger. Their air conditioner did not work at first, but was eventually repaired. The second room was a bit older looking with stains on the carpet. The fold out bed collapses under normal body weight so you'd be sleeping at an angle. We slept on the floor instead. The air conditioner never worked. At one point during our second day there, a maintenance man simply walked right into our room and into our bathroom without knocking, notifying us he was here and why, or saying a word to us period. When it came time to check out, myself and the individual who had checked in with their credit card went to the desk to check out. We both handed over our credit cards and signed our respective receipts. The next day I noticed I had two charges on my card. The other person had no charge. I called and spoke with someone in their accounting department who did little to explain to me what was going on. I was to wait up to five business days - there would be a refund. At this time, the other person's card had not yet been charged. Two days later I notice that there is not only a refund on my card, but now a third charge. They had charged me to hold the room, refunded my money, charged me for my room, and then charged me again! To make a long story short, the other person's card currently has a refund, but no charge. The person in the accounding department said that in order to get this corrected (one charge on each card), they asked for signed faxed pages and copies of both of our credit cards, front and back. Are you kidding me? They have already proven they cannot handle simple charges to credit cards.. why would I provide them with how my name appears on my card, my number, the expiration date, and the security code on the back?

This was a penthouse unit and at first glance it appeared to be well kept and in good shape. We had a unit on the very north end of the complex with a port hole window which allowed in the heat from the day and the lights all night long in since their were no drapes or blinds on the windows. The worst part of it all was the A/C didnt even work in this room. It was cold in the rest of the condo but no air would blow out of the vent in this room. We attmepted to watch TV in the living room area only to find that their was no cable. We called the Maintenance guy who took care of this unit for the private owner told him of the problem. He told us last week the tv in the bedroom didnt work and I was lucky it worked this week. He said he would have the tv fixed by the next day which was saturday. Well on monday when we checked out the tv still was not fixed. Later that night my wife and I sat on the couch in the living area only to be greeted by a silver fish crawling out of the couch. We then decided we would sit on the balcony instead. When we went out the door we were greeted by the noxious smell of tar from the taring maching located right under our balcony. The person who rented us this unit nor the owner told us about this nor even brought up that the complex was undergoing repairs. Their was tar all over the balcony and it stuck to our feet, clothes and anything else it touched. We could not even enjoy our balcony the whole memorial day weekend because the smell made us sick to our stomachs. When we came back inside from the balcony we were greeted by yet another critter. A roach this time crawling across the carpet. We killed it also and thought it might have come in when we had the door open to the balcony. After a shower my wife went to the kitchen and was greeted by a huge roach crawling across the kitchen floor. At this point she had a fit.....right before bed she got up to use the restroom and had to kill 5 more roaches in between the bedroom and bathroom hallway. We killed 7 roaches and one silver fish the first night. By this point we were disgusted with this unit. On saturday we got up and washed a pan to cook breakfast in. Washed it first then took some plates out of the cabinets to wash to eat off of. Well we found out why their were roaches in this place! The plates still had food on them where they had not been washed from the previous people who used them and the owner nor her maintenance man bothered to check. We immediately called the owners maintenance man AGAIN! Twice and it had not even been 24 hours yet. Told him of the roach infestation, dirty dishes and reminded him about the tv. He did manage to have someone come and spray....the only downfall to that was we had to clean up dead roaches in the units all weekend during our stay. Other then get the room sprayed the so called maintenance man did nothing to fix the problems with the other complaints that we had. I have tried to contact the owner of unit 505 and she refuses to respond to emails and nor does the lady who handles the booking of over 200 units for this area. My advice is to stay away from this complex. It is very old, run down and not taken care of at all.

The balcony was furnished nicely and looked over the pool area and directly on to the beach. My children loved the both pools (very cleaned) and the arcade area.

All the pools were clean and clear.The minigolf course was a wreck and not worth using as was the shuttle board equipment.Plenty of chairs are provided for ocean and pool side lounging.A laundry room is also available for fools like me who dont pack enough clothes. At one time this hotel must have been spectacular with all the palm trees and bamboo furniture but 35 years or so of operation with little maintance has taken quite a bit of the grandeur of this place away.

My husband and I were looking for a nice, peaceful place to relax and enjoy the Florida sun. Let me just say-the photos and descriptions on the website are NOT even REMOTELY accurate. This is a depressing and dirty hotel. As soon as we entered the lobby, I knew we had made a mistake. An exhausted woman at the front desk was fielding phone calls and trying to assist a LONG line of wet, sandy, hot and irritated guests. There seemed to be no airconditioning-just an ancient ceiling fan that wasn't doing the trick! When we finally were helped-we asked to see the room first-before checking in- and Thank God! First we squished down a depressing mustard-yellow hallway, on a filthy carpet, soaked with at least an inch of water! The room was depressing and shabby, reeked of smoke and when we pulled back the grimy curtains to see our \"balcony\" we found a grubby patio right on the miniature golf course-with several players practically on top of us! We were very disappointed and there was no way we were going to stay there! The woman at the front desk was very nice when I explained it just wasn't what we were looking for, and did not charge us for cancelling at the last minute. But the saga did not end there; we had a hellava time finding a decent place to stay in Daytona Beach! We are not snobs, and a simple room is always fine, but CLEAN is mandatory. I've been reading some of the other comments here about Daytona Beach Hotels and I would have to say: \"Beware!\" The hotels are cheap, for a good reason. We looked at many other hotel rooms and found the same things described on this website-bugs, dirt, sandy and wet elevators, hallways smelling of urine, grimy curtains and bedspreads etc. We eventually stayed at the Hilton which was expensive, but spotless and comfortable, with a gorgeous balcony right on the beach.

It was decorated cute; it was stocked adequately with more than what we even needed or used, and everything was in good working order. There was no screen door to the balcony, but we did not find that to be a major problem. The view was really nice. The only thing I can think of that we might have been able to use would have been some sort of drying rack for the towels since we did not have the benefit of receiving fresh towels everyday. There is access to washers and dryers, however. It is true that the hallways could use a little sprucing up, but for the most part the place has a nice atmosphere with the Hawaiian theme, and the grounds seem to be very well kept.

We waited 30 minutes for an extra pillow then called again and they finally brought it after another 15 minutes. The closet door was off of the hinge when we came in and had to have some on come in and fix it. When we went to check out the worker made us pay for 5 nights when we only stayed 4. We had already paid 90 dollars through Expedia for one night and she said it was there charge. We were, needless to say, less than pleased. Just a warning...and we won't be going back!", "Date": "March 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cLovEd It\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1683001", "Content": "IT was great...

I go through Hawaiian208 because she knows which are the cleanest and best units, and her rates are usually $100 less than the front desk rates. Her unit is the best in the house, as she has triple amenities compared to other units! There's a Playstation for kids, a metal detector to use on the beach (we found keys, money, and costume jewelery), vcr, cd player, kitchen island, and every appliance imaginable...even a Foreman grill!I would never book through the front desk again. We had one unit in which the couch smelled like vomit! I was so happy to have met this lady, I didn't know what to do.

With so many hotels and horror stories it was hard to decide what was good and what wasn't. We stayed at the Hawaiian Inn Aug 1 -Aug 10,2003 and we thought it was very nice. We are in our early 30's with 3 children. When we first go to our room we noticed the door was broke and rusty and it wouldn't lock. We talked to the front desk with in a 1/2 hr maintenance man was there to fix it. My husband had already fixed it (it was off the track). He was very nice and willing to fix anything else if need be. The lobby smells a little musty. Out side that we had a great time. The pool was clean and the deck around it was clean and spacious. The carpet in the room looked and felt like new. Our maid was wonderful! She cleaned our room everyday, ran sweeper,changed a comforter when asked. No it is not a luxury hotel, but it was clean (which is the most important thing to me), friendly, in need of some minor repairs, but what hotel doesn't. Pool side band was great too.

We had a great time. I do have a few tips. There isn't enough chairs by the pool so you have to get up at 7am to save a chair. Bring extra towels. Most of the chairs are dirty on the back or broken. The hotel doesn't provide coffee,tea bags,shampoo nor conditioner. And if you arrive early dont plan on checking in until 3pm. This summer is a busy time for them. In certain rooms the kitchen is in your bedroom. I guess you can have breakfast in bed without getting up. The view is excellent, staff is nice, and the rooms are clean.

{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bargain accommodation This is an older place, and the decor is a bit tired. That being said, the price is great, and the location is also. It is situated at the Fort DeRussey end of Waikiki, right on Kalakaua Ave. It's about 1-1/2 blocks to the beach, an easy walk to most things on Waikiki, and the bus stop is right out the back entrance. There are no telephones, so it's wise to bring a cell phone that has a plan that will cover the area, and any calls you may need to make to your home. You will have a small kitchenette, so that can be a further saving, and the bus will take you to either the Food Pantry on Kuhio or Foodland at Ala Moana Shopping Center. There are coin operated washers/dryers, and also a pool and sundeck in a small courtyard. Many of the guests are older, and have been coming to this same place for years. The only other difference between this and most hotels is that there is no housekeeping, so you clean up after yourself, and return the room as you found it: clean sheets, towels, fridge, etc. We would go back again... and probably will.", "Date": "Mar 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR148346920", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Myntrav"}, {"Content": "Best value in Waikiki My husband and I travelled to Waikiki in March. We found this place after much searching on the internet. It was hundreds of dollars cheaper than anywhere else we could find. The units have kitchenettes(everything you need while on holiday, since you probably won't be cooking elaborate meals), and while they're a bit old, they're certainly clean.We could have paid a lot more for another hotel, and not really had abetter room. As for the sketchy area from another review, we had noproblems at all, and were out late many nights. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to spend most of their budget on a room you're hardly ever in anyway.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR188665954", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "georgiegirloz"}, {"Content": "Sketchy...

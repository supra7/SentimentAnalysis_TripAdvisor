I walked past my room because the number was missing. I had to ask housekeeping where my room was. I entered and thought the room was a smoking room because it stunk so bad of cigarette smoke and musk. I think they turned a smoking room into a non-smoking room. I bought a can of Febreeze but that did no justice. The dial on the shower was misleading and I had to turn it to \"C\" for hot and \"H\" for cold. The TV channel selection was horrible unless you watch 5 versions of ESPN. The air conditioner barely worked and I sweated through the night no matter how low or high I went with the air conditioner settings. The bed was so hard. My back ached the entire stay. I did not sleep under the sheets or covers, I requested an additional blanket to cover me while I laid on top of the covers. The light fixture was hanging off the wall. I had a real, real noisy neighbor. Her 18 month old cried every morning from 7-9am. They gave me a $15 discount but I will NEVER go back even with a coupon!

Well, the hotel really isn't that bad! I didn't have any of the problems that people have listed here. First of all, the staff had absolutely no difficulty with checking in someone who had prepaid. I was in my room within minutes. The room was at least average, possibily even above average. The size was nice, with an efficiency kitchen (including a full refrigerator). The room was quite clean and had no odor whatsoever. And there were no stains on the carpet. Everything looked reasonably new. Look, if I were judging this as a five-star hotel, I might have to raise some complaints. There were little cracks in the sink by the drain. There was a small area of chipped paint on the wall in the bathroom. The TV is small, maybe about 21 inches. But that's all I'd have to gripe about. This place doesn't pretend to be a five-star hotel (and doesn't charge like one, either). For what it is, it's at least acceptable.

I booked two rooms for my family and friends. We checked in to find one of the rooms (on the 4th floor - they did not look renovated; another reviewer said there was a renovation going on) to find it horribly dirty with cigarette ashes, burned matches and food debris all over; the refrigerator was filthy. We were told there were no other rooms available and that someone would clean it. It didn't help much but we agreed to stay there since we had no choice. The hallways were horribly dirty and the carpets were stained. The bedding had holes and cigarette burns in it. One of the beds didn't have a dust ruffle on it and the box spring was disgustingly grungy. The carpets in the rooms were stained and gross. The windows either did not open or were broken on their tracks. We opened one and had to use a book to prop it open. There were very minimal dishes and utensils (dirty anyway) and no dish soap, no dishwasher. The bathroom was very tiny and run down. But, everything in the area was sold out so we went to our event. We returned late at night (there is no one at the desk from 11 pm till 6 am) and within a few minutes my friend saw 2 cockroaches crawling on the dresser near her items! ewww. We totally freaked out (well, one person didn't) and decided we couldn't stay ... we tried calling around but no one had a room! We finally found a room a few miles away at a Quality Inn which by now looked like the Taj Mahal to us. We had to drag children out late at night in order to switch hotels. I have traveled extensively and on a very low budget when I was younger and I have never been in a *chain* hotel that was this bad...it is hard to believe it is part of a chain, really. I did get our money refunded with ease by calling the property the next day , but really, just stay away no matter what. We paid $105 or so a night, by the way.

I am not sure what good the security guard does, since one time while I was here the laundry room was broken into and vandalized, but overall it seems to be a quiet location. I never had a problem with any of the staff, and it is convenient to the airport, and highways. Once you figure out how to navigate around Philadelphia, you can find restaurants and shopping areas, on your own.

Down side: Thin walls, thin bed (though relatively comfortable nd they'll give you extra pillows), plain decor, housekeeping only every third day.

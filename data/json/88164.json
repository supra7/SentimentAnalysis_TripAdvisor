I think the only \"five\" I could give this hotel has to do with service. This is not a bad hotel, but there is nothing great about it. It is probably my least favorite hotel in the immediate downtown Indianapolis-area. Yes, I understand that this hotel is a historic building. My issue is that \u201chistoric\u201d is not an excuse to allow a hotel to look worn and shabby. Both the Omni Severin and Canterbury nearby are old, yet (even with actual small rooms) the places have been recently remodeled. With Indianapolis hosting the Super Bowl one would think all of the hotels would step it up a notch, not the Crowne Plaza! The staff at this hotel is great. The valets, front desk staff, and the older man offering assistance from a podium by the front door could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Location wise, while this hotel is a bit further south than some others, it is convenient coming from the south. Since the hotel is located as far south as it is, you do not really deal with the congestion and one-way street issues encountered at other hotels. (Just drive up Illinois and take a left immediately after you emerge from under the viaduct.) I liked the location because of the proximity to Circle Centre Mall, Pan Am Plaza, restaurants, and the highway. It was easy enough to walk to Monument Circle from this hotel for our group. Sure, there are hotels closer to everything, but there are worse \u201cdowntown\u201d locations, too (by the canal, up by IUPUI, way east- all of these are considered downtown but are not as close to the action). We used the valet service to park our car, but self-parking at Pan Am Plaza was just north of the hotel. (I was not really fond of the hotel not having its own self-parking, but since the location is what/where it is, that is how it works. The cost at Pan Am plaza varies based on events happening downtown, which is not necessarily at issue at hotels with their own parking.) We stayed in a \u201cnormal\u201d room (#277), not a train car room. The room itself is the usual size and overlooks the pool. It has a normal-sized bathroom, two double beds (no way queens would fit unfortunately), a small table to hold a suitcase, dresser with a stone top & a flat screen TV, and a small table with two chairs. I would say that our room was on par with your typical Crowne Plaza/Holiday Inn room size, amenity, and set-up wise. You can tell this is not an older hotel, just an old building converted into a hotel (no tiny bathroom, tiny rooms, etc.; as you will find nearby). I thought the bed was comfortable. I also appreciated that it was double sheeted. The reason I give this hotel poor marks is because of obvious issues: First: This hotel needs to be remodeled. If the owners/management company is not prepared to do that, then it at least needs a good cleaning and sprucing up. Sorry but I find caving in tub surround tiles, rusty drips, peeling wallpaper, gunk around the bathroom door stop, dirty windows, stained dust ruffles, broken switch plate covers, etc. unacceptable. It just tells me that with some TLC this hotel could be great. Instead, it\u2019s not. I would not put this on a level with hotels that are dirty, but it is not really that clean either. Second: This hotel needs some soundproof windows. I needed to keep the fan to the climate control system running to drown out some of the sounds around the pool. I can not imagine what rooms on the first floor are like. On the second floor, we constantly heard people around the pool. There are things that can be done with windows to lessen the sound transmission. Unless you stay up late and wake up early, I guess try to avoid any of the rooms that overlook the pool. Third: I could hear everything in the rooms above and next to ours (on the bed side of the room). All morning I heard the people upstairs talking, their kid running around, toys pushed across the floor, laughing, etc. At night and the next morning, I could hear the people next door. In the bed closest to the bathroom, I could hear our neighbor in the bathroom. Not cool. The problem is, I do not think that thin walls & floors/ceilings are fixable in a remodel. Fourth: The bathroom is at the level of an old Holiday Inn. Peeling and ill-fitting wallpaper, plastic counter top, tile walls around the tub caving in, etc. Totally fixable. Actually, with some serious cleaning, tolerable. Instead, barely clean but not competitive with other hotels downtown. IF this hotel is remodeled I MIGHT stay here again. Otherwise, I will probably avoid it. For $25/night more, we could/should have stayed at the Marriott. It is a bit further west, but it is a much nicer hotel. If I could get this hotel really cheap after a remodel, I might just bring earplugs and try to deal with it. Nevertheless, probably not. If this hotel was not priced similarly to other, nicer, more recently remodeled hotels, I might say the value is better. There is not enough that is redeeming about this hotel to make me want to stay there again. I would not recommend this hotel to friends staying downtown either; I would direct them just about anywhere else.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trenton, Michigan, United States", "Title": "\u201cAverage at best\u201d", "Author": "Kim S", "ReviewID": "UR123467805", "Content": "We stayed for two nights due to our sons hockey tournament downtown.

If you're going to pay for valet it should be a covered area after all it's 27 per day.

The hotel is located in an old railway station, pretty close to the working rail line. You either love this hotel or hate it.

Only a few rooms at the side of the hotel have windows to the outside world. The hotel is well maintained. The crew is very polite, friendly and helpful. However, if you want to communicate with some maids, knowledge of Spanish would significantly help. There is a swimming pool there and also a very decent exercise room. The major issue with this hotel is the rumbling noise of trains coming through the \"live\" train line in the night. It is really a six o'clock alarm every morning. The bad news is that you cannot switch it off. If you cannot stand this alarm, ask that your room be located in the part of the hotel which is over the reception, and not the one which close to the railway. I slept on both sides of the hotel and the location does make a significant difference. Tip1: If you are Priority Club member, you will get a set of free tickets for drinks in the hotel bar. One per day of your stay. If you are not a member, just enrol when you check in and you will get your tickets. Tip2: The hotel was recently connected by a skywalk passage to Circle Centre Mall, through the new Convention Centre. It is a really long walk, however. You can get lost several times when searching your way. But in the case of bad weather you can make it without going outside.

Room was on the north part of the hotel and had absolutely no train noise issues. Room was perhaps in a little better shape than I remembered from my previous stay. Bed was better (my previous stay it seemed too soft for my tastes). It's worth noting that the hotel now has a skybridge to the Convention Center expansion, so you don't have to go outside to reach the Convention Center (although I did as weather was okay). Beyond that (and I don't remember if I mentioned this last review or not), it's worth noting that the hotel \"windows\" all over see the interior of the hotel. Thus, there is light coming in from them, even at night. The hotel does provide heavy curtains that do a fine job of blocking the light - but be aware of this and that you don't have any kind of view from the windows. One other point is you can save a few bucks (something like $5/night) if you self-park at the adjacent Pan-American Plaza parking, but be aware that it's a strict hourly rate; the valet rate does give you in/out privileges.

The bed went from one side of the room almost to the other. 3. Even though my train car faced the outside of the building, there was an area between the car and outside. The light and views were nothing great. If you train car is on the inside, it will overlook the hallway. 4. If you want to feel as though you are sleeping above the train station (because you are) ask for a train car on the Blue side. The Green cars are on the quiet side of the hotel.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cWe enjoyed our stay and never heard a train!\u201d", "Author": "Tamara6959", "ReviewID": "UR103702773", "Content": "Me, my husband, and 8 year-old daughter stayed in this hotel for 1 night while in Indy to visit the children's museum.

When we checked in, I had to ask about the package and the clerk said he would take care of booking the carriage for us. For some reason we had an \"upgraded\" room. Maybe because there was a big wedding and ROTC ball of some sort. Anyway, we weren't impressed with the suite. A king room would have been more cozy for one night. We went to the restaurant that is in the hotel and it was horrible. They weren't even serving in the dining room. We had to eat in the bar and the menu was so very limited as you would expect in a bar. Our food tasted like it was out of a frozen bag. There was no one else in the bar besides myself and husband and the waitress never checked on us once. She finally asked us if we wanted more tea when we were finished with our meal. So, when it was time for our \"15 minute\" carriage ride that was included in the package, we saw the desk clerk and she told us to go out front and it would be waiting for us. We waited over 15 minutes in the cold and still no carriage. The valet manager (very nice man) called the carriage company and they said no one from the hotel called them. They did end up sending a carriage and we did go for a ride and the driver was very nice and answered our questions. We loved the horse (Blue) who allowed us to pet him and was very gentle. Moving along, while we relaxed in our room, a train came through and it was somewhat muffled and we were fine with this.

The property is like many Crowne Plazas... nice but getting a little worn around the edges. But the unique facility inside a restored train station makes the place memorable. The hotel front desk and rooms are in a part of the train shed which makes a unique setting for an otherwise standard-issue Crowne Plaza. The recognizable bell-tower is actually across the street and that part of the facility is used for large receptions and events. Plaster-cast statues of train station visitors from yesteryear line the property and add some \"charm\" to the place. Most of the rooms (like mine) face hallways in the train shed while room windows face out into the atrium. Interesting is that old Pullman sleeper cars have been creatively restored into hotel suites across from the standard rooms on both sides of the hotel. While some have written about noise from trains interrupting sleep, I had a room on the opposite (north) side of the building and never heard a thing. You may want to request a room there. The exercise facility is tucked in a back-corner of the train shed near the convention center exit. It's awesome with brand new state-of-the art equipment (personal flat-screen tvs and fans on each machine) and a nice view of the downtown skyline. A few new furnishings (like flat-panel tvs in the rooms) would help modernize the facility. As long as you are not expecting new construction luxury, the rooms should fit your needs. I'm also not a fan of valet parking, and here it's mandatory for $27 a day. A valet attendant informed me that you can self-park at a garage nearby for slightly less, but it doesn't come with in-out priveleges. Overall, the valets were speedy and friendly. The attendants, however, were MIA when I returned from a late-night excursion even though they are supposed to be a 24-hour operation. Even the desk clerk couldn't find them and ultimately had to take my car key herself. The location is hard to beat. It's next door to Lucas Oil Stadium and an easy walk to any of the stores, restaurants and sites downtown.

I was in town for a two-day seminar and \"Hotwired\" a downtown hotel to avoid an hour plus drive (one-way) each day. Then added a couple of nights for a mini-vacation (joined by my family on Friday afternoon). Very happy with our stay, at least partly because of the good rate from Hotwire. The hotel was about what was expected very nice but it's not \"top-of-the-line\" fancy. Being in the old Union Station area was nice and, while we didn't get one of the Pullman suites, just seeing the cars was neat. Briefly: Pros: Location - *very* close to convention center & Lucas Oil stadium, close to all the downtown restaurants, night-life, entertainment, etc. Friendly & efficient staff; All the basics taken care of: clean, comfortable enough, everything worked (although in truth the bed was too soft for my taste, but that's personal choice); Didn't nickel & dime as many hotels in this price range do, \"business center\" allowed free internet access & printing; valet parking, while not cheap (and we didn't use it) was only a few dollars more than self-parking and included in-out privileges; Nice lobby, reasonable pool, etc. Cons: Some noise from the nearby train tracks, but nothing that bothered us (we were close, but not the closest rooms); A nearby room was noisy before we left for dinner (and we were afraid it might be an issue), but it was quiet when we got back; Location - while easily within walking distance of all the downtown stuff, it is not the most centrally located of the downtown hotels (but, still an easy walk to everything); Night \"light\" as most (all?) of the rooms overlook the lobby rather then being exterior windows, there is some ambient light (I remember noting it was later than I thought it was and then realized it was because it was still light \"outside\") - that said, they have some *very* good blackout style drapes that completely took care of this issue. Regarding an earlier review & \"party rooms.\" As I mentioned we had some noise, but it wasn't a problem. I did notice the hotel has an official \"quiet hours\" policy (I believe starting at 10:00 pm) and, while we didn't have to, I was prepared to complain to the front desk and just put the problem in their lap.

We are a family of five, but they aren't able to put a trundle bed in the Pullman car rooms because they are so narrow. So we brought along our twin-sized air mattress, and there was barely enough room on the floor for it after we pushed the chairs aside.

The pool may not be so busy on weekdays though, assuming there are more business travelers during the week. The hotel was in a nice location downtown, which was quite lively Saturday evening. We walked two blocks to eat dinner at the Old Spaghetti Factory, and it was dark when we walked back to the hotel. The area was well-lit and full of people, so we were not concerned walking there with the kids at night. This is not a luxury hotel, and much of it looked like it could use some fixing up.

A security guard checked on us and was able to turn on lights for us so we could see this beautiful place in it's glory. In the hallway part of the lobby still stood old ticket booths.

Then, once in our room, we were greeted with a gift from the hotel of a sleeping mask, linen spray and ear plugs. This was not a good sign. 1. The NOISE. Our room was on the same floor of the pullman train cars - and across the way from the ice machine. In hindsight, upon seeing the ice machine, we should have requested a new room. But we were only staying for 1 night and - how bad could it be, really? It was awful. The ice machine was either being used or in a cycling phase throughout the night - and was extraordinarily loud. Additionally, the walls are paper thin. You could hear everyone coming and going, and our neighbor's television was blasting at some point in the middle of the night. Not to mention, the housekeeping staff was chatting very loudly while cleaning other rooms. To be honest, the rumble of the trains was soothing compared to all the other noises happening around our room. 2. The ROOM: The room itself was standard. The king bed was a little hard. The TV stand was broken, but the TV itself worked just fine. The bathroom was dingy - with dirty wallpaper and the light fixture above the sink was falling down. 3. The BREAKFAST: We met my parents for breakfast at the Pullman Restaurant in the hotel. After sitting for several minutes, we had to ask for service. Then once our server arrived, we weren't sure if she would get our order correct - so we just asked for the simplest item on the menu. The food itself was OK. 4. The HOTEL STAFF: When asked how our stay was when checking out, we pointed out that it was unpleasant due to the noisy room. The man just looked at us and said \"I'm sorry to hear that.

These are nothing like the sleeping accommodations in the Pullman cars of old.

I had the occasion to stay at the Crowne Plaza when my company held its Annual Meeting there and found it to be very pleasant in other ways as well.

The service in the bar off the lobby was also excellent, despite the throngs of my thirsty colleagues who congregated there after the day's activities.

No train noise or excessive noise to speak of. Could've used the earplugs that came with the room , but werent needed. A couple computers available to use if needed in area past the lobby. Enjoyed the sofas and conversation spaces in this center area as well. We walked by the train car rooms, those looked pretty neat from the outside, but couldn't see inside of them. blinds tightly closed and too high off ground. Bedding wonderful, most all of the help were great! except one of the daytime desk helpers.....one was very dry and not helpful, but the evening help was great, as was one of the daytime gentleman. Since PRiority club members, we were allowed to use club lounge inside of gated area. simple breakfast items,egg burrito, some fruit, coffee, Orange juice,cereal,pastries, (only one morning used it) we slept in too long one morning to take advantage of it. Great location to restaurants and Circle Center Mall. Walked to nearby White River State Park, and walked trail suggested by Bellman along the river and over couple bridges. Beautiful running/walking path. A nice feature offered by this hotel is if valet/bellman are available, they will take you and pick you back up within 15 block (sometimes more) radius, so don't have to walk if don't want to. Helped when raining.....Loved the valet parking service. Never ate at the hotel, so can't comment on their food. Loved walking downtown and up Meridian to Monument Circle. WE were pleasantly surprised at INDY's beautiful old buildings/architecture/Monuments and overall \"ambiance\". EVen horse and carriage rides available and red brick streets in the center of downtown. We would stay again at the Crowne, and visit more of INdy's sites and history.

I thought it could be a little cheesy and I was a little put off by some of the reviews here, but we decided to go ahead and try it since it'd just be one night. We weren't disappointed at all! All of the staff were so friendly and helpful, especially the woman at the front desk who helped us check in. She was so warm and welcoming, and she called after we got into the room to make sure we were happy with it. We stayed in the first traincar room, which was decorated in a Charlie Chaplin theme (all of the rooms are themed by '20s movie stars, which is fun). You can tell that it's been awhile since these rooms were renovated, but hey, nothing can seem brand new forever. Everything was still in very good condition and exceptionally clean. The bed was large and very comfortable, with nice, quality bedding and lots of pillows. I was happy to see a real duvet instead of the thin, stiff, almost crunchy-feeling \"comforters\" that many (sometimes more expensive) hotels always seem to have - I HATE those. Yes, the traincar rooms are a little small, but you should kind of expect that since it's...well, a traincar. We still had plenty of room. We only once noticed a little bit of vibration from a train coming in, but it wasn't a problem. As others mentioned, they do remind you that the station is still \"active\" and they provide earplugs and a sleep CD in case the sound bothers you. We actually thought the rumbling was funny more than anything. We saw all of these things as little \"quirks\" that just enhanced the novelty of staying in a renovated train station. We had SUCH a good time there. I've already recommended it to some of my friends here.

Valet service was $24/day with in and out privileges. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was small, but clean and ok. We were advised at check-in that Union Station is still \"active\" and we may hear trains going in and out. They gave us ear plugs and a CD to listen to to rest, eye mask and a small lavender spray. I believe I may have heard a train around 11:00pm, but the sound was so faint that I can't confirm it. I would definitely return to this hotel again. I would, however, request to have a room away from the pool.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cLove the Charm-A Unique Experience\u201d", "Author": "missmuffett66", "ReviewID": "UR14858450", "Content": "After reading many reviews of this hotel, I decided I needed to post my own opinion. I stayed, on a completely booked weekend, with 4 teenage girls and the moms. We loved the hotel!! We had train car rooms and loved the experience. We were on the \"quiet side\" of the train so we didn't have the noise of the working train station. I have told many since that weekend that this was the quietest hotel room I have ever stayed in. No hallway noise, etc. since we basically had steel walls. Occasionally there was a gentle vibration from trains coming in, but nothing kept us awake. The rooms were all unique and offered a very different hotel experience. They are narrow (after all it is a train car!), but that is part of the whole experience. Don't take a train car room if you want a traditional hotel room. The front desk staff actually let us look at the rooms first before deciding! I would recommend 2 adults max per room (the beds are smallish). 4 teenagers were perfectly content with 2 double beds, but 4 moms needed 2 separate rooms. The bathrooms on the train were actually bigger than in the regular executive rooms. The hotel is conveniently located near great restaurants, Pan Am Plaza for ice skating, and Circle Center Mall for shopping. Parking was $20 overnight, which is a little pricy for Indy-we couldn't find street parking which can be tricky since there are limited hours for free parking. We will definitely use this hotel again and would recommend it to others who want something unusual.", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY", "Title": "\u201cLOUD and poorly managed\u201d", "Author": "Jaelynn_8", "ReviewID": "UR14262592", "Content": "I was very excited to stay at the Crowne Plaza Union Station in Indianapolis, but upon arrival I realized that my expectations were set a bit too high. One would think that since we were paying $140 per night, the experience would be a bit more enjoyable. The rooms were very small and a bit worn down. The furniture had been worn in places, however the bed was absolutely wonderful. We stayed on the second floor with a window facing the atrium/pool area. BIG PROBLEM here... It is so noisy because the pool is literally in the middle of all of the rooms, not to mention there was a children's cheerleading convention in town. My boyfriend and I were exhausted from traveling, and could not wait to go for a relaxing swim or have a soak in the spa. Neither of these were an option because there were literally at least 35 kids in the swimming pool, and 16 people in the spa, many under the age of 12 even though the sign posted says that anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an adult. (?) So we not only could not swim or enjoy the spa, but we also had to endure the ridiculous screaming and yelling of kids until 10 PM. NOT relaxing in the least. I called management and asked if there would be any way to have the pool stay open for adults for about 20 to 30 minutes after the kids left. I explained the situation and told him we can't even get IN the pool for one, and the noise in our room was unbearable. One gentleman I spoke with was very nice and said he would have to check on it and would call me back. No one returned my call. I called down again to follow up and spoke to Terry, who was the manager on duty. He proceeded to tell me in a rude and condescending manner that he would not be opening the pool up for people who were unable to use it during that time. Something about a contract which I understand, but I was surprised when he did not offer any solution to the problem. Apparently, this is a pretty common thing. They do provide you with ear plugs, a sleep mask and a CD, but the CD player did not even work properly. Of course, promptly at nine a.m., the cheerleaders were in the pool again, screaming and yelling. It was so loud that we called down and asked for another set of earplugs (They only gave us one initially). The concierge brought a bag of random toiletries; several packets of coffee and condiments. I did not feel ike they were being very professional whatsoever. I felt that we could have had a much nicer time somewhere else... defintely somewhere quieter! I am not a complainer, but this was terrible. However, one good thing was the hotel shuttle service. They offered to drive us a few blocks up to a blues bar and restuarant (The Slippery Noodle) because the weather was so cold. I thought that was very considerate. It was actually the only time during our stay that I felt they were trying to make our stay enjoyable. That was about it, though! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to relax, swim, or sleep in!", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but could use some housekeeping\u201d", "Author": "Indianafarmerswife", "ReviewID": "UR13492322", "Content": "The lobby is first rate, the staff pleasant, and shuttle service prompt, but our \"4-star\" room was disappointing.

He was right! The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The front desk staff is quite helpful. There is a valet for parking; usually quite quick but of course the day we are running late it took them over 20 minutes on a quiet early weekday morning to bring us our car. There are a few dining choices within the hotel - the breakfast buffet is plentiful, tasty and well maintained. We had appetizers and drinks in the hotel bar and found it clean, the staff pleasant and quite accommodating. Each time I stayed there, I stayed on a different floor. I found the main floor near the pool to be extremely noisy at all hours of the evening (horrible acoustics) but the other rooms fine. All are small, but well-laid out, very very comfortable beds, quite clean. I loved the sleep package that came with the room - a guided sleep CD, eye mask and ear plugs. The location is convenient to shopping and most Indy city attractions. The staff is helpful in providing suggestions on where to visit. When we arrived we were offered the option of free Haagen Daz ice cream or milk and cookies to be delivered to our room as a late-night snack - very fun feature. There are two computers and a printer in the elevator area on the main floor which was very convenient. Had no issues with accessing the Internet from the room. The decor is a bit odd - white plater full-sized statues of people with real leather luggage are around the lobby and there is an old traincar on display (and I believe available to sleep in).", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel but expensive parking\u201d", "Author": "pntballkrm", "ReviewID": "UR12057993", "Content": "After reading other reviews about the noise from the trains i expected the worst.......well it was far from it.

While the location is really good, easy walking distance to everything central even in 20 degree weather, the hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. The fact that it's in a train station is fun and the kids really enjoyed seeing the rooms in train cars, but it is loud throughout the night. They do give you earplugs, a CD, and a night mask, but I still couldn't sleep. Moved rooms to the third floor from the second on night two and that helped some. The windows face an open atrium in the hotel instead of outside which add extra noise. The interior is very shabby, carpet worn, bathrooms from the 80's or so, bu the beds are nice.

The hotel is directly across the street from the RCA Dome, diagonally located from the new Lucas Oil stadium ((still under construction) and just a block from the Circle City mall. It is very convenient. We stayed in an old passenger train car. We had always wanted to stay in the train cars, but now that we did, we won't do it again. The car was very long and narrow, it was only a little wider than the beds were long. Each car is named after a famous American, ours was the John Philip Sousa car so it had a patriotic theme inside. I think a nice touch would have been to have a short description of the famous American's contributions. Although the room had character, it was very worn looking. The carpets were unraveling at the edge. All the wood trim was very scuffed up and looked quite dirty. The bathroom door had stains that looked like something (coffee or soda) had spilled on the door, but was never cleaned. We have stayed in regular rooms at this hotel in the past. They were much nicer and clean. We don't regret staying in train since we've always wanted to stay there, but in the future, we'll ask for a regular room. Anyone staying at this hotel should know that it is still a functioning train station and trains do run through the building every day. We didn't really notice the trains in the regular rooms, but they seemed very loud when we stayed in the train cars.

If you are coming from the airport, use Carey Limousines. $12 each way gets you either a sedan or a limo. It was actually cheaper then a cab and definitly much nicer. The hotel itself was as expected. My king room was very large with enough room for me to get around. My room was interior, so I had a view of the indoor pool. The TV selection was nice and the shower was phenominal. The train noise that people talk about wasn't really a problem in this room, probably because it was interior. I also grew up a couple blocks away from train tracks and I still live relatively close, so I'm also pretty used to it. But what drove me nuts was the hallway noise. Doors slamming, people talking, etc. all night long. I dealt with it, but it was annoying. When I got home my wife also told me I smelled like diesel, which I thought may have been the plane, but everything in my bag had the smell too, so it was probably the hotel. No big deal though.

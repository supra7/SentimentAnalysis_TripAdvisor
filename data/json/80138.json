Personally, I found it was dated and a bit drab, which is a shame because the hotel would be so much more appealing if it were brightened up a bit. Hotel restaurant appearance was particularly unappealing and could easily pass for a cramped factory canteen, so we didn\u2019t use it. One problem with arriving late in San Diego on a weekday, is finding a meal at 9:30pm is difficult as most of the downtown restaurants said they were closing, turning away a group of 5 hungry customers.

Maggie, the manager and the front desk, in general, provided great service.When there was a shuttle snafu, she drove me to the airport herself and provided great conversation.

For us, visiting as first time tourists and not during real beach season, the location was perfect. We enjoyed walking around the farmers market in Little Italy, easy walking distance to the hotel. We also walked to the Midway, a farther but perfectly do-able walk. We did have a rental car (parking somewhat steep at $17/night but convenient to not find a lot) and the hotel had very convenient access to the I-5 highway (again, easily viewable from our hotel room, although we didn't have highway noise). Quick to the Mission Beach area, Balboa park, Del Mar, etc. We weren't on foot much in the area after dark, but the homeless folk we saw during the day didn't bother us.

The property is located off the bay and adjacent to the I-5 Freeway. As such, it is probably not the best location for walking through San Diego, but it is not so far enough from the bay and the downtown area that walking would be completely out of the question for those with hardy legs and hearts. Our room was exceedingly clean and well kept. The bed was comfortable and encouraged a good nights sleep. The carpet was fresh and new in appearance and the flat-screened TV worked great. The free WiFi connected to my laptop without a problem and stayed connected throughout the room. Our room had a king-sized bed, work desk, dresser, armchair, and a small chair-side table. The bathroom was also clean and well maintained. However, the bathroom door was a bit of an oddity. It was made of frosted glass and actually slid open and closed along the partition wall between the living area and the bathroom. While this configuration offered privacy, there were gaps at the edges of the sliding door that did indeed offer views into the living area whilst seated on the throne. Even though the sliding door fulfilled its function, it by no means created a feeling of being in a secure vault at the heart of Fort Knox ;) Some of the photos from other reviews show this feature and for this reason alone, I would think twice about returning (but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just me). The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location next to the freeway offers opportunities for some great views from the upper floors. We were on the sixth floor and could see parts of the bay, the freeway, and jets landing at the airport. I would recommend being higher than this if views are something you appreciate. Freeway noise was sufficiently managed by the windows. However, at the quietest of times, a sort of white noise could be heard from the freeway outside. The hotel has a small caf\u00c3\u00a9 off of the main lobby that is not much more than a snack bar. There are much better places to eat in San Diego, but I did use the caf\u00c3\u00a9 for getting a cup of coffee and a pastry in the mornings, which I brought back up to our room. For this reason, its presence is a plus for the establishment.

We were checked in promptly and the staff were polite and professional. We took advantage of the 'kids eat free' offerings and had breakfast daily in their little cafe. The food quality was decent and price was acceptable after factoring in their free meals as well. The complimentary shuttle was definitely a bonus and was fairly punctual on both pickup and drop which was nice as we used it quite often to get around including to Sea World as well as the Zoo. However, they are quite strict on and will not offer pickup / dropoff beyond their stated limit (1mi I believe?).

The hotel has shuttles that, when available, can take you anywhere in a 20 mile radius, this includes the airport, zoo, etc. The staff we encountered at the front desk was very hit and miss. The female staff was very pleasant to deal with. I'm afraid to say that the male staff was not up to the standards and were short and cold with their attitude. The main floor has a cafeteria, but, who wants to eat a cafeteria in a city full of interesting eateries? The rooms were very nicely decorated, modern, clean and we were very pleasantly suprised with the quality of sleep.

The breakfast cafeteria is next to the reception area and is small, they include breakfast but they give you a voucher (if I'm not wrong it was worth about US$ 15/20 per person) and if you order more then you pay for the balance. Unfortunately the cafeteria kitche doesn't have a good air circulation so all the smell goes into upper floors where the rooms are. The wifi at the hotel is free, but you have to pay for the garage if you have a car (I think it was $10/12 per day).

It worked out well for us as we walked around mostly and stayed only one night. Check in - was easy and quick. Although the lobby is kind of extremely small. Rooms - we had two queen beds and a nice choice of pillows which were labelled as soft or hard. Nice touch! It annoys me when hotels put in glass door bathrooms for the sake of style because it pretty much ensures zero privacy. I went with friends not with my partner so I did not appreciate that!! Also, while parking I noticed that the hotel overlooked an extremely busy freeway so I requested for a room that would not be on a lower floor or facing the freeway. Location - was pretty convenient; 5 min walk to the Harbor and 20 min walk to the heart of the downtown party area. The surrounding area is nothing to write home about but we felt fairly safe walking around even after dark.

My room with a comfortable king-size bed was spacious and very clean, with a pleasant neutral decor (granite sinks!). And there were numerous other small details that I appreciated: an attentive, pleasant and responsive staff, plenty of towels, a good heating and cooling system that I controlled, good quality soaps and lotions, free wireless that worked perfectly with my Samsung Netbook, and plumbing in good order (e.g., wasn't faced with standing in a non-draining shower as so often happens). From this hotel location you CAN walk directly down First Avenue to the harbor if you wish. Again, as another poster commented the area is a bit sketchy, not horrible but a lot of parking lots and a nearby Motel 6 - a bit gritty. But if you are just looking for a safe, clean, pleasant place to stay and have a car, I'd recommend it - the week I was there, the hotel was packed with families and business travelers. There is also a pool that I did not use but plenty of other people seemed to. They also have a little cafe on the ground floor where you can obtain breakfast etc. For the hotel type and location in a very expensive city, gets 5 stars from me for being clean, safe, and pleasant, and I would stay here again if I were in the area.

This was a business trip for my DH and a leisure trip for me. On arrival we were greeted by Jose who was very pleasant and knowledgeable. When we expressed concern about noise and the location of our room, he mentioned the double pane windows and that noise would not be a problem. The noise was a problem and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a light sleeper! No matter the time of day, cars were flying by and you could hear them. The hotel is also in the flight path to the airport. Take a look at my pictures. We ate at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant (First Avenue Grill) a couple times for breakfast and one dinner. Food was average, but service was always great. The restaurant had all the basics (yogurt, cold cereal, juices, coffee, tea, pastry etc.) Most of the time when we ate in, we ordered from Florencia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. An Italian restaurant that delivered. Food was tasty, arrived promptly and was hot! Our favorite restaurants were Hob Nob Hill (good food and lots of it) and Buster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at Seaport Village (definitely try the Tropical French Toast). We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really too fond of Edgewater Grill, which was a fave mentioned by a few TA members. If you want to go casual, we heartily recommend Yummy Buffet (off Rosecrans Avenue in the Loma Portal area). We happened upon it when I had to make a quick stop at a CVS Minute Clinic. Yummy used to be a Sizzler and was recently renovated. It was clean, staff were pleasant, and most of all, even picky eaters can find something on their large buffet. We ended up eating three lunches there during our 7 days in San Diego. In terms of activities beyond the basics (Zoo, Coronado, Embarcadero, etc), just hanging around the Seaport Village on a Saturday afternoon is cool, because you can people-watch and listen to the live music. Also, we recommend doing a Trolley Tour (early in your trip), and visiting Coronado for more than a few hours. We loved Balboa Park. Holiday Inn Pros - The staff are very helpful and pleasant - Good access off the Interstate - View out our window of the arriving planes was nice. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never stayed at any hotel that was as close to an airport as the Holiday Inn. - Staff were very responsive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on arrival in our room our fridge was missing in less than an hour a staff member brought it up. A bathroom issue was handled quickly and efficiently. - Free Internet that worked! Holiday Inn Cons - If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a light sleeper the freeway noise and planes arriving could be a problem. The planes depart in the other direction from the hotel. - As someone mentioned the hallway lights shine under the room door. It was a bit annoying to have all the lights off and still have light shining under the door. - Parking is pricey and sometimes (for us, most of the time) the access card did not work. Luckily we had two key cards so if one didn't work, we used the other. Inserting several times usually worked eventually. We had a rental car, so we didn't walk around the area. There are areas close to the hotel where panhandlers frequent. As Holiday Inns go, this one was not horrible. That said our hotel selection was based on corporate policy (budget), since this was partly a business trip for one of us. If this was a true leisure trip I would likely have picked someplace different. Feel free to email me with any specific questions.

The wake up call was right on time and check in and check out were very efficient! Only downside would be parking - $17 per night is a bit steep. Sat by the pool on one day and it was a nice small pool, got lots of sun and was well maintained. A gentleman from the hotel restocked towels and cleaned up the tables and chairs regularly. Suggestions of things to do: Coronado Island - stop by the Hotel Del Coronado. Also, Nice beach with street parking.

Was lucky to get picked up by the courtesy bus at the airport as I walked towards the taxi rank, this was around 22.00hrs. Was probably there to pick up flight crew as I was only 'guest' on board, but expect an advanced phone call from myself would have resulted in them meeting me anyway. Check - in was quick and efficient, although no mention of Priority Platinum membership or upgrade offer. (Something I have noticed several times with late arrivals). First impressions of room was spacious with ample storage units, lighting and decor were on the dull and dated side, but I never book a room with the thought that i'll be living in it 24hrs a day. Bath/shower was adequate, with plentiful towels. Bed was king sized and very comfortable. Good points re location were its close proximity to Little Italy - 5 mins walk down Cedar. A further 5 mins will get you to the Maritime museum at the Embarcadero and the ferry to Coranado. 10 Mins up 1st Ave / Elm St will get you to Balboa Park, with a further 20 mins from there to the Zoo. Courtesy bus runs there daily, but I didn't use it for this location. 15 mins down 1st will get you to Gaslamp Quarter, suggest you walk to Westin Hotel and cut through courtyard to 4th Ave. No issues walking back to Hotel late at night, though would suggest again you cut through to 1st ave rather than walk up 4th or 5th as a number of homeless congregate around this area. I didn't see any bother or issues, but at that time of night it it better no to take any chances. Taxi's are plentiful and about $7/$8 dollars from mid 5th Ave. If driving Hotel is convenient for access / exit from freeway's. This does present an issue with traffic noise, which is continuous during the day and most nights. If a light sleeper would be a major problem. Also very close to flightpath, although this does stop from 10.30pm - 6.30am Snack bar area was okay, with reasonable choice and cost. There are a number of local restuarants / bars in the Little Italy area which provide a good alternative. This is also location for a trolley tour stop on the city tour. Free internet access from a couple of terminals at reception. Pool area is limited, but traffic noise prevents this from being a relaxing locale. Ear phones / plugs recommended. Gym equipment was limited, about 6 machines, but good quality., Courtesy bus to Seaworld each morning at 9.30 with 5.00pm pick up. Local public transport links are very good. Bus stop for No' 30 next block down 1st Ave, $5 day ticket will take you to Pacific / Mission / La Jolla beaches and Westfield Shopping Plaza at the end of line. Also MTS trolleys from a couple of blocks past Little Italy will get you to Old Town / Tijuana for same cost.

Complimentary shuttle service that can take you to the top San Diego area destinations. The staff was very nice. Cons: The parking facility is atrocious at best with spaces designed primarily for compact or subcompact cars. The hotel's location, while relatively close to downtown San Diego, is surrounded by a major freeway and airport. As such, noise level has a tendency to be high. Very limited (and unhealthy) dining options on the property. The Holiday Inn San Diego Downtown is one of those antique circular properties that are leftover from the 50's. I've always wondered what a stay in one of these hotels would be like, and now I know. Mostly, it is cramped, and confusing to maneuver. On the bright side, this Holiday Inn has gone through a complete remodel to modernize its look and amenities. What that means is that rooms are clean, functional and have everything you'd look for in a comfortable stay. Depending on your location in the hotel, your room could have a gorgeous view of the beaches or the dizzying interchange of the I-5 freeway. I had the latter, which meant that I also had the pleasure of car/truck noises and airplane take-offs to lull me to sleep (the hotel is adjacent to the airport). Also on the plus side, the complimentary shuttle service takes you to all the downtown hot spots, as well as the San Diego Zoo and Sea World. That is a very nice service, and might convince you to forego a rental car. Now, the hotel has a restaurant on the lobby level, but it is very off-putting. In fact, the first thing you smell upon entering the lobby is the odor of fried food and old oil. That alone makes one think that ordering from the little cafe could clog your arteries in less than a heartbeat. I did, indeed, eat there and while the service was very cheery, the food was woeful. This property also has a laundry room, exercise room and a pool. However, they were so difficult to find in the labyrinthine parking structure, that you might throw in the towel before ever arriving to them. Speaking of the parking structure, this is truly one of the worst I've ever encountered. The secured gates that prevent outsiders from entering did not work the entire time I was there, so you'd have to call the help line and the gate would go up automatically. So much for the security piece. Additionally, because the property is circular, spaces are odd shaped and very narrow. I saw cars that had 2 inches between them. Definitely not an ideal location to park, and if you do, just know you might leave with a few extra dents on your car. Overall, this hotel is average, and when compared to other Holiday Inns in the area, is probably slightly lower in value for the price. For better value nearby in a comparable price range, you might consider the Holiday Inn Express San Diego Downtown, which offers a free breakfast and slightly lower room rate.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Branson, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cThe FREE shuttle was NICE!\u201d", "Author": "WhoELS", "ReviewID": "UR80775327", "Content": "The room was nice and what we expected for a Holiday Inn.

From the outside, the hotel is nicely located near the I-5 freeway for easy access, recently renovated, and property is well-kept. Easy arrival, the front desk even let us do an early check-in at 1000. There are two elevators that can get pretty busy at peak times, so we used the nearby stairs. Placed at the 6th floor 2 doubles room facing the back side of the hotel, outside noise was barely heard during the night. The beds were comfortable and clean, HDTV with HD channels a plus, desk with nightstand and chair, free wifi, coffeemaker, and very clean bathrooms are the highlights of the room. Housekeeping does a great job cleaning the rooms, and the condition of the furnishings are relatively new. Now for the downsides of the room, where there was no provided refrigerator (50 dollars/night to rent one) for perishable food, no dvd player, and the A/C unit can be quite loud when working, making sleep sometimes difficult. However, the room itself I feel is a good value for how much i paid (60/night through priceline). The onsite restaurant is small, very pricey, and we avoided eating there and went to other nearby affordable food places for meals. The food is nothing special and quite mediocre in taste. Parking is steep here which is 16/night, and spaces are narrower than average, making bigger size vehicles a bit difficult to park. The swimming pool is small and the fitness room consists of dumbbells, 1 treadmill, stairclimber, and elliptical. I used it every morning before venturing out and the equipment worked out just fine. The provided shuttle service only goes to Seaworld and San Diego Zoo for the attractions and airport and local downtown places based on availability of the driver. I didnt use this service because I had a rental car and the return flight was before 6am, which was when the shuttle service starts everyday. Laundry is at the ground level and there are only 2 washers and dryers each. Overall, polite employees and a clean room made this stay rewarding. I would stay here again if I could pay the same rate.

I know that when I think of the chain, it often comes with mixed reviews - which is precisely how I thought this stay was going to be. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. I'd drive by it a few times the last time I was in San Diego. Looking at it from the freeway it appeared a bit old and had the potential to have lots of traffic noise filter into the rooms. I was impressed to see that when we checked-in, we found ourselves in a newly renovated property with good sealing on the windows. We found this hotel on Priceline yet were given a high floor room that faced downtown. I am always happy when Priceline guests are treated the same as others - or at least, I got the feeling we were. The front desk employees were courteous and efficient, and I really enjoyed both the unique restaurant recommendations we got when we asked for help for somewhere to eat. The room itself was done up nicely - and slightly larger than normal. It was set up appropriately given the unusual circular shape of the building. Our room contained two double beds that were very comfortable, as well as the usual desk and TV unit. The one thing I did not like at all about the room was the bathroom - it had a sliding door instead of a normal one and allowed almost no privacy. My friend and I were not fond of this in the slightest. Other than that - the room was great. Location wise - this hotel is literally at the foot of the entrance to the 5 Freeway (both North and South entrances). I was concerned about noise but we never got any humming from the highway. This location is great to get anywhere in the city, but a little inconvenient if you are going downtown because you have to circle up past the freeway. Not a big deal, but you cannot turn right to go to the center of the city. The core is also walkable - but places such as the Gaslamp Quarter are not close by (maybe 20 minutes). In terms of amenities - there is free wireless in the rooms which is always greatly appreciated. We were charged $15.00 a night for parking which was a bit less than the last hotel I stayed at in San Diego. There is a pool (no jacuzzi) on the ground floor but to be honest, the cosmetic appearance of the pool area left little to be desired. There is also a small restaurant in the lobby which we didn't sample. Overall, I thought the value of this hotel was high when it came to the new rooms and items such as free internet. It'd be nice if the bathroom door was a regular locking door, and not a sliding piece of clouded glass. The location at the freeways was perfect for our trips to Coronado and MIssion Beach.

We just arrived back from a wedding on Saturday at 10:00pm and had to leave at 4am the next morning to make a 6am flight. Saturday was the same night as prom for H.S. in san diego.

The drivers were nice and made sure they explained when and where pick up times were. (Although they were late on both occasions, but I think I can hopefully put it down to traffic). I didn't feel very safe walking the streets of San Diego, but once I was back in the hotel, I felt a little more at ease.

I booked through priceline and when I checked in I was given a room on the 4th floor. I went to bed early (9:30 pm) and as I was dozing off, I noticed something crawling on the wall...it was a cockroach! I killed it and called front desk; they told me they were full but we're going to look into transferring me hotel. 45 min later I had not heard anything and by then I was so tired (having been up for almost 24h travelling). I called again and they said they found a room on the 12th floor that they were cleaning for me. I went about 20 min later and the room was a downgrade (2 double beds instead of a king I had booked and smaller) and the toilet seat was dirty! Not a very good clean-up job even if it was rushed given the circumstances. I slept poorly that night and got up at 6 am to speak with the manager regarding a possible transfer to another hotel. She told me that they have no cockroaches and the one I saw must have come from a guest's luggage !!??!! [---] She told me I could not be transferred because I had booked with priceline and the hotel would not be reimbursed! She told me she could book me another hotel if I payed for it out of my own pocket! So basically, they did not want to take a loss for something that is their fault but I should instead! What great customer service! She offered me a room upgrade and two $10 vouchers for breakfast, as if I would eat at the likely source of infestation! She never called priceline in order to sort things out; I called but it was impossible to speak to anyone (you have to email your problem and they will get back to you). Finally, I accepted the room upgrade since by then it was 8 am and I had to go to my meeting. Two days later priceline got in touch with me and dealt with the regular manager; he offered me the possibility of early check-out and being reimbursed for the 2 nights I would not be staying with them I refused because by then , my stay was 2/3 over and it was unlikely I would find a hotel with a conference in town. They did give me free parking for 3 nights. Overall, a very bad experience that ruined my stay. I had to waste so much time dealing with this stupid issue during a business trip and I feel the 'extras' that were thrown my way were insufficient. I have a phobia about cockroaches and had to constantly worry they would get in my stuff and I might bring some home; I would have to put all my things in my suitcase when I left the room. Needless to say, I will never stay there again or deal with priceline since their attitude is that if you get a deal you are stuck with it, no matter what! Another reason for frustration was that a lot of the staff at the front desk (including the female manager) are not fluent in english and did not understand everything I told them. The general manager was fluent and it made it easier dealing with him at least but he was there only on weekdays. So to wrap up: AVOID at all costs!

We were only staying 3 nights, and were working with a pretty tight budget, so we went to Hotwire to book our hotel. I had done quite a bit of research and felt pretty confident that the hotel we were selecting would turn out to be this Holiday Inn. Because I had already checked out the location, reviews, services, etc, I was OK with this choice. I did not have any overblown expectations about this being a 5 star resort. I expected a clean, safe, comfortable, quality hotel with a courteous staff. The hotel met all my expectations. The room was very clean, and well appointed with an HDTV and comfortable beds. The bathroom was very spacious with a large countertop. We did not have any problems with noise, and our A/C worked just fine. Our primary view was of downtown, and if you looked to the right you could see the harbor. The staff was always courteous and helpful. We took advantage of the shuttle service from the airport, and the shuttle driver offered to take us/pick us up from various tourist points as long as we make arraingements in time for him to work that into his airport schedule. We had the shuttle pick us up from the harbor area one afternoon, and then they provided round trip service for our Hornblower dinner cruise one night. It was very nice to not have to call and wait for a taxi. We did not eat at the cafe in the restaurant. We did not have a rental car, so we did not have to worry about/pay for parking. (I noticed a lot of compaints about parking charges. $16/nt? Get over it! Come to New Orleans and pay $30-$40/nt and then talk to me about parking! :) ) The only drawback to the hotel (for us, anyway) was the location. It would have been better for us to be a few blocks closer to the harbor for the majority of the activities we had planned. But, that was not a major issue. If we plan a return trip to the area, we may not stay here solely for this reason.

The trouble started at check in when we had explained that we were all paying in cash and that it was two of us the first night, then other two were arriving a day later respectively. They insisted that we pay the full balance right there and then as they didn't just take cash as guests arrived. Our friend who booked the room said she had spoken to the hotel and that they had said it was fine for us to do that, and then the manager on duty tried to cover it by saying that she couldn't have spoken to anyone at reception at the hotel, when my friend most certainly did! It didn't get any better either, most of the restaurant staff didn't pay attention or understand when you ordered. My friend booked the shuttle for Tuesday morning to take her to the airport over the phone and they didn't take her name or room number so when she went down, no shuttle was there for her at the time she requested. Then she was told that the driver was on lunch break (at 8.30am!!) and when he/she went to tell the manager, he was \"In the bathroom\" but they offered a taxi instead, but then the shuttle turned up anyway.

I agreed with some previous reviews about the location - this hotel is NOT really in the heart of downtown or so-called \"Gaslamp District\" but it is within a close walking distance. About two blocks away from the \"Little Italy\" area in town so it's very easy access to many restaurants and shops. AND, the premise has got a spectacular view of the San Diego Bay so it makes up all the difference (if you have a room facing the Bay) for those of you who wish to avoid all the downtown bustling and hustling. Exterior of hotel premise does look OLD and OUTDATED, but boy I was surprised when I walked into the room! Everything is new, fresh and modernized! Clea- line furnishing, big desk, LCD TV, renovated bathroom....pretty much everything you can ask for a nice business hotel - all for around $75 a day! Consider that's how much the 2-star (or even 1-star) hotels will charge you in a popular city like San Diego, you simply can not beat this price! The only drawback of the hotel is it does charge quite a bit money for guest parking on premise and you pretty much need to have a car for this location as the public transportation is not really close by. However, there is plenty of street parking around the hotel so do drive around and you will find FREE parking quite easily.

My response was, \"Whichever room is quieter!\". I wound up on the tenth floor, with the room with two queen beds. I had a commanding view of the I-5, though thankfully noise wasn't really an issue due to how high up I was. It must be said that I could also see the Balboa Park area, and had an equally commanding view of the airliners on approach to San Diego Airport! The hotel's recently been renovated, and it really shows. The room was excellent, with supremely comfortable beds. I prefer a firmer mattress than most, and these fit the bill nicely. Also a nice, big flat screen TV. Stylishly renovated bathroom, too. I rarely heard any noises from the hall. I had a couple of brief meals at the downstairs cafe, but it's pretty basic. Prices aren't bad, though. You're better off walking a few blocks either south or west to find something better. Speaking of location, it's a bit of a stretch to call this hotel \"downtown\", as quite honestly it's a good five blocks from what I'd call downtown. I should also mention what others have mentioned before - the parking charge. OK, I got a great rate 'n' all, but twelve or fourteen bucks a night for a parking space? Those are pretty much my only criticisms, as it had a bright and friendly atmosphere and overall was very comfortable. Next time I'm in San Diego I might try somewhere else - just for contrast - but I'd certainly be happy to stay here again.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSo so hotel\u201d", "Author": "LAX-PHL", "ReviewID": "UR25111400", "Content": "I think if one has high expectations of this hotel, he/she will be disappointed.

In addition, the bathrooms in each room have been totally remodeled, as the flooring has been replaced. The bedding has more of a Sheraton look and feel with white duvets and very nice selection of pillows and quality sheets. There is even a card on the bed that states that if the pillows on your bed do not satisfy you, please call and request other types that are listed on the pillow selection card. Wow, who would ever expect such an option at a Holiday Inn? The carpeting is very nice and NEW, with a double ring style pattern on a dark green background. Once again, very nice quality of carpeting. I had to keep reminding myself I was in a Holiday Inn and not a Sheraton. It really did have a Sheraton feel. Just be sure to request a high floor location for your room, as the property is located overlooking Interstate 5 of downtown. I was on the 15th floor and heard nothing from the street.. Obviously, the access to major roadways and downtown is outstanding at this property and parking, although it comes with a fee, is quite convenient in an attached garage.

It was worse than a grade school cafeteria!", "Date": "May 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newbury Park, Ca", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst nights..still remember it years later\u201d", "Author": "regalaone", "ReviewID": "UR3401475", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel one night 5 yrs ago. I still remember the night. Our party consisted of my 21 yr son, 22 yr old niece and myself. When booking the room we asked for a roll away as none of us were bedmates. We went out to dinner. Opened the rollaway around 11 pm. It stunk of smoke!!! Soon the odor filled the room. No one could any of us sleep on it. Called the front desk, they did send up another one...even smellier. Turns out (we figured this out, no one admitted this), all their help went into the room where the roll aways were stored to smoke. They obviously knew this. Even though we had gotten a no smoking room, this became a joke. We ended up putting this roll away out the door asap, and jerryrigged a rather uncomfortable sleeping arrangement. I complained in the morning but the staff could have cared less. Did absolutely nothing to try to fix the problem, either the night when I was complaining or during the morning check out process. I wrote a complaint form (the form that always seems to be in rooms these days) and to this day I've not gotten any reaction from the hotel or the chain. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels in my life, either for business or pleasure, and this was one of my most unsatisfying experiences. And the price for the room was (in 1999 $$) almost $200. Certainly NOT the place to stay in San Diego, where the choice of hotels is almost unlimited.", "Date": "April 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita", "Title": "\u201cOK, but---\u201d", "Author": "olaydt", "ReviewID": "UR2571360", "Content": "Having just come in from a cruise we were hoping the hotel had a view of the bay but all we had was a view of the freeway.

I recommend you verify with the shuttle driver as to where exactly they will pick you up. We were also able to walk to the city trolley from the hotel.

Upon arrival, I noted that the small outside balcony (for looking, not sitting) was littered with pigeon feces. How any hotel maid can leave a room in this condition for what appeared to be a considerably long period of time without cleaning it off is inexcusable. Not to mention my surprise when I turned down my bed and noted a large dark yellow baked in urine stain on my bed sheet. I've traveled for business for many years and NEVER encountered something so disgusting. To top everything off, the toilet didn't flush completely unless you held down the handle ! What are the maids thinking at this property ?...or better yet what does this tell you about what hotel management is thinking ? My concerns were expressed to management who passed along some candy and water in a small pail. Maybe they think guests won't notice these poor conditions. Nonetheless, find someplace else.

The staff were rude, ignorant, and unfriendly. The only worthwhile thing at all was the shuttle driver Troy, who went out of his way to accomodate us and make up for all the hassles that we had to deal with. The other drivers would demand large tips, and then refuse to take us after we paid them, because they had to make \"an airport run\". Or, better yet, when we called the desk for a shuttle pick-up, the staff would never be able to 'locate' the drivers, and tell us to \"just take a taxi\" all the time. Harbor View??? Give me a break. Only if California renaimed the I-5 to the Harbor freeway, because you certainly have a great view of that. If Holiday Inn called me and offered me $1000.00 a night to stay here again, there is no way on god's green earth I ever would. Especially with the Embarcadero right around the corner.

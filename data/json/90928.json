There's a big living room, dining room, bedroom with two queen beds and two - count 'em, two - bathrooms. And a full kitchen with dishwasher. It was fun wondering if visiting Chicago celebrities had stayed there back in the day. The breakfast was rolls, bagels, cereals, etc., nothing hot but that was okay.

No information that us with bad knees could get to breakfast by another elevator & not have to walk down an imperial staircase. A coffeeshop serves a complimentary breakfast. Dimly lit. Minimal contributions, badly arranged so that you have to go to three different areas to put together a bowl of cereal. (Except for Rice Crispies, everything was colored sugar cereals.)

The only staff that saves this place are the bell hops and he was able to find me a room key in 5 minutes and told me the guy at the front desk is a joke.

I mentioned that I would need my car in an hour so they left it parked conveniently in front of the building. Very thoughfult service! Check in was a breeze. This is an apartment/hotel so it had a very upscale-residential feel. The keys are old metal keys rather than key cards but the nice thing is that they also include a deadbolt key for additional security. The queen room includes a kitchenette which I didn't expect and did use. The building is old and beautiful and the rooms have a vintage feel and are not cookie-cutter Marriot or Hyatt. If that's your expectation then this might not be your place to stay. The room was spottlessly clean. My room rate included a basic continental breakfast which was appreciated. Another reason I chose this hotel is because of their restaurants. The have Mon Ami Gabi and L20. Both are high quality restaurants part of the Lettuce Entertain You chain. The down side is that these restaurants are only open for dinner. You must leave the facility for breakfast and lunch Location: just north of downtown, so it's an easy drive or taxi to Rush Street /Michigan Ave. area. Wrigley field is also nearby with all the fun bars/clubs. I also needed a late check out and it was granted without any issues or charges. It doesn't have a pool but at 23 degrees with snow, that wasn't an issue. Summary: This is a property that I would definitely return to for business or pleasure.

The hotel is in a very nice residential location. We had a one bedroom with full kitchen. Nice but dated. Most of the units are occupied with full time residents. There is a small workout room and continental breakfast. We didn't utilize either but the breakfast mainly consisted of danishes, muffins, juice and coffee. There is a laundrymat on site, but appeared to be for the residents. The hotel hosted a private party in the lobby, apparently for potential buyers for units they had offered for sale. We left and came back twice during their party and were grilled at the door each time about why we were there. Really?? I guess it didn't occur to them that they rented out some of the units to travelors and that was the only entrance for us to come back in through. It was a little annoying but not so much so that I wouldn't stay there again or refer to anyone else. They hosted a very nice Christmas breakfast complimentary to everyone staying, residents and travelors. It was delicious and everyone was very kind. Just keep in mind it's not really a hotel and has more of a primary residence kind of feel to it. Other than not being \"luggage friendly\", we really didn't have any complaints about staying here. The bus stop is not too far of a walk and takes you to Michigan ave very easily. $2.25 each time you ride unless you get some sort of pass which we did not. Make sure you have change. We took a cab a few times and that ran us anywhere from $8-$12 depending how far down Michigan ave we were. The zoo is across the street and had a light show going on for Christmas. Very nice. There are several restaurants within walking distance, honorable mentions are RJ Grunts (very affordable $7-8 sandwiches) and Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinders ($10-12 range). Starbucks is 3 blocks and an easy walk as well. We did have dinner one night in one of the hotel restaurants Mon Abi Gabi. Good food~ a little pricey.

Michigan Avenue, after all, is stuffed from curb to wall with tourists and artifice. The shopping is world-class, but it's not the real Chicago. The heart of Chicago beats, eats and sleeps in its neighborhoods. The only problem facing the savvy Chicago guests, is that there aren't many hotels in Lincoln Park! Believe me, I've stayed at them all. The the only one worth staying at is the Belden Stratford, which as far as I'm concerned is my new Lincoln Park Hotel. And it may very well be the best hotel for the price in Chicagoland. The Belden Stratford is elegant and classy, a truly gorgeous building sitting on Lincoln Park West, overlooking the park, the Lincoln Park Zoo, and The Lincoln Park Conservatory (btw--one of the most underrated attractions in Chicago). The hotel staff are friendly and personable in an honest way. They know your name, keep things light, and make sure you're taken care of. I find that more comfortable than the fake \"grateful subservience.\" The first room I settled into didn't receive a strong wireless Internet signal, which is important for my business. Tim the hotel manager personally scouted a new room for me using his phone to check signal strength! The next room was perfect. Full bars. And guess what? No surcharge. No \"resort fee.\" Wireless Internet is free. That's just how they do things at the Belden, with traditional respect for hospitality from a bygone era. You won't find yourself attempting to cleverly empty an automated fridge full of $4 candy bars and cola's without triggering the dreaded sensors, just to make room for the $1.50 Sprite you bought at the Walgreens down the street. Quite the contrary, most rooms have a mini kitchen, with a refrigerator, stove top and microwave! It's efficient for extended stay business travel, when you don't want to eat out each meal. Breakfast is one meal you don't have to worry about at the Belden. The continental breakfast is pleasant, and also free! Bagels, croissants, cereals, coffee. It's well kept, and the dining area is pleasant. What more do you need? Okay, maybe mimosas and brunch, but that's what the hotel's Mon Ami restaurant and bar is for. Mon Ami seems to be a popular destination for locals. Always a good sign. Nice patio fronting the park. The prices aren't bad either. My visit happened to coincide with the annual air show that goes on over the lake. Lucky me! The Belden Stratford hotel has a rooftop deck. I watched the show perched far above the crowds. Can't think of a better Chicago Air and Water Show Hotel, even on Michigan Ave (which is too far south to really see the full show).

The downside was lengthy: the water out of the kitchen faucet was murky and stayed that way regardless of how long it ran. The bathroom sink/tub water was fine. The kitchen and bathroom floors were very slick, even in bare feet. Dangerously so. The room air-conditioning system was lacking. Even though the exterior temperature was in the low 50s, the room was warm. We turned on the AC and even after running for 10 hours, we slept without covers. Outside the room itself, the doormen were consistently so involved in conversation amongst themselves that we often opened the doors ourselves, which is fine normally. I'm just not really sure why they were there. The continental breakfast had one employee working it on a Saturday morning. During this time, there were no plates or spoons during the 45 minutes we were attempting to eat. He was apologetic but the spoons/plates never arrived. Plastic spoons and napkins sufficed. Luxury hotel?? When we checked out, we had 6 hours until we had to catch our plane. The B-S staff graciously offered to hold our luggage there until we returned from a walking trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo.

Thankfully, he returned it to their lot when no one claimed it in a timely manner. When we returned to get our bags and the vehicle a few hours later. leave it to the bellman to give us some small measure of grief for not retrieving our vehicle upon checkout. Perhaps Barbie at the desk could have relayed said information to the guys so that they would have left the vehicle parked until we returned to leave later in the day.

The kitchen doubled as our daughter's bedroom because it had doors on it, we closed the doors and stuck her pack N play in there. The hotel provided the clean pack N play with a top and bottom sheet. The bathroom had tub and shower, but was a tight squeeze for more than 1 person in there. There is PLENTY of storage, Bed was comfortable. Clean. Directly across from the (free) Lincoln Park Zoo. We had a great view of lake Michigan. It was quiet and the hotel staff are friendly to children. The free continental breakfast was small, but adequate, considering we were eating on nervous stomachs. Check out was easy.

We stayed in Chicago for 4 nights and had booked our outher 3 nights at the Doubletree near Michigan Ave though Doubletreee was nice, no way as large or comfortable as our rooms at the Belden-Stratford. We had 2 bathrooms, living room, dinning room, fully equiped kitchen and another small room with a bed. Place was very charming and we all agree loved having all the extra space, would not stay any place else. The only problem you will need to take a cab to the center of Chicago which can run about $20, cab fair from the airport ran $30, but you can also catch a bus on the corner for a lot cheeper traveling into town. The hotel also offers free breakfast and has a lovely restaurant/sidewalk cafe. You must take a boat tour of the city, we picked up our tour at the New Trump tour. We went to the Chicago Art Institute which was wonderful, only thing would skip the 3rd floor, art on that floor was not our taste. Navy Pier is very nice, we went on a tall ship with a Pirate who told you wonderful true stories of the Pirates in Chicago. One of my favorite things was we went to a Chicago Cubs game and got to se the old stadium.

They used profanity in front of customers, cut down the reservations staff, and complained. I can give an quote example, \"This is [--], I am so sick of people today.\" The first hotel we have ever experienced were they DEMANDED the entire bill up front the second we walked in the door and lied telling us the price for the valet in/out parking service was a total of $38.00 per car. We thought, no problem, that's reasonable, until the day we checked out and were billed us close to 160 extra deciding then to say it was 40 bucks a day per car. I have never been so angry about the treatment at a place in all of my travel experience and this was my freakin wedding! Horrible. I can't believe those front desk clerks have not been fired as we were also advised by another staff member that there have been numerous complaints on their manners and their treatment of people. That's a stupid move on managements behalf because they turn away customers. My uncle and my fiance were beyond mad and they are two of the most laid back people I know. I will say on a good note and my husband wants to make sure everyone knows the bell hops and valet drivers were so nice and funny. They helped make an awful stay somewhat tolerable. Make sure if you do stay at this place to tip them well. They are great people!

We really enjoyed being outside of Downtown. Apart from the great walks in the park (including the free zoo) and on the lakeside the location encourages you to get out and visit the interesting neighbourhoods of Chicago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lincoln Park, Old Town, Lakeview, Wicker Park. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Mag.

As previously reviewers have said the public transport is excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bus route 151 is a 3 minute walk from the hotel with buses every few minutes into the centre of the City \u00e2\u20ac\u201c routes 22 and 36 also handy (take route 72 to Wicker Park). Get one of the good value CTA passes - $14 for 72 hours. Recommendations outside of the hotel. Well to start the nearby walks are great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not so much in winter I guess! Restaurants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for brunch we enjoyed the Original Pancake House (Gold Coast) and Caffe de Luca (Wicker Park). For lunch \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Heaven on 7\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Millers Pub, both in the Loop, and Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder (Lincoln Park). For dinner Bistro Margot in Old Town (half priced wine Mondays!), the Chicago Chop House for steaks (expensive) in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Near North\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Mon Ami Gabi (at the hotel). We also ate at Geja\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cafe (fondue) but over-rated in my view. The Art Institute of Chicago has a great collection worth 2 - 3 hours of your time. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe your guidebook if it says free entry Tuesdays, that finished a while ago, the $14 entry is still good value. The Architectural Society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boat tour is comparatively expensive at $28 but well worth it for the expert review of Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world class high rise buildings and general background on the city.

The price of a night's stay was more than repaid by the hotel's proximity to Lake Michigan, The Lincoln Park Zoo, and Lake Shore Dr (affording quick access to Shedd Aquarium, the museum, Soldier Field, etc.) As other reviews make clear, the furnishings in this hotel are dated, but the layout is spacious and the rooms clean. The rooms are rather like small apartments than traditional hotel rooms. (In fact, very few of the rooms in this historic multi-story building are hotel rooms -- the others are full-time apartments.) My wife and I stayed with three of our children (ages 11, 7, and 7mos) in a one-bedroom suite. We slept in the bedroom, the baby slept in a crib in the kitchenette, and the other two kids stayed on the fold out sofa in the living room. Our other child (age 9) stayed with grandparents next door on the sofa (not a fold-out). All of us were delighted with the accommodations and, especially, the location. The irony was, we had a hard time dragging our children away from \"Animal Planet\" on TV to visit the Lincoln Park Zoo across the street. Valet parking at the Belden was available for $38/day, but I chose to self-park nearby. There is a lot west of the hotel on Belden where you can self-park for $35. (Why not use the valet service for $3 more?) There are several places to eat if you head two blocks west to N Clark St. I would recommend Ranalli's on Clark (corner of Belden and N. Clark) if the weather is nice. You can sit outside on their patio and enjoy good food at a moderate price. For other miscellaneous needs, there's a 7-Eleven at Clark and Belden and a Walgreens on Clark south of Fullerton Pkwy . Breakfast at the Belden-Stratford was pretty impressive. Their free continental breakfast included milk, water, and juice (in bottles), plus Metropolis coffee (a local Chicago roaster www.metropoliscoffee.com). Bagels, muffins, and sweetbreads provided the substance. My only complaint was that it was a trifle crowded, but our family made up most of the crowd, so who's complaining : ) If you're arriving for your stay on the train into Union Station, the best way to reach the hotel is by cab or bus. The #151 bus picks up on Jackson St just outside Union Station and drops off at Lincoln Park. (Check the CTA website at www.transitchicago.com for more info.) I don't know what cab fares would run, but you can't be more than 7 miles from the hotel. At night, be sure to take a walk to the lakeshore. There's a bikeway/walkway teeming with people, and the views of the city are wonderful. Make no mistake, the Belden-Stratford is not as nice as the Omni Hotel on the Mag Mile, but they don't charge you as much as the Omni, either. If you want to walk outside your hotel and into the Mac Store or a trolley car, stay at the Omni. If you want to walk outside your hotel and into The Lincoln Park Zoo (which is FREE) or onto the lakeshore, save money and stay at the Belden.

The young, fat receptionist was rather rude but the older lady with a man's name (cannot remember the exact name) was really nice. Sorry for the odd sounding descriptions but that's the best I could do. The room was pretty basic. It had a dated kitchen but a nice bathroom. The toilet paper was in a VERY inconvenient spot-minor detail, I know, but wait till you see it too. All in all, the room was decent and clean. I only received a paper on the last day but I'm nitpicking. The bright spots? The location is great-in a very nice part of Lincoln Park just a couple blocks from Clark. Right across the street is the park and the Zoo. The staff was all very nice, save for the one. The breakfast was basically juice and assorted pastries and bagels. The atmosphere of the hotel was very calm and relaxing. There were very few young people around, even late at night. I think it's because the place is actually a condo complex with a few rooms that they rent out. I would definitely recomment this hotel for someone looking for relatively cheap lodging in the Lincoln Park area. Other than the initial problem everything else was pretty good. Granted, I'm not the pickiest traveller but it was very clean, nice atmosphere, and quiet.

My wife booked two suites and two regular rooms three months before the event and paid for the rooms in advance. When we arrived at the hotel, the receptionist told us there were no rooms available and we would have to wait for the manager to explain it to us. She then refused to speak to us until the manager appeared--which he did after 10 to 15 minutes. The manager did not explain why all our reservations had been cancelled, merely that they had been and we were being redirected to another hotel. When I demanded to know why our reservation had been cancelled, I got a long, condescending explaination that if I knew anything about travel, I would know that this sort of thing happened all the time. In fact, in more than 50 years of travel, I can't recall it happening before: having not but four paid-for rooms being cancelled. We were told the new hotel was \"a couple of blocks away.\" I asked for a map to guide me to the hotel and was told that none was available. I asked how to reach the new hotel and was told \"just drive north and you can't miss it.\" We finally found the new hotel--at least 12 blocks rather than \"A couple of blocks\" away. The hotel was decent--even charming--but it had none of the features I needed. There was no restuarant or coffee shop, no valet parking, no suites, no childrens' beds, no cot so children could sleep in the same room as their parents. Parking was in a public garage--reached from the hotel by walking down a dark alley. We found other people in this hotel that also had been sent over from the Belden-Stratford. One party was told that because of a computer error the hotel had overbooked. Another was told that a big convention needed more space than expected. One party said they had spent two nights at the Belden-Stratford and were told after breakfast that they would have to move to the new hotel by noon that day. By my estimate, upwards of 15 people either had their reservations at the Belden-Stratford cancelled or were ordered to move after they had already spent a night or more there. I found the staff of the Beldon-Stratford arrogant and unhelpful. I felt they did nothing to improve a bad situation. This was a family event that had been planned for years and our problems with the Beldron-Stratford cast a pall over everything. I feel anyone who trusts this hotel risks being badly disappointed.

We have had rooms that appeared in need of assistance (one room had a refrigerator leaking on the kitchen floor), but we have never stayed in a room that wasn't clean or safe.

Our last experience was really excellent--a lovely apartment with wood floors, and spacious windows overlooking the zoo and the lake. I think they should do something about the continental breakfast, which includes only coffee, juice, and pastries, but every single room inclues a kitchenette, so I suppose one could bring some things along.

We kept our reservation, however, and were extremely happy with the hotel. Many reviews claim disinterested staff and out-of-date rooms; we experienced the complete opposite. Our room (a suite) overlooking the Lincoln Park Zoo & Conservatory was quite modern, with no evidence of mold, peeling paint, critters, etc., that some other reviewers mentioned. It was plenty spacious and had two large TVs - bedroom and living area. One small issue: they have free wifi but this was not advertised on their website, so we did not bring a computer. The front desk staff, porters and valets were very friendly and helpful, and all seemed to enjoy their jobs. The complimentary continental breakfast each morning was decent - no cereals or toast, but plenty of scones, muffins and other pastries. We chose the Belden-Stratford mainly for its proximity to a music venue (Park West) and our favorite Chicago restaurant (Geja's). A big concern with most hotels in Chicago is the outrageous cost of parking a car each day ($32 in the case of B-S). However, there was plenty of free parking on the street in front of the hotel and across a small median in front of the Zoo & Conservatory. We discovered that this is basically where the valet will park your car anyway, so we decided to save $32 a day and do it ourselves. No biggie, and we could see our car from our room. However, this was the one big bummer of our trip, and it can more rightly be attributed to the culture of crime in Chicago than to the Belden-Stratford. When we went to depart (on a Sunday), we packed up and started our car, only to discover that some hooligan had actually crawled under our car and cut off the catalytic converter. Stunned, we learned from the valet that this is apparently not uncommon in Chicago. And though they bore no responsibility for our situation, the valet and front desk staff went to work for us right away to find a repair shop that was open on a Sunday. Where other hotel staff may have just handed us a phone book, they actually made the calls themselves and took an active interest in our plight. They succeeded in locating a shop for us and we were able to return home not sounding like a Harley-Davidson. We will definitely return to the Belden-Stratford. It is affordable, friendly, homey, and in a pretty good location (car woes notwithstanding).

The suite was very spacious by any standards. There was a dining room, large living room, laundry closet, 1 1/2 baths, bedroom and kitchen. It had a very dated feel in both finishes and furnishings. It was adequate for our needs, and priced very reasonably for the location and size of accommodations, but this is definitely a case of \"you get what you pay for\". A nice touch was the 24 hour fitness room, which was small, but well outfitted and the complimentary continental breakfast. I don't know if this is only offered on weekends, or takes place every day.

The night of our son's reception, we arrived home at the hotel at approx. 12:15 a.m. We found that there was no valet service after midnight so I went to the front desk to inquire as to who would take care of parking our van. (We paid the $32/night for parking.)The rude young man reluctantly told me that he would take care of it and asked me to at least bring our keys to the front desk. When I did so, I thanked him and in a very patronzing voice he said, \"try to be in by midnight from now on\". I informed him that we would be leaving in the morning so he wouldn't have to deal with us any longer. I also informed him that we were at our son's wedding reception and since we were the hosts, we were unable to be in by midnight. I felt as if I were being chastised by a parent for breaking curfew!

When asked if she could return in 30 mins. they replied that that wasn't possible as the maid leaves at 4 p.m. We allowed her in the room, asked her to do the minimum and please leave, as we were preparing to get ready for the wedding.

There is free Wi-fi. Our room faced the alley in the back, but at $179 a night, who cares? At the front desk, Tom was very helpful, and the day-side staff were also friendly and accomodating.

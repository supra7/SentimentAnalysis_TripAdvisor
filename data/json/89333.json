By the time we departed the next day we were already very impressed with your staff and facility (including the night doorman who proved to be very helpful when we came in from a show at Johns Hopkins at about 11:30pm) but became even more so later. When we arrived back home in Richmond on Sunday afternoon, I discovered that I had left my camera bag inclusive of ALL of my camera equipment and hundreds of pictures I had taken the previous evening, in my hotel room. It was a not too smart move on my part, and as you might imagine, caused me a great deal of immediate worry. From the moment of my first call to your hotel to report this problem, I was treated exceptionally well by every involved member of your staff. My first contact was with Michele Sipe, front desk associate, who managed the process expertly, and most importantly, with a great attitude. To the full credit of your housekeeper, once she found my bag, she quickly realized it was too important to put it in the usual \u201clost and found\u201d location and immediately brought it to Michele at the front desk personally. Her name is Jauanda Seldon. I am exceptionally grateful for her fast action. It really put my mind at ease to know that my equipment was secured so quickly. As I was driving to work on Monday morning I received a call from your head of housekeeping, Novella McCall. She explained to me how and when she was going to ship my bag back to me. She was very professional and helpful. To round things out, by the time I got to work I had an e-mail from Michele giving me the full details of the transaction including my FEDEX tracking number, and all was arranged at the most economical rate possible. (I expect delivery tomorrow at my home) If I was asked to supply you with just one word to summarize the handling of this situation by your staff, it would be WOW!!! My expectations could not have been more greatly exceeded. I have enclosed three envelopes. They contain a note and token of my appreciation for the excellent work performed by each of the employees I mentioned above. I would be greatly honored if you would distribute them in person. Thank you for running such a fine establishment. It will be one my wife and I will be sure to visit again. Warmly, Gregory D.

First off, we checked in very late, near to midnight. The check in process was quick and the valet was exceedingly helpful. Then, the problems began. As soon as we stepped into the elevator, we were hit with an overwhelming stench of marijuana. It followed us up to the third floor, and down at least 2 hallways! Horrible! When asked about it, the valet just said they should be charged a $250.00 fee for smoking in the room. ?????? Our 6 year old kept saying how bad the place smelled. We finally escape the smell down the hall our room was in, which was a relief. Had it not been so late, we'd likely have left. We enter the room. Hubby and valet unload the luggage cart, the rest of us (me, 6 year old son, 2 year old daughter) kicked off our shoes. The carpet was wet. We asked the valet about it, he said perhaps the tub overflowed. We said, what if it was the toilet that overflowed? Called the front desk, was told they had no idea about it. So, we needed another room...who knows what was on that floor and our kids would be playing on it. Off to another room. We had paid for a one bedroom suite. The new room was just a regular room. Not to mention next door to some extremely loud people, who I suspect was the source of the marijuana smell. Completely unacceptable. Off to room number 3 on the night. Same thing, not the suite we paid for. Explained to the valet that we paid for a bedroom, and we wanted a bedroom. OK, hang on, I'll be back. Off to room number 4. SAME THING! Not what we paid for. Finally call the front desk, and got the manager on duty. Upon a suggestion from my husband, he upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite at no additional cost for our trouble. We asked that it be away from the partying, and informed him of the smell in the hotel, and he just said he was aware, but there was nothing he could do. Really, nothing? He said he'd put us on the other side of the hotel. Since it was late, again, we decided to stay. New room, room number FIVE on the night, was a nice room, more than we paid for, we finally settled in and got the kids off to bed. It was a late night for all of us. 8AM our phone rings. The general manager wanted to talk about what happened the night before. So, it was after 1AM when we finally got into our room. I appreciate that he wanted to see if we were OK with everything, but you know what time we checked in....call a little later!!! I was very tired and not overly pleasant to him, I must say. Told him to call back later, but he never did. We were spending several days here, on our way to Ocean City, taking the kids to the zoo and the aquarium. Most of the staff was very helpful. Then, the night before we left, we encountered the life guard. I have never seen a life guard in a hotel before. Ever. It's an indoor pool. We go to swim and are informed that there is no swimming for half an hour due to thunder. Thunder???? What in the world does that have to do with anything, especially inside. Then she said she misspoke and meant lightning. Again, it's an indoor pool! Outside weather does not affect it. There are large doors, that are always open to the outside, but close them! Hello!! Said she was just following the rules. We called the front desk, who said it was OK to swim. Life guard still refused to allow it. Kids are getting upset. She asks us to wait 5 minutes. Whatever. Finally, we get in the pool. Life guard sits her rear down, never takes her eyes off her computer, and has ear phones in. It is lightning the entire time we are in the pool, which we do not call her attention to. She pays zero attention to any of us. The spas are behind frosted glass. If someone had an issue back there, she would never possibly know about it. I watched her the entire time we were in there and she never once looked up. We get out of the pool, and I ask her why she didn't close the pool for the lightning. She was like a deer in headlights, had no idea it was lightning, which was the reason she didn't let us swim when we first arrived. She admitted she did not know. Then went on to say she was completely uncomfortable guarding children and didn't even want us there in the first place. Umm, who needs guarding the most?? Children!!! Her job is completely unneccessary, and she just added to our overall dim view of this hotel.

In the 3rd room it was quiet enough for us to sleep but the TV was completely not operational. Breakfast the next morning was a catastrophe as well for two of us. We asked for no peppers in the 2 of the 4 omlets and no hash browns / potatoes on the side in 2 of the 4 servings. Guess what the omlets came with peppers and there were potatoes. On top of the forgetful service there was a large black hair on top of one omlet - not very appetising.

Usually you either payed the garage fees or paid the self parking and used the room key for entry and exit. In my opinion the choice should have been either valet parking (which was 24 dollars a day) or just to pay for it independently without a self-parking charge.

While it IS close to Johns Hopkins, it is not particularly close to the admissions office, where they do the tours, which is on the other side of the campus.

Location \u2013 The location of the hotel is inconvenient unless you have business at Johns Hopkins University. The street outside the hotel is very busy, both day and night, noisy with traffic, and police and ambulance sirens. In addition, our suite overlooked what appeared to be a construction staging area that was very unattractive. Staff \u2013 The staff is inconsistent, ranging from very professional and friendly (Eric, the lifeguard at the pool and the lovely woman who brought bottled water to our suite every day) to unconcerned and aloof (the Sunday afternoon front desk staff who, when asked about the hours of the pool, told us they didn\u2019t know and that we should go and look for a sign on the pool ourselves). Suite \u2013 Upon check-in we were brought to a junior suite whose A/C was extremely loud and rattling. At our request, we were moved to another suite. The A/C was quieter (but still loud) and seemed to be on an arbitrary timer that switched on at odd times of the day. The suite itself was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. The couch and chair in the sitting area of the suite, however, were extremely uncomfortable. Each area of the suite had minimal lighting \u2013 a single lamp in the sitting area provided insufficient light for reading at night and on a cloudy day. During the day, I had to leave the curtains open in order to have enough light to read. The furniture on the outside balcony was filthy and I had to clean it several times before being able to sit on it. Food \u2013 The Continental breakfast was adequate but the single server seemed confused and ill trained. The restaurant area itself was rather dark and musty. I ate there one morning and never went back. Pool \u2013 The pool was closed every day from noon until 5:00 PM. This seems ridiculous since these are the prime hours when a pool would be used.

During our week long stay, we became friendly with many of the staff members at the hotel. The hospitality extended by the employees made us feel welcome in a city that can otherwise feel big and intimidating to people like us who come from a small town. One of the employees who made our stay most enjoyable was Paul Masai. He greeted us with a smile and warm cookies every day of our stay and seemed genuinely concerned and attentive as to how our stay was going. Since the Colonade is right across the street from the JHU campus, we talked with Paul about the possibility of having our daughter stay at the Colonade during stressful times (e.g., during finals) so that she could have a brief respite from the chaos of dorm life and get a restful night's sleep on occassion. Paul told us to call him anytime and he would personally make sure that her visit was nothing short of relaxing. With finals week ahead of her, we decided to book a stay in December and as promised we contacted Paul to let him know when our daughter would be arriving. Paul returned our call right away and he assured us that he would make sure that everything was taken care of when she arrived. True to his word, Paul not only made sure that our daughter's stay was restful, he also put her safety first by reserving her a room on an upper floor in a non smoking room, with no adjoining rooms. Paul arranged the perfect room for her where it was quiet enough for her to study and where she felt safe. My husband, our daughter and I are so grateful for the extra care and attention that Paul (and his staff) gave to our daughter during her stay. It is comforting to know that even though she is far away from family, there are kind people (such as Paul and staff) who care enough about others to make sure that they provide a safe and restful environment for their patrons at the Doubletree Inn at the Colonade.

My husband and I first stayed at the Inn in mid-September, when he came to Baltimore for a consultation at Johns Hopkins for his cancer. We were still in shock from his diagnosis, and needed to work out many emotions. The room you provided was beautiful and we so enjoyed every minute, relaxing in the whirlpool bath and on the balcony, watching life continue around the university as we made important decisions. The staff was wonderful, even though very few knew of our situation; this was all the better because we knew that they genuinely cared about customer service overall, not just because we were going through a difficult situation. When we heard that my husband needed major surgery and could have it done at JH, we again decided to stay at the Inn. We came down actually a night early, so we could spend some time together before his surgery on Oct. 7th. Again, the staff was wonderfully caring and supportive; they were there to help, whether it was with directions around the city, getting our car at 0500, allowing us to get breakfast items from the caf\u00e9 the evening before (to take along since we left so early), or offering a warm fresh-from-the-oven cookie. You all earned a perfect \u201c20\u201d; a \u201c10\u201d certainly isn\u2019t high enough for your hotel! I will also be mentioning your Inn and the quality of your services when I write to Johns Hopkins. I feel they should know about your excellent hotel so that they could recommend you to their patients and their families who are not from the area. Your team made so much difference for us as we went through this ordeal. Thankfully, we think that my husband will eventually be fine\u2026.the operation was successful, but he needs to recuperate and get back to normal over the next 6-12 months.

At 169 a night, it was a real bargain! Another good thing about the Doubletree is that the hotel is surrounded by and connected to Condos. The good thing is that loud and obnoxious tour groups or weddings have to keep it down and be out before 10! This is a real plus! The room was awesome too! We got the 2 Queen Beds Larger Room. It was huge! The beds were big and comfortable, the bathroom was fancy and large, and there was a sitting area! All wonderful! As far as tech, there was FREE internet (Yay!), and a big flat screen TV with a lot of channels and movies. The area is nice. There is a Ruby Tuesday around the corner which was a great place for dinner! Beware of the EXTREMELY TIGHT parking quarters in the neighborhood. Not a big deal, though. Parking at the hotel is $24 a day valet (one time fee) and $20 a day self, but the self is far away and you have to pay a fee when you leave every time. Weird! Breakfast the next day is at Alizee, the onsite restaurant. Not only is the restaurant really nice, the food was GREAT! The omelette guy is amazing! There was eggs, bacon, sausage, taters, toast, danish, pastry, cereal, fruit, etc. Also be sure to try the Choc. Milk. Best I've ever had! Beware, though.

It's lovely by the way if you're not married to being in the Inner Harbor or in other truly urban Baltimore neighborhoods (like Fell's Point and Inner Harbor East). This hotel is prime for people with connections to Johns Hopkins University (mind you, I'm talking about the university, not the medical campus whose proximity is more toward Fell's Point, a whole other part of the city). The weekend we were there we saw numerous families (with boisterous kids who overpowered the tiny indoor pool) and wedding events. Still, very pleasant if unremarkable. We booked a suite and from what I could tell when wandering through halls when housekeepers were working, it was the same space as regular rooms (with slightly fustier furnishings, certainly no flat screen televisions while standard rooms had been upgraded) though suspect our bathroom -- with jacuzzi tub -- was an upgrade. Hate the kind of \"suite\" that basically puts the living room at the entrance (with no windows). Didn't really care for the room, frankly (though did appreciate the empty mini-fridge and liked the bathtub). The other thing I didn't love about the hotel was that despite all these great outdoor spaces -- two patios off the pool, an area off the entrance that clearly has been marked as a gathering spot because chairs and tables, as yet unwrapped in mid-June and so useless -- was that the urban/suburban nature wasn't properly addressed. The restaurant (Alize something or other) seemed rather sad sack (though we enjoyed the bar), definitely not possessing any kind of buzz. In fact the hotel itself had a sort of sad sack air about it. Hallways reminded me of the kind of airport hotel that tracks in one night stays. The smoke scent in our room, ugh. Will we stay there again?

In that regard, the location is excellent -- across the street from the campus. However, the stay was not excellent. For the premium prices charged, this property should have a high level of customer service and quality settings.There were so many issues that we will thoroughly check out other hotel options for our visit next year. Issue One: Parking. No where on the website or when you check in are you told that you will have to pay every time you enter and leave the garage. A 1.5 hour stay was $8 alone in the garage. Overnight is an additional $20. Come and go several times and your parking expense can become very prohibitive. Issue Two: Front Desk. We only encountered one person at the end of our stay who we would consider customer oriented. Others we encountered were indifferent at best and seemed put out to have to talk or help a customer. Issue Three: No door on the bedroom. The suites are advertised as having a separate bedroom. Yes, there is a bedroom area, with a wide entry to it; no door. The set up was more typical of a low end suite hotel; not a hotel that charges $300 for a suite. So, if you want a private bedroom to allow someone to watch TV and others to sleep, this will not work. Issue Four: Other room issues. These included a refrigerator that did not work, a TV in the sofabed area that was older and had a fuzzy picture, a sofabed that was too short for a shorter person to sleep on with legs fully extended, a ragged blanket to use with the sofabed, a bathroom with laminate flooring as the ceiling, and a small size for a $300/night room. Yes, the balcony was nice. The room and bathroom were very clean and lots of towels were provided. Issue Five: Business center. Yes, there were two computers to use. However, the printers did not work and the front desk indicated that we and other guests would have to wait to the end of his shift until someone could figure out the issue. This is the only location for printing out boarding passes. This is a hotel that seems to think it has a captive audience with its location and has to do little to obtain a full house.

I didn't change to another room because I was afraid what I might be assigned to next. I swear, it was like playing russian roulette! The front dest staff could sometime be friendly and helpful, but only if there was a manager in the vacinity. It is shameful that this property is part of the Hilton family. I had submitted a complaint to the Hilton Corporation in 2/07. It is now 9/07 and I am still waiting for a response.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced pile of dirt\u201d", "Author": "veildancer9", "ReviewID": "UR8396504", "Content": "I was misled by a nicely appointed entrance and front desk area, but once I stepped off the elevator onto my floor, it all went downhill- total, disgusting disaster! I had to walk through long unkempt (dirty, messed up carpets and walls) hallways- half the hotel was undergoing renovations and these areas were open to the public rather than partitioned off. I was greeted with a waft of the odor of cigarette smoke upon arriving at my room. Not only was my room supposed to be non-smoking, but it's a non-smoking hotel. I asked to speak with someone about a price adjustment as the conditions in the room were less than savory. I was told that because I had made an advance purchase online, the hotel had not yet received the money from the outside vendor that handles their advanced online sales (Please note- I made my reservations directly on the hotel website, NOT Travelocity or a similar site). They claimed that since the hotel did not receive their payment, they could not work with me on the exhorbitant price I paid for a room that reeked of smoke. I asked to speak with a manager- they were able to find a supevisor for me, who said they will try to get in touch with their outside vendor regarding payment to see if they could then work with me on the price. I was told that someone would get in touch with me the next morning. No one contacted me and no one addressed my request. Entering the bathroom, I noticed a Q-tip on the floor. I gave them the benefit of the doubt- perhaps it had fallen out of my own bag. However, when I looked in the shower and found used bottles of shampoo in there, I knew the bathroom had not be cleaned. Housekeeping did visit after my call, after about a half hour wait. When visiting the restaurant, I asked if I could order something for \"takeout\"- after spending so much on a room that missed the mark, I did not want to spend extra for room service. I was told that they do not do that. I went back to the front desk to inquire about why this was so- it turned out to be a misunderstanding- the waitress thought I wanted to order from the room service menu and not have it delivered to my room. However, I was surprised that after expressing my disappointment in the room's conditions, the hotel staff did not offer my measly $6 salad \"on the house\". The hotel was very noisy too- their air conditioning systems and some type of fan was very loud, noisy and disruptive. The room rate was astronomical, particularly given the fact that it was not up to par. I could have flown halfway across the country for the same price!! The staff, I do have to say, was very nice, and seemed to want to accommodate me but given the hotel policy, they could not. This policy is horrid and there is no reason why they couldn't have shaved some money off my bill, given the unsatisfactory conditions. I was also shocked that I was, in essence, penalized for paying in advance. I should have been accommodated all the more, not less!! I was thoroughly disappointed in this hotel- very dusty and dirty room! Very overpriced!

I finally had my chance to stay at the hotel when I was invited to participate in an alumni advisory committee in April 2007 (I did not have to pay for the room myself). I have to say I was a little disappointed with the hotel. First, the rooms are kind of dark and a little run down. Next, I could not figure out how to set the clock, let alone the alarm (it had the wrong time!) and the lock of my room was pretty bent and worn (but it did still lock). It was unusually warm when I was in Baltimore and I had a difficult time getting the room comfortable. After crawling into bed, the bottom sheet kept coming untucked from the mattress (I hate that!). During my stay, I saw furniture just left in the hallway (and overheard the discussion of the staff, \"I wonder what that's doing there?\"). In addition, I did not find the front desk staff to be overly helpful when I needed to schedule a 4:00 am taxi. On the good side, the food we were served on our first night's meeting was outstanding. In short, the hotel is great for convenience to the JHU campus, but is in need of renovation (which they said they were doing) and some improvements in service.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for visting JHU, a little worn around the edges\u201d", "Author": "panicked", "ReviewID": "UR7275782", "Content": "This hotel is very convenient to Johns Hopkins Homewood Campus and Charles Village, but not close to much else. The staff was very accomodating during my stay. They switched my room when I showed up before check-in time so I wouldn't have to wait for my original room to be cleaned. I think that some strange charges and refunds on my bill resulted from this, but the staff was again very helpful in sorting it out and printing me a new bill on checkout. The key card machine wasn't working when I checked in, so they sent someone from housekeeping to meet me at my room and let me in, and called me when my key was ready. They were also very helpful with tips on how to get the semi-functional ATM in the lobby to work (unplug it and plug it back in to reboot it). All of that being said, I was a little disappointed with the condition of my room. It was small and rather dark. The furnishings were somewhat worn. No mini-fridge. It seemed like there was a shampoo shortage because when I arrived, my shampoo was half-empty, and wasn't replaced during my stay. Good points: I love the DoubleTree cookies. Free wireless internet. Helpful staff. The most convenient hotel to JHU. The pool/solarium looked nice. Not so good: The rooms need a renovation (they appeared to be renovating something in the lobby when I was there). Not close to the Inner Harbor or BWI. And what's with the shampoo? Check out: Tamber's Nifty Fifties Diner at 34th and St. Paul. It's a 50's style diner with Indian food. It sounds weird, but it works. Try the chocolate malts, Kashmiri naan, and chicken korma. Also: The Ambassador restaurant behind the DoubleTree has good Indian food in an elegant quasi-British Colonial setting. They open up the patio doors in the summer and seat you in the garden with tablecloths and hurricane lamps. And: The tiramisu at Donna's at 31st and St. Paul.

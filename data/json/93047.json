We have learned you get the best deals booking through the visitor center, even better than on the internet. I try to make sure I include this information whenever I write a review on a hotel. We arrived in New Orleans Tuesday, after the basketball tournament and again wanted to stay in the French Quarter. We booked our room for three nights and only had perhaps a 10 minute wait for our room to be prepared. All I can say is the service is excellant, especially if you happened to have Ms. Ava as your desk clerk. She took excellant care of us even booking our tours for us. The valets were great about taking care of our luggage, even going above and beyond to get my jacket out of my car on a rainy morning and keeping it dry by putting it under his coat. I took my own pillow and if there are any complaints it's that the pillows were very flat. The room itself was very nice, a great bathroom with a wonderful shower. This probably sounds funny, but I was thrilled to see a wing back chair in the room. I have a bad back and laying in bet watching TV just kills me. The other thing I must mention is that our room did not have a window...it was an inside room. While quaint and very quiet, I prefer a window in my room. Another thing you need to be aware of is the cost of parking. The first night at the hotel is $10.00 and then it is $28 a night thereafter. Just another reason to make sure you stop at the visitor center to book your room. It will help defer the cost of the parking by making your room rate less. The hotel is approximately 1/2 block off Bourbon Street. I just want to say one thing here for those of you traveling with children...stay away from Bourbon Street. It is full of homeless people, more strip bars then I can ever remember being there with pictures in the windows of the acts taking place inside, and girls in the doorways with little on shaking their booty, and prostitutes trying to hit on Johns. Definaltely not a place for children. There are many other places like Jackson Square and the French Market and Royal Street, or take the trolly down to the Convention Center for three flours of shopping for all kinds of souveinors. This was not my first trip to New Orleans, but this is my first trip post Katrina. This is NOT the New Orleans that I used to love. Once again do not believe all that you see on TV how everything is all just wonderful again because that is not the case. Take the \"City Tour\", there are many of them and you will see just how much has been destroyed by Katrine. Rebuilding is slow at best. My heart goes out to the people of the ninth ward. This was probably my last visit to New Orleans.

We tend to stay in higher-end chain hotels when we travel. Ultimately for this vacation we decided for our first time in NOLA we should stay in an historic hotel in the French Quarter (rather than a chain in the business district). We also needed a microwave and fridge, and a room quiet enough to get some sleep (which can be tough to find in the FQ). With a little trepidation, we chose Prince Conti. Any qualms we may have had vanished right away when we arrived. The small lobby is very pretty, and all of the staff was friendly and helpful. We had reserved a Junior King Suite, and I believe I asked for the highest floor (in this case, 3), and a quiet location in the building. We liked our room right away. None of the furniture was new, but everything was very clean and well kept and looked appropriate to our expectation of what a FQ hotel would be like. The bed looked like it could be uncomfortable, but in fact it was not at all! I usually don't sleep well in hotels, but I did here. The bathroom was clean, functional, and in good condition. The fridge and microwave were great for our leftovers from big meals all around NOLA. We were VERY happy to find two flat screen HDTVs in our room. Temperature controls were simple and worked well. The hotel's location was also perfect, being about a half block off Bourbon and a very short walk to Canal. We were able to walk everywhere in the FQ, and the hotel served as a nearby safe haven when we were worn out from walking among the revelers. When we wanted to venture further afield, we just walked to Canal and took the various streetcars (including taking one to a nearby car rental place so we could venture even further). We also had breakfast at the Conti Cafe (the attached breakfast only place), which was nice. We really liked the staff there and talked and joked with them a little. The \"Southern Eggs Benedict\" is *really* good! I've been trying to think of any negatives during our stay, but really the only small thing I can think of was that the wireless internet signal in our room wasn't as strong as it could've been. But then it was free, and it did work, so it's hard to even fault that. Maybe we were just lucky to get the most perfect room in the place, but honestly, we're pretty fussy and we loved it.

The Prince Conti is a GORGEOUS old Southern and very classy hotel with more charm and characted than you would ever imagine looking at its rather austere facade on Conti Street. The rooms are very spacious and have 15' ceilings and drapes, the furniture is a bit \"dated\" but very clean, and by that one wouldn't expect modern stylings in such an old building with so much character. The furniture fits the architecture. Even the doors to the rooms are quqite beautiful with their ornately carved woodwork grilles. The bathrooms are newly and beautifully restored and fitted with marble, ceramic tile and gleaming white fixtures. Now a note on the size of the rooms: most are what I would consider a very spacious room, and no doubt the ceiling height helps this. But they have a handful of \"petite\" rooms, and they are not kidding! They are smaller than the cabin on a cruise ship. You step in the door, you can set your luggage down and either step into the bathroom or sit on the bed, not much more in all honesty! And the price differences between them and the other normal rooms is not that great. There are also two restaurants, Cafe Conti and the Bombay Club (the latter of which is pricey but very elegant and serves true and authentic Creole cuisine). Literally right across the street, like 30 feet from the front door, is a fantastic German restaurant called Jager-Haus. Delicious for breakfast, lunch and dinner (dinner is a bit pricey but you can get a coupon on the tourist map at the front desk of the hotel) and the other, a true French restaurant of the old world charm and order: Broussard's. The staff is marvelously helpful and friendly, from Cindy at the front desk and Van at t he Bellman's stand during the days, to the ladies on the night shift (I apologize but forgot their names!) and even Mr. Valentino, the owner and manager who truly made me feel welcome and valued as a new guest. The location could not be better, and the major sights to see and tour are either walking distance or available via taxi, horse and carriage or arrangements by the very helpful and capable desk and concierge staff. The Conti Museum of New Orleans History is only two blocks from the front doors of the hotel in the opposite direction from Bourbon Streetm and two blocks beyond that is the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which is the former St. Anthony of Padua French Mortuary Chapel ating from 1827 and also containing the Shrine of St. Jude, on the corner of Conti and Rampart Street. It is a small and unassuming church but extremely rich in New Orleans/Yellow Fever Epedemic and Archdiocesan history. Behind the Church, across Basin Street and inside the white concrete wall, is St. Louis Cemetery #1, the oldest and one of the famous above ground cemeteries in New Orleans, and also the final resting place of Voodoo Queen Marie Laveaux (if you're into that). The other beautiful thing about the PCH's location is that, though literally half a block from Bourbon Street, when one enters their room at night, it is QUIET as opposed to those hotels right on Bourbon. A real retreat and place of beauty and serenity. My only constructive comments, NOT complaints, are that 1) the mattress in my room was very soft. I only say this because I prefer a firmer mattress due to chronic back issues, but I slept rather well, and 2) the lamp shades might need replacing soon due to the carelessness of past guests and just years of use, and by that I am referring more to the interior linings, and 3) they should get firmer, overstuffed feather or other types of pillows. I don't care for those thin foam pillows that really don't breathe well. The A/C in each room is WONDERFUL as are the large-sized ceiling fans. Hey- it is New Orleans and one of the hottest and most humid climates in the country! Regarding the price, I am not making the salary I once was (who is anymore?) so a lesser cost would have really helped me out alot, but it is what it is and I did have a good time. I judge hotels by the following criteria: 1) location, 2) my feeling of safety, 3) condition of the property and rooms and, most importantly: 4) would my mother stay there? She would in spades at this one! The hotel is perfection and one would be doing themselves very well to stay there and give it a try. (Well, perfection except for the juvenile-acting drunks staggering in from Bourbon Street at 4 and 5 AM!) THANK YOU Prince Conti staff and Mr. Valentino for a simply fantastic and quite-pleasantly surprising experience.

The beds are not top quality. It is an older mattress that probably needs to be updated. Our room on 2nd floor had a bad odor, something like dirty carpet. They had sprayed room spray, but it didn't help. Our friends stayed in a different room and they had no odor in their room.

The staff did not meet us outside at the curb, so we had to carry our luggage inside and up to our room. They did hold the door open for us coming in the front entrance. The taxi driver was surprised they did not come outside too. The lobby is very small. There is no complimentary breakfast offered. There was a restaurant on the property, but we did not go in it.The rooms have paper thin walls. I could hear everything said as people walked by. We were near the ice machine so we had a fair amount of traffic by our room. There was also a lot of noise above our room. I am guessing the floors are hard wood because there was a ton of squeaking above us as they moved about. I joked that the people above us had dance practice in the upstairs room starting very early in the day. The hotel is in a good location, within walking distance of all the action.

The second room we were offered only had a skylight. Are they kidding? Again, I don't know if it is legal for fire regulations. We marched down to the front desk and asked for a room with windows, and Ava (a very pleasant lady) sent us to room 355. It was a regular room, but very damp and the carpet was almost wet. The heat was turned on Thursday and Friday and it barely dried out. We left the door open in our room most of the time. There is no air circulation in this hotel. There were threadbare towels and the other linens and bedspreads had seen better days. One of the beds was loose to the headboard and rattled even if you just put your hand on it. We had requested a room for when we got back on the 21st, I insisted on a window. Well, there was a crabby front desk clerk this time. She said ok. We we got back on the 21st the same crabby clerk was there. I asked about a room with a window again, and she sort of smirked at me. I didn't know what was in store for us. We got room 232, right by the elevators. It had windows alright. Three large ones, all facing Conti Street. The hotel was supposedly sold out, so we couldn't get another room. The din started about 7pm. Sirens, shouting, music, arguing, yelling and so on til 5am. I am sure the desk clerk put us in one of the worst rooms in the hotel since I demanded not to be in a dungeon. The only reason I stayed there as my friend had stayed there before and liked the location. I think she was given a regular room at that time. It is too much of a crap shoot to stay here. It needs new linens and some updating. I still can't get over the fact that they have rooms that would break fire regulations in most cities.

The nature of the French Quarter is crowded, so don't go expecting a sprawling brand new piece of modern architecture. Instead, if you embrace the rich history and authentic detail that imbue this hotel with a museum-like grace and character, you will really, really enjoy yourself. Location is the key for this hotel. A block from Bourbon Street. A few blocks to Canal. Three blocks from Rampart. I won't even attempt to tell travelers where to find exceptional food or the infamous New Orleans night life. You'd have to stay in your hotel room closet to avoid it. Unless you have a specific destination in mind, I recommend just walking out to the street, picking a direction, and walking until you find something interesting. You won't have to go far. Valet parking is available, but I'd recommend using one of several pay-to-park lots within a block or two. Take your things out of your vehicle, pay much less. Also, the wifi signal in our room was weak and occasionally caused aborted uploads. At times, this was frustrating. My only other issue would be with the card keys for the rooms. They were unfamiliar to me, lacking a magnetic stripe so they couldn't be demagnatized by cell phones, etc. But during my stay, they constantly became non-functional. As a result, my friend and I had to get well over 20 keys issued to us over the course of just a few days. The staff, however, was friendly, attentive, and professional. They made accommodations for my early check-in and were quick to facilitate a last-minute addition of another friend to my reservation on the second to last day of my stay. The manager named Cindy was classy, smart and in control. It was a pleasure to stay here and it was a pleasure for me to let her know I'd be writing them a favorable review.

It helped they had a great ceiling fan so we aired it out. The room was really clean and well kept. Nice flat screen T.V. Good hangers and a very nice, clean, and working bathroom. Our beds were not very comfortable and felt springy but still able to sleep. The double beds are small and if you are taller than 5'9 you will have problems.

Sure is convient to have your room so close that you can easily return for a pit stop or unload any purchases, then head back to the action. The hotel itself is older, but clean and the staff is very courteous, we were even treated to a \"gift\" to celebrate our birthday, which was a pleasant surprise. We were happy with the room itself, although the lighting was a little dark and the walls a little thin, but no real complaints. My only negative would be the WIFI signal, which was very weak in our room 362. I went to the lobby and the internet worked fine, the manager said they would look into the problem and meanwhile suggested I try to connect near the hallway, which did work for one day. The next day, I tried a similar approach with no luck and then went to the lobby to try, where someone finally told me that the entire WIFI was down throughout the building and part of the Quarter itself. It never did come back. We utilized the Hotel parking and had no problem with that, although you may want to leave extra time for the valet to get to your vehicle. Could be a wait. We also decided to dine at the Bombay Club for our birthday celebration and thoroughly enjoyed that experience. (review will follow soon).

It is a quaint, boutique hotel 1/2 block off of Bourbon St on Conti St. We arrived on Christmas day and the woman at the front counter was anything but friendly. I called ahead since we arrived in New Orleans at 10:00am to see if rooms might be ready. She answered \"Prince Conti\". I said, \"Good morning and Merry Christmas!\". I heard silence. She relented and said, \"oh, yeah, Merry Christmas\", with little enthusiasm. She stated that everyone was still sleeping and no rooms would be available but they would be happy to store our luggage and call us when rooms would be ready. We arrived, checked in, stored luggage - she was very matter of fact with no sense of humor at all. She did answer questions, but curtly. When the rooms were ready, my husband got the call on his cell. My sister never got a call. They gave a room to my sis and b-i-l that had no heat. After calling down 2 times, another gal at the desk said that, that particular room should not have been rented as they were waiting for a part for the heater. They sent a staff person up with a new key - for a room on the floor below - but we wanted to be near each other. We called the desk again, they sent up another key for a room 3 doors down, which was nice. They seemed put out at having to do this. The rest of the stay had different front desk staff who were cordial. The hotel was clean and comfortable. It is an old hotel and as such has all of the personality of an older hotel with dimmer lighting and creaking floors, if you like that sort of thing. We rather like the personality of it and spent much time outside the room anyway. The housekeeping staff are loud in the mornings and others staying there were up and down the hallway all night - quite loudly. But then, it is, New Orleans, so you expect that, especially the second night when the Saints beat the Falcons at the Superdome in town. Lots of celebrating! There is a breakfast cafe next door that looks quite good and the Bombay Club Restaurant. We did not eat there as we went around the corner to Cafe Beignet for breakfast and to Deanie's Seafood for dinner - only 2 blocks away. The location is great because it is so near Bourbon Street. A 4-block walk gets you to the trolleys and you can walk all over the French Quarter. We booked this hotel through Hotels.com and got a very good rate - less than $100 per night.

We didn't get daily service, so it was like this when we checked in. There is free wireless Internet available in the guest rooms, but I generally found that it was slow and seemed to \"go out\" every five minutes or so when I tried using it. Overall, this is a solid hotel, but be very careful about the beds. Also, make sure to bring ear plugs with you because you'll hear every word spoken in the corridors and every slamming door (though that beats Bourbon St noise any time).", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cAnother great trip!\u201d", "Author": "LARC130", "ReviewID": "UR114688010", "Content": "This is our fourth stay at this hotel and we will continue to come back.

The Bombay Club is a good place to close out a day of \"doing\" New Orleans, a city which needs all the (tourist) dollars it can get.

I lived in New Orleans for a little over a year and this little place is right in the heart of the French Quarter--less than a block from Bourbon and about a 10 minute walk to Cafe Du Monde or Canal Street to the street cars/buses. We didn't have a car but I believe there was parking available for an extra daily fee. We stayed 04/07/11 - 04/10/11 which was during French Quarter Festival, a little busier than your average time of year but not quite as crazy as Mardi Gras or Jazz Festival. And now the negative... 1.Our room was the \"Double Bed Petite Room\" -- it was $199 for Thursday and jumped to $279 for Friday and Saturday. Waaaayy over priced. It seemed pretty run down and not really updated. 2.The room was extremely small and often difficult for my husband and I to move around at the same time. It didn't look anything like the pictures on the website. The bed was shoved against a wall and there was a small \"desk\" on the other side of that. I wouldn't even want to call it a bed--it was more like a mattress stuffed with potatoes. No amount of alcohol could have made that bed comfortable. 3. It is near Bourbon Street so of course as soon as you walk out, the smell will hit you. 4.The cleaning staff seemed friendly enough but on our 2nd day/night there, I noticed that some of my expensive facial cream ($30 bottle) went missing. I reported it to the front desk and was told that a manager would get back to me....I'm glad I didn't hold my breath. I filled out an incident report and everything and got absolutely no follow up with staff at all. I was extremely disappointed about this. 5. Cafe Conti never truly looked open whenever we walked by. It seemed the only time I saw people in there was when it was hotel staff gathering to chit chat. Overall, the room was forgettable. I don't mind paying more for a room if it's got charm and the service and amenities were there but for what we paid, I wish we could have stayed elsewhere.

It was actually difficult to see because it was hidden within with the filthy, stiff, gray carpeting. Since the mass had parked itself right in front of the bathroom, you got the unforgettable experience of stepping on it, with your bare feet, in the middle of the night; the soapy, sopping mess seeping between your toes in fetid runniness....YUM! The bedding made Motel 6 look like the Four Seasons. The top blanket, if you could call it that, was a wafer thin, matted piece of polyester with all the plushness of styrofoam. It was abound with holes and tears from all the years of drunken frolicking. You lay there shivering, in your saggy bed, with the vents moldy air billowing down on you. How lovely....the charm we were looking for! We complained and they offered us another room. We decided to leave and found a wonderful hotel down the street.

I know you don't go to New Orleans to stay in your room and we didn't. But the times that you are in your room - it should be comfortable. Our front door was warped and wouldn't shut unless we slammed it. Same for the bathroom door which also had a door handle/cover that needed to be reattached. I can't believe that housekeeping wouldn't let maintenance know that the doors were sticking or that a guest wouldn't have brought it to their attention before I did upon checking out. My guess is they just don't care. Walls are so thin that we might as well been rooming with our next door neighbors since we could hear every word they said. You could hear people's conversations in their rooms as you walked down the hall. There is no space in the bathroom. Only a pedestal sink and a ledge for placing toiletries; a bathtub and a toilet. other good and the bad: We were allowed to check in very early - very nice. We got there at 9:30AM and they had our room before 1PM (not supposed to check-in until 4) Internet is very slow. I will say the room was very clean and I really appreciated that.

Best part of the stay was the Cafe Conti. It does have a great breakfast and great prices. Great vending machines on 2nd floor. I think the rooms on the 2nd floor must be nicer than the 3rd floor (where we were). One side of the hall has only brick so you wouldn't have half the noise.

Not to discourage anyone, just keep in mind to keep your wits about you and not to venture outside the French Quarter unless you know its an O.K. area to enter (Canal Street is not bad unless you get up north of the quarter).

Unfortunately the Prince Conti is not the answer to this problem, and we strongly suggest to stay away. We stayed there for two nights. To start with the good things: The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located very close to the heart of Bourbon Street, but if you have a room facing north (as we did) you won't hear a thing. The room was spacious (as are most rooms in the USA). On the negative side: First of all the hotel looks as if it was good and prestigeous some years ago, but has taken a beating since. Most of the furniture was well worn, and there was some visible and unrepaired damage. As for our room, the ceiling of the bathroom showed a lot of mould. The beds were pretty soft and unfortunately just about 1,80m (6 ft) long, so even somebody at average height will sleep with his or her feet at lease partially hanging out of the bed. On the first day the linen appeared clean, but on the second day the new linen had holes and bloodstains (we later discovered holes in the blanket too). There were also holes in the curtain. As we arrived, the carpet was pretty wet and the whole room clammy and damp. This state persisted for both days we stayed there. (We were told later that the carpet had been shampooed, but apparently there was no plan to get it dry again.) As in many hotels, the windows couldn't be opened, so there was no way to get the humidity out (the AC didn't help at all). The \"included\" breakfast didn't help. Since it consisted only of croissants, jelly and some cake. Drinks were coffee, water and a juice that tasted as if it consisted only of sugar and artificial flavours. Everything else had to be ordered separately and of course to be paid for, too - and it took the kitchen a long time to prepare a crepe and some toast, even though just 3 or 4 tables were occupied. To sum it up, an adventurous backpacker might tolerate this in a Motel that costs 20 dollars a night, but to me this is totally unacceptable for a hotel in this class (where a night costs more than 100 dollars).", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basingstoke, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful\u201d", "Author": "Kerrycavanagh", "ReviewID": "UR87780629", "Content": "Very central location right in the centre of the French Quarter but was very quiet at night.

For the reasonable rate of this hotel and its convenient location to Bourbon Street, you'll jump for joy when you discover the many delights of this tiny gem.

The three things we were looking for were: 1. Walking distance to the French Quarter. 2. A smaller hotel with a New Orleans feel. 3. No corporate Marriott feel. The Prince Conti not only delivered but secured itself as the ONLY hotel we will ever stay in while visiting New Orleans. Beds were huge and comfortable. I could spit out my window and nearly hit Bourbon Street. The Continental Breakfast was the best we have ever had. The staff was courteous and friendly and went out of their way to make us feel at home. Brad, the manager, was there everyday to ask how our trip was going and recommend things to do. The staff supplied me with band aids for my blisters and made sure my post cards got mailed. The icing on the cake was that while we were staying at The Prince Conti we were actually the very last guests to use REAL METAL KEYS. I can't tell you how cool that was. While we were there they were switching over all the keys to swipe cards. The staff let us keep our metal key! The best souvenir we could have ever asked for. You want to have a great trip? You want to sleep like a baby? You want to feel like not just another room number? You want to be treated like you are a part of a family? Then you want to stay at The Prince Conti!!

That's on the positive. On the negative side, there are no real facilities at the hotel, eg no swimming pool which is an issue since New Orleans is generally hot. The staff at the front desk were friendly but didn't seem to be very knowledgeable, most of the questions I asked they weren't able to answer. The cost of the room includes a \"continental breakfast\" which means that they set out rolls, coffee and juice in the breakfast room which you can help yourself to. Alternatively, if you don't want the continental option, you can order a hot breakfast and receive a $7 credit toward the cost. I would STRONGLY recommend that you forget having breakfast at all in the hotel, the continental breakfast is pretty dismal and the order off the menu option an absolute nightmare. There are only 2 staff serving in the breakfast room and only 1 of these is able to take your order. Getting her attention to take your order or bring a glass of water involves a significant amount of arm waving and usually a wait of around 10-15 minutes. On the 1st day I thought maybe they were just short staffed but it was the same every day. I saw a number of tables give up and walk out before placing their order. I watched 1 table resort to wriiting down their order down and hand it to the waitress who is not allowed to take orders and ask her to give it to the other one (needless to say their breakfast never turned up). Once you finally get your order in expect a very very long wait for your food. Minimum wait for eggs on toast was at least 40 minutes and one day over an hour. I saw numerous people cancel their orders and leave after an extended wait. Also expect a very good chance that when the food finally turns up it won't be what you ordered. I got the wrong food at least half of the time and one morning out of a table of 8 women next to me, only 3 got the right food. In one case, after a wait of another 20 minutes to have her order replaced, they brought out the wrong food again. On the morning that I had to wait over an hour and then didn't get what I'd ordered, the manager did waive the bill. But given after taking into account the $7 credit the bill was only $3 or $4 in any event, this was a bit of a token. Housekeeping service was also failry lax. On at least 2 days I left the room at 10am in the morning leaving the please clean my room sign out and returned at 3.30pm to find it hadn't been cleaned. Both times I then asked to have the room cleaned straight away. On one of the ocassions after then being told it would be done immediately and ready in 20 minutes I left the hotel for another 45 minutes and came back to find they hadn''t started yet. The staff all seem to work hard, but the hotel appears to be dramatically understaffed.

The room was dark, as there were no windows that faced outside. Only 1 window which faced the hallway. This does result in no natural light, but that makes for some pretty deep sleep. Continental breakfast at Cafe Conti is included ($7) or you can order anything off the breakfast menu and receive a $7 discount. I opted for the Breakfast Biscuit ($10) which was very good. As a vegetarian, I asked that the bacon/ham be substituted with spinach or whatever vegetable was handy. The chef used fresh basil, tomato, mushrooms, baby spinach, green pepper and red onion. I was extremely impressed, as most places don't go through that kind of trouble. It should really be added to their regular breakfast menu. Location is excellent - in the heart of Bourbon Street.

On opening the grill, I was amazed at the condition of the filter, which clearly hadn't been changed in a long, long, LONG time. It had a serious accumulation of dust, which explained the asthma like issues and the visible particles.

It had atmosphere, charm, and a perfect location - and it didn't cost us a fortune, either. My mother and I were scheduled to be in New Orleans for a business conference held at the Marriott on Canal Street, but we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a hotel room we could probably find in any city. We wanted a taste of the city, something more intimate, something with personality. When we found the Prince Conti Hotel, it seemed like a perfect fit - and it was. The rooms were very well-priced, and its location was perfect - just a couple of blocks from the site of our conference, and an ideal launch point for walking through the Vieux Carre. Our room was more than adequate - it was comfortable and welcoming after a long day of sightseeing, a little like coming home. The water pressure in the shower was actually surprisingly good, considering the age of the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful; when we arrived at the Prince Conti at 11:00 PM on a Tuesday night, hungry and weary after a thirteen-hour drive, they eagerly recommended a restaurant just a block down the street and gave us coupons for a 10% discount. The restuarant, Oceana, turned out to be so good that we ate there twice. As I mentioned above, the location of the hotel is fantastic. We had no problems walking anywhere we wanted in the city. Jackson Square and Cafe du Monde were only ten minutes of walking away, and the beautiful St. Louis #1 Cemetery was only three small blocks straight down the street. And, of course, the hotel is just off of Bourbon Street - a perfect locale for anyone who wants to go out and party without getting lost on their way back to their hotel room. And yes, the close proximity to the boisterous Bourbon Street did mean that we heard some street noise. At about 4:30 AM during our first night at the hotel, we were woken by a furious argument between two girls on the street below us - yet somehow, it just made us howl with laughter rather than simmer with fury. It was part of the atmosphere, part of the spirit of New Orleans, and I wouldn't trade those whoops and hollers from the balconies lining Bourbon for any silent, frigid chain hotel in the world. Still, I leave a warning for those travelers who just can't abide the \"disruptions\" - yes, Bourbon is rowdy, and while most of that noise stays in the street, you'll still hear whistles and the thump of a bass. While we ended up loving the mayhem, your mileage may vary. For those of us who can't leave home without our laptops, the Prince Conti had excellent wireless internet service, which was complementary and easy to access. There were no hoops to jump through or passwords to enter; instead, the Conti's internet was unlocked and had multiple access points via routers fixed to the ceilings on each floor. Very easy to use, and very convenient. I also want to mention that for fellow smokers, the Prince Conti Hotel had an excellent designated smoking area. The hotel itself is located off a little enclosed alleyway, where there were ashtrays and a bench just across from the lobby (and in clear sight of hotel staff) for those of us with the bad nicotine habit. It was safe, secluded, and sheltered from the elements. Perfection. New Orleans is a magical city. It has a spirit and character that is utterly unique unto itself, that cannot be found in any other place in America. When I first traveled to New Orleans eight years ago, I fell in love with it instantly. It reminded me strongly of my own beloved hometown of Charleston, with its historic architecture and muggy climate, but while Charleston is a marsh heron, elegant and demure, New Orleans is a peacock, unfurling its brightly-colored feathers with a mischievous wink. I love New Orleans with all my heart and soul, and I cannot wait to come back. And when I do come back, I know exactly where to rest my head after a long day marching down the old, narrow streets: I'm coming back to the Prince Conti Hotel, a surprising shot of tranquility in the middle of a wild, wonderful landscape.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice suite size, bad luck with old beds\u201d", "Author": "LeisureGator", "ReviewID": "UR64874025", "Content": "We stayed here for Jazzfest 2010 and loved the location, as well as the space of the suite we reserved.

Although it's only a 1/2 block from Bourbon St., you can't hear any noise from the party folks on the street. Speaking of noise, the Conti has very thin walls. For a couple of nights, we were treated to the sounds of a couple that might have been upset if they knew what we heard. (Thank God they didn't take too long with their love-making...slam bam, thank you maam!) Also, another night or two, we heard several young boys raising cain for about a 1/2 hour before they passed out. A few times there was no ice in the machine, but you can't blame the hotel for that since I saw many guests filling up coolers. The breakfast was the same every morning; coffee, OJ, rolls & jelly, pastrys, apples, & oranges. The Conti also provides two newspapers you can pick up in the lobby (USA Today & the Times-Picaunne).The lady the took place of the breakfast room was also another gem. If you wanted something more than the usual continental affair, you could just walk across the street to the De'javu, a restaurant/bar that is open 24/7. We ate there several times. Not much to look at, but the food was good & cheap. Also, across from the Conti is German reataurant that has good weekday specials. Although we didn't go there the Conti has the Bombay Club attached to the rear of the hotel; an upscale martini lounge with jazz every night. I peeked in, & it seemed very nice. The desk staff was went above & beyond the call of duty to help you with anything you needed; from reservations, advice on where to eat, what to see, getting you a cab, etc. They honestly seem to want you to be happy with their hotel. As I mentioned, the location is ideal. It is very close to many upscale restaurants as well as other eating places that serve very good food. It is also very close to Canal St. so you can catch the bus or trolley.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cGreat off-season rate- European type hotel\u201d", "Author": "shortysboyKansas", "ReviewID": "UR33180752", "Content": "I've been to NOLA a half dozen times, this was the first time to book a hotel in French Quarter- I couldn't have been happier with the choice; highly researched on TA.

The room was exceptionally clean. There wasn't much of a view (the 1st floor roof with a AC units), but then I didn't come to NO to look out a hotel window. The only problem with the room (and I'd read this in other review also) was that right outside the bathroom door the carpet was always wet.

Being that we had never been before, I wanted to read a bunch of reviews to find a decent place. I wanted a decent hotel that was clean, safe, in walking distance to everything in the French Quarter at a reasonable price. I am so happy that I got exactly what I wanted. The hotel was very charming with a little bit of an old fashioned, New Orleans type feel. When we walked into the lobby, we were immediatley greeted by the woman at the front desk asking if we were checking in. Over to the left, I was delighted to see secuirty guard stand with the security facing us and the elevator. We gave our name, and in a split second she checked us into our room an hour and a half before normal check in time. When we got to our room, I was so happy to see that it was a decent size with a large king sized bed, and a window that faced out towards Bourbon Street. Even though we faced the street, we never heard one bit of noise. The hotel is step away from one of the best parts without all of the noise. The room was clean, the bathroom was a nice size. The hotel was in walking distance to everything, which was great. I will say though that if you plan on walking around all day, it can be a lot of walking. But the location still can't be beat being right next to Bourbon Street. Almost everytime we came in and left the hotel, there was a new staff member at the front desk. Every single one of them was pleasant and extremely helpful if we had questions. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel, and really don't have anything to complain about. Some of the other complaints i saw about this hotel was that it didn't have a pool or a courtyard. Why in the world would you come to New Orleans to swim in a pool? Go to the beach then! And it didn't bother me that there was no Courtyard at this hotel - there were plenty of courtyards around the French Quarter to see and visit. All in all, this hotel was perfect for what we were looking for. If you are alooking for an over the top, fancy place with room service, a pool (I still don't understnad this one), and other amenities, then this is probably not what you are looking for.

You can literally hear everything going on in the adjacent rooms. Here is the trick, get out of your room and enjoy New Orleans. Shower, toilet, sink, A.C. and TV all worked fine. TV was a bit of a joke (maybe 17\"), but again, put down the remote and take in the sights and sounds of the French Quarter. Booked the room in advance and prepaid the entire weekend for $325 on their website for Saturday thru Tuesday over Memorial Day weekend. A steal in my opinion. Didn't try the continental breakfast but why would I when right outside the hotel is the French Quarter full of restaurants!

Due to the festival the rates were a little higher than normal but less than many of the other French Quarter hotels. About us: I am an avid reader and poster on Trip Advisor. We are also pretty easy going people that don't let the little stuff bother us while we are on vacation. We also typically go for a hotel that is in a great location, at a decent price, and gets good/decent reviews for being clean. I have to say that the Prince Conti met all of our expectations and I would recommend this hotel Check-in : We arrived around 2pm on Thur. Both of our rooms were ready and they put us within 1 room apart from our friends on the 3rd floor. The desk person, I believe Cindy, was very nice along with the rest of the staff we encountered at the desk. Within minutes we were checked-in and on our way. Rooms: We were both on the 3rd floor and our window looked out on the not-so-pretty roof/courtyard...or should I say \"courtroof\". The rooms were standard size hotel rooms both with king size beds. The bed looked as though it was on a slight slant but ended up not being noticeable and quite comfortable. The rest of the furniture was looking worn but was clean. The bathroom was also very clean. The pedestal sink eliminated having any counter space but helped make the bathroom seem larger. There was a small glass shelf to put things on but little place else to put anything toiletries. We managed but don't expect to spread out much more than a couple of toothbrushes and toothpaste and a couple other small things. The water temp in the shower also did fluctuate at times but it wasn't terrible. Our friends seem to have a similar overall experience except their air conditioner was stuck on the whole time but wasn't bad enough to complain. Location: Hard to beat! Steps from Bourbon and it was very quiet A couple things to reiterate that people have mentioned in the past: 1. There was no in-room safe. Not sure why every hotel these days doesn't have one. 2. They still have metal keys. Not an issue for us since they are decent size but I am sure there would be a charge if you lost one. 3. There was an iron, although we never needed to use it 4. They have a continental breakfast...but who needs that when you are in one of the great food cities in the world? Just give me a hot beignet and coffee from Cafe Du Monde and I am happy! So overall, a nice stay. If you our looking for a clean hotel, at a decent price, and is just steps from Bourbon than this may be a good choice.

The Prince Conti had refunded our room in full, no questions asked. Very understanding. So, we rebooked for post-Christmas/New Year's trip. The cab ride from the airport to the hotel was about 23 minutes, maybe shorter. Excellent location, 1 block from Bourbon Street, yet quiet. We didn't hear any street noise, only some fireworks on the river on New Year's Eve. We were checked into our room before 11 a.m. which was great. Nice king-sized bed. View was limited of the building/wing next door. Bathroom was nice. Nice soap. Free breakfast was fine for quick pick-up before heading out. We requested no room service each day and this was honored. Thankfully we never heard our neighbors and only light hallway noise a few times. No biggie. I heard this building used to house labs, perhaps pharmacy? Anyway, I didn't get to request a haunted room since we checked in early, not sure there are any. But the hallways are sort of spooky. Nice ambience lighting. I love old hotels and the historic and haunted stuff is exciting. But if you aren't into spooky, you probably wouldn't even think that about this hotel if I hadn't mentioned it. In the opposite direction of Bourbon St. is the Muse Conti Wax Museum, just steps away. Very cool. Been there twice. If you aren't familiar with the Quarter, this area is safe. They are expensive and inexpensive places to eat across the street. But, as with the entire Quarter, a cup of coffee, snack, alcoholic beverage or tasty meal are always a few steps away from anywhere you are.

However, it's a little different when you're paying out of your own pocket, rather than using the corporate card and staying as part of a conference or company meeting. In this case, I was going to NOLA for a long weekend/girls' trip with my mom, and I wanted something that was in a great (and safe) location, not too hard on the pocketbook, and DID NOT HAVE BUGS. On a couple of occasions, I'd been about to book a hotel based on a great-sounding description...but then reading further I'd see the magic word (aka - cockroaches) in someone's writeup that called off all bets. NOLA is known for its cockroaches (rumor has it that the cockroach was originally part of the Saints' original logo), but that doesn't mean I want that aspect of the Big Easy up close and personal, thank you very much! :) Anyway, I found this hotel to be what we were looking for. Was it the nicest hotel I'd ever been to? No. Did it have the most amenities? Absolutely not. Would I eat the continental breakfast? Nunca. Would I have been a bit disappointed if it was my first time to NOLA and I was hoping to rely on the concierge for guidance on what to do? Definitely. However, 1) The price for what we got couldn't be beat. 2) It was safe - we never felt in danger, and we were two women out alone. 3) NO BUGS IN SIGHT. 4) Location, location, location! It was literally half a block from the action on Bourbon street, 2 blocks from Canal (main ave where the streetcar lines run), and just a quick 10 minute walk (if that much) to the riverfront (IMAX, aquarium, etc.), and a short walk to Cafe Du Monde and Jackson square. Consider this - you aren't spending your time in your hotel room. If it's about the NOLA experience, then what you want is somewhere clean, safe, and walkable to everywhere (take a cab from the airport and don't even bother with a rental car...parking in the quarter is pretty much impossible and why pay for the valet??). This hotel is it. Oh, and by the way - we were in a room that faced out towards the direction of Bourbon and we didn't hear much of anything at night. We went to bed around 10:30/11 each night and slept very soundly. One night, some people were a little drunk when they came back, so they were a bit noisy in the hallway...but once they went into their rooms we heard nothing. Also, it kind of cracks me up when I read the reviews that say \"we were appalled...there were NO amenities! no pool! no gym!\" etc. etc. My answer to that - did you even halfway read the hotel descriptions? Any description on Orbitz, Travelocity, Expedia, or any other such site will tell you what amenities the hotel does and doesn't have...so \"shame on you\" for not paying attention. Granted, I think they shouldn't even bother advertising the free continental breakfast...my mom and I walked into the restaurant after check-in and walked right out. There are plenty of places to eat for breakfast/brunch (we enjoyed Monte's, as well as a place on the Southeast corner of Jackson Park whose name escapes me (across from Cafe du Monde, right on the corner facing the park). Cafe Beignet (sp) was great for a quick on-the-go breakfast our last morning before heading to the airport. As far as the concierge, I've stayed at the Marriott (not the JW but the regular one) before and they have an excellent concierge service. We stopped by there a couple of times and asked some general questions...they were very helpful. We never told them we weren't staying at the hotel, and they never asked. Plus the hotel and lobby are so big they probably don't know the difference. I wouldn't...! As far as restaurants - DEFINITELY check out K-Paul's on Royal (it's across from what I believe is city hall - or some type of federal/legal building). The drum (type of fish) is AMAZING and the service was wonderful...I had eaten there once before while on business and loved it even more the second time around. Bayonna was a great one as well...the redfish was really great (exit hotel and make a left...then take first right and it's on that block, on the right). Redfish Grill wasn't bad. NOLA isn't bad either (one of Emeril's restaurants, for those of you who are fans of his). Recommendations - Walk wherever you can...there are some great sights and photo ops! Hop the ferry over to Algiers, even if you just get back on it and come back over. You get some great views of the city from the boat. Insectarium - that's where you go if you want to see bugs (i.e., safely behind glass). You can even eat them in the cafeteria...and they're quite delicious! Garden District tour is nice - we toured with Katie and she's awesome & feisty. Preservation Hall is a great experience, even if you don't stay for an entire set. Just be sure to snap a pic of the band right when they walk out and get settled, because that's when they make the announcement that flash photography is not allowed. :) On Bourbon - Fat Catz on St. Louis and Bourbon is alot of fun with the resident band called the Connection. They play alot of old 70's and 80's funky tunes. Miscellaneous: I'm into buying a Powerball ticket whenever I go to a Powerball state, and there's a tiny convenience store on Royal about 30 steps from Canal (on the left when walking away from Canal) that sells them. If you're looking for little snacks, there's a Walgreens which I believe is on Royal a few blocks down from Canal...we stopped there every day to pick up water and it's also where you can go for any toiletries you may have forgotten. And of course, in general, be smart about where you go/what you do. NOLA is a city just like anywhere else...there are places you definitely should not go alone, and things you should not do after dark. BE SMART ABOUT THINGS. Stay where the crowds are (you can't go wrong on Bourbon -- save for the revellers who've had too much to drink, but are typically harmless...and there are plenty of cops around). Girls - keep your eye on your drink at all times. That's about all I can think of...happy traveling and enjoy NOLA!

Am coming back in January, week day \"Value\" rates in January were only $84... about the same price as the airport Sleep Inn. Very happy with everything. Rooms size for French Quarter was great. Entire hotel was very clean and quiet considering we were 1/2 block from the middle of the action on Bourbon Street. (Google: Conti & Bourbon street New Orleans LA) Nice bar in back with patio seating outside. I did use the valet service for our car ($25.00 per night). When we pulled up in front of the hotel, a young man in uniform asked if we were checking in, and directed us to pull in to the driveway leading into the hotel. When we checked out I told the desk clerk we would be leaving at 7:00, had a roll and coffee, and exactly at 7:00 our car pulled into the drive... Could not have asked for more.

Considering the location of this hotel and it's location to Bourbon St., there was virtually no noise at all and we always had a comfortable night's rest each night. Just a few suggestions to do while in NOLA: We visited the WWII musuem and was highly impressed with the establishment. A musuem that had a lot of artifacts and actual veterans there to visit with you about their own personal experiences. If you like Italian food, then you must try Tony Moran's on Bourbon St. We ate there the first night and it was the best Italian food we have ever eaten. The atmosphere and the staff was top notch.

In perusing the reviews I noticed that some people had nice rooms and others complained of worn furniture and carpeting. I called the hotel and was advised that rooms are renoved a few at a time. I requested a renovated room and they replied that they would see what they could do. Upon check in we were upgraded to a beautiful mini suite!!! This was really nice of the hotel management and made our trip that much more enjoyable and memorable. There were also numerous complaints about the free continental breakfeast in the reviews. Having experienced the free continental breakfast first hand I can tell you that there is juice (including fresh squeezed orange juice), coffee, fresh crouisants, assorted fresh danish and assorted fruit, which is exactly what one would expect at a free continental breakfast. everything was fresh, delicious and, did I mention FREE. I dont see what all of the complaing was about. The location is wonderful. The loudest bar on Bourbon Street is the Famous Door, which is about fifty feet away from the hotel, yet you cannot hear a sound from your room. We did not have a car and never felt we needed one. The entire french quarter is within easy walking distance. We walked to the St. Charles Street car and rode all through the garden district. We walked back from Comanders Palace, which was real nice until we left the garden district, then things got a little shady, but we made it back in one piece. We took the ferry to algiers and went to mardi gras world, which was a bit pricey and kind of a tourist trap, but highly recomended none-the-less. We did a cemetary tour with haunted tours which was great. I did not pack any long pants as New Orleans is kind of like a festering tropical hell hole in the summer. As such, I could not eat at the Bombay Club, Commander's Palace, Antione's, Gallatiore's or any of the other really fancy places. However, we did not have a single bad meal the entire time we were there. We ate lunch at Monty's, the Napolean House (twice) and Felix's. We had Dinner at NOLA, Mr. B's, Muriels and we got takeout from the German bistro accross the street from the hotel. Every single one of these places I highly recomend. The food was my favorite thing about New Orleans. The only thing we did not like about our hotel was the view, however, we spent little time in the room. Ms. B's bistro is only open for the free continental breakfast. It would have been nice to have a casual bistro in the hotel.

The front desk was very helpful in calling taxis and as I arrived at the hotel a little early, they asked the maid service to clean my room as soon as possible and then called me when my room was ready.

It was nice to see more progress in and around the French Quarter and Canal Street. More new hotels and more new businesses and it was even busier than previous visits. Airboat Adventures was a great time and strongly recommended. The guides know their stuff and are on first names basis with the alligators, which can venture up on to the boats, but you will not be harmed. The Natchez Steamboat is lazy fun going down the river with a drink in hand. You cannot get better food than Commander's Palace, that was the best meal I have ever eaten.

The windows had great drapes, altho access to the drape pulls was a little challenging at some of the windows, had to move the chairs to get to them. There were no closet doors.

This year, after much review of online websites such asTripAdvisor, we decided to stay at the Prince Conti. People: Over the stay we intereacted with various housekeeping staff, receptionists and even the manager, all of which were pleasant and helpful. The manager went out of his way to ensure that our vacation was a special one. To get a fresh perspecitve one day a man was checking out and I asked him what he thought of the hotel. He stated that he loves the hotel and that this is the only hotel he stays at, and he's here on business a couple days each week. The manager is keen on repeat business and obviously knows the way to have people coming back time and time again. Location: The location of the Prince Conti is truly fantastic. It's less than a block from Bourbon St. and walking distance to absolutely everything in the quarter. Accomodations: We found our room to be very clean and comfortable. The only thing I have to warn you about is that the hotel does not have hundreds of rooms like the big hotel chains (Sheraton, Hilton, etc..) so book early or you might miss out on this New Orleans hidden gem. Also, I would recommend that you treat yourself and get one of the bigger rooms. They are a bit more expensive, but still quite affordable in comparison to other hotels in the quarter or downtown.

We got a Deluxe Double Queen room at a rate of $58/night. Here is a quick run-down overall of the pros and cons: PROS: Cheap rate during the off season and only half a block from Bourbon Street makes for a good location (Although their sister hotel Place D'Armes is closer to Jackson Square if you plan to frequent there) Hotel staff was very friendly except for one particular woman. They also have a printer to print boarding passes in the lobby (only to print passes, the one unfriendly woman berated me while trying to print my passes) but overall they gave me the room I requested on the 2nd floor. The room was always kept very clean and tidy and the bathroom was nice w/ marble floors and counters. CONS: The free breakfast was a bit of a joke, most mornings it was just croissants with orange juice and coffee; but it was free, so not going to complain so much. (Renovating their kitchen currently so offering free continental breakfast to their guests, not sure how much longer this will last) Try to get a room in the back of the hotel farthest away from Bourbon. There is a bar right on the corner 2-3 buildings down that you can hear very well if your room faces Conti Street. The Deluxe Queen Room we got was not nearly as charming as the photo they show online; no brick wall, no antiques, etc. It was a plain hotel room, no doubt about it. You might request a room with brick wall and antiques if going, as this was one reason I found the hotel charming, but overall did not impact my stay. I really enjoyed our trip overall at the Prince Conti. Its position allowed us to safely walk around at all hours of the night without going anywhere dicey. The area is totally safe, as I thought the entire Quarter was. I was out till around 2am with no problems any night even on the quieter streets.

Upon arriving at the hotel we checked in and all was good until we arrived at the room, all the unique furniture was gone, just hotel style furnishings filled the room, yuck. When we unpacked as we headed down stairs I asked the front desk about the furniture and was told it was just gone, quite rude actually, but never the less we weren't going to let that ruin our anniversary. The city itself was great, but just didn't seem quite the same, there seemed to be alot of rudeness among many store keepers and the people, almost like they didn't want us Canadian's down there.

An older looking elevator is just off to the side of the very small reception area. The room was very large and clean and had a big window. The shower and water pressure were great, and there were nice toiletries provided. One minor but weird little annoyance was that the TV (as is common in hotels) was encased in a stnad which had two doors. But the furniture wasn't designed too well because the doors didn't swing out far enough, so it was hard to get an unobstructed view of the TV! the furniture was nice though, and didn't seem cheap.

The staff at the front desk and the cleaning service was quite friendly and check in was a breeze. However, they did manage to sell us on a $4.95/day telecommunications deal that I don't think was necessary. It was to include high speed internet and unlimited incoming and outgoing phone calls w/ voicemail. We have cellphones so our reason for taking it was for the internet. The internet was an unsecured wireless set up which means that we could have used it without paying the additional $5/day. I probably would have complained but the room price was so reasonable, I didn't feel like I was being robbed. We had booked a Deluxe Room w/ a queen bed. Upon arrival we found the room to be very clean, spacious and nicely furnished. The Bombay Club, located on site, provided a great location for dinner to avoid the heavy rains outside. They managed to work the two of us in for dinner even though we did not make previous reservations. There is also Ms. D's onsite which is a breakfast cafe. The hotel is older so the following, while not a trip breaker for us, may be problems for those who expect perfection. The bathroom was SMALL but it was very clean which is more of a concern for me than the size. The water pressure in the shower could have been better but it didn't keep us from getting clean. The wallpaper was coming loose in a couple of places and there was a dripping noise from time to time in the ceiling. But, it is an older hotel and not a reason to avoid staying here.

I booked this hotel after reading positive reviews on Tripadvisor and because of the terrific location in the French Quarter. We looked at different rooms within the hotel before choosing one with actual windows. The rooms located in the interior of the hotel, have no windows and many of the rooms on the perimeter of the hotel face brick walls. We finally settled in room 334 which had windows looking over Conti Street (pronounced Con-Tie). The room was very small and besides a coffee maker and hair dryer, had no amenities. The bed was large but the bed spread was stained and the pillows flat. The bathroom had newer tile but the walls were cracked, moldy and, I'm not exaggerating, BUGS, lots of tiny bugs crawling in and out of the cracked walls, over the windows and the sink. My toiletry bags were covered in bugs after leaving them on the windowsill, they even crawled into my makeup, I had to zip them up and put them on top of the tv to avoid any more creepy crawlies. This was also the loudest hotel I have ever encountered. After arriving on a Friday morning, I tried to take an afternoon nap. However, the housekeeping staff was constantly in the halls, yelling to one another, slamming the storage closet doors and fighting over their personal lives. On Saturday morning, the housekeeping staff was cleaning the halls, the rooms, and again yelling up and down the hallways at 10 in the morning. And sure enough, on Sunday morning, at 9:00 a.m. they were yelling about which guest rooms were locked and who had the keys. The walls in the hotel are paper thin, so we heard every person in the hallway all weekend. And when someone with heavy footsteps walked by, the bed board actually vibrated. Dreadful! We ended staying at the hotel for 2 nights and 2 days because of the excellent location. Our favorite place in the French Quarter is the Bombay Club, which is located within the hotel, but is THANKFULLY not affiliated with the hotel itself. Since we began and ended each evening at the Bombay, the hotel was convenient. We also ate at the delicious Bayona Restaurant which is a 1/2 block from the hotel on Dauphine Street. The best breakfast in the French Quarter is at Petunia's on St. Louis Street, also 1/2 block from the hotel. The hotel staff was adequate and helpful in storing our luggage and hailing cabs. Besides the excellent location of this hotel, there is nothing to recommend it and we learned the hard way that location isn't everything.

I could hear the talking and joking, but this was always around 9-10am. I don't know if I would want that right outside my door, but they were never right outside my door anyway. You figure the noise is coming from a open room being cleaned. This too, did not seem like something to complain about. The bathroom was the size of a normal apartment bathroom. Mine was not \"ultra-tiny\". If you want the big Marriott, double sink bathroom, this isn't it however. Just a normal apartment style bathroom. The ceiling was a good 15 feet high. No air--but a air system that does not work so good. It was up to high and not doing much. There is a great ceiling fan though. It was on low. ( I had to stand on a chair to pull the chain!) and the room cooled right away. I woke up shivering most mornings. Lets see....everything was clean, no problems there. In the shower, the little pull did not want to stay up sometimes and I had to pull it hard to get it to do so. Cable TV but you cannot rent movies--no HBO etc. oh--by the weekend I had a bunch of girls in the room next to me. They were loud and I did hear them through the walls. So long as my TV was on I could not hear them. I would go back here, it is cheaper then what you will spend elsewhere. I read the reviews here to and was worried--but it all worked out. I did have one gripe though. My last day there I was getting ready to leave and saw something odd on the floor. Went over to look and saw the largest roach I have ever seen in person. Big and brown and they type that fly I imagine. It mush have crawled into the room from the hall. I kicked it, and it was dead--might have been the cold air.

We requested a non-smoking room (all rooms on the second floor are non-smoking) with two queen beds. The room is not overly large, but it met our needs. The bathroom is tiny, no counterspace, just a pedestal sink, tub & shower and toilet. Air Conditioning is climate controlled and there is also a ceiling fan (not available in all rooms). It was great having the ceiling fan for those hot days as it really cooled the room. Internet access is available for an additonal daily charge. Ice machines are located down the hall and complimentary coffee is available in your room. This hotel also has inside rooms which do not have any windows (think inside cabins on a cruise ship). The only drawback to our room #256 is that while we had a view, it was of the backside of a building and roof but since we didn't plan on spending a whole lot of time in our room it wasn't too big of an issue. Also, since this is an older hotel, the noise level outside our room is more noticeable. The walls are not very well insulated against noise so that you can hear your neighbor's TV and muffled conversation. For this reason, I'm only giving the hotel an above average rating rather than an excellent rating. The location of this hotel is excellent as it is just around the corner from Bourbon St. so you are within walking distance to restaurants and the streetcars.

Adjacent to the hotel is a restaurant (didn't eat there so can't say how good the food is) and the Bombay Club. Entertainment is nice but did not have dinner there only drinks at the bar.

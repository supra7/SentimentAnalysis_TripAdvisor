The best thing about the Midtown is it\u2019s location. It\u2019s in Back Bay, which is a really nice neighbourhood, right opposite the Christian Science Centre (well worth a visit to the Mapparium), and two minutes from the Prudential Centre. Copley Square, Newbury Street and Boyslton Street with shops and eating places minutes away. There are a few T stations just up the road (really easy to use the underground) and the Old Town Trolley Bus stops opposite the Prudential Centre, useful for sightseeing and as transport. We were so tired by the evening so it was great to be near the Prudential Centre, where we normally ate but there are other places close.

We felt that the fee for parking our car was very reasonable for a city. We left the laptop at home, we came to tour the city and the school so wifi was not a concern. No complaints from me. We really just slept and showered in our room. Our bed was very comfortable. I could see how some claustrophobic guests might be uncomfortalbe in the small bathroom.

The air conditioning fan is very loud, so much that when it goes off it wakes you up to complete silence or outside noise. The flat screen tv was very nice. The best part of the hotel is Ron the morning desk clerk! He was friendly and very helpful. He even printed us a map and gave us directions to the colleges.

The choice proved to be perfect and all three were delighted as they felt the flexibility of travel choice gave them complete freedom to be independent to travel when, where and how they pleased and also be able to improvise easily with our son and his student friends. Bus,train,taxi, or foot, every-thing you need is literally 2 minutes away. Four of us (my wife and two teenage children) stayed again in August 2011. Again the staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. I have read many reviews on Mid-Town including some with derogatory remarks. What I would say to any dissenter is this: apart from hauling luggage to and from a room (for a family) who needs a lift in a two story building? The hallway carpets have been replaced. I have often been in hotels that say they have internet, have and then charge a fortune to use it! Its at the Mid Town and that's the main thing. The only critter I met during my stay was when we stayed over night in New York, (and that critter was on the street). There is a grand heated outdoor pool with towels provided. It is a great activity for those who wish to rest within the hotel during the day. The beds were very comfortable with clean white linen along with towels etc replaced by house keepers who were totally unobtrusive. Of course they knock on your door; and they have to start somewhere at 9.00 am; and there is a door jam/safety lock on your door plus a non disturb sign! We slept contentedly with no noise interference and perfect air con. Who in their right mind would bother wasting valuable city centre space on breakfast when you can have any choice of breakfast from around the world in the Prudential Centre exactly five minutes from bedroom to food service! There are also other excellent places even closer. I stood in a good quality N.Y hotel for breakfast where the self service left us with poor fruit juice,cold eggs, poor tea, paper plates and cups and then no place to sit! Next time any of you stay in a large Hotel just for fun time how long it takes from closing your door, traveling down a corridor, waiting for a lift, sharing it , making small talk, making your way to breakfast room, waiting for seat allocation.... get the picture? Mark kindly provided an extra bed so our student son could stay with us at night on a few occasions, and you know how cluttered a room can get with five plus suitcases laptops and different types of hand bags, shoulder bags, shopping bags, news papers, city maps, excursion maps , fliers etc! The house keepers somehow managed to do their job yet never move or interfere with anything other than what was in the bins. Safe keeping is discreetly provided at front desk. The staff mind their own business until approached and then were most courteous and helpful. Special mention for Kevin, Cornelius and Mark. In a rush to meet some friends who were just able to squeeze in time for a meal half an hour away and burning time trying to hail a taxi, Mark caught sight of the situation and walked out unto Huntington Ave, stopped a taxi and literally saved our evening! On our departure I asked Mark what I needed to do on tipping and his beaming retort was there was no need other than the staff to do their job which they enjoyed. I will never forget that one. Then poor Cornelius brought down our five suitcases and bags to rest room and subsequently to taxi and when I tipped him he insisted I take back half nor did he take no for an answer.

If I had a second chance I would have slept in my car. As soon as we arrived in the hotel for pricing two rooms, the staff who desperately needed some coffee, rudely told my friends and I that they could only supply us with wireless internet if we booked our two rooms. He implied that we were going to use the net to run out the door and book another hotel. That was real cheesy, but it got worse. After hearing a outrageous price for two rooms, we booked because it was late at night and we were all tired. Now that we had paid the staff over $250 not including the cost of parking we thought we could now use the internet. However that was not to be. The staff told us we had to pay for the wireless with a credit card or use the archaic computer in the corner of the lobby with a credit card slot! When we attempted to travel two our rooms we found that the staff had placed our two rooms at opposite sides of the hotel, ie. a 10 minute walk down a rabbit warren of hallways that a room cleaner told us some people never make it out of. As my buddy and I entered our room we where pleasantly surprised to find that our lights did not work in our Russian gulag looking room. After another ten minute hike down the suicide inducing hallways we found that out other buddy's room was around twice the size and with more than 6 TV channels as featured in our own room that we had paid the same price for. Go figure. Going back to the light issue, we found that in order for our lights to work, the main room switch had to be in the off position and the table lights bulbs were blown. One actually nice feature about this hotel was that the rooms showers do not have coin slots as I was convinced they must have. In the morning we had to wait behind a gentlemen who was complaining that his \"paid for\" ten minutes of wireless time was not connecting. Do you think he was refunded? I will let you decide that for yourself. In a nut shell, when visiting this hotel I would just carry a picket sign with my credit card numbers written on to save myself some time and pain.

A subway Aside from this the experience was less than stellar. The parking, while available is limited. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s d\u00c3\u00a9cor is dated. The carpet looks old and dirty to the point we elected not to walk in bare feet. The first morning there, a family member awoke to find a large roach stuck under their suitcase. This did not reinforce our comfort level with the hotel. Well not unexpected, the street noise is really bad. If people on the sidewalk stopped or were talking on the phone outside our room window their conversations were completely audible. Sirens throughout the night felt and sounded as though they would come right through the room. At one point a family member paid $2.00 for a bottle soda from a vending machine. They stated it tasted poorly, and alas the expiration date had come and gone. A computer in the lobby requires a credit card and WiFi is a charge, too. If one is looking for inexpensive, convenient accomodations in Boston the Midtown might work.

The desk staff are pleasant as are the housekeeping staff. We had booked for 11 nights and the first 7 were uneventfull, however on the 8th night we were kept awake till 3am by the room above us. My husband complained to the front desk and the noise did go down a little, and eventually at 5:30 it stopped. There were 3 groups booked into the hotel that day, one of them being high school kids who come to Boston for Uni visits. The next night was slightly better but the layout of the hotel is over 2 floors and there was an exit door at the end of the corridor which can be accessed 24 hrs, meaning that guests can come in this door without going past the front desk- resulting in many young people going past your room at all hours-noisy. I spoke with the manager on the second morning asking if the group leaders could remind their groups that other guests were staying in the hotel, and he informed me that the group was checking out that day- hurrah. However when we arrived back that evening another group of kids were checking in- my husband spoke to a very understanding girl at the desk, who said that this group were in rooms all over the hotel, but she could move us to another room at the back of the hotel which would be quieter. We then had the last 2 nights in peace. So I would recommend that if you intend to stay here in March/ April- ask for a quiet room.

When we arrived, my colleague had already arranged for a roll out bed for the floor, and the desk clerk explained that this would cost extra, despite that we had already ordered it. The price calculation it gives you does not take this into account. Nor does it take into account their outrageous parking fee. But that opens another matter I'll come back to in a moment, a coercive ugly matter. The room was tenable upon first inspection, nothing fancy but nothing horribly shabby either. Frankly it seems like the majority of the budget was spent on the LCD television. The internet access is for pay, and by the way, it's not wifi, so I hope you roll around with cat5 cables in your luggage or you'll have to wait until you can walk down to the Panera. The security was decent despite our view of the brazen graffiti from our window, and we never had any fear of the cleaning staff stealing our possessions. This was largely because the cleaning staff was remiss in their duties to begin with. We came back one evening to find the room smelling of mildew and only one of the beds made. I'm still puzzling over why they would bother to make just the one bed and leave the other. The desk staff again was curt and practically useless, there was a gentleman at the tourism desk who gave me the phone numbers I'd need to call for pizza but if you should ring the service desk by mistake or simply have an inquiry be prepared for a conversation with a rude clerk. Finally, I want to discuss the parking fee policy, which is the most shady piece of rubbish I've ever seen in a hotel, keeping in mind that I've traveled in four continents and stayed at dozens of hotels on all ends of the price scale. Shadiest practice EVER: You must pay a fee (I believe it's 15-18$ each night) in order to park your car in their cramped garage in which exit signs direct you to dead ends. HOWEVER, you can escape this fee, if you should check into the hotel using foursquare. That's right, give them free viral marketing or pay them a fee. Outrageous. I've been at many establishments that ask for customers to use internet apps of this kind to add to their publicity but never have I had such a rat hole demand this in return for not charging me a hidden fee. If you want me to tweet or facebook or foursquare your hotel you need to step up your service, not charge me more hidden fees.

Pros beyond location and price are that the front desk is always staffed and very good, housekeeping is very quick, usually done by 2 PM, and wifi is pretty fast - we got 10 MBPS and could stream netflix. Cons - very thin walls which when the school kid trip came to town was really annoying. A lot of the vending machines were broken. The furniture, bathrooms, and decor were very dated.

Those are the two good points. The room itself was most unpleasant. After about 30 seconds, the inside lining of my nostrils started to tingle and then just plain felt sore and stinging. It's a day later, I'm at home and my nose is still bleeding somewhat. I am not someone who is usually sensitive to these things so I have to conclude that their choice of product(s) for the purpose of cleaning the room is some concoction of industrial strength toxic detergents that would probably prove cancerous if exposed to it everyday for \"x\" amount of time!!!!! Truly distressing. One note here: the bathroom appeared very clean. I put a plastic wrapper from a plastic glass they provide you over the tv remote and I immediately removed the polyester bedspread. Eeewww. Sheets and towels seemed clean, bright white and soft. As other people have posted, charged for internet connection. We had just returned from a third world country and even hotels there provided free connection! Really. How do they justify this cost? Our signal was okay but we only paid for it once for two hours. Plumbing noise is a very big problem for those who are looking to sleep at this hotel. You can hear adjacent room occupants shower, use the sink and flush the toilet as well as their conversations. And they weren't yelling; it's just flimsy walls. And because people are coming and going at all hours (I'd ask in advance if neighbors are getting up for an early flight so you can be far away from the noise!) it's a foregone conclusion you'll be awakened during the night at least once. And let me not forget to mention the slamming doors!!!! Walls are like paper and doors sound like prison doors in the wee hours. If you use the elevators, don't look closely. It's gotta be 20 years since anyone ever cleaned the insides. Most likely a petri dish for many nasty germs and bugs. Take the stairs if filth bothers you.

I couldn't beat it anywhere. So I gave it a shot, and was pleasantly surprised. We arrived and parked in the convenient garage below the hotel and went to check in. I guess it is normally $18 dollars a night to park but if you are going to a sporting event (we were going to see the Bruins) the parking is free. We reserved a standard king on the first floor with a street view, and were quickly checked in by the front desk staff who were beyond nice. We went up to our room and were very skeptical at this point, the hallways were long and confusing, and very poorly lit. So we made it to our room and we were very impressed! The rooms must have had an overhaul because a lot of people said the furniture and decor was out dated..not so much in our room. It was a very large room with a nice table with chairs, modern looking lamps and a 32\" HDTV! With options to order a movie. So DONT pay attention to the older photos in this review..it was a very nice room. The bathroom was very small but very clean..I mean come on, its not like we are going to be sleeping in there! The bed was freshly made and very comfortable. When we went to sleep that night, the heater was a little loud, but nothing unbearable..and we didnt hear ANY traffic regardless of the fact the street was right out of our window..so we had a VERY comfortable sleep. The staff is amazing. The next day, we went to go have breakfast, and we got some very generous discount coupons from a restaurant place down the street owned by their sister hotel (The Clonnade). The concierge offered me a complimentary paper for my breakfast and told me to enjoy my meal..he was so very nice. We came back, got ready to go out and watch the Patriots at a local bar and the concierge stepped outside and grabbed a cab for us! He was always available and made our stay even more impressionable. There was a 10 dollar charge for 24 hour WiFi access which is a little unheard of these days..but I was on a trip to enjoy time with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e..not cruise the internet. You cant beat the location of this hotel..it is RIGHT NEXT to the Symphony T stop..its not in between the two, the building is just so long it takes 2 minutes to walk from the lobby doors to the entrance to the T...you could not get any more convenient. We went to the Bruins game and the front desk staff gave us some menu options for late night dining, and we took full advantage. We checked out the next day with no problems. So yes, the hallways need more lighting and the outside looks dated. But WHO CARES? We paid half of what someone across the street at the Sheraton paid and still got the 5 star treatment from staff members and thats whats most important. We weren't treated like tourists on a budget..we were treated like real people. So are there on site amenities? No..but walk 5 minutes and use a coupon the hotel gives you. Its worth it. Is there a charge for parking? yes..but significantly cheaper than any hotel and FREE if you show them a sporting event ticket.

I paid $100 p/n inclusive of taxes for our stay here and I must say that for a hotel this conveniently located with reasonable amenities, this was a total bargain.

The only other drawbacks observed were that they plumbing from adjacent rooms was a bit loud in the morning, but aside from that I never heard any of the neighbours.

I was a little concerned by the reviews, but having visited the states extensively over the last few years and never having had a bad experience with an American hotel, thought it would probably be ok! How wrong I was. The lobby is grey and dismal with a dirty, old smell about it. Check in was fine and we then dragged our luggage to the first floor. On entering our room it smelt very strongly of stale tobacco. I returned to reception and asked for a room that did not smell. They began by being very gracious and apologetic and gave me a new room immediately, advising a staff member would check out the smelly room! We dragged our cases to our new room on the second floor. Quicker to drag your cases than take the elevator! Our new room was awful, dismal, mismatching wall paper, broken window, broken towel rail, the list goes on it was just gross. We decided as the hotel was booked and paid for that we would grit our teeth and get on with it! We left the hotel via reception, in order to find something to eat. When passing back through the reception area an employee of the hotel started shouting across the room that \"there was nothing wrong with the room (whatever number it was) that I had asked to be moved from.\" It was rude, unecessary, gross behaviour and done so that I could here him. I can only assume the employee who checked out the room had aclimatised to the smell of the hotel, but please be assured it stank. I have been travelling for over 34 years to many countries and have never had to ask for a room change before! With regards to the beds, you can see the mattresses as they have no valences, and they look old, tired and sag in the middle. I am not sure if the bed linen was off white or cream, but it was old and horrible. I have never ever felt unhappy about getting into a hotel bed, but I did at the Midtown, and covered my pillow with a T.shirt and wore as much clothing as I could in bed, so that I did not have to touch the bed clothes. It was all very old, very dated and very unacceptable. The rooms are noisey and you were kept awake by the noise. When we were waiting for our shuttle to the airport, the reception staff talked noisely amongst themselve and there appeared to be a total lack of professionlism. Rest rooms in lobby were very unclean when we used them. This hotel is in urgent need of a face lift.

Picked it for its close location to the school and booked the room online for $169 for the night which is a pretty good deal for a hotel that seemed close to everything . After arriving in Boston, I could tell from the exterior that it was an older property but I figured it's only for one night so who cares? I checked in around 9:30PM and was told that it would cost me $18 to park my car in their garage for the night. I thought that was a bit strange, having never had to pay for parking at a hotel before but I figured this was a big city so maybe it was normal. I eventually found the main elevator after dragging my bag upstairs and down a musty, dark hallway only to find that when I got to my room, I was given key cards that apparently did not work. I went back down to the desk, they reprogrammed the key cards and I hauled my bag back upstairs to the room again, only to find that the cards STILL didn't work. Back down to the lobby again and told that I would have to be escorted to my room by someone with a Master Key, which did finally work. Once in the room, I found it clean enough I guess, but definitely dated and run down. All I wanted to do was watch get something to eat (which involved being escorted back to my room after I got dinner, with the master key) and watch TV. But The TV channel displays did not match what was actually on the TV. They said they had HBO but in fact, when I tuned to HBO, it was another channel entirely. Giving up on TV I felt a bit warm in the room. Unfortunately the air conditioning did not work. That must be why they left one of the windows open. My room was facing the very noisy Huntington Avenue. So when I tried to shut the window so I could get some sleep, I found that the window was broken and could not be shut. I had to listen to trucks blaring by all night long. To add insult to injury when my bill arrived in the morning, they charged me $200/night for the night instead of the $169 that I had booked online bringing the total bill to over $250 for a crappy night sleep in a noisy room. When I complained to the manager, they did fix the bill and waived the $18 parking charge as a way of apologizing for all the inconveniences.

And what a fine city it is as well! Having decided to get away for a few days, i thought it was time to heed my brothers advice and book a trip to Boston. He only had good things to say about it, so i thought it was time to find out for myself especialy as i'd never been before. I have to say i was rather alarmed at the prices of hotels there, and it was as much for this reason that i decided to book The Midtown. All other options were too expensive!! I must confess to being slightly concerned as to whether i'd done the right thing. The pictures on the net didn't fill me with hope as they made it out to be little more than a cheap motel, and as the shuttle driver pulled up outside these fears were enhanced even more! I wondered what on earth i'd let myself in for! Well what a surprise...the very friendly staff checked me in and arranged for my bag to be sent to my room. The corridors were clean and tidy, i also saw drinks and ice machines. Arrived at my room and was greeted by a huge area..Ok, nothing special in the decor etc, but of a high basic standard. Bathroom with toilet seperated with a door to the wash basin area..not big but perfectly acceptable. Once again very clean. The only slight downer was that i had one of the 'road views' so i did have a fair amount of road noise, but you can't have everything! A knock on the door and there was the bell man with my bag..he gave me his name and said if i needed any help with maps, directions or any information i need only ask. You cant want for more! The staff were like this the whole time i was there and i can't praise them enough. The only negative aspect of the hotel is the lack of an on-site restaurant..now does this matter when i'm sure most people would eat out anyway? Well i believe you should at least have the option. As others have said there is Thorntons, a nice breakfast cafe which is three hundred yards down the road, as well as the Prudential Centre which is a five minute walk away where you have numerous eating options. Room service was always done efficiently, i only actually met the maid on my last morning and that was only as i was staying in the room a little longer due to checking out! Check out was also painless, they also stored my bag for me for the day as i was catching a mid evening flight back to the UK. As regards transportation, the trolley tour bus stops right outside the hotel, the 'T' stop is in the Prudential Centre, which as i've said is a five minute walk, and if you'd rather walk, well thats fine as it is such a compact city you can virtually walk anywhere, and its the best way to look around anyway! A quick word about Boston...Superb! So much to do and see. If you need to get out of the city for a day or two, you've got superb coastline to explore..I took a day excursion to Cape Cod..what a stunning area. All in all one of the best trips to the States i've had. If you book The Midtown you may fear the worst, but i reckon you'll think to yourself..'I'd be more than happy to stay here again' which is exactly what i thought as i was driven to Logan Airport for my flight home. The location is spot on, the staff are very friendly and the hotel throughout is very clean. Dont let the pictures put you off staying at this little gem! A big name chain it may not be, but it offers the personal touch to your stay which they just cant compete with!

Hotel overall was OK....small two storey hotel conveniently situated in city. Staff friendly and efficient. No restaurant on site but a Thorntons restaurant one hundred yards along street for breakfast and snacks, so too is a small convenience store, plus at the second traffic light turn right, walk fifty yards to a 7-11 convenience store, walk another 100 yards past 7-11 to a liquor store. Rooms good size but bathrooms tiny, with very small vanity area outside bathroom. Plumbing noisy on occasions. Plenty of towels, changed daily. Comfortable beds. For our first two nights we were in room 134 at the back of the hotel with a small window overlooking parking area and another opaque window looking onto interior corridor so very little natural light. However this room was quiet. We had no qualms about returning here for our last two nights in Boston. On our return we were in room 110 on first floor overlooking sidewalk and road, much more light, room spec the same but slightly larger with more storage space and more noise which however did diminish at night, except for the family of elephants in the room above ours. Maybe a good idea to ask for a room on upper floor. Diagonally across the road is The Prudential Centre for shopping and a food court. Check out the view from the 50th floor Skywalk. Just a few yards further is a large Shaws supermarket outside of which is the starting point for the Boston Duck Tour(very overated and overpriced, I would give this one a miss). With the exception of a splash down in The Charles River you would see the same sights on the city tour. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Copley Square, Boston Common, Quincy Market and very pleasant Frog Pond gardens. Plenty of restaurants and fast food outlets nearby.

As with another poster, first impression was Oh Dear (very 50s/60s lobby & dreary but new gray paint on corridor walls) but our room was clean, security guy very evident esp. late at night, and wonderfully helpful cheerful staff changed that impression quickly. It's actually an old motor court type building, with cars corralled in the central courtyard -- ours slept there for $14/night. Beat that elsewhere in the city! The first floor is nonsmoking (what we wanted) & these rooms are partially over this car court, so the floor was cold when we got in--but things warmed up when we turned on the heat. Do bring slippers or flip flops. The heat is air, not baseboard, and it blows in noisily unless you turn the blower very low, and the heat up--separate controls. The trick about the noise is turning the blower low. The TV was dismal ---small screen, & several channels very staticky esp the Weather Channel the one we really wanted! However, we had not come to Boston to sit in the hotel & watch TV! So it didn't really bother us. We paid $99/night the week between Christmas & New Years, so we have no complaints. The things we really wanted were cleanliness, safety & near to the T & we got those. We have stayed at 4 & 5 star hotels that were not as clean & had less pleasant staff. The rooms are huge by city hotel standards. Lots of room for families to spread out or for you to place your purchases if you are on a shopping expedition. The price allowed us to place more of our budget in enjoyments such as the ballet. Our room appeared to have been redone recently---new dark green patterned carpet & new looking fabric on chairs, also Craftsman style headboards. There is a coffee maker & the little packets are replenished daily. Corian sink top was generously sized for placing toiletries & not getting them soaked. Sink is separated by pocket door from shower/toilet, and shower section has shelves above toilet for towels/clothes. However, the fan & lights are together which means the rather noisy bathrooom fan went on whenever you used anything---that I did find irritating. On New Years Eve we did hear some guests going up & down the hall, but they weren't that bad & it only lasted a few minutes----and what else do we expect on New Years Eve? We did not ever hear our neighbors in rooms to either side at all. There was a sign saying the in house restaurant is closed for renovations. The desk clerk also mentioned that some of the rooms in the smoking section, on the second floor, are being redone. The guest who had checked in just before us came right back to say his room smelled smoky, and they sent someone there to spray it with something that looked like a can of Lysol. This was a nosmoking room---I want to know why, oh why, do smokers smoke in nonsmoking rooms. There are people who request those rooms because they have asthma and the lingering smoke will trigger an attack of their disease---they aren't being snooty about your smoke; they just don't want to wind up in the hospital during their trip! Maybe all hotels should take Marriott's step & ban all smoking period. There is internet connection in the lobby; we saw people using it. Our trip was pleasure only & we did not bring the laptop so I can't address the connections. There is a T stop at Symphony, half block west, and another one block east at Prudential. Towards Pru less than a block a cafe, Thornton's, with really excellent breakfasts & lunches. The Prudential center is across the street & down the block. In the Pru center, there is a St Francis Chapel on the ground floor & we were able to go to Mass on Sunday morning. There is an Au Bon Pain right across from the chapel so you can go there for a bite after church if desired. We wanted to watch the Pats/Giants game with others & had a teen with us, so she could not be in a pub or sports bar after 8 pm. We learned there is an Uno restaurant right up Huntington Ave past & across from Symphony Hall. It has loads of TVs & being a restaurant the underage can be there well into the night. It's on the same side of street as the Midtown. We would go back to this hotel in a minute---while it is very simple in decor, the very affordable price & the excellent location, cleanliness & lovely staff made it the right choice for us. It is right between the museums we wanted to visit & the downtown things, and also has easy access to the Mass Pike to get in & out of town when we visited relatives in the burbs.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cBad soundproofing\u201d", "Author": "TheHighrise", "ReviewID": "UR12160454", "Content": "I was delighted to find such a reasonably priced hotel in Boston, and had high hopes for my stay.

Initial impressions of the place were good. Ron at the reception desk was very friendly, and our check-in was handled in a matter of seconds. An equally affable porter offered to take our bags to the room, which was number 172. The room was huge; two double beds, a desk, small table and seating area, plus a good sized bathroom with bath and shower. The facilities were good too - nice TV with plenty of channels, and a funky little cafetiere for making fresh coffee. Everything was very clean, though the decor was slightly dated, and the bathroom suite showed some signs of age. I'm not one to pick at such things, however, so all in all we were happy. Being somewhat jet-lagged, we decided a short nap was in order. Sadly, I didn't get a wink of sleep. No sooner had we settled down, we were subjected to an ongoing cacophony of slamming, shouting, and what sounded like the practising of an inexperienced drummer. The noise irritated me somewhat, but given that this was still only late afternoon, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bothered. Our siesta having been abandoned, we decided to explore a little. The location of the hotel was very good. The immense Prudential shopping centre was just a couple minutes walk away, and had a subway stop to get wherever we should want. Massachusetts Avenue, with its assorted shops and restaurants, was only a few minutes walk in the opposite direction. So, having been fed and watered, we returned to the hotel for a well-deserved (and by then long overdue) night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. Unfortunately, once again I found sleep hard to come by. It seems that the noise of the Midtown hotel persists at all hours of day and night. Doors slamming, voices shouting, and a variety of crashes, bangs and wallops - all conspired to rob me of a restful slumber. After two such disturbed nights, we did complain to reception, who said they could only help us if we were able to tell them which rooms, specifically, the noises were coming from. Not wanting to wander around the hotel in our pyjamas in search of the parties responsible, we decided just to grin and bear it. In time, we got used to the constant racket, but felt annoyed that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever had to. In summary, I was a bit disappointed by the Midtown. The room was large, comfortable, and reasonably well-equipped, while the location was very good. However, the ongoing noise of the place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent unwillingness to help \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put me off, and means that if I do ever return to Boston, it is unlikely I will rest my head at the Midtown.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Armagh, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cch ch ch check it out!\u201d", "Author": "BigJaydog", "ReviewID": "UR6805545", "Content": "Excellent location, spacious room and it appears the hotel is under a refurb so the summer might be a great time to go.

The staff were very very friendly, and nothing was too much bother. The room we had was huge, two double beds, tv, en-suite bathroom, ground floor and lovely and warm. Our room was to the back of the hotel. We did not need car parking. We got a taxi from the airport and we asked if it was a set fare, but the guy running the taxi stance said no, it was metered. We got in and the taxi driver talked all the way, asking us where we came from etc, and we then noticed the meter was not on, so we just left it. He asked us to telephone on the day we were leaving and he would come for us. We asked the price and he said $28.00, so we gave him $40, a tip of $12, as he was so nice. When we were leaving we did not bother to phone him as we thought we would just hail a taxi outside, so we did just that only to find out this taxi had the meter on and it came to $20.40 even although we were stuck in traffic (5pm)!!! The guy coming had conned us and into the bargain we had given him the extra. If you are getting a taxi from the airport, check that the meter is on and dont be conned. Anyway, back to the hotel, the Prudential centre is 2 minutes from the hotel, and it had lots of shops, food terrace, restaurants etc. The Cheesecake Factory is also in this builiding and for anyone not from the US, they have gorgeous cheesecakes, but they also do delicous food and cocktails. Open from 11.30 am until 11.30pm S-T, and 12.30 on a Friday and Saturday. We ate here twice. The portions are huge, and 1 piece of cheesecake is enough for two, and if you leave any food they automatically ask if you want to have it wrapped!!! I also bought a $10 phone card and I used it in the hotel room, which is great, and they only charge 50cents for letting you use the phone. My card let me have four conversations on land lines in the UK, from 20-30 minutes EACH, then a mobile in the UK for 20 minutes, and I still had time left on the card when I left!!! We like our breakfasts so we found the Marriott Hotel on the same side as the hotel further up the road (about 5 minutes walk) go up the escalator and you will see the breakfast room, they do a menu, or we had the buffet breakfast which was marvellous for the money. First day we had, oatmeal (like porridge), FRESH orange juice, coffee or tea, french toast with strawberries, pineapple and oranges, and maple syrup, and a blueberry muffin. There is LOTS to choose from. We thought the buffet was $18.95, but when the waitress saw we did not have anything cooked (sausage, bacon etc), she said it was only $13.95. Great value for money. You can eat as much as you like. We also had a meal at Legal Seafood in the Prudential Centre, but I would suggest booking on a Friday or saturday, which the hotel did for us. If you want shopping in one place with lots of bargains in the stores, we got the T to Kendal (about 10 minutes over the Charles river) $1.25 each way, and then there is a courtesy bus at the bus stop 4 times an hour, to take you to the Galleria (5 minutes), open until 9.30pm. Shops include, Macys, Saks, Old Navy, Sears, Best Buy, Ann Taylor, Benetton, H&M, Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch, Banana Republic, Timberland, Book shops, Toy shops, Banks,Shoe shops, in fact they have everything. They also have a food terrace, which had every kind of fast food. The Cheesecake factory is here also. the reason we went here was for Old Navy as this is the only one in Boston.

We decided to make a real visit of it and came in through the subway, which very conveniently had a stop so close to the Midtown Hotel that we could see it from the street as soon as we exited the subway! Though by no means a fancy hotel, I thought the hotel was well worth the money. The Prudential is one block away, offering budget priced, delicious food. We walked to Fenway Park-it was that close. After the game, I was disapointed there were no restaurants close to the hotel still open, but the front desk clerk advised that there was a pizza place open until 12:30 a.m., only 3 blocks from the hotel. He had recommended Boston House of Pizza, but being tired, we missed it, and went into the tiny pizza place right next to B.H.O.P. instead, and were glad we did. The atmosphere was nothing, but the pizza was excellent and very reasonably priced. Although I mostly agree with the reviews concerning the furniture, I did not find the accommodations as run down as suggested, nor did I expect much better, considering the price of the other hotels in the same vicinity. Bonus-the rooms are very large. If you cannot afford the Ritz, and we certainly can't, this hotel is well worth the price tag-and the location cannot be beat! We either walked to most places in Boston, or took the subway to the more distant spots, with the subway entrance right at the Prudential. The outdoor pool was quite nice, with lounge chairs all around. I did walk into the hotel restaurant, but decided not to try the food as it was miserably hot in there-and no air conditioning-or it wasn't turned on. Only 2 small problems-at 6:00 a.m. it was not possible to get really hot water, only warm, and the first floor ice machine was broken the whole time we were there.

The best he could do was offer to move me to a non-smoking room for our second night. Smoking room: it was terrible. It not only smelled heavily of stale smoke, but also of stale urine (even my husband, a former smoker couldn't stand it). The room decor was old and like a cheap motel (for example, the tv wasn't inside a wooden armoire, but was perched on top of a pole that was screwed into the floor.) I had to put a t-shirt over my pillow just to sleep because the pillow stank of smoke. I kept waking up coughing because of the condition of the room.

It was newer, had nice dark furniture (tv was inside of an armoire), it was bigger, clean, it smelled fresh, and was a great deal. If I could have stayed in this room for the entire stay, and had never seen that other room, I would have rated this hotel above average. The place really is in a nice location (walking distance to prudential center, the T, and great restaurants/shopping), and you can't beat having free parking in downtown Boston! The price is really excellent, but before staying there again, I would call and confirm any and all room requests, or else you might get stuck in that pit of a room we had.", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing ..\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5187179", "Content": "Smelly hotel.

The hotel is located on the south side of the river, just south of the big Christian Science complex. It is within convenient walking distance of the T, and there are lots of stores in the area that can provide fast food, perscription meds, hardware, and small electronics. The cab in from the airport had trouble finding the street address at ten at night, so print a map before you come. The staff is friendly and efficient: the concierge / porter in particular never failed to ask if I needed directions to where I was going. The room was huge (about 2X the size of a normal hotel room) but sparsely furnished and dark. I was on the back, away from the street, and it was reasonably quiet and free of glare from adjacent buildings and streets.

I would normally go to New York, but this year, anything below $150 a night for a single room, and you start noticing words like mice, roaches and \"in desperate need of cleaning\". So I looked a bit further afield and came up with this gem. They are certainly not words that you are ever likely to find in any review of this hotel. Sure, it doesn't look flashy, especially against the high rise Hilton and Sheriton across the road, but it's clean, comfortable, friendly and in a location that makes the life of a tourist very easy. Oh, did I mention it's also very cheap! Thanks to one of their special offers, I paid only $400 for six nights for single occupancy of a double room which was massive compared to some hotel rooms I've paid a lot more for. As well as being fairly large, the room I had was clean, plenty of storage space, with a well supplied bathroom with plenty of hot water (but it takes about a minute to come through so let it run before climbing in the shower). The beds were comfortable enough even for someone like me who rarely sleeps well in a strange bed. The only disappointing thing was the lack of tea making facilities. They do provide a coffee percolator but no way of simply boiling hot water. Some of the reviews on here have criticised the customer service at the hotel, but I have to say that they couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Finding somewhere to eat wasn't a problem either. I didn't use the cafe attached to the hotel, mainly because of the limited menu and the fact that nobody else seemed to use it. For breakfast, I can recommend Thorntons diner about 100 yards up towards the Prudential Centre, and in the evening you've got the whole of Boston to choose from thanks to the MBTA (the \"T\" as it's known locally) station (Symphony or Prudential on the Green \"E\" line) being on the doorstep with a direct link into the heart of the city. The proximity to the tram line was a godsend, as it meant that I didn't have to plan for a whole day out and carry everything I needed. I could go out and do some shopping in the morning, slip back to the hotel lunchtime, and be back in the City in 30 minutes to do some sight-seeing in the afternoon. It's also cheap to get around on the T, a 7 day visitors pass costing $35 which is good for the trams, subway buses and some local commuter rail journeys. As a first time visitor to Bostom, I was well impressed, enough that I will no doubt return and would have no hesitation in going back to the Midtown. It had everything that I wanted to make a holiday comfortable and enjoyable. I probably wouldn't have gained any more benefit if I had stayed at the Sheriton.", "Date": "February 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cNice stay at Midtown\u201d", "Author": "commscholar", "ReviewID": "UR4359196", "Content": "This hotel is not fancy.

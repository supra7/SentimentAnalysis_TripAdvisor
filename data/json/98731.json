The executive lounge was nicely decorated but breakfast offerings are minimal continental and the chardonnay pour for $7.50 is the same stuff they pour for free at the Embassy Suites down the street, at least should be upgraded to Bogle or Beringer for that price, the per bottle profit will still be three times the cost.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "1000 Islands, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Business Hotel\u201d", "Author": "1000Islands", "ReviewID": "UR125044213", "Content": "My stay at the Hilton Anatole made for a successful trip to the Dallas Market. I was fortunate to get a very attractive car/hotel package rate for the property during the January market week. Located just across the freeway from the Market, with quick and regular shuttle service during shows the Hilton was very convenient. The public spaces and room were definately up to Hilton standards. Our room was clean and well appointed with a comfortable bed. We found a burnt out bulb in the bathroom when we arrived and the TV reception was quirky. I only mention this because of the Anatole's response - both problems were fixed within a few minutes of calls to the desk. Another plus was the campus-like layout of the hotel. Having listened to the distant bass beat of too many wedding bands in poorly planned hotels, I was nervous when a large evening affair arrived in the hotel's meeting rooms the second night of our stay. But, no noise filtered up to our room. The mix of restaurants and bars on site proved to be just what we needed. The food and service at the Media Grill was very good. The real trip-saver was the Hilton's Counter Offer take out restaurant. It let us grab a quick coffee and breakfast on our way to the show without wasting much time or money - very refreshing to see a full service hotel offer a food choice that doesn't overcharge for convenience. My only nit is one common to many full service properties - the hotel charges a substantial fee for basic in-room Internet connection. Worse, I couldn't even find a common wifi connection in the lobby areas.

I had quite a few unfortunate experiences and other guests that were also staying in the hotel were amazed at how disorganized and falling apart this hotel was. The front desk at the \"Tower\" side had a very large problem of communication. I paid for a King Size bed in a No Smoking room and was given a room with two doubles, when I told the girl at the front desk she told me that the rooms were not assigned by her and that all Kings were full. The next morning after taking a shower, the water would not turn off. No matter how hard I tried the water was still pouring out. I told the girl at the front desk before I left and asked her to get maintenance up to my room as water was still running from the shower. She said she would, I left to continue my day. When I cam back 5 hours later, I checked in with the new front desk clerk to see if the shower had been fixed. He called maintenance and they told him that a ticket had NEVER been made up and that they would do that right now. I went to my room changed my clothes and then had to leave two hours later, never did maintenance show up while I was in my room. I then left again and asked the same desk clerk to have my room cleaned and make sure the shower was fixed by the time I got back, which would be an hour or so. He said he woul. When I returned 2 hours later I purposely checked with the new front desk clerk to see if the shower had been fixed. She stood on hold with maintenance for 5 minutes she said they had not fixed it. I was shocked that a Hotel of this magnitude could let something like this go without any second thought at all. I went up to the room and found maintenance in the bathroom staring at the faucet asking what is wrong. He asked, \"whats wrong\" I said turn on the water then try to turn it off. He turned on the water and it shot everywhere now. I walked back into the suite area of the room and there was still dirty dishes and the room had not been cleaned. I immediately went down stairs and told the front desk I wanted a new room, that was a King as my feet were hanging off the double bed, and I wanted it done immediately. She did not hesitate to find a new room for me. When I got to the new room, the Television was broken. Overall this hotel is OK, at best. The Media restraunt food is fair, the counter offer sushi bar, is excellent (sushi), but prices at they always are at hotels are above average. The hotel is large and provides many banquet and meeting rooms for conventions, symposiums, business. The employees on average are very nice.

Everyone was courteous and helpful, just what I would expect. Our lunch break was truly remarkable. On our first day we enjoyed the food that Counter Offer had to offer which for us was delicious steak, couscous, salad and an asparagus soup. For dessert they brought us 4 different kinds of cupcakes of which I had the pleasure of trying each. The atmosphere was very classy but somewhat relaxed which gave us a much needed break from all of the work we had been doing before. Being able to escape from work for a good hour was the boost we all needed to get through the rest of the day. Our hotel rooms were incredible. The rooms were very large and spacious, giving me a space to do my work and a separate one for me to relax in. The view was great and I could see all of downtown Dallas which was nice. Everything I could have wanted was in that hotel room and with the room service I'm not sure I would have had to leave if not for the business meetings. By far one of the nicest rooms I have had the pleasure of staying in across the United States. On the second day of our visit we had more people in the meeting and the staff adjusted the room accordingly to make more room for everyone which we thought was subtle but amazingly helpful once everyone showed up. They again brought in different drinks and snacks throughout the day while being very courteous of our meeting. Some of us hadn't even realized they had come in and out of the room to switch everything out. For lunch that day we went to Media Bar + Grill. The head chef came by and made a few suggestions for us, one of which was the hamburger, which was all the incentive I needed to order it. We had a room all to ourselves which was great so we could talk about work and other things without worrying about others hearing us. The staff again was super helpful and kind whenever we had questions or needed to change our orders. The food came out and was just as delicious as we had hoped. Everyone enjoyed their meals, we all shared to try different items ordered and everyone left with smiles on their faces. The rest of the meeting went well and after it was over I had time to visit a few of the shops and pick out a few Christmas gifts for my loved ones. I loved coming here for my business meeting but I expect to come back on my own next time I visit Dallas. I can't look forward to coming with my family to show them what a great time they can have in the Hilton Anatole in Dallas. One of the biggest things for me was truly the staff you guys have hired on, not for one second did I see anyone who wasn't treating us with the utmost respect and kindness. That for me is truly incredible that you've found staff who all treat their customers like royalty when they stay here. From valet, to the shops, to the restaurants and the general staff; everyone I met was very helpful and almost made me jealous of working there. I really look forward to coming back next time I visit Dallas for myself and hope next year's meeting is held there again, I know I'll be lobbying for it if anyone says otherwise.

I recommend having a rental car (even though parking is $17/day, you will easily spend that on cab fare doing anything in the city). DFW is about 20 minutes away. I stayed in the Atrium, which I found to be comfortable, but occasionally the sound from the downstairs bar area filtered up to our room. It was a rowdy weekend, as we were there during the Red River Rivalry game, and the place was swarming with Texas & OU fans. Security was pretty tight (you had to show a hotel key to access the elevators), which I appreciated. The room itself was spacious and comfortable. I have no complaints about it, except that the hotel needs to get with the program and offer free wi-fi.

My only issue is the air-conditioning...or lack thereof in the open walk-ways of the higher floors. We were on the 10th floor.

The rooms were beautiful, however we would have enjoyed staying in the terrace side versus the towers because there was more to offer. Dinner at Nana's was delicious, but I do wish they would have let our friends cut their wedding cake (which we brought from outside) and listen to us when we told them 10 times this was wedding rather than assume that this was a first year anniversary dinner. The music at Nana's was nice, it did not create a ambiance of romance like advertised however and the music in Media Bar did not exist.

When I asked about that I was rudely told that I could not have filled one out because she (Nyeti) could not find mine. I was informed that I had to come down and fill out another one or the charges would not be removed. These are the kind of employees that are making the Hilton name bad. I will not return because of her. There was one employee named Terri that worked at the Concierge desk and she was totally AWESOME.

The first time we had a junior suite (that overlooked a gravel rooftop, but the room was so opulent we didn't care about what was going on outside) and the second time they gave us an upper floor double with a panoramic view. You really get the feeling of being wrapped in luxury here for the most part, although the age of the hotel does show in small ways, like the bath fixtures were less up to date than the rest of the room in some instances and the elevators don't seem in keeping with the newness elsewhere. The lobby and public spaces, and especially the grounds, are lovely and really fun to explore, and the good thing about the hotel's age is that you at times get a glimpse of its old-school opulence despite the stylish updates and hip watering holes. I have to say we spent more time hanging out at the hotel than we normally would because we enjoyed our room and dug the general atmosphere. The big drawback, and the reason this is not a five-star review, is the parking -- it sucks. You pay a high daily rate for self-parking, and do not get the freedom of in-and-out access unless you pay the fees in advance or valet (the latter of which is just prohibitively expensive). There is a loophole however, in that the parking booth seems to be randomly staffed. Our first visit we agreed to just let them charge our bill in advance for the number of days in our stay, but then noticed that half the time the gate out was left open and no one was in the booth to charge anyone. When we complained about paying for parking when others were not being charged, after much wrangling we got $50 in parking fees refunded.. Our second visit we wised up and just paid at the booth as we went, and using the method we only ended up being charged one time during a three-day visit. But of course that's also a gamble, and mainly worked because when we left for the day we didn't come back till we were in for the night. Due to the parking cost and weirdness of that situation, I don't recommend this hotel for people who will be going back and forth to the hotel over the course of each day, as you can get charged anytime you take your car out if there happens to be someone working the parking booth.

Okay. Small detail.

I called front desk from the parking lot and was rudely told that parking was first come first serve....i said im paying $17 a day and you cant tell me where to park...he said i cant see the lots from here mam...try lot 2 or 3. The event was going on by now....it was chaos......shouldve seen all the staff out in the street with walkie talkies stopping traffic to park cars.... whole lotta behind kissing goin on around there now cuz the bentleys and ferrari's were there aka \"the important people had indeed arrived\" this hotel is a joke. my view from the 23rd floor was of the hallway. why even put a window in a room if it is a view of THE HALLWAY !!!!!! pay for internet.....pay to park your own car....couldnt even get in my little refrigerator if i did want to pay $15 for some nuts.

So, they promised to give me one the next day. Oh, but, they said I could empty out the minibar, use it as my fridge, and pay the restocking fee for ALL the items!! REALLY!!!! No fridge the next day. So they offered to let me use the minibar free of charge. Why, because, although I was first in line to get the fridge, they gave them out to other guests due to bad communication. Next, went to move my car out of valet since it is so darn expensive. Took them 30 minutes to get my car. NOT one person was there waiting for their car. Do not order room service! One hour wait for disgusting food. So, get my bill. Was charged for 3 nights of valet. WHAT????? Got that taken care of. HOW MUCH TIME DID I WASTE FIGHTING WITH THESE PEOPLE????? A LOT.

The hotel itself - publics areas is nice and large, with lots of restaurant choices and good people watching. However, we had 2 rooms (avoid at all costs the handicap room if offered to you - it is horrible - worst bed I've been in and I was in Ecuador recently). Really amazing the bed could be that poor! The second room we had was a King bed in the atrium area - the bed was better, but really not what I thought would be up to \"Hilton\" standards. I've had better beds at a Holiday Inn Express!! Truly disappointin. The room was sorely in need of upgrades. It was probably nice 10-15 years ago. The bathroom was tight - tub/shower and toilet combo - hardly any room to move and we not large people. The first room was dirty (some left chewing gum on the themostat, which was not removed). The second room was better maintained. There is a nice flat screen TV. The furnishings were worn and outdated. We did have a pretty good view from the 2nd room. Perhaps the Tower rooms are nicer - try to get one of those. We really didn't have an issue with noise and mainteance responded quickly when there was a problem with our themostat. The front desk was hit or miss. Best front desk clerk - Hon! Rest were pretty poor customer servie and down and out lied to us at one point. The security was great. The parking - OK - $17 self park and I can'[t recall what valet was. They do seem to nickle and dime you - internt in room (not WiFI - really? This is 2011) was of several varying prices. You could get free WiFi in the lobby area. Nice gym facility. There is an indoor pool. The Media Bar & Grill was fun and good food. So was the casual self serve eatery. We liked the Coors Light Sports Bar that was in the basement - cool feel. The Terrace Restaurant was OK -a bit pricey. Ate at Nana's Restaurant on te 26th floor - awesome views of the town, but a bit disappointing in terms of food quality - service was excellent though. Overall, I would NOT return until they remodel all the rooms. We stay in nice hotels and this did not make up to anything we have been in recently (Westin, Peabody, Marriott and even the Holiday Inn Express). I would look elsewhere.

There is a Dennys about two blocks down the road. I ended up paying $28 roundtrip for a cab ride to Walmart to pick up bottled water and snacks so I could save some money. #2 Im here for a conference, which held a reception tonight at 5. I attempt to take a shower at 3:30. To my disbelief, the shower water begins to pool around my toes, then my feet, in minutes it was up to my ankles! I call down and fortunately, the repair man is here in minutes. Unfortunately, it takes him and his partner TWO HOURS to fix it. I know what you are saying, change rooms right? Well, considering what I went through to navigate this massive hotel with all my crap I said forget it. #3 The maintenance man calls down to have Housekeeping come tidy up the bathroom at 5:55pm. I hear them say 10-4 on the radio. At 6:30 I am still waiting on Housekeeping. I call down to that department and the woman tells me they have no record of the call! UNBELIEVABLE! So needless to say, I have some explaining to do to my boss as to why on the very first day of the conference I was not seen or heard from at the reception. Keep in mind this is DAY ONE. When I called down to the Manager, she said she will see about compensating me half a nights stay. I guess that covers my taxi fares for the day.

The wireless internet signal was so poor in my room I could not establish a reliable connection. The signal strength was over 85% in the hallway on the 24th floor, but under 50% in my room . I called the hotel Hilton Honors member customer hservice line to report the issue. I did receive a VM response later that a technician was dispatched to investigate and everything checked out fine. Evidently, the technician never entered my room to check the signal strength, for if they had done so they would have easily observed the inadequate wireless signal. 2. My room adjoined room to another on the 24th floor (executive floor) with a doorway that linked the rooms. The sound barrier between the rooms was extremely poor, as the sound from their TV proliferated my room. Even the coughing from the adjoining room sounded like it was coming from someone in my room. 3. I called before my stay to inquire about getting a refrigerator so that I could keep cold a dietary supplement prescribed by my doctor. I was told by the Hilton employee on the phone that I could utilize the refreshment center refrigerator as it had available room. I utilized the refrigerator as directed, but to my dismay my perishable dietary supplement was removed and placed on the counter to spoil. If the hotel staff was going to remove my items, AT LEAST they could have placed them on ice. Even the complementary bottled water provided to me by the hotel for being a Hilton Honors guest was removed from the refrigerator. This action simply infuriated me. 4. I visited the front desk this evening to pay for some incidentals charged to my room. I had to wait in line for 15 minutes in the Hilton Honors line since the main desk was only staffed with one clerk. To further exacerbate the situation, the desk clerk was unable to accept cash for she had no change. Absolutely unacceptable for a Hilton property of this category. 5. Numerous times I entered the hotel lobby with my arms full, but not ONCE did the bellmen or valet parking staff make an effort to open the doors for me. I have NEVER had that happen at any Hilton Hotel. A complete neglect of a basic common courtesy. 6. Speaking of parking, this hotel property has acres of parking that was mostly empty, yet they feel the need to charge $17 a night for self parking.

I had stayed at the hotel several years previously, and I instantly recalled what I liked and didn't like about it. The big plus: the gym. The big minus: its location along a highway that makes even a jaunt across the street a cab ride away. I arrived a day before the crush of trade show attendees were due to show up, but there was still a long line at reception. Only two desk clerks were on duty, and one seemed to be occupied solely by guests who had already checked in but had complaints or requests. After about 20 minutes, I had finally checked in, but for the life of me I could not find the elevators. It's a large property with a huge atrium, and several areas were walled off for construction. The big problem, however, was that hundreds (if not thousands) of high school students were in the hotel for some sort of conference. They swarmed everywhere, blocking every entrance and corridor, some camping out on the floor with sleeping bags and pillows. They were friendly enough, but made it difficult to navigate. After walking a few hundred yards to the tower portion of the hotel, I was directed back to where I started--in the atrium--dragging my bags and having to navigate through throngs of high schoolers again. My room itself was nice and fairly spacious--plenty clean and no real complaints. The only significant irritant was that the walls were paper thin--I could hear everything going on next door, and I was grateful I wasn't sharing a wall with honeymooners. Another minor hiccup--pun intended--was that the wet bar refrigerator wouldn't open. Because I worked late every night, I took a couple of dinners in my room. Room service seemed overworked, if friendly, and the orders took longer than expected (an hour). Food was uninspired but OK. Dinner at one of the restaurants below was a lot better. The real jewel of the property is the spa and health club behind the towers, and the outdoor track that undulates through a pretty patch of lawn. Though the health club carries an extra fee, it offers a full-court basketball facility, a boxing gym, squash courts, a pool, aerobics classes, and a large selection of weights and cardio machines. To sum up, this is a spacious property that is nicely maintained, but it's lobbies are reminiscent of the cattle drives you'd see elsewhere in the state. It's also \"ghettoized\" along with other upper-end lodging properties along a highway.

This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really an issue other than hearing some construction noises when walking to the Tower or conference center. - The hotel is rather isolated from other places so unless you have a car or want to take a cab, there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much nearby. - My room was in the atrium, it was great size, but the bathroom was very small, especially, for a Hilton and what is supposed to be a high-caliber property. You had to close the door to use the bathroom. - Though there were 5 lights in the room, it still seemed very dark to me. - The housekeeping service was very odd. For example, the majority of the days, the housekeepers came down the hall early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking 7-7:30 a.m. I had a do not disturb sign out, but they came to other rooms nearby and you could hear them. They also would do afternoon room checks. Also, the last day of housekeeping left a lot to be desired \u00e2\u20ac\u201c towels were replaced except for washcloths. The toilet seat was left up with toilet paper in it, some of my drawers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c night stand and dresser were open (even though I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything in them). - Also, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what happened but two of the days my wake-up calls worked and two of the other days they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Would I stay here again? Perhaps if I had another conference though I would probably want to request a room in the tower as they seemed to have bigger bathrooms.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte", "Title": "\u201cDon't Stay Here This Summer\u201d", "Author": "almychrn", "ReviewID": "UR66539743", "Content": "Just so you know . . . a large part of this hotel is being renovated.

Eventual room was nice, even tho it was a *handicapped accessible* room. Good beds. Gossip Bar is fun and good, along with The Media Restaurant. Nana is awesome in terms of the view, particularly at night where you can see downtown Dallas and the light show from many of the buildings. But don't eat there.

First, parking is impossible. Though there is ample space for parking, one must meander through a convoluted maze to find an entry gate, so that the hotel may charge you $17 per day to park on land that is, frankly, not valuable. Luckily, parking was free for me since I had my ticket validated. But still. Not a great start. The hotel is massive and lovely inside. It is a gigantic complex. However, something quite curious arises. There is only one-- yes, one-- restaurant in the hotel in which to have lunch. A small trendy sports bar type place is the only place where any of the hundreds of guests may go to have lunch. There are no restaurants within walking distance. Thus, my grandfather and I went to the restaurant to attempt to have lunch. At 12 noon, there were no tables. After being promised a 15 minute wait, we were finally seated after waiting for 35 minutes. Our waiter could not have been more disinterested. We finally had to beg for some water and for him to take our order. 30 minutes later, our sandwiches arrived (did they bake the bread that day?). I felt awkward because there was a woman sitting next to us who had been ignored by the server for at least 20 minutes. This hotel is expensive and opulent. And yet, they do lunch so poorly.

The art, mostly Asian, is unparalleled in any hotel I can imagine. I understand from previous discussions with staff that this hotel is privately owned by Margaret Trammel and her private collection adorns the walls, grounds, etc. And the decor of the hotel reflects the beauty and style of the art. This hotel is really three buildings: the tower, or tallest building, is the most amazing in art, I think, but the whole property, including the grounds, is a walk through delightful art. Most visits we make, we spend at least 4 hours looking at the art. Since my kids (now 11 and 13) have been 3 times, this time we decided to explore the swimming pools, also, and found a whole new reason to visit! There are 3 pools on the property, one being very large and outdoors with a swim up bar (empty, unless there's a party, I think), one small pool tucked into a corner of one building, and their spa pool, which is for swimming laps but has the added bonus of a beautiful women's area with steam room, hot tub and plush bathroom/shower facilities (there's another very nice hot tub and steam room, also pleasant and somewhat bigger, out by the pool that is co-ed). Their spa and exercise facilities have just been remodeled, and are luxurious. There is a pretty, manicured park with a walking/running surfaced loop as well as concrete sidewalk winding around and through it, adorned with delightful and surprising sculptures ranging from large, marble elephants to a shockingly large part of the Berlin wall. Nana's, their top notch restaurant, is outstanding also, and commands beautiful views of the surrounding areas from the top of the tower building. Honestly, I could write a book about all the wonderful and delightful details of this hotel, but you have to experience it to believe it. It still stands as a highlight of her trip to the US when my German cousin came to visit with her son and I put her up with my mother there. They both spent their first 2 days of their \"visit to Dallas\" wandering the property. PS -- don't miss the Margaret and Trammel Crow Asian Art Collection in Dallas when you visit.

I stayed Sunday March 28th, and had a horrible experience. I sat on the red bench in front of the bed, and approximately 15 minutes later, my legs and feet were covered in painful, itchy red welts/bites. I nearly called a doctor, I was so worried. I took a long hot shower, and went down to the front desk to complain. They said I could stay in the room, and they would look into it, or move my room and let me know what was going on. I understand the hotel can not control someone bringing something in, and things happen. What disappointed me was the response I received. I was told that the room would be unoccupied until it had been checked and treated. After I moved rooms, I went back to the front desk repeatedly. Monday night they told me the room had been checked and cleared, and was occupied. They said they would send someone Tuesday morning to clean my clothes and to sanitize my suitcase first thing in the morning. All I needed to do was leave mty clothes by the door. I left contact information, and asked they call or email me first thing in the morning. When I returned to the room at 11 AM, the clothes were still there, and I had an unintelligible message on the phone in the room. I checked out, and finally at around 2:30 I got a call from the hotel. By this point thanks to the lack of communication, I had thrown away my suitcase and the clothes, hoping to prevent the spread of whatever caused the reaction. The manager who called told me the room still had not been checked by Terminix, and that they would let me know what they found. I finally got a call from the hotel this morning telling me that the room had been checked but nothing was found. I guess I made it all up. Unfortunately, I didn't take pictures of my legs thinking that Hilton would take action and resolve this issue. Now I wish I had, so that I could show just how bad the reaction was, and to better warn others of the poor treatment by this hotel.

Never before have I been so inspired by a hotel to leave either a negative or positive review. This was so bad that I had to take a stand. In fact, this place was so bad, it has inspired me to write a book on bad company practices in the social media era. First of all, they bamboozled me into a \"third night free\" option via Hotwire.com The location is where I need it to be, and the price of $250 for three nights sounded reasonable-ish. As soon as I got to the hotel, I noticed there was no free parking on the premises. They requested $17 a dollars a day to park on one of their lots, or $27 a day for valet parking. On the second day of my trip, they had the two \"cheaper\" 17 dollar parking lots green-coned off, due to an event at the location later. So, I had to park several football fields away from where my room was actually located. The room was absolutely beautiful. The bed was very comfortable and you can tell the staff takes pride in keeping up a nice hotel. Nice isn't the problem. It's quality. But, for a company to nickel and dime you to death, is unbelievable. Next, I make it into my room. Almost EVERY hotel that I have stayed in for the last 10 years has some kind of complimentary internet access in the room, with the exception of some hotels in San Francisco. The Hilton Anatole thinks that $14-$17 a day for $24 hours of non-wifi / ethernet-tethered-to-the-wall is a good value. I don't pay $40 a month for internet at home, why should I pay over $50 for THREE DAYS? So, I decide to go into the atrium and get some food at their little open market deli stand. Aside from being extremely overpriced, apparently the cashier took the card that allowed customers to actually pay for their meals. So, I had to wait for about 15 minutes to even pay for my food. They couldn't take cash, credit OR charge to my room. After my meal, I decide to go to the gym... world class leisure and workout facility, a sign says... check out the Veranda! Great, after a long stressful trip... a workout would be ideal. I get over there... and the nice elderly lady tells me all about how great this place is, then commences to tell me that it is only $16 a day, unless I'm an ultra uber gold rewards member or something. I sarcastically ask if it is okay to walk on the sidewalk or do I need to pay a $5 incidental fee of some sort? So, I sat at the bar and decided to relax with a drink since I wasn't going to be working out... I'll take a screwdriver from The Gossip Bar. Sweet. Only $10. It's a freaking bargain in this money trap. Stay far away from this place. It is ridiculous the greed from this place. It's like Paris Hilton herself is running the place and is trying to get enough cash to get her dog an new diamond encrusted doggie bag or something. To be honest, I shook my head in amazement that their wasn't a fee for ice on the floor. I half expected it to be a dollar bill vending machine. Unreal. Boooo!

There are flower pots in all the driveways (which can be slid out of the way) but the real gem is that we noticed some tire tracks on the grass... hmmm... the curbs are very low and easy to hop - go to the corner of the lot near the highway (lot 2 is best) near the gate and you'll see the tracks. Food: Don't eat there, breakfast is $20!! Alternative: There are alot of conventions and most have breakfast for their group. They usually set it up in between the two front desks somewhere.. just be sure to have some sort of id card hanging around your neck (flipped over of course) and they won't say a thing. Internet: Don't sign up for the $17 internet... there is wireless but they do not mention that... works in the room but in the lobby better. Soda: There is a soda station in the lobby, they charge like $2 for the cup but say it can be used all day... be sure you save the cup for the entire stay! Smoking: Smoking not allowed indoors (even though there are remnants like old ashtrays turned into trash cans). If you want to smoke be sure to stay in the atrium side.

Biz Center: Watch out for the biz center... the hotel does not own this BUT will utilize it... for example: lets say you need a box, if someone from the hotel threw away your boxes they will instruct the biz center to accommodate you. Also, let 's say you need a box... there is a loading dock in the rear... if you are on business be sure to utilize it... the entry is near the backside of the unloacked and open biz center cage and there are bozes galore just sitting there... right by the back door.

However, we were treated very nicely and our whole family really enjoyed everything about this hotel even the food we bought at the open kitchen was really good and was a large portion. I really think they are trying to bring it up to Hilton standards and this weekend was proof that they are almost there. Thank you Sada for a wonderful time.

The first time I was on the 23rd floor and the second visit I was on the 17th. Both rooms were immaculate, with stunning views of downtown Dallas. There's not much to visit on Stemmons Freeway, but you are ideally located near several key highways that can take you to Dallas' top spots. A visit to the concierge will provide you with a wealth of info about nearby Dallas attractions. David was especially helpful giving me directions to some of the area shopping destinations printing out several maps and pointing out additional places to stop as well. If you are stuck at a busy conference and don't have time to get into downtown Dallas, the hotel offers several restaurants. Also, it is located down the road from a super diner, the Original Market Diner which is a must visit for foodies who like homestyle cooking. The Anatole also has a huge work out facility and excellent equipment and a pool. It also has a new spa but I didn't have a chance to check it out.

I enjoyed a very restful stay with clean, modern, and nicely appointed room, while my colleagues who arrived separately and checked in on the Atrium side complained about noise and thin walls. The downside to staying on the Tower side is that it is a longer walk if your conference activities are on the Atrium side. On the upside, it is a closer walk to the outdoor campus area and the Verandah club and fitness area, and closer to one of the chic hotel lounge bars called Gossip Bar. The Verandah club and fitness area is a rip off for charging $17 a day for a daiy entrance fee to the gym - there are slight discounts though for 2 day/3 day passes. Another rip off is that the business center charges a minimum $7.95 for access to their computers, so you cannot expect to print your boarding pass for free here.

Also as has been mentioned, why is that only expensive hotels charge for the Wi-Fi? In perhaps a more disturbing trend in \"luxury\" hotel Nickel and Diming practices, it seems that it has now become common to charge for entrace into the Health Club to use poorly maintained treadmills.

I guess these hotels need to pay for their nice art in some way, but I would prefer them to include it in the room rate and then provide excellent service rather than gouge certain clients.

It was a very long walk back from the tower to the desk. Now I know that I would never book an interior room on a cruise ship. Ate in a hotel restaurant in the atrium area on the first night and had a $22.00 hamburger.

The bar was only open on the weekend during our Sept. stay but is probably open daily during the peak summer months. The Atrium Bldg. also has an outdoor pool which we didn't use.

The lobby areas are huge and luxuriously decorated with large sculptures and large wall hangings. The hotel is defitely designed for business conferences. A downside to this hotel is parking.

I did not fly 1500 miles for that, so I took my shoes off and proceeded to make the incredibly long walk back to the elevators and down to the lobby. I thought I was going to have to give CPR to the poor gentleman who was having to push my luggage all over the hotel! Back at the front desk and quite winded, I requested a room closer to the elevator in the atrium overlooking the pool. I informed the clerk that my brother, who was suffering from a knee injury and limping, and my 73 year-old father would not find that hike to and from the room several times a day an easy thing. So what did he do? He proceeded to give me a room, albeit with a better view, in the same tower. I then said, \"Didn't I just ask you specifically for a room in the other tower?\" He got a little snippy but finally obliged with a room right next to the elevator on the 4th floor.

I haven't seen this in a long time, but it was a fully stocked mini-bar and it had no room for anything other than their very expensive stuff.

Now this thing was set-up to monitor anything taken from specific slots and would then automatically charge it to your card. Seriously!!! They told us that to take it out and later put back would cost us $28. What crap. They agreed to remove the items only after we told them that we had a recovering alcoholic with us and that they couldn't sleep with alcohol anywhere close by.

There is a mini bar, but you cannot store your own drinks and food in it. There is also no microwave. There is no free parking. You can pay 17 dollars a night for self parking or you can pay 26 a night for valet. There is also a daily charge for the use of the internet and exercise facilities(I believe each were around 15 dollars a day, but as I did not use these services, I cannot say that with certainty). Local calls are 55 cents a minute but room to room calls are free. The staff at the Hilton Anatole was friendly and helpful. We have no complaints with them. The check in was quick and the front desk employees were friendly. It is in a great location with several restaurants and museums within 3 miles or so.

I do agree that most things around the hotel are very difficult to walk to, so you have to rely on someone that has a car or rent a car yourself if you want to do anything outside the expansive hotel grounds. As for the hotel, we always request the a room in the Tower (for some reason every time we make a reservation we are always offered a room in the Atrium and I always have to ask for a room in the Tower - the rooms are the same price). The rooms in the Tower are refurbished, there is no noise from the open atrium, and the views of Dallas are better on the higher floors. The rooms are very comfortable, and the decor is very stylish. The beds are soft, and the rooms are ample in size. The bathroom has two sinks, a hairdryer, a lit shaving mirror, and a lot of towels. The only strange thing about the restroom is the toilet - every time you flush the thing it seems like everything in the bathroom is getting sucked in as well. It's not really annoying, but it just catches you off-guard. The Executive Lounge is decent. They have a bar and a few snacks in the afternoon. But there is no free computer access, which was strange for me. The staff in the lounge is very helpful and welcoming, so it was a pleasant stay. The only problem I had about this hotel is that I couldn't find a corkscrew. I asked the front desk where I could get one, and she said that the hotel had none. So I went to the Executive Lounge and asked if I could borrow a corkscrew (I even brought the bottle of wine with me), but under law he couldn't open the bottle. He offered to call housekeeping and have a corkscrew delivered to me. The response was quick, and we were drinking our wine within ten minutes. So if you ever need a corkscrew, just call housekeeping. We did try the gym in the building behind the hotel. The only problem about the gym/spa area is that it is not connected to the hotel. It was below freezing when we wanted to use the gym, so we just ran as fast as we could to this building. Once inside (HHonors members can use the gym complimentary), the check in staff was very nice. The gym was pretty impressive. Each machine had its own television, so don't forget to bring your earphones! There is a towel service, so you don't have to bring a towel from you room. We didn't use any other parts of the gym due to lack of time, but the spa services seemed nice. Even though the hotel is extremely huge, the personalized service is there.

I was in Dallas for several weeks, and my company put me up in the Hilton Anatole. As many other reviews state, the place is quite impressive, but it only goes skin deep. Yes, the grounds are beautiful, the buildings look nice, the insides are very attractive, and the staff is indeed nice and helpful for the most part (see notes below for the contrary). However, I soon found that the excitement was lost once you go beyond appearances. This hotel is geared towards one type of person: those who like to feel more important by spending much more money than should be required for anything, or those on company expense accounts. First of all, self parking...$15 a night ($19 for valet). This hotel has thousands of parking spots, most of which were empty for a good portion of my stay, and many of which aren't available to hotel guests anyway. Yet, they still charge this ridiculous amount for self parking (it's gated, so no cheating). From what I can tell visually, no other hotel in the area has gated self parking, thus I imagine they don't charge for parking. Yet this hotel feels it necessary to charge $15 a night. The worst part was when they closed the one lot closest to the atrium building for four days \"for an event\", forcing you to either park across the campus (a good 5 minute walk away), or valet. No one ever seemed to know why the lot was closed, or when it would reopen. I only saw cars in the lot for one of those four days. Even though we were at the Hilton for three weeks, we visited only one restaurant one time. After paying $6.25 for a domestic beer at the sports bar, and looking at the menu prices for a few of the other places, we decided that eating a meal in this hotel was not an option. I think it was about $23 for an entree at the Mexican restaurant. Another ridiculously overpriced \"amenity\" at this hotel is their internet service. They offer two options, \"Choice\" for $11 a day, and \"Premium\" for $13 a day. It's the most expensive hotel internet I've seen in years in the US. Being an internet junkie, I did pay the $11 a day several times, and I can say that the internet service at this hotel is pathetic. Dial would be faster on most occasions. I could hardly even get Google Maps to load, and checking email was spotty. This was even when the hotel was not busy, so they can't use that excuse. I have to check again, but I believe I was also charged a \"handing fee\" for receiving a small package of mail from home. That's just a slap in the face if you ask me. I didn't use any other service that this hotel. Noise is certainly a factor if you are in the atrium building. On some nights, when a convention lets out, even at 11pm (I had to work early the next day or it wouldn't bother me as much), it sounded like a freight train was running through the hotel. The atrium does not absorb any noise whatsoever. The TV channel selection is pretty boring as well. Standard networks, a few sports and news channels, and a few cable networks. Other than that, the room was clean, and the place seemed nice enough. But I would never return to this hotel by choice. I simply just do not believe in paying extreme prices just to feel like I'm getting better service.

The poor front desk attendants were clearly instructed not to be too friendly, not to chat, etc., in the effort to move things along.

The soundtrack: a local rock n' roll station. Not bad, but not nice. And the \"gardens\": lawn & containers with the least expensive flowers imaginable (the equivalent of pansies, but it is May in Texas, so pansies can't stand the heat).

The views out the window were fantastic (rooms ending in -66 are on the SE corner). All the rooms in the tower are recently refurbished (within the last 12 months), and are styled, not overpoweringly, in a distinctly Asian theme. The tower rooms feature tiled, glassed in showers and flat screen televisions. The kids were upset that we couldn't plug in the playstation or dvd player (there is a sticker of RCA inputs on the tv, but no actual inputs).

The outdoor pool is back there as well, on the other side of the garden area. The gym is pretty well stocked, almost like a mini health club. It has lots of cardio machines, and quite a few weight machines with free weights as well (although the weights and weight equipment look 20 years old). The atrium side of the hotel tends to be louder as all the rooms open to the atrium. The tower rooms are limited to the noise on your floor (which has never been a problem for us).

There's alot of Chinese artwork throughout the hotel (the kids love the two large elephants outside the meeting rooms near the tower).

The HVAC worked splendidly, water pressure and hot water were great, and morning newspapers were welcomed. Yes, the doors are heavy and slam loudly so be careful. That said, we never heard anyone in the hallways or other doors slamming. Nice. We had dinner in The Terrace Restaurant. There were only 4 tables full the entire time we were there. The problem with that is that waiters are LESS attentive when there are fewer people dining. My wife's side dish was completely forgotten and came out after having to hunt down the waiter and ask for it. To their credit, they did not charge us for it. All in all a good meal that was prepared fairly well. We tried to use the main hotel pool but it was closed due to chemical treatments. We insisted on being comp'd into The Verandah Club which was only \"okay\". There was an \"out of order sink\" in the men's locker room, rusting drain troughs in the pool and yucky tile in the yucky jacuzzi area. In the summer it is probably much nicer, but on a February morning it was not very pretty. The Anatole has added a \"Charge per day\" parking lot in the last couple of years so be aware. Their valets were cheerful and efficient as were their check in people. There is a Denny's across the street within walking distance for those who want to eat a little cheaper. That said, the quickie food in the main open atrium area is reasonable for breakfast, but a bit expensive (like most hotels) for lunch. We prefer smaller hotels but, overall, this was a good stay.", "Date": "February 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cNot my favorite Hilton\u201d", "Author": "Suomessa", "ReviewID": "UR13464630", "Content": "I used to live in Dallas, and always used to think it would be fun to stay at the Anatole.

Self-parking at the Anatole is $15 a day. There isn't another hotel in the immediate area that charges for parking. When I brought up the parking charge the desk clerk gave me a \"free\" pass for the week.

I got it \"free\" because I am a Diamond VIP! They gave me something free that most hotels do not charge a dime for! I ate at the Mexican restaurant at the hotel.

Thankfully this was taken care of without a major hassle. The elevators had some serious issues - sometimes you'd have to press the button several times for one to come, and some of the doors wouldn't close until you pressed \"close door\" - which you didn't realize until the annoying buzzing started. Also, one time, we pressed \"down\" and an elevator arrived with the down arrow lit.

The ONLY saving grace for this hotel is that I had free usage of the racketball courts next door at the Verandah Club and Spa, but this was only due to my status. Checkin at the tower was quite lengthy, especially when half the people in line were returning with card keys not working (some had mentioned that they had to return up to 5 times!). The first night I was put in a room on the 26th floor of the Executive Tower, but in a room that had two doors to connecting rooms, which I dislike and which became very apparent why at around 1am in the morning. Suffice it to say, there was a travel agent convention at the hotel and they had a Las Vegas night, the woman next door obviously had too much to drink and took the Vegas slogan of \"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\" to heart and applied it to Dallas. Let's just say that she \"met\" someone at the convention and the connectng door was so thin I thought I had an adult movie playing on the television. The first thing in the morning I requested a new room and requested that they get me a new room and move my suitcase and 2 shirts in the closet, when I returned that evening I found that my request wasn't followed and I had to move my own things. Instead of giving me a key to the new room and let me move my things right then, I had to go retrieve my luggage, drag it all back down to the registration desk, wait in line again, get the new room key, then drag my belongings up to my new room. Then I find out that my room preferences on my Hilton Honor profile (non-smoking room, high floor, away from elevator, king size bed) were completely ignored and I was placed in a room next to the elevator on the 4th floor with double beds. The only saving grace about the double beds and pillows was that they were much more comfortable than the King size bed on the Executive floor. The internet was sub-par, keep in mind that I utilize the high speed access in hotel rooms as part of my job, the first night it took at least an hour to successfully go through the charge screens (yes, they charge Diamond members) and connect to the internet. And unlike all other hotels that I stay at, there were no directions available regarding the outgoing smtp server to be used for the mail client. Forget the support number they give you, I called and asked specifically for the outgoing server and either they didn't know what it was or they refused to give it to me. Oh yes, if you should have access to the Executive Lounge and are not on the upper executive floors, you have to request access to the Executive Lounge, it's not a given. If this is the treatment they give a Hilton Honors Diamond VIP member, I would not want to be a guest with a lower status. Both the hotel rooms and Verandah Club are very tired and need a major refurbishing. I would not recommend this hotel to the casual nor business traveler.

Our stay was neither particularly good, nor particularly bad. It was just kind of flavorless... The hotel is HUGE. So huge, in fact, that there are two separate buildings. I would recommend not parking your car until you check in to determine which one you are in so that you can park accordingly (self park at $15/night is not what I would call cheap, either). But what I found most surprising is that for such a huge hotel, there is virtually no staff. There were a few valet guys lurking out front, but other than that, it was pretty much desk staff only. As we headed to the elevator, I overhead someone asking for the concierge only to be informed that \"the desk is not always staffed.\" And this is a Hilton? Hmmm. Our room was on the big side. The furnishings were pretty standard - a desk, a couch and coffee table. The bed, however, was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept on in a long while. The pillows were exquisite. The A/C was a little wonky as it was either stuffy or frigid. There was not really an in between temperature. In keeping with the theme of no staffing, there was only one desk personnel for checkout. On a Sunday morning, nonetheless. Are you kidding me...? After waiting in line for 10 minutes, I gave up and returned to the room to do the expedited phone checkout. Turns out this was the wrong decision. Our $3.00 of mini-bar purchases were charged as $10.78 to my credit card. Looks like I will be calling the hotel to sort it out. So in total, the Anatole is a good value for (near) downtown Dallas, but do not expect the level of service a hotel of this caliber should deliver.

Things that annoy me as a business traveler aren't necessarily the same things that I care about when on vacation. Let's see, where do I begin. I've stayed here twice for business. Once they put me in the executive tower; once in the atrium tower. Poor service at the front desk both times. Check out service was poor (I still haven't received my honors points for one stay; plus I had to call 3 times to get a copy of my bill). They don't put your bill under the door as they do in just about every other Hilton property I've stayed in. I travel a lot for work and always try to stay at a Hilton property. Because of my work travels, I have reached Hilton Diamond status. I don't expect special treatment because of my Diamond \"status\" but you'd think I'd at least get a friendly front desk clerk or a helpful attitude. I don't think anyone, regardless of their HHonors membership, gets decent service here. I had to ask for a pass to the executive lounge both times. One stay they gave me free internet access for being a HHonors member (without me asking for it); the next stay the front desk person argued with me that she's never heard of such a thing. The front desk guy didn't know where the exec lounge was located or what the hours were. Unfortunately, this is probably a beautiful property but I was so frustrated with my check-in BOTH TIMES that I failed to notice anything else. I thought for sure that my first experience was an isolated situation and gave the hotel a second chance, but I was wrong. One other thing (not the hotel's fault)....both times I was there, I needed a cab to downtown (not far, about 10-15 minute drive). Both times, the taxi drivers were annoyed to pick up a fare for such a short drive. Sorry if this review sounds overly negative, but as a business traveler, I won't stay here again. The Park Cities Hilton in Dallas has much better service and I will go back there again. Hilton recently purchased the Anatole so maybe they're just going through growing pains. I just didn't feel the usual Hilton service here. One positive note, the exec lounge had really good happy hour food and the guy that works there was very nice and attentive. They should put that guy on the front desk. :)", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lako", "ReviewID": "UR5411371", "Content": "This hotel has large,open spaces inside.

I was also told at this time, that they can guarantee you get a room, but not necessarily the room you booked. (and I'm a Hilton Honors member!) Not even a King sized bed, so you'd better be pretty chummy with your roommate. I guess it's true that everything is bigger in Texas.

She seemed perturbed to be interrupted from talking with her co-workers. When I persisted she said that there was nothing that could be done as there were no other rooms available.

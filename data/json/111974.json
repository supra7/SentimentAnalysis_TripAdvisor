The beds were comfortable and the view from my room was awesome. I used the pool one afternoon as well, and it was clean despite being an outdoor pool (it rained all day). I did not get a chance to explore the hotel restaurants and bars just because I was in NOLA for such a short time and preferred to see some local spots--but the menu looked good, if a little on the expensive side but that's to be expected from a luxury hotel. I stayed away from the hotel parking, since it seemed to be upwards of $30 a night. I was on a roadtrip to Alabama and Mississippi, so I just waited to rent a car til after I checked out of the hotel (you don't need a car to get around NOLA if you are just doing touristy stuff downtown). Fortunately, the rental place was closeby--a short 5-block walk. The only downside was that I realized a few hours after I checked out that I left my iPhone charger in the bathroom wall outlet. I called reception right away and asked if they could hold it for me for a few days until I came back from my trip.

Everyone was nice and friendly. The hotel is located in a good area. It is about 5 minutes from Bourbon street and Canal Street. It was clean and was well decorated. We chose to get a balcony because I love to hang out on the balcony and enjoy views. However, the balcony on all of the rooms faced an office building with no views except people working and eating on one of the floors across the street. On top of that, the rooms adjacent to us had easy access to our balcony if they wanted to climb the small divider. With the window shades open there was no privacy in the room (including the full time view of the people in the next building that was always occupied during the day) and offered an insecure feel unless you kept the balcony door shut and locked at all times. So if you fear some crazy jumping onto your balcony and possibly into your room, skip the balcony. It was about $50-$70 more anyway. (One note on the balcony: I am not a first timer in a city like this. I just expect a little more out of my balcony. On the other hand, it did not look like any other hotels had better balconies. So it might just be my perspective). The room itself was a bit noisy. I could hear people above us and next to us.

Great people. Management, not so much. So the toilet in our room (1435) kept running, we could live with that. The AC never got the humidity down, although in the next room (1436, a family member) the humidity was just fine. The killer? The Shriners were having a convention and their hospitality suite was directly across the hall from us! The are an incredibly self-absorbed and insensitive group of middle-aged frat boy partiers well into the wee hours (around 1:30AM) who were shouting and laughing and slamming the door every time someone came or left to their party room. AND THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT KNEW THIS WAS THEIR HOSPITALITY SUITE BUT PUT US THERE ANYWAY! In fact, we were upgraded because we are Platinum Priority Club members. Despite many complaints from us, and other guests, the hotel security did not make the partiers leave, and the desk staff kept telling us that they were sorry and management would do something to make it up to us. They did not. When I checked out and paid my $1300 bill for two rooms and dining, there was no mention of apology, no mention of making it up in some other way, there was no response from management. Two nights out of the three we were there we were kept awake until after 1:30, as was our daughter and grand daughter in the next room. Total management failure.

The Suite was huge and beautifully appointed, with a separate seating/office area and 2 large flat screen TVs. The furninshings and decor were beautiful and the bed was huge. The bathroom was disproportionately small ( as was the tub) but had all necessary amenities. The view was not inspiring - a car park and other buildings. Given the situation of the hotel, I doubt that any rooms have an especially good view. Being on the Club floor, we had access to the Club Lounge for breakfast and evening cocktails and canapes. The Lounge has an excellent food and drink selection in the evening, most of which is self service. Wine and beers are served by the staff (of one rather surly lady, who was like a strict school mistress) on request. Refills are not forthcoming - you have to ask. Beware weekday breakfast finishes at 9am, which I consider to be on the early side. We arrived at just after 9 on our first morning to be advised by the surly lady that breakfast had finished. Not even a cup of tea or banana to take away was offered. (When we checked in, we were told the opening times but I did not take enough notice. I just expected that it would be standard breakfast times) On the 2 mornings we arrived on time for breakfast, the selection and quality was good. I have been to many IC Club Lounges in the past and the service is usually polite, friendly and helpful. While the surly lady was not rude, she was certainly not welcoming. All the other staff we encountered were exceptionally helpful and friendly, especially the Bellboy team. The IC is in a great location, just a short walk from the French Quarter, Bourbon Street, Canal Street and the Mississippi. There is a St Charles line Street Car stop just yards down the road if you turn left out of the main doors. This will take you to the Garden District and the museums, including the WW2 museum, which is well worth a visit. You can buy an all day ticket on the Streetcar and at $5, this is very good value.

The walls were thin and my room had an interconnecting door to my neighbours so I could hear their television all evening and all night. Standards of cleaning were not great. My quilt cover had a huge piece of wax on it when I arrived. I changed it for the quilt on the second bed and that was dirty too. Breakfast was frustratingly slow for a business traveller. They have that annoying system where they make you wait until the (one) server is ready to seat you at their convenience. On the last day of my stay, after waiting 5 minutes for a server to greet me at the door I was told that I would have to wait another 5 or 10 minutes for a table. I was furious (especially as I could see lots of empty tables that I could have used). I think that I was not alone in being annoyed. Eventually the food & beverage manager (Frank Gifford) came to speak to me to explain. Apparently they were \"obligated to give excellent customer service\" so, because they were short staffed, they had to close off half of the restaurant so they could serve the remainder well. It amazes me that he thought that it would be better customer service to keep people waiting to sit for 5 to 10 minutes rather than make them wait a few minutes longer for a coffee (and a bill).", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Biloxi, Ms.", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "jvjcr", "ReviewID": "UR137028251", "Content": "Booked a room with a king bed with breakfast included.

It wasn't horrible but it wasn't quite up to the standards you'd expect in a high end hotel. I would have rated this hotel a 5 if the mattress was a bit better.

Could have quite happily stayed another couple of nights and seen more of the city as we were working at an exhibition. Next time there would be no shadow of a doubt that I would stay back here. By the way in response to the parking comments - Yes the car parks will rip you off if you let them but we found plenty of street parking for free next to the hotel between 6pm and 8am and then after 8 it was only $3 for every two hrs and even the car parks were giving 24 hrs for $12 at weekends. In summary - 5* masquerading a 4* if you ask me which is the exact opposite to normal experience - Well done Johan and the team you are a great flagship for your company!", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frisco, Texas", "Title": "\u201cExcellent with a big drawback\u201d", "Author": "cancun123455870", "ReviewID": "UR131776135", "Content": "I stayed at the InterContinetal for one night.

And since I travel to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disasters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not always blessed with the best accommodations. So once in a while I like to treat myself and take the high road to a 4 star hotel, which is why I now find myself writing a review of the Intercontinental Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Intercontinental offered room rates online that exceeded my travel per diem. But Karen Stahl (the Revenue Manager), was very accommodating in getting me an agreeable rate AND a room upgrade! I arrived in mid-May and was promptly greeted by Bellman \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Randy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who cheerfully relieved me of my numerous heavy bags. Check-in was a breeze and bellman \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mervyn\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd escorted me and my tons of luggage to my room which was and well-appointed with the usual amenities of internet, TV, VERY comfy bed, and a cash bar. The big surprise was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balcony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was not the typical 6x6 platform that many hotels call a balcony, but a huge 15\u00e2\u20ac\u2122x15\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 covered patio overlooking a roof top garden (very nice!). The Intercontinental is a step up in service and amenities, offering 24 hour room service. Mine was promptly delivered by a friendly and courteous gentleman named Julio. The hotel is a full service establishment and as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect, those services come at a price. But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re prepared to pay the price you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed. The room service menu offers a reasonable variety of fare (at a price) and very well prepared and presented. I suspect that most people would be out sampling the local cuisine and not dining in their room. But I was working every day so getting a quick no-fuss meal delivered was high on my list of priorities most weeknights. As is common in New Orleans, the hotel offers valet parking (exclusively) at $32 + tax daily. I tried to always have at least $2 to tip the valets. The garage is a few blocks away and they do a lot of running back and forth so I figured they more than deserve that consideration. Call ahead for your vehicle and allow about 20 minutes for the car to come around. There is a public garage next door that charges $25/day if you want to save a few $$. The ground level of the hotel is dedicated to Pete\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar & Grill, the sundry shop, and a coffee/Danish shop. Check-in, additional restaurants, and the Concierge are an escalator ride to the 2nd level which is very attractive and well-staffed. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an experienced visitor to New Orleans, you get used to waiting for elevators. But the Intercontinental has 4 very fast elevators and I never had to wait more than a few seconds for the lift. As I said, my room was well appointed, but my personal preference would be for brighter lighting. The room also offered some of those little touches I love, a very quiet air conditioning system, turning on the hot water and finding it gets hot and stays that way throughout my shower, a broad selection of TV channels to view (though no pay per view movie offerings which puzzled me). One shortcoming was the little coffee maker which brewed one cup at a time. I love my coffee so I travel with a small French press. The plus here is that the hotel supplies Columbian Supremo and when put through my press was rich and almost chocolaty, exquisite in the a.m. The biggest plus (for me) was their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instant Service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd button on the phone. I hate calling customer service and either not getting an answer or getting put on hold indefinitely. Not so at the Intercontinental. Hit the button, it rings once (maybe twice) and a courteous person greets you by name and handles whatever it is you need without transferring you to another department (another thing I hate). If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a frequenter of New Orleans, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably used to late night revelers loudly wandering the halls. (Why to intoxicated people talk so loud?) Not so at the Intercontinental. My room was very quiet and the bed!!!! Think of sleeping on a cloud! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m usually an early riser and I have to admit, the bed was so comfortable that I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get out of it and I got well acquainted with the snooze button on my alarm clock. Housekeeping was quick and thorough. Though I suspect that quick is the key word. In fact, the only obnoxious sounds I heard during my stay were the repeated slamming of doors as the housekeepers moved from room to room. Afternoon naps on the weekend were not a great idea. Bottom line: If you want to treat yourself a little better than your usual bargain hunter stay, you really should try the Intercontinental Hotel in New Orleans.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis", "Title": "\u201cA good modern hotel in downtown NOLA\u201d", "Author": "StLEngineer", "ReviewID": "UR130280460", "Content": "The Intercontinental is a nice modern hotel. In New Orleans, this means that there is no damp, musty smell, the rooms are well laid-out and have modern electrical systems.

The room rate was a good one, including acceptable Wi-Fi service. The location is also very good, just a few blocks from the French Quarter and roughly a ten minute walk north of the Mississippi. The Saint Charles streetcar line has a stop across the street and the Canal Street streetcar is only about three blocks away. You can walk to any of the New Orleans urban attractions, although you'll probably want to take the streetcar if you go to Audubon Park or to the universities. The room was quite spacious, the bed comfortable, with electrical outlets available for chargers to plug in. Now a few of the negatives. The rooms do have windows, but there isn't much of a view as there are buildings all around. That's the way things are in a downtown area unless you're in one of the tallest buildings.

I got a good deal, $60, so despite the lackluster nature of my room, I just dealt with it. Smelled like cigarettes, the beds were both completely tilted to the clock side (i actually flipped one myself), and the elevator was beeping loudly the entire night, to go along with slamming doors.

We were able to party as long as we wanted and then let it go. He was trying to sleep in the middle of an all night party - I suspect it was a long night! One thing that really impressed me - my son was to get married on Saturday with a parade, etc. Thunderstorms called for on Saturday so - the wedding was moved up to Friday evening. We arrived at the Intercontinental at about 10 am Friday morning and dropped off our bags (they kept them for us under lock and key) and headed off to city hall to get the paperwork and waivers done. I explained our problem to the desk clerk and the young man was most helpful. I explained the wedding had been moved up and was now at 5pm Friday. Regular check in being at 4pm was going to be a major issue. I asked for a 2pm check in to allow us time to shower and prepare for the wedding. He assured me it would not be a problem - contacted the cleaning service people and asked for our room to be cleaned asap and took our cell phone number. These people were great - they had us in our room by 1pm and we were able to get everything done in plenty of time which relieved a lot of pressure. It is/was most appreciated. They eliminated a major hurdle (at no extra charge) and saved the day. Good job Intercontinental Hotel - your Hotel was excellent but your people and attitude was exceptional!

The balcony door was nearly impossible to open and close...once we did make it out there we noticed RED RUM was written in the 1/2 inch of dirt on the sliding door. awesome! This has clearly been there awhile due to the 1/4 inch of dirt filling in the letters. We did try to upgrade the room to the concierge floor because I read those were nicer...but they said no.

It was not the fanciest place, but reasonably priced for the location and amenities. Out of all the places I have attended for conferences, the layout and convenience of the meeting rooms, quality of AV tech service, and catering was the best. The breakfast buffets and lunch we were served were outstanding. I had another helping of the crawfish salad stuffed avocado for dessert. The staff were all unfailingly courteous and helpful. Waits for elevators were minimal at any time of day. Housekeeping responded cheerfully to requests for extra towels and hangers and accommodated cleaning times to our schedules. The room was updated and there was a roomy closet, mini bar large enough for me to fit my left overs from Lebanon's Cafe in there (stuffed grape leaves are great cold), code safe and large desk as well as a small round table. The bed was comfy--I'm used to larger pillows but I was fine--and everything was very clean. If I have any complaint it's that the bathroom has a fixed front bureau look and no drawers or shelves for toiletries. Rather than clutter the counter, I left my items in travel bags and deposited them in the closet. I did get a rental car and found that I could park in the lot next door before 9 a.m. for $10.00. Towards Canal, close to Carondelet and Gravier, is the Hilton Garden Inn parking lot. The public can park there for $5.00 above the 6th floor. There were always spots on the same block as the Intercontinental for free between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. Even though it was French Quarter Festival weekend, I think I ended up paying about $35 to park Tues-Sunday. It's an easy 3 block walk to Harrah's and then you can amble up Decatur or along the river front into the French Quarter. My room faced St. Charles. The rumble of the streetcars in the morning wasn't disturbing to me as it brings back nice memories of my mom taking me to Audubon Park on one when I was little.

If things are going to go pear shaped, it is going to happen at 1:00am. Not only is it late - but this is a family trip, this is why I work - this is why I travel - this is what matters to me. On a business trip if things go wrong - it's just me, I'll deal with it; but on these family trips - well, they are more complex and it matters a lot more to me that things go right. Everything went right. Check-in took all of 2 minutes. Staff was polite, courteous and knowledgeable. Very smooth. The lobby was clean and elegant - and very sharp - if I hadn't known better I would have thought it was brand new hotel. Elevator needed a room key to whisk us up to the 14th floor (my wife liked the extra security). Walking off the elevator the hallway was bright and fresh and the carpet in great shape - again, things looked good - in no way dated (some reviews have mentioned cleanliness; I'm in the food business - my lowest health department score in years has been an 98% - I know clean - the hotel was clean; this isn't an opinion (the wife is a certified inspector and has a doctorate - she was impressed, that's not easy). Ok - Hotel looks good, staff is great, lobby is nice, hallway in good shape and now we get to the room. The room. Wow. Just Wow. After staying at the Grand in Paris, the Amstel in Amsterdam, the Willard, the Barclay, the IC Rome and a host of others - it takes more than a standard room for us to go wow. This was nice - by any standard. Beautiful corner suite on the club level. We loved the room; the master bed had been fitted with one of those fancy foam mattresses, the extra bed we requested was in the room - even more comfortable than the master bed; and outfitted with extra pillows and blankets. Great beds, spotlessly clean room. And it was huge - Master bedroom with a private bath, sitting area, foyer, dinning room, office, second bathroom. Oh - and a kitchen - huge fridge; which we made use of and loved :) We slept well and soundly each night. The location is 2 blocks off the french quarter - the room was silent at night. Silent - no streetcar noise, no noise of any kind. I had to work, loved the desk (not a glass top thank goodness) and the Internet was quick. Ok - so the room from it's core function of getting a good nights sleep - check, perfect. It was tastefully well appointed, highly functional and a joy to relax within. I've mentioned a few times we were on the club floor - many club floors in the US are not a great value; this was the exception - this club was quite nice. Each morning my wife and I wandered down the hall for a quiet breakfast; eggs, bacon, salmon and much more - very nice breakfast; good coffee to boot - but make sure you have a croissant, truly the highlight of the breakfast. And kudos to the lounge attendant, she was wonderful at assisting with any request. Each evening the lounge was transformed with a plethora of food and drinks (we did not partake as we had huge dinner reservations each evening) but the food did look nice. Twice I ran down to the lounge for an extra drink late in the evening (Diet Coke - as I stayed up a few nights and worked late while the family slept) - I really appreciated they kept chips, sweets and drinks out late in the evening. Lounge - Great value for money - wonderful full hot breakfast, nice evening food and drinks and very considerate snacks and drinks kept stocked in the lounge 24/7 for guests. We really appreciated/enjoyed the lounge. Location - again - perfect. Two blocks off the quarter kept it quiet; and right on a streetcar stop meant we had a fun ride down to magazine and the garden district for a whopping $1.25. For longer trips the cab stand at the hotel always had a taxi for us, even during downpours. Less than a 2 minute walk to CVS, with multiple local shops even closer. To recap: Clean Hotel, great nights sleep, wonderful room, excellent lounge and prime location. We will return, we will recommend the InterContinental New Orleans to friends and colleagues. Should I have the opportunity to hold a meeting in the city, my first call will be to the InterContinental New Orleans.

They're right. I stayed at the Intercontinental New Orleans from Feb 1-5. It's a nice hotel in a good location along St. Charles Avenue in the CBD. However, it's simply not up to Intercontinental standards. The first thing I always do upon checking into a hotel is to turn on the TV. When I attempted to turn on the TV at the Intercontinental I discovered the remote did not work. I then discovered the slide-out drawer the TV rested upon was broken...leaving the TV slanting from left to right at an angle that made for awkward viewing. After turning on the TV using the buttons on the front of the TV I noticed that hitting \"Channel Down\" actually turned off the TV instead of working properly. Additionally, the TV is an old CR-Tube model. In an era when three star hotels have large flat screen TVs, it felt a bit strange watching an old-style, non-HDTV model at a supposed four-star hotel. I try not to stay at places that do not offer free wifi, but the Intercontinental doesn't even offer PAID wifi! The hotel is really like taking a trip back to 2005. Since I've stayed in New Orleans 5 times over the past 5 years, I thought I'd give you my guide to the hotels I've stayed in (from best to worst): 1. Lowes (great location, great bar (Swizzle Stick) and wonderful service) 2. Royal Sonesta (the jewel of the French Quarter, very attentive service, but guest rooms and hallways look dreary and drab) 3. Sheraton (mega-hotel on Canal St., caters to conventioneers, good location) 4. Intercontinental 5. Royal St. Charles (DO NOT STAY HERE - rude, inattentive service, ground floor nightclub (now a coffee shop) kept me awake all night with bass-heavy trance music) I would have complained about the TV, but a.) it was midnight upon check in, b.)replacing a tv is not an easy task, especially for those old heavy ones, and c.)I didn't want to switch rooms at that time of night. Oh...almost forgot. I know SOMEONE has to stay in the room by the elevator, but it sucks that it was me. Drunk people returning from the French Quarter at 4:00AM awoke me every night.

I was a little skeptical going into this stay after reading reviews from other travelers, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I am quite a discerning traveler, and I must say we were pleased from the moment we arrived. It was a crazy busy time to be in New Orleans, and we were checking in on the Saturday before the BCS Championship Game, which was on Monday. I expected great delays at check-in, because I knew they were booked to capacity. As soon as we drove into the driveway of the hotel, we were greeted by a smiling valet and a bellman...surprising, given the number of people who were arriving at the same time! They pleasantly took our car and our bags and directed us toward the registration desk, where we were greeted by a friendly young man named Alton. He greeted us with a smile and addressed our two little girls, ages 8 and 9. He made sure we knew our way around, directing us to the elevators and sincerely telling us to come to him if we had questions or concerns. I had called a head a couple days before and requested an upper floor, and we were happy to find we were on the 12th floor. I think lower floor rooms probably have more street noise. Upon entering the room, we saw comfy beds with extra pillows...a big plus. Some of the furniture was a little worn, and yes, the television was not a flat screen, but everything worked great, and we were happy enough with the furnishings. There were blackout drapes on the window (huge for me!), hair dryer, coffee maker, and we were given extra towels as soon as we requested them. Room service was prompt and friendlty, and the food was delicious. We ordered breakfast one morning, and we were thrilled when it arrived. You can order one New Orleans style breakfast, and it will feed two people, though it doesn't say so on the menu. The coffee was great too. We also ordered dinner one night, but I always order a burger or sandwich from room service, because I feel like it's safe. This time I ordered the Bistro Burger, and it was fabulous! I wanted to eat the whole thing, but it was HUGE, so I couldn't! Because we have two little girls, we always have to visit the hotel gift shop, no matter where we go, and we were very pleased with the service and selection there. All toiletries are available, and the staff is very kid-friendly. As far as location, if you don't want to be in the midst of all the chaos of the French Quarter but want to be nearby, this hotel has a fabulous location. We were a couple blocks off Canal Street, making us just a few blocks from the French Quarter. Poydras St is just down the block, making this hotel convenient to the Superdome, easily within walking distance. The streetcar picks up just down the block at the corner of St. Charles and Poydras, and we opted to use this to get back and forth to Commander's Palace retaurant (a must!). We checked out on a Tuesday morning...again, another busy day, since the big game was the night before. Again, I was anticipating delays at checkout and at the bell/valet desk, but those delays did not exist! Check out was speedy, and Alton remembered the girls! We have been home for just one day, and I have already recommended the hotel to a friend who is visiting New Orleans in March. There are \"nicer\" hotels in New Orleans, but I cannot believe you will get better service from any staff. And the location is tough to beat.

We're new to the Intercontinental chain but certainly know of the quality based on what we've heard in Chicago and San Francisco; but this property definitely lacks any quality. Having stayed in many high end chains we found that our experience here was similar to what would find at the low end, i.e. Motel 6. Check-in was efficient and friendly, as was the Concierge service, and people at the front door. After that it all goes down hill. The room was actually dirty, and especially the carpet which not only needed a cleaning but had candle wax and unidentifiable substances on it. Pillow covers were actually thread bare. The bathroom was also not overly clean, and there's a very strange vanity that not only is uncomfortably high (if you're short it would be extremely awkward) and has many mock drawers but nowhere to store anything. Housekeeping doesn't seem too concerned about appearance as all the lamp shades were on angles when we arrived. After about the 3rd night we discontinued leaving a tip. The doors to the armoire were broken and could not close. We returned back to the room one evening around 5pm to find the room hadn't been made up from the morning yet, and while getting ready for dinner the maid came to the door only to seem annoyed when I asked her to come back in a half an hour when we'd be gone. The worst, however, was the total lack of sound and acoustic control. Literally we heard every word and conversation of our neighbors. The bed in the room next to ours squeaked so badly that any time a person turned in it you'd think it was in your own room.

But this hotel is old-fashioned in appearance. It is not furnished with exquisitie antiques, but looks more like something from the 1950s. The amenities are all there, though, like WiFi, good Tvs, a gym etc. The service is very good, the rooms are clean and the concierge and front desk are all very willing to help out. The value, at least for our conference rate, was excellent. The hotel is very convenient to all major attractions, with the French Quarter 4 blocks away and the Casino about 2. Now the word \"threadbare\" might very well be applied to New Orleans itself, especially post Katrina and post Oil Slick. Some of the old, cool places never came back or returned as shells of their former selves. The French Quarter is even dirtier than usual and the smells are not exactly pleasant unless you like the aroma of dampness, stale alcohol spilled in the street or other olfactory experiences which will go unmentioned. Still, there is no reason to kick the town while it is down. New orleans is still an extraordinary experience with massive numbers of hugely loud crowds on Bourbon Street and beyond and incredible music blaring from every hole in the wall. The street performers are even more talented than in Paris...which is saying something...and the French architecture is still awe-inspiring as is the culture, the anything-goes spirit and the great Antique and Art shops along Royal Street and elsewhere. Certain comparisons to France are inevitable, but when it comes to noise level and buzzing activity, all comparisons end. New Orleans is like Paris on Steroids. And the food is still great in so many places...best food in the USA, I think. One last word of caution. New Orleans is a dangerous city.

I spoke with Alton, he was sweet and said no problem, I'll have a room on the 12th floor and to have a good trip. I get there and I am told that they do not have a room for me--the Night Manager, Nygen--tells me that I can either stay in a smoking room or a room with a sofa bed and sleep on that or I can go to another hotel. I tell him that I called ahead during the day who I spoke with and he snottily tells me that the day guy didn't have the right to do that, and too bad, because I booked through a third party I wasn't guaranteed a room. After being shocked by this, I end up at the Crowne Royal on Canal which was a pit and had a fire alarm at 4:30 in the morning. They did pay for the cab there and the return cab, however, the inconvenience and the waste of the day of unpacking (I came one day early to actually enjoy New Orleans before diving into work) was miserable. I return to the hotel around 11:00am and end up getting upgraded to a suite with a balcony, and the breakfast/drinks lounge. OK..they're trying to make it up. I'm here on business, and all I want is to be able to get some restful sleep while I'm working for a client and some work done. The food in the lounge was ok...if it weren't complimentary. The lounge is no access after 11, so if you come back in late, and you need some water, you're out of luck--after learning this, I just stocked up when I went in the morning and if I made it back for their cocktails. Staff is very nice. Upside, they have upgraded the TV's to Flatscreens. Downside they still have mechanical problems with their doors. My door lock stopped working--they had to have engineering send someone to replace the lock. Which means that my key card had to be re-done, and I misplaced my key one night. Both times, I had to come back down to get the upgrade access to the club floor added which was inconvenient and typical, because I stood there while they re-keyed my card and told them to put the upgrade on the key. So the listening skills weren't that great. Plus the upgraded room was next to a bunch of 20 something frat boys who were loud at all nights. My room was part of a suite with the door locked between the two, and you could hear everything. When they checked out, I then ended up next to families with screaming kids who run up and down the hall. They either need to soundproof the place or they need to have kid free and 20 something free floors where people who aren't there to party can actually benefit from this being a Business Hotel. As for the overbooking--that is completely unacceptable. Why are you as a business going to put out rooms on the site at Rack Rate and then tell people who book---too bad? I paid $98 a night, which was $30 more than what other people I saw were paying. Plus the inconvenience of coming in exhausted from a red-eye and being shipped off to a dump. Bed was comfortable. Maid service adequate--the first day, I saw a made and said that my room was available to be cleaned, it wasn't. Called down to guest services--got the we'll send someone right up, and that never happened. Called the next morning, they were on the spot with taking care of it, but it was too late--were already on the next day--what was the point. Room Service--not getting it. Usually they wheel the cart into your room, the guy carried the tray in, there's no place to set the tray down because the desk was covered with work. So I had to eat off the nightstand. The food was ok but not worth the overcharge. All in all, adequate--from my understanding this is what passes for a 4 star in New Orleans. Seeing as how the Crowne Royal Plaza was rated as a 3 star and was a complete pit--I worry for anyone who can't afford to stay in at least a 4 star. Weekend Concierge a bit clueless--maybe she was new, but asking here where a spa was, she didn't know or recommended ones way far away, walking around the corner, I found one that she didn't mention. When I told the spa owner about it, she said they referred people to here all the time. So I'll chalk it up to her being new.

The room that we were given was spacious, clean and comfortable with a large bathroom. We never heard any noise from other rooms. At the end of each day, the room was a pleasant, if temporary, home. The TV wasn't a flat screen but who cares about TV if they are visiting New Orleans? The staff at the InterContinental was professional, helpful and friendly. I was impressed. The Concierge, Michael, gave us recommendations for some of the restaurants in the French Quarter. Our dinner at Arnauds in Bievielle St. was excellent. I felt that I got the benefit of good advice from a local rather than the standard steer toward a place that advertised with the hotel. The front desk handed me an umbrella to replace the one I had been stupid enough to leave in New Hampshire. In short, the InterContinental was exactly what I wanted for a New Orleans hotel. Perfect location, flawless service and a great place to retreat to at the end of the day. I did not use the spa, the pool or the fitness center as I was out walking around New Orleans. New Orleans Tips: Watch Treme, the HBO series before you go. Taxis from the airport are a flat rate $33 for 1 or two. This is the easiest was to get into the city. Use the streetcars/ busses to get around the city. A day pass costs $3. French Quarter Food: Arnauds and Muriels were both elegant and excellent. Both had all-inclusive dinners for $40 or less that featured excellent cuisine. Go to Cafe DeMonde on Decatur St for beignets and coffee while sitting outdoors watching the French Quarter come to life. Try the Muffeleta at the Central Grocery. One of these sandwiches will feed two people. Make it out to the Garden District to see some of the elegant old homes that grace this city. Shopping: The French Quarter has dozens of shops that seem to sell the same tourist-oriented merchandise: T-shirts, postcards, beads, more T-shirts... The Louisiana Music Company on Decatur St had a great selection of local and popular music. It was a trip back to the 70's; Listening stations, and a knowledgeable staff. If you like music, check it out. The ferry that leaves from the base of Canal St can be a brief respite from the summer heat and humidity. Also, its free. Go see Bourbon Street at night. Walk down it for 2 or three blocks and you'll get the agenda. It really is a pretty decadent incarnation of a sophomore's frat house dream. You will meet tourists there from everywhere else. Have a 'Big Beer' or 5...... Not for children or for those with sensitivity of any sort. I loved my taste of New Orleans and will be back. The city has a crumbly, almost Caribbean feel in some of its parts. Hot and humid in July? Absolutely. Learn to sweat gracefully and go out to enjoy this truly different place.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "blackdots", "ReviewID": "UR115966874", "Content": "This was by far the friendliest staff.

One of the knocks would be that the breakfast was a little overpriced considering what they offered for the buffet. You're better off ordering from the menu. Another knock was that their pub, Pete's was absolutely empty except for a couple of barflies. Also, considering it's a higher end hotel brand, you expect to have wifi (even if we have to pay for it). We only had landline internet, and managed to jump on the Hilton's free wifi across the street. Kinda pathetic. Finally, if you bring a car, it's about $35 a day to valet, no other option. We walked and used taxis instead. I will say that it's lacking a bit of the luxury that you would expect from the brand. We paid considerably less because of online deals, but I don't think I would pay their normal rate.

The bathroom was one of those split affairs, with the sink area open to the main room - at an IC?!?! My safe was operational, but not screwed into the wall - anyone could have walked away with the entire thing. The ammenities were tiny and not up to IC standard. My room included a balcony which was pretty useless since it was a windswept wasteland, facing other rooms and the building next door. It was also none too clean. The balconies all face the back of the hotel and from the constant noise I'm guessing the ventilation units from both the IC and the building next door face the courtyard - not relaxing in any way. Old fashioned CRT type TV - I repeat, in an IC!!! My room had not one but two connecting doors to the rooms alongside me, and neither were insulated - I could see light from the adjoining rooms underneath, and I could clearly hear conversations from next door. I stayed here for the points - next time I'll forgo them and stay someplace that justifies the price, or stay in the HI for half the price in a similar room.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Stay in NOLA\u201d", "Author": "MarriedinMexico07", "ReviewID": "UR105327951", "Content": "Got our room through Bookit.com, super deal.

The plumbing was very noisy and the room door closers were adjusted so that if someone walked out of their room and let the door go it would loudly slam shut. As a consequence, flushing toilets and early departing guests ensured that you were wide awake no later than 6 AM. My biggest complaint was the Internet broadband. They charge about $10 per day for the service in the room and it is hard cable only, not wireless. If a couple both have laptops, then they have to take turns using it. If one of you is traveling with an iPad, then you cannot use it at all. To add insult to injury, the bandwidth is only slightly faster than a dial-up connection.

The one bed we slept on was quite comfortable but the other bed was lopsided and had a wooden board underneath. I would have been really disappointed if I had to sleep on it. We had a corner room on the 12th floor with a decent view but I would think most rooms from this hotel probably are lacking that because of the surrounding buildings. No free Wifi from the hotel but there was free pulic (slow) Wifi available from other sources. The room had a tube television. The bathroom was lacking. The shower pressure was alright but the shower head was old. It was easy for water to get on the floor while taking a shower. Both the shower and the toilet made some interesting noises. The rooms and hotel look older but I found them both to be some of the cleaner I've seen. NO received over 3.5 inches of rain in less than 8 hours the first night we stayed. That evening and early morning there was a repetitive banging and groaning noise that went on for hours. It didn't really bother me but I could see it bothering most guests.

That weather was extreme so I'm not sure if those noises were a rare occasion here but it didn't happen any other night we stayed.

However, we couldn't get an upgrade because they were completely booked and no additional rooms were available. We wasted at least 20-30 minutes on the whole upgrade thing while there were no rooms to upgrade to. That was frustrating. The basic room is small. There are no kings, only queens or doubles. The bathrooms are tiny. The single sink is so high, I had to lift up my daughter every day so she could brush her teeth. I found it high for myself even! The shower head was a joke as the holes were almost completely rusted out. The shower also \"screamed\" the entire time it was on. I can't explain it better than that. Just a super LOUD screaming sound coming from it while on. The beds are very, very old. My bed sloped to one side and throughout the night, I was constantly rolling to the one drooping side. The pillows are old and not comfortable. The linens on our bed were ripped and simply tucked in to hide it. The furniture seemed fine. The televisions were the old tube models and the picture was grainy and fuzzy. They use satellite tv, so one night when it rained, we were stuck inside the room but had no television. The view from our room was onto a parking lot. The rooms were the worst I've ever stayed in from a 4 star hotel (or even a 3 star or 2 star).

We complained, but no one did anything. We had one other meal at the hotel restaurant, and it was just ok. Very $$$. Avoid it if you can. Try Luke's Brasserie directly across the street. Room service is very expensive, as expected. Don't do it unless you have to. A VERY SIMPLE breakfast for 2 was $60. We didn't have a car, so cannot comment on the parking.

The jazz quartet was very entertaining without being too loud. Checkout was smooth. It did take about 20 minutes to get the car although we called ahead but it was Monday morning.

It is, however, a disappointing one--and at full price, a terrible value. Also, it seems that either the management or the ownership of the hotel is asleep at the switch at times. A number of New Orleans hotels date from the late 70s, or early 80s, and this one opened in 1984 in time for World's Fair. Unfortunately, this hotel looks every bit of its 26 years at times, in decor, in upkeep, or both. While other hotels date from the same period, you'd be hard pressed to find a hotel as charmless, inside and out, as the InterCon in New Orleans. In a city of great character, this is a structure that looks all the world like a 15 story office building. That sense doesn't go away once inside the front door, either. A bank of escalators rises to a rather non-descript second floor. And the weekend I stayed here, one or both of the escalators was broken. The rooms are average sized (though for New Orleans, above average) though the position of the building and its lack of height deny guests much of a view. Great beds are the highpoint of the room. The room's carpet was particularly dated--both in pattern and age. Nearly didn't want to walk on it with bare feet. As befits an InterContinental, there are some nice details--bathrobes, phone in the bath, bathroom scale, a nice coffee making machine (the single cup sanitary kind--thanks). The TV is about 15 years old and is encased in a huge armoire. The marble bath is large, but a wall between the vanity and the water closet/bath bifurcates the space awkwardly. Curved shower rods would have been a nice addition. The shower didn't work well--once I notified the front desk, was fixed quickly and well. Bathroom amenities are tough to open--particularly with wet hands. There is mouthwash available, but you have to ask for it. . .how about placing it in the rooms? WiFi is free on the first three floors, but no one bothered to tell me that at check-in, and the wire-required internet in the rooms costs $5-10 a day, depending on how long you purchase it. (Note to hotel--just do it free throughout the hotel. Feels cheap and nickel/diming to do otherwise). There is a fitness center and pool on the 15th floor. Fitness center was fine, clean, and bright, though the clock there was broken throughout my stay. The pool is small, and the outdoor pool deck smaller. Location is not bad--on St. Charles Avenue on the streetcar line to the Garden District and Uptown, four blocks from the French Quarter in one direction and four blocks from the Casino in the other. I paid $61 a night on Priceline. As such, the hotel was not a bad value. However, this hotel clearly would like to get more per night for its rooms. . .And at full price, I couldn't recommend this hotel. Would have to think that hotels like the JW Marriott, Loews, Hilton St. Charles, W are meant to be most direct competitors. Nearly all are nicer, more charming, reflecting of more local flavor. If you have to pay full price here, ensure they have renovated first. To my knowledge, no renovation has been planned.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cLap of Luxury!\u201d", "Author": "GeauxSouthernBelle", "ReviewID": "UR77811895", "Content": "My husband and I absolutely love this hotel.

CONS: It is a very large hotel, many rooms, which means that upkeep and maintance is difficult and it SHOWS. Example: you will see wallpaper started to peel in many areas, in both the rooms and common areas. Carpet has stains in the hallways.parts of the walls look patched and warped. The second room I was in the shower head was loose, I has to tighten it back to the wall. Old bulky tvs in room. FYI. This visit I stayed in two rooms. The first room I was on the 7th floor which has some smoking rooms. My room was non smoking, but still smelled of smoke. Staff readily relocated me to another floor. Valet is about $32/night.

Within the 4* market segment (Westin, Renaissance, Omni and I/C)- and I stay at lots of them- this property is among the bottom 10%. I had rooms with two beds. In both my butt was a foot lower than my feet or shoulders and the left side of my body was higher than the right. This was unacceptable so I dialed the number labeled \"we solve all problems\". The attendant was sympathetic and said she would get right back to me regarding a room change. When the return call failed to materialize in 15 minutes, I called again and was told, \"The managers are really busy today and aren't calling me back.\" I marched down to the front desk and got a room change. Guess what? Once again both beds sagged north/south and east /west. I decided to investigate. The metal bed frames had been pulled apart and were now wider than the box spring, which therefore was not supported. The mattress (judged by the look of its cover and condition) was 25 years old. It was compressed and sagged with no weight on it. Granted there were $300 feather beds on top of them, but the mattresses had been dead for 15 years. I called Guest Services two more times. Both calls met with polite sympathy and promises to get back to me with a fix. No calls were received. I proceeded to adjust/fix the metal bed frame so that it at least supported the box spring, I then stuffed the pillows from one bed between the mattress and box spring on the other and in the end had a highly improvised, but reasonably comfortable bed for the night. That this even needed to occur is absurd. That management can literally ignore priority customer service calls boggles the mind. The second room had no upholstered chair- a first for me in a 4*. Perhaps it had been removed because it was stained even more than the chair in the first room, which was filthy. The furniture had been through the wars. It was chipped and banged up. The carpet I am quite sure dates to the 1980s and has never been steam cleaned. I did not walk on it with bare feet because the thought of doing so grossed me out. In fairness, the housekeeper had vacuumed and the bathroom was clean. It is the absence of heavy cleaning over the years that creates the problem. The hallways look like a 2* hotel from 1945- dingy. So many light bulbs have been removed in the public spaces that one suspects the hotel is in bankruptcy. The decor is 1980s red velvet and faux gold leaf- not a great look- done badly. The look suggests the designer's previous commission was a house of ill repute for senior communist party officials in Eastern Kazakstan. The similarly priced Sheraton where I have also stayed is a standout for that brand and far, far nicer than the Intercontinental. Avoid the I/C New Orleans like the plague.

It was a bit more than I'd hoped to spend, but I figured it would be worth it. WRONG. The room was tiny, with one chair - so when my husband and I ordered room service, there was little room to eat. There was no dresser, only two small drawers beneath the tv cabinet / minibar. We were travelling for a week, which meant we ended up with wrinkled clothes in our suitcases - oh, and there was nowhere to put our suitcases except the floor beside the bed. There was one suitcase stand in the small closet, but it was broken. The walls were paper thin; neither of us slept a single night all the wall through, as we awoke every time our neighbors came and went. We could even hear distinctly every word of conversation and each time they opened the safe or put down a glass. We did have the balcony as requested (and paid for), but I hadn't realized it would be looking down an alley and constantly dark. It wasn't exactly inviting - more the atmosphere of a dank apartment block. The bed was dirty. There was something that looked suspiciously like vomit encrusted all over the bedskirt. Had I noticed this when we checked in, I would have requested another room, but it was late and we'd been travelling all day. After that, I just tried to avoid it. Disgusting! The internet connection in the room didn't work, so I tried the \"business center.\" Their business center is nothing more than two computers in the lobby (which require a credit card for use, which struck me as pretty chintzy considering the price of the hotel) - but they were broken all week long. The TV remote didn't work either. Finally, the room service ... The hotel has a \"romance package\" breakfast, which we ordered for our first morning. It took forever to arrive (which seemed odd, considering nothing needed cooking), and when it did, it was missing some of the advertised food. Considering that, with delivery charge and included tip, it costs about $100, that's pretty bad. But, for some reason, we ordered room service twice again. With those two times, we had the same problem: they gave us silverware and coffee cups for two people, but food for one. Oh, but they did charge us for two. All in all, it wasn't a good experience. I would NEVER stay here again. My family is from New Orleans and we travel there quite often. This was the worst place I've ever stayed.

The staff were all friendly and helpful, when I complained that the door stuck, it was fixed when I returned to the room. On the top floor is a fitness room with several machines and a heated outdoor pool. I didn't swim in the pool because I don't think it was \"heated.\" There's a gift shop downstairs and a pastry/coffee shop. On the second floor is a lovely European syle restaurant--The Veranda and Pete's--an English style pub. The room was large with a foyer at the entrance, two room marble bathroom and two double beds. The shower was great with a large shower head and plenty of hot water, but the shower curtain always allowed water to run across the floor. Damana brand French tolietries were supplied. Plenty of coffee was supplied with the single serve coffee pot. I personally don't like all the little signs around the room and the water bottles with the price tags and the pricey stocked refrigerator. I like my room to seem like home, not a \"sales room.\" The view from my room was of the parking car garage nest door, I was so close, I could read the license plates numbers. Here's what's unbelievable to me, the mattress was soft and bouncy. A thin feather mattress was placed on top of it-- I guess in an attempt to improve it. I had such a backache that I had to pay for a $140.00 massage just so I could get through the next day. So much for bargain hotels --right? I hope no one actually pays $175.00 a night for this hotel. Also, if you have a car, you will pay &30.00 night to have it parked or $45.00 if it's \"oversized.\" I think next time I book a hotel, I'll try and find out what kind of mattress the hotel has.

In fact, after staying at Intercontinental New Orleans, I won't think I'll come again. The Cons: 1. The service was bad. The front desk told us that the free room and the paid room would combine together, but it never. On the 3rd night, the card could not open the door. We had to go to the front desk to lie up again to change to a new card. 2. Breakfast was cold, no variety, less choice and pricey. The paid room $199 is including 2 free breakfast. We have 2 kids (6 & 3)with us. We brought our kids go to the resturant with us becuase they could not stay at the room by themselves. They bring their own milk inside. The manager still charged 1 kid's price at $14.99+tax. I argued with him, he still had to charge a small box of cheerio which my son just took a piece into his mouth. The manager told me the box cheerio just costed $2-3, but it was $4+tax when he handed me the bill. 3. The same opinion with other travelers is the bed is old and too soft. It caused my husband and I had back pain. They have to update the beds and furniture. 4. Lack of amentiy. We have 4 people but they have only 1 person's amenity. We have to ask call them to bring in everytime. A bit stingy. It maybe good for one business traveler but not family with kids.

We actually were not there for the Fest and did not go but just about everyone else there did! Location is very good since it is only three blocks from Canal. You can be in the bustle of the quarter really quickly but can escape if you want to also. We had always stayed in the quarter before so were not sure this would be something we would like or not but thought it was worth a try. We are very happy that we did! Check in went quickly. Rooms are very nice, more antique than trendy. Rooms have balconies, however, ours faced another building across the street so not much of a view but nice to sit and enjoy a breeze. Surprised no flat screen TV yet but it worked just fine. Also, there doesn't seem to be that many hotels with good outdoor pools downtown so we were happy that we could sit outside and get some sun every day. Work out area is pretty small for a big hotel so getting a machine was not always an option. Ate the first night right across the street at Luke. Really happening bar with unique food options. It was very good and price was moderate for New Orleans. Other days we did walk over to the quarter. We were happy to see that Hotel Monteleone bar was still a hot spot where you can sit at the \"merry go round\" bar and have a drink watching the bartenders get confused as you move around them. They also have to jump over the bar since there is no door so it is pretty funny to watch sometimes. We had lunch at Napoleon House...one of our favorites. They have great lunches and a lovely courtyard to sit in. Prices there were very good also. We always hit this place whenever we are in town. A lovely restaurant we went to in the quarter was LeMeritage. It is quite new but service and food were fabulous. Once again, a great courtyard with a very creative menu. Wine pairings with half or full pours were available and we loved the idea of also offering small or large plates so you could taste more items on their menu and not get full. Everything was great. I would highly recommend this new option in the quarter. We did eat several breakfasts at the Intercontinental. The buffet didn't really seem worthwhile for what we like but the off the menu options were very good and reasonably priced. We also enjoy the $7.00 mimosa's to start the day!

The morning the bed was required, we asked the front desk if they could please arrange for the bed to be put into the room, and we were told no problem, and charged $30.00. After a call to house keeping later that night the bed still hadn't arrived. When we went to enquire at reception, we were told 'There are no spare beds' and then were told 'No you can't have a spare bed, due to fire regulations.' After a debate with the Manager, who told us in the first place we could have a spare bed, we conceeded it wasn't going to happen and our friends worked out their own sleeping arrangement. To the hotels credit, they did remove the charge of $30.00. The rooms were very nice, I liked the decor and the bathroom was lovely with a marble benchtop and huge mirror. The large windows made for great viewing of the Parades below. The hotel's restuarant was fantastic. We had dinner on the first night and tried the 5 course Tastes of New Orleans menu - the food was delicous and well cooked, although we did run out of cutlery part the way through and had to 'borrow' extra from an empty table.

So we had to rapidly remove all the stuff from the car because the entrance is small and crowded. We were told that the next door parking deck was about $15 per day, but you pay that fee every time you move your car. Our room was standard size. Space was adequate because we had one king bed. It seemed like it would have been crowded with two beds. Most of the space in the tv cabinet was consumed by a minibar. The cabinet had two small drawers, one of which was broken and did not open. We had to put our clothes in the two small nightstands. A small closet was available as well. The vanity, safe, and toilet were all unusually high and not user friendly for the petite person.

The first two years I stayed at the Holiday Inn on Royal Street, and never really had a problem there but it is a slightly rowdier crowd, especially during Mardi Gras. The Holiday Inn isn't anything special but it was way better than the Hotel Monteleone I stayed in this year for 3 days. Talk about overpriced. So after my non-refundable weekend at the Monteleone (trust me, I would have left right away after seeing that place) we decided to go follow Royal Street across to the other side of Canal Street, where Royal becomes St. Charles Street. We walked another two blocks and found the InterContinental. Right away I was definitely impressed. The building is fairly new and modern, built in 1984 I believe but you would think it's newer. When you walk into the foyer area, there is a huge escalator to take you up to the lobby. There are a few shops, a bar, and a parking garage all connected to this lobby and foyer area which is convenient as well. We weren't expecting them to have any rooms because of the extra large crowd at the 2009 Mardi Gras, but they had a room for us for Monday and Fat Tuesday, and it was about $20 less than the Monteleone's room. We got up to our room and it was awesome, I almost felt like we were in a mini suite - large and spacious, bathroom and shower was separate from the sink area, plenty of room to walk around the beds, a nice desk, and a much better television and entertainment center than in most rooms - a television you can actually connect components to. Even better was the ventilation and circulation in the room, a smoker could probably get away with smoking cigarettes in a non-smoking room here if they stood under the room's air intake in the hallway. You can almost feel a nice breeze as the air is constantly circulating. Another thing I really liked about this room was the huge wall of windows, we had a corner room and the view was spectacular.

We came in for the holiday weekend, as well as my birthday on Saturday. Randy greeted us and got our bags at the entrance. We checked in at 2pm with John. I mentioned to him that if it were possible, if we could get a nicer room for my special occasion. When we got to the room, it was nice, but standard, and it overlooked the parking deck next door. In terms of amenities, it was nice...comfy bed, clean and new looking bathrooms. Halfway through our stay, the remote control for the TV stopped working, but we were too lazy to ask them to replace it. We wished that the internet would have been more affordable, if not free. I used the exercise room one morning and it was good-sized and well equipped. The pool was located just outside of it, but since it was rainy, I didn't use it. We really liked the fact that it was within walking distance to the French Quarter, Harrah's, as well as the Riverwalk and the Aquarium, although sadly it was raining on and off all weekend. One of our favorite meals was across the street at Luke. When we returned to the room to freshen up before dinner on Saturday night, I was surprised by a bottle of champagne waiting for me. It was a very nice touch from the hotel to remember my birthday. All in all, we had a great trip in New Orleans and would definitely consider staying here at the InterContinental should we get a good rate again. ***One issue that did somewhat affect the enjoyment of our stay was the fact that the Bayou Classic was the same weekend. Unfortunately, the elevators could not hold up against the volume of people elevator riding to party in various hotel rooms, and thus there was a backup at the elevators. Also, when we left our room early Sunday morning to check out, we saw a man sleeping on a chair in the corner of the elevator waiting area, which shocked us.

We rode down to the Garden District and walked to the zoo for Swamp Fest for some local music and authentic cajun food.

To be honest, we didn't spend much time in the hotel room. The beds were comfortable. We had great water pressure. Lots of closet space. No noise problems. There were just a few minor problems. The air vent on the ceiling fell open. The TV had terrible reception, not that it mattered. You have to pay for internet. Room Service prices were ridiculous. The room was a bit run down, but still quite clean. I would not pay full price. The pastry shop on the first floor, is closed on weekends which seemed incredibly stupid with all the tourists there for Halloween. With so many great restaurants in NOLA, we didn't waste our time at the hotel restaurant. From the other reviews, it sounds like we didn't miss much. For $99/night I think we could have done better.

When I checked in I was told that I was being given a complimentary room upgrade to a King Deluxe. The room I got looked exactly like the one in their photos. I was on the 11th floor and had a huge balcony that overlooked the courtyard. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, the towels were large and plentiful, and the shower was great.

Two people could've made a meal of it. I liked it so much I got it both nights. As for location, the Intercontinental is in the perfect spot. Its at the border of where the central business district and the French quarter meet. This was a quiet area yet only a five minute walk to bustling Canal Street. The St.Charles and Canal streetcars are easily accessible, as well as public bus service, and the area itself is safe to walk at night. My only complaint, if you can call it that, were the connecting room doors lack of soundproofing.

The staff in the executive lounge were very friendly and helpful, but the lounge itself was nothing to get too excited about. No WIFI, and staff only in the morning (for continental breakfast) and a couple hours in the evening. Otherwise, it was a few softdrinks, chips, nuts, coffee & the NY Times. The gym & exercise room were clean and above adequate for a hotel (there was a real weight bench and weights over 25 lbs.!) with a nautilus machine, free weights, treadmills, bikes & stairmasters.

All the details of the stay were either above average or excellent. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful from the check-in to the concierge to housekeeping. They went out of their way to make our stay relaxing and fulfilling. Our room was upgraded upon check-in, probably because we paid rack rate and I am a frequent Intercontinental guest around the world. We had 1109 and it was equipped with a nice balcony with a overlook of the quiet alcove. The bed was really top quality with a nice feather bed and ample pillows. The curtains closed to make the room totally black and allowed us extra rest after a night of partying. The decor was smart and the room spotlessly clean. Although not spacious, it was generous enough and the bathroom was full marble and the towels fluffy. For location, it is really ideal. The street car passes directly in front of the complex and can get you uptown for $1.25. The French Quarter is a few block walk along safe streets even at night. Mother's, the famous greasy spoon, is a few blocks toward the river and they can satisfy any hunger you might conjur up. We didn't make use of the restaurants or bars in the hotel, but did catch a few rifts of the nightly music as we filtered back into the nightlife of the city when we passed the lobby. We, also, didn't check out the gym or the pool. Too much partying, I suppose, to pretend to work out. Isn't that the way it always ends up on trips to this city? The city has many options of hotels in this luxury category and most are fairly good bets. The Intercontinental, albeit pricey, was equal to any high end hotel I have stayed at in New Orleans.

Check-in wasn't until late afternoon but our room was ready when we arrived at 10:30 a.m. I had previously called the hotel and requested two beds . . . and that's what we were given. Our room (1119) was lovely. We had two double beds, armoire w/TV, minibar, desk, small table, one chair. We had a safe and iron/board in the closet, even had some padded hangers. Our large green-marble bathroom was two rooms . . . one with long counter, sink, magnifying mirror, hair dryer, coffee and another with tub/shower (nice, adjustable pressure) and commode. The beds were super comfy and our room was very quiet. We could not find one thing to complain about . . . it was perfect! The reception was polite and in no way made us feel badly about booking the hotel on Priceline.

The furniture was quite worn, but I have no real complaints about the room itself. I never actually saw hotel bar/restaurant (Pete's) open our entire stay--including Saturday night. The concierge also keeps strange hours as he was gone by 7pm on Saturday. The front desk was a poor substitute for the missing concierge--remarkably unhelpful with directions or recommendations.

With a special rate negotiated by my employer, I was able to stay for $133 for the night. I booked into a Queen, standard room, and on arrival was upgraded to what the desk clerk called the \"Presidential Suite\" on the club level, which he said normally rents for about $500. What a nice surprise! The room was huge - had a bedroom with a nice King size bed, a bathroom, and 3 other interconnected rooms: a sitting area, dining area, and kitchen, with separate bathroom attached to the dining area. While it was definitely spacious, the furnishings looked dated and in need of updating, as did the flooring, the bathroom, and the kitchen. For example, the refrigerator in the kitchen had to be at least 25 years old -- granted, if you are staying in an Executive Suite, you probably won't be using the fridge that much. However, in a high-end hotel, you would think that the furnishings and decor wouldn't be so dingy. Parking was easy at the garage next door, and pretty typically priced at $20. The staff was kind and efficient, and the Club Intercontinental complimentary breakfast was good. Interestingly, the Club dining room had been updated to a standard that would be appropriate for the rest of the rooms on the floor.

The bathrooms were huge, with stone/marble and granite counter area - the usual great Intercontinental amenities (and ours were replenished daily, unlike the reviews have posted elsewhere on this site). I noted two spots of mildew in the tub caulking and this was unexpected as I think proper treatment would have been able to clean this. Housekeeping was otherwise generally attentive and prompt. The beds were very comfortable, with double layer feather-beds below the mattress pad. The rooms were not very large, but adequate. The furniture was not as up to date as in some hotels in this chain but quite fine. No signs of damage or unattractive aging from overuse. The minibar, coffee bar, TV channels and on-demand movies were all exactly as expected from the Intercontinental chain - all functioned fine. It was lovely to get the NYTimes every day! The only two problems I had at this hotel were 1- You could hear every door slam in the hallway even through ear plugs (we may have had particularly noisy neighbors who literally slammed their doors). This was incredibly disruptive and I wished for more noise insulation. 2- There are no concierge or guest services here. They don't even supply you with a proper map - just a poor photocopy on which they proceed to circle three streets as their tourist guidance. There are plenty of free guides printed in New Orleans and available at many a hotel or the visitor center office- its perplexing why the Intercontinental can't have these guides ready for guests, or supply better quality maps!

I have NEVER had a bad experience with the Intercontinental other than that the gift shop/store closes too early (9PM) and the Valet parking is $29. Otherwise, my experiences have been very pleasant. The rooms are quiet, roomie and comfortable. The bathtub is adequately sized. Not garden tub sized but bigger than most of the hotels with their tiny tubs that force us bigger guys to shower instead. Location is convenient. It's on St. Charles about three blocks from Bourbon and the Quarter, and Three blocks from Harrahs and the Riverwalk. It is also maybe 5 or six blocks from the dome. The restaurant is pretty decent, albeit expensive.

We saw children at the hotel being treated to a visit by Santa Claus and his helpers.

Our package included a full breakfast which we enjoyed, especially because we were able to listen to the wonderful jazz musicians playing there that Sunday morning. We felt the location was perfect. It was a short 15 minute walk to the free ferry that transports people to Algiers across the river. There a van takes you to Mardi Gras World, well worth your time for young and old.

Check-in was off to a bit of a rough start. When I made the original reservation, it was just for myself with a king bed. Later, a friend decided to join me, and I called to ammend the reservation to include her name and book a room with two beds. They did not have my change in their system, so they needed to add her name and give me a different room. They did this without complaint. Once I arrived in my room I flipped on the tv and decided to unpack. I kept hearing a noise. I turned off the tv to see if the noise was related to that. It wasn't. Every 30 seconds or so, I would hear the same noise. The noise was driving me nuts, so I called the desk to ask what it was. They told me that it was the service elevator. I asked to change rooms. I hadn't seen the previous review that said to avoid room 1253 for this reason. I was in 1250, which also had that noise, and the person room across the hall from me also heard it. It took an hour, but they finally found me a room (1216) with 2 beds. No noise! A big window! This room was much better. Until I realized there were no hangers. I made a call to the front desk to get some and they were brought up promptly. Then I went to turn on the TV. The remote didn't work. I had to call the desk again, thinking it just needed batteries. An hour later, the technician figured out that there was a cable at the back of the tv that was damaged and needed to be replaced. Even though my stay was off to a very rocky start, the staff were extremely friendly and nice about all of my initial complaints. They responded right away and did what it took to correct the problems. When my friend arrived, she thought we had a fantastic room and she was quite pleased with it. The furniture was a bit dated, and scratched in a few places, but the room was kept very clean. The blankets were a bit rough, and I thought the bed was too soft, but my friend thought it was perfect, so that's just a matter of taste. The location was perfect - far enough away from the French Quarter to avoid the craziness and smell, but close enough to feel safe walking there. We didn't have a car, so parking wasn't an issue. The only meals I ate in the hotel were those served as part of the conference. The conference food left something to be desired. It also seemed like we saw the same staff working from early in the morning to late at night, probably due to staffing shortages as New Orleans rebuilds. Despite the long hours and somewhat demanding crowd, the staff were always friendly and accommodating. I don't think I would stay here at full price, but I recommend staying if you can get a good discount.

We weren't sure which of the properties had the best location, but chose this site because of the ratings seen on trip.advisor.com. You arrive on the ground floor and take the escalator up one level . Check in was easy and very fast. This could be because the city was only 15% occupied (as per reception staff). However when we checked out there were lines, but enough people behind the desk to swiftly accomidate everyone. ROOMS We had room 1204 and room 1253. NOTE - DO NOT STAY IN ROOM 1253 if noise bothers you. The first night we heard what I thought was a motor grinding noise. Not bad enough to keep us awake, but annoying all the same. The next morning I menioned it to the front desk before we went out to see the city. When we returned there was a message on my phone telling me that engineering was in the room and found the cause. It wasn't a motor we heard, it was the \"service elevator' between room 1253 and the next room . They did offer to move us, but we didn't feel like re-packing, so we just dealt with it. Our room had a king bed, a 'double bathroom (separate shower and commode area from the sink), desk and chairs. The other room had 2 doubles in it plus the desk and same bathroom. I', not sure if this was an upgraded room (we ask as platinum members) or all the rooms are like this. I also asked if we could have 'club privelages\" and received certificates from the small snack shop on the ground floor - basic coffee, bread products and drinks. It was adequate to get us started, and as the restaurant was not openned when we arrived (Dec 26) we were satisfied. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. They also took the trouble to memorize your face and name, and called you by name when you approached. Nice touch. ROOM SERVICE We ordered dessert the first night from room service. Very good and quick. The last morning the kids ordered breakfast from room service and also enjoyed it. LOCATION The hotel was about 4 blocks from riverwalk - straight down poydras street (and 1 1/2 blocks from Mothers - one of my favorite New Orleans eateries. IF YOU ARE GOING TO THE FRENCH QUARTER - you may not feel comfortable walking down St Charles street (which leads to the quarter and becomes Royal) as it is dimly lit. Walk one block down Poydras to Camp street - It is exceptionally well lit and will take to you Canal street (equally well lit) - you can then walk to Bourban street (2 blocks) and feel safe. SAFETY - This is always a concern in New Orleans. I have been 5 times and although I have never had a problem, I recognize this is an issue for some people. At the risk of offending some, I have to say that the forces of the Hurricaine that drove out many people has also driven out much of the criminal element. The city is safer than ever! But back to the hotel - if you don't mind walking a few blocks to the quarter or to the river this is an excellent choice.

I understand that Katrina was devastating to local business, but regardless, the restaurant selection in close proximity to the hotel is abysmal.

It seems like it was en vogue at one point, maybe about 1983. 3. Hotel food. This is my biggest gripe. Unreal. Highlight #1- ordered a mediocre turkey sandwich to my room- $20. Highlight #2- attempted to buy brunch sunday morning- was told that I would HAVE to buy the $42 champagne breakfast in order to eat at the hotel restaurant. They were literally not serving anything else. I passed on the 42 dollar breakfast. Highlight #3- attempted to eat dinner at the restaurant. I arrived at 5:15, 15 minutes after they open for dinner.

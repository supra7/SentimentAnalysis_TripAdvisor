We were close to everything hollywood has to offer. The hotel is older, but has come great character. The rooms are very outdated, and the beds are hard (although all 4 members of our group expresssed amazing sleeps!). We joked the carpets in the rooms needed to be shampooed, but honestly for a 2-star hotel I feel like we lucked out with the location. The front desk man when we checked out was a little odd. He seemed nice but there seemed to be a communication challenge. The second man we checked out with was adorable and hilarious. The parking and internet are both $5.00 each /night so that was VERY reasonable as other hotels in the area were double the price with internet of $10-15 and parking of $20-30. If you are expecing an amazing luxiarlly hotel don't go here, but if you are looking for something afforable and quaint, stay here. I personally don't like all the luxiary so I really enjoyed my stay! We will be back. Also the Swingers Coffee shop is unreal! Breakfast 2 days was AMAZING! Some good quality food! We had a misunderstanding with one server as 4 of us were paying so we under-tipped by a few bucks and she let it be known that we did that. It was an honest mistake but we heard her complaining before we even left the cafe.

The hotel itself has a kitsche feel to it, like old hollywood glamour. I felt like we were staying in an old style apartment rather than a hotel, and that gave it a homier feel. We have two teenage boys, ages 16 and 19, and the area was cool for them to hang out in. Close to the grove, the mall, theatres, etc. My 19 year old LOVED hanging out at Swingers, the coffee shop at the hotel. We enjoyed it as well, and their coffee was amazing! The hotel has a pool, but we didn't use it...too busy otherwise but it looked good. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Parking is onsite and convenient.

In all the years I've sent folks here, I've only heard rave reviews. For tourists, it's centrally located, so a trip to the Valley for Universal is reasonable - as is a trip to Santa Monica. You are a few blocks from Beverly Hills, a mile or so from the Sunset Strip and walking distance to some of the best restaurants in LA.

They charge $5,- a day now for parking but I think this is a good decision because last time we found it hard finding a space to park when coming back late at night. I guess there were just too many people parking at the hotel and not being an actual guest. In the parking there is an old abandoned car which I really like and definitely not should be removed because its part of the charm of the hotel. Both times there was a film crew shooting at the hotel which immediately gives you the Hollywood feel. Bruce and Roberto from the front desk were both very nice. We had package shipped to the hotel and they took care of it which was really nice. Price is a bit high for my budget but reasonable because the location is perfect. Walking distance to the Beverly center, Melrose for shopping, Wholefoods market and Petersen Automotive and Lacma museums. I asked for a top floor room at the back and we got room 310 which felt more like a small appartment than a hotel room. It had 2 windows, a kitchen, 2 queen beds, a table, two chairs, large closets and normal size bathroom in it. Beds were clean, comfortable and heating was working fine (there weren't extra blankets and it was cold at night so I had the turn the heater on, so putting extra blankets in the closets will save energy). Also the pattern of the bed covers was very nice. Our other room had purple which was a bit dark but these were yellow. And it was super quiet! We felt like moving in immediately and staying forever :) Tv channels were poor and they charge extra for wifi but this didn't bother us because you're only there to sleep. There were only 2 lights in the room this was a bit dark when you need to repack and reorganise your stuff before going on the plane.

TV was fine and swimming pool, although freezing was lovely. Lift to all floors including the (free!) underground car park. That made us feel safe and secure, knowing our rental was not left randomly on street. The attached Swingers restaurant was just great...

Melrose and Fairfax were a pleasant dander away, as was the Farmer's Market. Everything else was dead easy to drive to. The only issue - and it's a big one - is that they charged us twice. We used a U.K. debit and despite explaining that when they 'froze' the money in our account, it would come out, they seemed to not understand and went ahead with their duplicate debiting anyway, We had to then spend an hour on the phone to the bank back home and only got it sorted because my OH works for that particular bank and knew what to say.

Location is great. Adjacent to Melrose and Fairfax District and The Grove/Farmer's Market and in the middle of LA between downtown and Santa Monica each of which are only about 20 min away or less with no traffic. Great price, there are some cheaper motels nearby but most are more $$. Food: Swinger's diner is downstairs and is almost open 24 hours, Canter's is almost waling distance and is open 24 hours. Unlike my past experiences and despite several reviews here on Yelp, the Swinger's staff were actually very nice and helpful. Especially the two waitresses we had early Friday morning. Awesome health food market right across the street and huge Erewhon market three blocks away with full deli. My room was conveniently located close to the stairs and elevator to parking basement and had good sun and view of the pool. We were in room 104. The hotel looks nice and inviting, the room looks nice, but after living in it for a little while I realize that there are a few conveniences missing. And I,m not talking about extras like chocolates on the bed or free bottled water or ironing board and iron. I mean a HOT shower! How bout a coffee maker? How bout conditioner to go with the shampoo? Lotion would be nice. How bout a phone book, pen, clock!?! Big plus was that the room has a fridge and a microwave, bummer is that there was no dinnerware or mugs so the microwave went unused. Another big plus is the free hotel parking except that during prime dining hours @ Swingers the patrons use the hotel parking and apparently the hotel staff don,t enforce the Hotel Guests Only policy. Hotel staff and cleaning staff are nice. Guests seemed nice and were a mix of young crowd, thirty somethings on a budget, and a few families. I am sure that at least one of my neighbors was having a really good time because he let everyone know by screaming and singing and yelling at the top of his lungs for about 15 minutes at about 2:30 in the morning (not sure what time it was cause there is no clock in the room!) Rooms can be a little noisy when guests walk down the halls talking (or scream at the top of their lungs). The walls are thin. If it were hot outside, which it often is in LA, the pool seems like it would be really fun. But it was 69 degrees and the unheated pool was freezing. Bed is hard, so are the pillows. So hard that I tossed and turned every night I spent there. So, to recap: What you get: Good location, good price, free parking, pool, microwave, fridge What you don't get: good night's rest, hot shower", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING!!!\u201d", "Author": "projectBNE", "ReviewID": "UR49853263", "Content": "Absolutley loved it...

The reviews on this site are, for the most part, accurate. It does have a cool retro vibe - decor is adorable. Location is excellent, and there is free parking, which is important. The diner downstairs is FANTASTIC - we ate there several times and loved every meal, and the prices were quite reasonable. We were really prepared to love everything about this place. As long as everything in your room works, this hotel is great. So I assume that the majority of the reviews have been left by people whose rooms were functional, and probably the odds are in favor of that, so it may be worth the risk, particularly because LA hotels are so expensive. We would have been one of those reviews if we'd stayed in our first room, quite honestly. However, we had requested a king non-smoking and were given 2 doubles instead. We stayed there the first night, because we got in very late, and that room was nice, and everything worked. However, my husband is 6 foot 4, and the beds were WAY too small for him, and we couldn't share one (they were tiny), and since it was a romantic weekend away, we asked for a room change in the morning, and got one. No problem. This is when we discovered that if something in your room doesn't work, you're screwed. In the next room, the toilet was broken. We were told that maintenance couldn't come until THE NEXT DAY, so IF they could find one, we could have another room (like having a room with no toilet was a reasonable option!). In the room we were moved to, the shower was broken, and the answer was basically, \"Tough, wait until maintenance comes tomorrow\". The attitude of both people we spoke to about the shower (the night it broke and the next morning) was that we were being unreasonably fussy by expecting our plumbing to work correctly; one said \"I know about YOU people - you SAID your last room had problems too\" (as if we'd made it up) and the other said \"So in every room you have, the shower is broken?\" We calmly reminded him that no, the toilet was broken in the first room. However, we were pretty angry that no apologies were given and we were blamed for the problems; the usual response for a hotel in this case would be to apologize for having things in the room that weren't working, inconveniencing the guests. And they were pretty MAJOR things - it's not like the remote control was broken or something. Sadly, we had to agree that we wouldn't stay here again. Sure, we might get lucky and next time, our room might have no problems at all. Or we might have another broken toilet on a night that the entire hotel was booked - with this hotel's \"we don't call maintenance until morning if only one room is having problems, no matter what\" policy (this is what the front desk lady told us when we called about the shower), we could end up spending the night without a toilet, or having to pay for a room somewhere else just to get a room with a toilet that worked!

Very cool place to have breakfast, with good service, delish granola, lovely fruit salad. Location was very good - The Grove and the Farmer's Market are nearby which make for a fun evening.

We (me, wife, 8-year-old daughter) stayed at the BL the nights of August 8-9. First things first - don't let the name fool you; this hotel is not in Beverly Hills. It is on Beverly Blvd but that doesn't make it Beverly Hills. The surrounding neighborhood isn't bad (although most of the houses have bars on the windows) but it sure isn't Beverly Hills. We checked in around 3:30 Friday afternoon. The manager (owner?) is very friendly. We had reserved a non-smoking refurbished room. We asked for something quiet (not facing the street) but he told us this wasn't available in a refurbished room. He could tell that I was disappointed with this news so he upgraded us at no charge to one of the refurbished studios that face the alley in back. The cost of the room was $119/night plus LA hotel tax plus $2/day energy surcharge; parking is included, which is very rare in LA. My wife gasped when she heard our room number as this room has been the subject of a bad previous TA review. We never had any trouble parking and only had to go into the underground garage once. All of the parking is covered - others have mentioned that it is a tight squeeze but much of the tightness is due to people not properly parking within their space. There is no security for the parking garage - even the underground area does not have a gate or any noticeable security cameras. You are reasonably close to everything - The Grove is less than a mile away as is Fred Segal (on Melrose). The hotel looks old - it is old. The hotel does not have a web site but there are pictures of it floating around on the web. The pictures of the refurbished rooms are flattering - the reality is much less flattering. Our room had been refurbished but that word means different things to different people. The room is old and it looks old. There is no dresser so you will have no drawers in which to put your clothes. The flat panel was nice but it was not HDTV and the remote didn't work (we didn't bother contacting management about this). The kitchen area is small and looks really old. The fridge is a step up from a dorm size fridge but still very small. There is all kinds of light coming into the room, especially around the door. The a/c is a wall unit that blows cold but is very loud. The bed was not very comfortable and the pillows are the worst I have ever had at a hotel (not much bigger than what you get on an airplane). The bathroom is reasonable in size and had been refurbished but still looked old. The towels will bring back memories of gym class and the toiletries ... well ... let's just say that you should bring your own. All you get is a bottle of really bad combo shampoo & conditioner and the cheapest little bar of soap that I've ever seen in a hotel. The water pressure is good and there is plenty of hot water. With the exception of the a/c unit the room was quiet at night although I can imagine that if you face the street and are close to Swingers that it will be noisy. From what I can tell room 303 is furthest away from any of the noise so that might be the one to request. We tried the pool but didn't last long in it as it isn't heated. Even as I child I didn't like cold pools - I'm certainly not going to change that opinion as an adult. The pool water appeared to be very clean. Swingers is OK - the price isn't bad nor is the food. We ate one dinner and one breakfast there - I don't feel a need to ever go back because there are just far too many great places to eat in LA. I got what I paid for in LA. If you are expecting this to be some hidden pocket of luxury in Beverly Hills for Motel 6 prices you will be sorely disappointed.

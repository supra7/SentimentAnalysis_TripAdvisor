I was incredibly impressed with reception--even though my room was not ready, they were able to accelerate the process so I could check in. The rooms are huge and spacious with nice finishes, a large closet and a mini fridge. I really enjoyed the pool floor (5th?) outside the spa. Nice deck loungers to relax in and staff around to help rearrange chairs or move cushions. The main restaurant, Indigo, was pricey and not great...perhaps better as a bar. I didn't appreciate a $20 club sandwich. The conference facilities were impeccable. Ballrooms were kept clean and stocked with water (very important for a sports conference). If you are coming to Miami on business, or just planning to stay in the hotel for a conference like I did, this is a great hotel. However, if you're planning on doing some sightseeing or hoping to lay on a beach, this is not the best choice. It's on the bay, so no sand, just concrete walkways, and it's in the financial district, so to get to any quality restaurants a car is required. There is very little within walking distance of the hotel. There is a nice grassy park next door full of palm trees, but otherwise the neighborhood is rather dull.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Lansing, Michigan, United States", "Title": "\u201cperfect hotel\u201d", "Author": "Joe G", "ReviewID": "UR126518821", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at the InterContinental for Ultra Music Festival and all I can say is that I was thoroughly impressed.

The hotel is very nice and clean and has an attractive, fairly large, modern lobby area with lots of marble and a fountain. First, I will run through the goods. Rooms were nice and well appointed and the bed very comfortable. We had a corner room which is a bit larger and we had a beautiful view of the bay. The hotel is located in a great spot and is walking distance from Bayside Marketplace and across the street from the free PeopleMover public transit system. The pool is average size and faces the bay and has a nice tropical style pool bar and a covered sitting area for casual food. The hotel is minutes away from the cruise ship port and South Beach is right across the nearby bridge (about 10-15 minutes with light traffic and 30+ minutes on weekends and when busy). Coconut Grove shopping/dining area is also fairly close at about 15 minutes by car. If you upgrade to a Club access room you get access to the Club Lounge (hours are 0700-2000) with free water/soft drinks/snacks along with a free happy hour and breakfast offered. Just a couple of negatives. The valet staff were courteous and efficient but overnight parking runs about $35 and there is really no other choice. Entrance drive is fairly small and traffic is kinda crazy. Front desk staff is also friendly and helpful but front desk area is rather small and awkwardly located which means lines almost always for the desk and folks have to walk through the waiting guests to get to the elevators. There is a mini bar with a variety of items at an expected high cost but beware not to move the items as they are on motion sensors. There is an exercise facility which costs $15/day per person. Internet access also comes with a fee of about $12/day. For a fairly pricey hotel, it seems a little tacky to nickel and dime you for every little thing and detracted from an otherwise pleasant experience. One other item to keep in mind is that the restaurants and bar at the hotel add an 18% tip in all the time. This is also pretty standard at the restaurants at Bayside and South Beach so check your bill or ask before tipping. Overall, we did like the hotel and the location very much.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Russia", "Title": "\u201cThe worst IC!!!\u201d", "Author": "alexzhdanov", "ReviewID": "UR126321025", "Content": "There is my official complain to the property Didn't have any answer. Good afternoon! My name is Platinum Ambassador Member since 2006 Well, I would like to infrom you that we've stayed 1 night in IC Miami downtown and it was the worst IC experience for last 5 years. Some facts: 1) we'd arrived about 11pm, bellman was by the door, but nobody helped us with heavy huge luggage (!). Wherefore, bellman was smiling all the time while we had to pull our bags up the stairs. 2) the room was very smelly like salt fish for beer. Disgusting. 3) during check-in, smooth and very welcome, receptonist said about opening hours of restaurants and bar. BUT! When we came for couple of drinks to the bar (works till 1.00) at 0.24 (!) the lady saind: Bar is closed. Why??? Closed. Ok. At the reception the lady said I dont know, why they close. Thats all about!!! 4) I took a beer from the minibar. It was warm. Yes, guys, warm beer(!!!) in IC!!! 5) We used the Business center option \"Printing\". So, we had to pay for internet and 6 pages 11.00$ But my Visa has been charged for 20.00$ ,nobody answered me. 6) Room service food. Hotdog - real shame, 1 bread, 1 dry sausage and nothing more (see the menu!) with disgusting thin oil-smelly french fries. Excuse me, but for 14-hour (!!!!) stay little bit much bad things, right?

They claimed not to allow early check ins, but a friend had checked in early just minutes earlier. Of course they have early check ins....for a price. This then started the upsell that continued throughout our stay. They asked if we wanted to upgrade to a bay view for $20. I asked if that would get us into a room now. Of course it would! So, we took it. We figured we had already saved about $60 by booking through another site and we were super tired from traveling. We were also offered an upsell on some other frequent traveler thing, which we declined. We got to the room, which was quite nice at first glance and was well-appointed with furnishings, a mini bar (which we did not partake in), toiletries, etc. Nice big bathroom. Great view and worth the money. We rented a car right from the lobby to go to an event in Boca Raton. That was super convenient, but the hours are very limited.

The room was very clean and beds quite comfortable.There is a small store in the lobby. Looked to have some specialty items and was a little pricey. We walked to Bayside for drinks and hung out for a while. As we went back to the hotel, someone was having a white party. A boat was docked next to the hotel where many were parking before boarding. Lots of lobby foot traffic. My sister thought the breakfast to be the best she's had a hotel. We purchased the buffet because it was the easiest thing to do as one in our party is not very mobile. While I cannot recall the exact cost, it was quite pricey. The front desk staff, bellman and concierge...were all SUPER EXCELLENT!!!

Needless to say we didn't do that, we were already unpacked, in bed and extremely upset about the situation. No apologies were given the following morning during checkout. Later during the year I booked again, mainly becuase it's close to restaurants I like in the downtown area, but it was as dissapointing as the last time. The room was dirty, unkept bathroom, and what's more it was missing pictures hanging from the wall only the nail was there hahah!! The mini bar was empty as well.

As the Club was closed we received complimentary upgrades to the breakfast buffet at the Indigo Restaurant and vouchers for drinks and an appetizer at the bar - quite an upgrade from the comp continental breakfast on the club floor! The food at both places was fresh and delicious. When we got to our rooms a gift of a wine and cheese plate awaited us from the concierge Eduardo, who (along with Stephanie from the Executive Office) was so gracious in arranging all the details of our visit. We had massages at the spa, which were among the best I have ever had at a spa. Also, the spa was very quiet and really beautiful with the stone floors and mosaic walls - the relaxation room is cozy and really relaxing with its little waterfalls and low lighting - and there is a steam room, sauna and drench shower as well.

The lobby was huge and decked out for the holidays. The room was surprisingly large , clean, and well laid out. The view was very nice of downtown Miami and the bay. This was our first time in Miami so we were unfamiliar with the area. We were very surprised to find that there was a beautiful park right next to the hotel and just beyond that the Bayside mall area. The Bayside mall is worth a trip to Miami by itself. My wife was in shopping overload over there. Everything from Victoria's Secret to Haagen Daz was represented there. Over a dozen waterside resturants provided food for almost every taste. When the sun went down Hard Rock Cafe, Bongo's, Hooters and other night spots kept your attention. There was also a waterside bandshell that had live music throughout the night. Back at the hotel there was entertainment available as well as resturants but to be honest the lure of bayside and other nearby resuturants and entertainments was stronger than the desire to stay in house. The location of the hotel could not have been better. We were in the very heart of downtown, within walking distance of hundreds of points of intrest. The causeway was less than a mile away to hop over to Miami Beach. The only thing that stopped the experience from being perfect was the $36 per day parking charge. I still prefer to decide what my cost are and tell me upfront and stop with the add ons. Pet peeve of mine.

The port is a short taxi drive from this hotel. There are plenty of taxi's available to take you to the port when you are ready to head that way. No need to worry about setting up transportation. The Intercontinental is a large hotel set right on the bay. The Bayside market is with-in walking distance from the hotel. We felt really safe walking around the area. Lot's to see and do. There is also a Walgreen's with-in a few block's of the hotel also for those last minute pre-cruise purchases. Check-in was really pretty fast considering how busy the hotel was. We were upgraded to a newly renovated room on an upper floor/bayside since we are Priority Club member's. Priority club is one of the few reward's program's that consistently offer's us upgrades. The room itself was really nice with a huge picture window with a direct view of the cruise ship port. We had a king size bed with lot's of pillow's that was really comfortable. Also had a nice size flat screen tv. The bathroom itself was really nice with a separate tub and shower, hair dryer and some nice amenities. The only problem's we had with the room were we couldn't get the safe to work and they don't give you much coffee for the coffee maker. The coffee maker is one of those new Keurig single cup coffee maker's. We requested extra coffee from housekeeping, but they seemed really reluctant to give us any extra. Not sure what the problem was with that. The mini-bar was fully stocked with beer, wine, snack's,etc. and of course the ridiculously high mini-bar prices. We decided to just eat in the bar area for dinner since we were wanting to watch a football game and just relax. They have a nice menu selection with appetizer's, pizza, sandwiches,etc. My cuban sandwich was huge and came with a nice size salad also. The drink's were also really good. The place was packed so service was kind of hit and miss. The prices were to be expected from a hotel bar. We got a 15% discount in the bar since we are Priority Club member's. Didn't try the Indigo Restaurant. It is located right next to the bar. Heard they served good food though. Check-out was a breeze. Just looked over our final bill and got our statement.You can charge most thing's to your room, including the restaurant/bar tab. The hotel does put an initial hold on your credit card for I think $75. It seem's most hotel's do this anymore for incidental's. Over-all this is a really nice upscale hotel in a great location.

I had booked two rooms for one night and the rooms and views were lovely. Unfortunately, the only excellent service we received at this hotel was from Paola in the bar. The poor service started at check-in. Upon arrival the first thing the receptionist told us was that there would be a $100 charge to check-in. This was before even asking us our booking information. As we were on the club level (which we were informed was under construction at check-in, not at booking) and members of their frequent stay program, there should have been no mention of a fee for early check-in. This is not the warm welcome you expect at a deluxe hotel. One of our rooms was charged at the wrong rate. After pointing out the discrepancy, we received a blank look from the receptionist. We actually had to explain that we expected the discrepancy to be corrected. The beds, bedding, and pillows were clean and very comfortable. The bathrooms were in good working order, large, and generally clean. Luckily, I hadn't planned to use the tub. I say luckily because it wasn't particularly clean. Also, they kindly stock shampoo, conditioner, soaps, cotton balls, etc.; however, the decorative case that holds the cotton balls, q-tips, and nail file was not recently inspected by housekeeping. There was a half empty packet in the case. The fruit bowl consisted of a banana, an apple, and an orange and was a welcome snack. As the club floor was under construction, we were given coupons for appetizers and drinks in the bar. The appetizers were larger than expected and all delicious. The drinks, especially their own specialty cocktails were also quite good. Our server, Paola, was warm, attentive, and quick. Breakfast in the restaurant: The breakfast buffet included a very nice selection of fruits, meats and cheese; omelet station; breads; etc. The servers are supposed to provide beverages and clear the dishes. We had to repeatedly request drinks and drink refills. The server didn't seem to notice that we didn't have water or were out of tea or coffee, etc. Check-out was efficient and quick. Valet: The first night getting the car was no problem and we received our car in good order. At check-out, we received the car filled with the heavy smell of smoke which persisted for the majority of our 40 minute drive even with the windows open. We ultimately discovered a cigarette butt on the floor! It took over a day and some Febreze to get rid of the smell. I tried contacting the hotel manager, Robert Hill, but was directed to Elizabeth Perez's voice-mail until finally reaching the duty manager, Pedro. He apologized for the valet service. Instead of immediately offering to reimburse me for the poor valet service, he assured me he would talk to the valet service first and then get back to me - as if I would bother to contact him about this event a day after the fact if it hadn't actually happened and upset my family.

The food and beverage options for a 5 star hotel were absolutely awful. Where do I start. The bar menu and restuarant menu were in fact pretty much identical and were pizza, average pasta dish, paninis etc. We arrived late on Friday to be told by a member of staff (I shall come to her by name personally later) that the restaurant only had one server so we had to go to the bar. OK but this was supposed to be an event with over 2000 participants so you would think then would put on more staff. NExt morning - looking forward to breakfast - err no. Priscilla - the lady who really needs an atittude adjustment for working in a 5 star hotel - said that the restaurant was too busy and could we sit in the dark and unlit bar area. I said I wanted to walk around and see which I did. The restuarant was EMPTY!. I asked the very helpful server Juan whether it would inconvenience him if we sat in his area. He could not have been more helpful and welcoming. I went and told Priscilla that this was what we were going to do and she just looked at us blankly. Saturday night we ate out as we couldnt face Priscilla again and her attitude that we were an inconvenience in her pressing day! Sunday after the race I just wanted to eat and sleep. There was a buffet with pretty limited selection or the bar menu. Service was slow although the server was just maxed out and then the kitchen sent my burger and my boyfriend's pizza 15 minutes apart. This is a five star hotel with premium prices. Room nice, front desk staff friendly and excellent, room service staff good, greeter in restaurant terrible, food terrible.

This review focuses mainly on the spa/fitness center facilities, from the perspective of a regular member. About a year ago, I joined the MySpa Fitness Center, and have been so pleased with my membership there. It's a great place to stop in for a workout or to relax in the steam room, sauna, or poolside. One of the unique and fantastic aspects of the gym is that they provide your work-out gear: shirt, shorts, socks, shoes, and sports bra for ladies. This is a HUGE convenience both for regulars, and for travelers who don't have to pack bulky sneakers and work out clothes. Recently, the Fitness Center sponsored a fun contest to award the person who visited the gym the most times before Thanksgiving. That extra motivation to get to the gym helped me break through a fitness plateau and lose 5lbs! Great motivation! Catherine and all of the staff are friendly, professional, and a pleasure to see every day. The gym's cardio machines have televisions, and they face the windows looking out on downtown Miami and Bayfront Park. The windows provide nice natural light for workouts. Location: the hotel is located on Biscayne Bay in downtown Miami, bordering Bayfront Park. For business clients or people who are in town for litigation matters, I always recommend this hotel. I would also recommend it for people who are planning to cruise out of the Port of Miami, or attend events at the American Airlines Arena. The causeway that takes you to South Beach is also nearby. Gym and spa, overall: For my colleagues and friends downtown, I would not hesitate to recommend the fitness center. The ambiance of the spa facility is very relaxing. The fitness center, while not huge, has a good variety of free weights, weight machines, and cardio machines. The gym provides plenty of fresh towels, plus the work-out clothes, and the use of a locker while you work out or get a massage. Price: The price of the membership is fair; the spa services also seem to be priced about the same as other hotel spas, but MySpa often runs promotions that make them an especially good deal. They also have packages which include monthly massages and other services. While I have not opted that that, the prices for those memberships are also fair. The showers are stocked with soap, shampoo, conditioner, and shaving cream. I don't like the smell of the shaving cream, but that's about my only complaint. The other aspects of the hotel that I can review are the restaurant in the lobby, and the cafe by the pool. At the restaurant in the lobby, I have had the buffet lunch, which is not cheap, has a good variety, whether you want to eat light or have a feast. The food at the cafe by the pool is just OK (I had pizza), but it is enhanced by the amazing view of the bay and port. I would recommend it, just for that reason. Get a window seat.

All four of us are very easy going people who are easy to please. We booked the hotel through Priceline, Name Your Own Price. When I looked into the hotel's website I was happy to see that the Hotel was located in the Bayside area (perfect for shopping and restaurants and next to a large park) and that they had a pool and gym. The website said that check-in was at 4:00. My first impression of the hotel was that it was quite beautiful, the lobby was expansive and contained very pretty art and furniture. After a very long flight and multiple bus rides to get to the hotel, I was definitely ready to unpack and unwind. Upon check-in (we arrived around 4:30, 30 minutes after the rooms were supposed to be available) we were told that there were no available clean rooms, and that we would need to check back in an hour and a half. Well I wasn't very happy about that, but knew there wasn't much we could do about it. They let us leave our luggage with the concierge, and we went to explore the area and wait for our room. We were told that we would receive a call when it was ready. We never did receive a call, but showed back up at the hotel around 5:45 and the rooms were ready. We never did receive any apologies for the inconvenience. When we entered our room, 2015 (on the 20th floor) I was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful partial view of the ocean and rooftop pool (5th floor) surrounded by lounge chairs and a walking path. There was a very nice flat screen television on the dresser, as well as a very comfortable couch and small table. There were a couple things that we were very impressed by. The dark blinds on the windows were electric and could be raised and lowered by a button on the nightstand. Quite convenient if you want to sleep in! The bed was also very comfortable, and the pillows fantastic! We were so impressed by the pillows that we looked at the brand, Pacific Coast. My husband and I have decided to buy a couple, the website was on the pillows as well, pacificcoast.com, and they were down pillows. I haven't slept that well in a very long time! We were also happy with the bathroom, it was large and very pretty and clean. Loved the double shower heads, but wasn't very happy with the water pressure, it was far too weak. The room was kept very clean as far as I could tell. Every day we would go out and shop and eat, and when we came back the bed was made, trash emptied and fresh towels put out. I only have a couple complaints about the hotel in general. My husband and I were disappointed to go down to the 5th floor to work out, and find that there was a $15 per day per person charge if you wanted to use the gym. That was very surprising! We later found that there is also a charge to use the wireless internet. After returning home I did find out that it is listed on the website that there is a charge, but it seems absolutely pointless to me. The fact that I'm paying for the room should pay for the gym and internet, it seemed that the hotel was nickle and diming for everything they were worth. The only other thing that we weren't happy with was that the lobby of the hotel was used for some type of red carper formal event every night we were there.

This was the first time I had stayed with this hotel chain and it most certainly will be my last. The first night I stayed at the hotel was uneventful as I had to work and immediately came in that evening and went to sleep. The second night was a different story. While using the rest room I noticed a roach of some sort that was at least 1 inch long and about a half inch wide. I was disgusted to say the least as I do not have roaches in my own home nor do I care to bring any into my home after staying at a filthy hotel. My husband killed the bug and I sent on about my business. The next day, there was another roach on the bathroom towel in front of the shower. Again my husband killed the bug. We proceeded to go with our day as planned and upon our return, things went completely downhill. Whoever had been assigned to clean our room did a poor job. A used washcloth was left on the chair in front on the desk; the facial tissue box was left on the dresser, empty (the tissue box had originally been in the bathroom where it belonged). When I went into the bathroom, I was again greeted by what I thought was a third roach, only to find out that it was the roach that had been killed earlier that day. It appears the house keeper shook the bath mat out refolded it and placed it back on the tub, leaving the dead roach in the MIDDLE of the bathroom floor. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the house keeper had refolded the original bath mat that had been there earlier and replaced it on the tub despite that fact that it contained remnants of the dead roach that was left lying on the floor. Needless to say I was completely disgusted! I informed my husband who then told me there was another roach that he had killed on the day of our arrival that he not told me about for fear I would freak out. That is now a total of 2 huge roaches. I immediately went to the front desk to inform the clerk who snickered and asked me what I wanted her to do. I was taken aback, first off snickering if not an appropriate response and she should have been the one making suggestions, not I. I asked for the manager and was informed she was busy, I told her I would wait and she eventually went and got her. I spoke with the manager who was apologetic and offered to switch my room. I accepted and went to move my belongings. Once we arrived at our new room, on the same floor as the original room, I decided to inspect the room first. Boy was I blown away but this filthy hotel, I had no idea it could get worse. The new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room I had just checked into had trash in the trash can (I thought emptying the trash was standard) and in the bathroom I was greeted with a tub that was so filthy there was a very visible dirt ring around the tub. How gross! I had my husband check to see if it were a stain or actual dirt and as it was rubbed the dirt came right off. I was done! How can the house keeper not notice a visible ring around the tub? When was the last time the tub was even cleaned? I was appalled! I went back to the front desk to speak the manager again, she cringed when she saw me coming and said she hoped everything was okay with the room. I informed her of the condition and she offered to have the room cleaned immediately and she offered me and my husband a drink coupon at the hotel bar. I can only guess that she was hoping when I returned to my room I would be too drunk to notice any of the dirt. Had this not been my last night at the hotel, I would have checked out immediately! I will never return to this filthy hotel.

The conference facilities were quite nice (although the A/C was up much too high the first morning, but was soon fixed) and we had our lunch breaks at the Indigo restaurant in the lobby area. I did have a lovely view from my room of the bay which was the highlight of the room. The room itself was comfortable but looked worn. There were a view stains on the one upholstered chair in the room and on the coverlet of the bed. The walls were a bit beaten up and the mold in the bathtub was not what I would expect at a hotel of this caliber. I also had a bit of a drainage issue with my shower the first morning which I reported to the front desk staff. It seemed to be fixed by that evening, but the problem returned the next day. The walls and ceilings seemed incredibly thin and I could hear the room above me even though the people seemed to be speaking at a normal volume. Housekeeping seemed lacisdasical at best. The little coffee pot in the room was never cleaned (hey I'm more than happy to clean up after myself, but come on), the tissue cover was placed on the bathroom counter, without any tissue to cover, the room overall just didn't feel very clean. In keeping with a \"luxury\" hotel the prices were outrageous for internet access and the room service prices (I had a very early flight and decided to stay in the last night) were utterly ridiculous. Overall the hotel is very nice in its common areas and its location is ideal. The staff I dealt with were very nice for the most part so thankfully I didn't have some of the issues that other reviewers noted in regard to the staff, although I did not get the impression that the staff was very interested in going the extra mile.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cTerrible service for a deluxe level hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Gustavo S", "ReviewID": "UR120511941", "Content": "From the recepcionist at the check in through the waiter at the restaurant, me and my family (wife and 2 little children - 4 and 1 years old) were extremely terribly attended.

The hotel charges $15 a day to use the fitness center--in Miami, where it can get too hot to exercise outdoors!

The hotel is in a great location right on the bay and as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a triangular shaped building, you have either city views or bay views. When booking my room I specified I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like a bay view room which I received on the 7th floor. The views across the bay were spectacular and during my stay I managed to view a Manatee swimming past as well as dolphins jumping in the bay. Most impressive! As my stay was leading up to Christmas, the hotel was tastefully decorated and there were even displays of gingerbread houses. The lobby and reception area are very inviting and a great place to hang out while waiting for friends. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a Henry Moore sculpture in the lobby too. The hotel has a breakfast buffet which costs $22, which I found it was quite good value for money as there were plenty of options and enough to fill you until dinner time! The restaurant was also quite good. The rooms are well proportioned and nicely maintained. All the usual little luxury items in place as one would expect from this hotel. The bathroom was large and plenty of towels were at hand. Beds and sheets were all comfortable. As I already mentioned, the views are great, and you can even sit on the windowsill and read if you so wish. My only complaint is paying for wifi for the rooms (there is a Starbucks with free wifi in the lobby). I paid for the wifi package but it only covers one device, the one which you log onto first. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re buying the wifi add on, make sure you log on with the device you wish to predominantly use.

I cannot say whether our long wait was due to temporary malfunction or an inadequate number of elevators for a tall building, or both. There are too many other alternatives for me to take the chance again. My son and I walked down 13 flights of stairs with luggage, due to the long wait and crowds waiting for a working elevator. Third reason is that the pool, although generously heated, sits in the shadow of other high-rises most of the day. Fourth issue, no free work-out area. Lastly, there were no board games available for families to check out like there are at other hotels such as the Marriott in Doral.

My room was spacious for an urban hotel and the black out shades made it a great place to sleep. The physical space of the hotel is very upscale.

On the first night I was there, the shower had almost no water pressure, then on the second day, there was no hot water. When I called the front desk, they offered no help and no explanation, other than it was a bigger problem impacting most of the hotel. Strangely, my sink only had scalding hot water. Furthermore, I nearly missed my flight after a 20-30 minute disaster in the valet line, when for some unexplicable reason, the valet manager decided to block the entire road to let a few people unload entire carloads of bicycles, essentially holding up about 20 cars trying to leave.

Everything was brand new: Flat screen TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S, new carpet, electrical blackout and sheers, the bathroom was well remodeled and well done with the new shower heads, they have two shower heads, the cabinets and the closet was big enough to host enough luggages even if you are there for a longer stay. The new d\u00c3\u00a9cor is great despite of the previous one was very nice as well. Everything is brand new and top quality. The location of the suite was great. The staff is well groomed and cares about their guests and would say hello every time you pass by one of them and eager to assist you and ask if there is anything you need. Their concierge team is one of the best, always helpful and knowledgeable and familiar with the area and what needs to be done and will advise you and your family what could be done and what you will enjoy the most. Just ask and they will let you know and will direct you on how to get there and possibly will advise you what needs to be done. If it is food, they will suggest the restaurant depending on the type of food you are looking for, night life, directions, where to go, what to do\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. so they are your encyclopedia when it comes to visiting Miami and area. Ask for Rosello and he will make it happen for you. The restaurant Indigo is also quite noteworthy. The buffet has a variety of great foods. The breakfast has a variety of food and the people there serving are very knowledgeable and want to help you even if they are not responsible of that section. We had breakfast both days we were there and they remembered us and one some even called us by name, that is service. The omelet cook was super great and not only just ask for the type of omelet you do wish to have by will engage with you in conversation so by the time your omelet is done, you still wish to keep talking to her, and if you are one of those that want to rush, they will even bring it to your table. They had a wide variety of fruits, yogurts, smoked Salmon, cheeses, pastries, cold and hot cereals and abundant of items on their hot buffet area good for vegetarians and non vegetarians and of course feel free to ask for assistance and if it is not there, they would make it for you. The lunch buffet is available on weekdays and it is one of the best lunches in Downtown Miami, everyday is different and certainly will enjoy it either on a business lunch or with your family and friends. The location, they are close to the Arena if you are ever there for a game or event held in there, walking distance to the small market, dining, entertainment 7 days a week.

I told the receptionist that we had a Travel Zoo coupon and we needed 3 appointments at the same time. She booked us all for 1pm on Sunday, Sept 18th. On the Thursday before, I received a call telling me that \"One girl's spa appointment was moved to 1:45\". I called back to ask why she was re-scheduled. They said the made a mistake. Fine, we'll deal with not going at the same time. Then on Friday, I received a call from the spa telling me that all of our appointments were wrong. We were all scheduled for 30 min vs. 45 minutes. For that mistake, we would all have to be re-scheduled and there was no more availability that weekend. I said that's ridiculous... just because our appointments were input incorrectly, we will not sacrifice losing our vouchers. So, she said we could come at 5, 5 and 6pm on Sunday. I told her I would have to call my friends and get back to her. I did just that. 15 minutes later, I called back and asked her to book the 3 of us at 5, 5, and 6pm. Sunday, I showed up at 445 for my 5pm and the front desk told me that she did not have me down for an appointment. But if I could wait 15 minutes, they could get me in at 5:15. I told her I was confused because we had originally been booked at 1, then rescheduled to 5 5 and 6... She said that was impossible because they close at 6pm on Sundays... Now I was just livid. I had to wait 45 minutes for my appointment that afternoon... The treatment was just average. The woman talked the entire time about how fantastic she is at facials and that I desperately need it and I should come back to get all my facials done by her. Once my treatment was over, the girl at the front desk advises me that I was still booked at 1pm and she had to \"refund\" the cancellation fee she had already charged me.. Then I was forced to pay a gratuity on the service ($30 on a $59 voucher is ridiculous!!)...

This was not my first time at this hotel and had some problems with them in the past before they embarked on this renovation, but at that time I was told all issues (mold, musty, and very dated) would be resolved with the pending renovation, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stayed there again. Our stay started in one of their newly \"renovated\" rooms. While they claim they are completely renovating the rooms the bulk of the renovation is just lipstick. New carpet and furniture for the most part. Since we knew about the renovation we knew to ask for a room on a floor with no construction. The Front desk informed us that there was no construction on our floor and in fact all the rooms above us had already completed their renovation. Much to our chagrin this was a bold face lie, and we in fact had construction two floors above us, and it sounded like the construction was going on in the room next to us that is how loud it was. After talking to several people at the hotel, and once being told by a manager that I did not know what I was talking about in regards to their un-renovated rooms, we were presented with two options 1: move to an un-rennovated room or a larger room on a higher floor with the same amount of construction. Knowing how putrid the un-renovated rooms were, we decided for the later and took a larger room. We were placed in room 3221 that had one living area and one bedroom, while the size was overly adequate the finish and \"renovation\" leaves a lot to be desired. There were large gaps in the stonework in the bathroom that had a lovely growth of some sort and on several occasions bugs would come out or go into these gaps. With this being Labor Day weekend we figured that there would be no construction on Sunday and Monday morning, so we decided against switching hotels and just riding out a shoddy room. Well this was not the case, 9am on Sunday morning the drilling, cutting and pounding started, and the same went for Monday morning. The noise is truly unbearable, and one should be very cognizant of what is happening. Now onto the service...While the valet staff is one of the best I have ever experienced in Miami, the same does not ring true for the rest of the facility. The front desk lied to our faces saying all the construction was below our room, and then when called out about it denied everything. The manager who I briefly spoke with and wished I had written down his name was condescending and inept. When I was questioned as to why I do not want an un-rennovated room he found it hard to believe that I had been there before and he told me I did not know what I was talking about. It seems that the renovated rooms are actually not complete, since when looking for the mini bar we just found a note saying they have not received them yet, so you need to order up what you want. So besides being up charged for the mini bar items you need to order them, so if the midnight snack, night cap or spur of the moment drink is something you desire, forget about it you need to wait up to 45 minutes to get anything. This is not a big deal, but this is also not what can be accepted in a 4 star hotel. After the headache of dealing with this, we needed a drink and went out to get some ingredients on our own. When we got back to the room we went to get some ice, and noticed that the ice maker on our floor was broken. When I called room service to get a bucket of ice sent to the room, we were told it would be 45 minute wait and there would be a service charge as well. When I questioned this due to the fact that the ice machine was broken, I was served a nice plate of attitude and told the room service department has nothing to do with the ice makers on the floors so it was not their problem and I should call engineering. So we decided to try every floor until we found an ice maker that worked and it took 4 tries on 4 different floors. This level or service does not represent what Intercontinental Hotels are all about and IHG should take a serious look at keeping their flag on this hotel. So before you think you are getting a deal booking here, just remember no matter what you always get what you pay for. This is a 3 star hotel at best based on the facilities but 2 star hotel in regards to service. I have received better service at roadside motels. Everyone on the staff except for the Valet staff and their managers should be ashamed of the product they put on the market. There are a lot of options in downtown Miami and the Brickell area, and I will never stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Locatioin\u201d", "Author": "Lump Inc", "ReviewID": "UR117849167", "Content": "Stayed one night before our trip back home and enjoyed our stay.

I definitely did not have a good experience at this location and do not recommend staying at this hotel. The hotel is certainly in need of a remodel (which wasn't a huge deal to me), the rooms are pretty clean, the bathrooms on the other hand are not as clean as I you'd expect (e.g. the glass doors to the shower were dirty with soap scum) I've always found Intercontinental staff to be very helpful and very customer oriented. Not one employee I came across was particularly helpful. I had a late departure flight on my last day and confirmed a late check out ahead of time. I am an ambassador member and one of the perks for being a member is guaranteed early check in and late check out. I had forgotten whether my confirmed late check out was 4 or 5 so I called guest services to check. I was told that they were not allowing any late check out because they were completely booked- I explained to the woman on the phone that I was an ambassador member and it should always guarantee a late check out, plus I had already confirmed when I arrived at check in. She basically denied the late check out and referred me to the manager on duty. I was only able to leave a voice message- manager never called me back.

I'm glad that it hadn't! Yes, it's showing its age a bit. There were stains on the chairs in the room. And the room service menu was dirty. But the hotel felt sort of elegant nonetheless, like a NY hotel. It's located downtown on the waterfront, right next to the Bayside Marketplace. So you aren't limited to room service or fast food restaurants. The room was nice and spacious, the beds felt great, and the staff was friendly. Here are the glitches that occurred: 1. The room a/c didn't work and they had to send a bldg engineer to fix it. Had to call twice (as perhaps they forgot to send someone after the first call) and someone came right away after the second call. Fixed it in a matter of seconds. 2. The key cards stopped working even though we hadn't done anything to demagnetize them. We went down to get replacement keys, only to go back up and find that they didn't work either. The bldg engineer had to come let us into our room and do something to the key card reader on the door to get the key cards to work. 3. At checkout, there was no bill left under our door so we needed to visit the front desk. Unfortunately several guests who had arrived on an international flight were checking in and we had to wait for nearly 30 minutes to get checked out. There was no separate checkout line and no triage to get us out of there. Next time, we'll just have them fax it to us or something. Also, there was another guest waiting because HIS key card had stopped working. So, even after all of that, we still liked the hotel. Probably would have liked it even better if they offered a complimentary cup of coffee or something for the minor troubles. Got the room at a discounted rate, though.

Initially I made the reservation just for the dates of the convention. When the time got closer, I decided to stay a couple extra days. The online system wouldn't allow me to change my reservation. I called, but no one could seem to help me. I kept getting transferred to different departments or dumped into voice mail. I finally got a person who explained that my reservation could not be altered because it was associated with the convention. I wouldn't think it would be that difficult to alter an existing reservation, but she offered to make a 2nd reservation for me for the extra couple days. She promised that there wouldn't be any noticeable difference on my end. I got to the hotel and showed both reservation confirmations. I was again assured that there would be no problem associated with my having two different reservations. On the last day of the convention, after a long day of classes, I returned to my room to find that I had been locked out! I went down to the lobby and was informed that I had been locked out because I hadn't yet checked in for my 2nd reservation. When I asked why they hadn't checked me in for my 2nd reservation when I checked in for my 1st reservation, I was informed that I had to pay for my 1st reservation before checking in for my 2nd reservation. Not only was I inconveniently locked out of my room, but they never even bothered to tell me that I would be required to pay for my 1st reservation part way through my stay. Instead they just locked me out of my room. They had my credit card on file and quickly charged the 1st reservation and reactivated my room key. When I got back to my room, I realized that they had overcharged me! I had to go back to the lobby with a copy of my reservation to show the price difference. They lady at the desk had the nerve to treat me like I was inconveniencing her. She was not the least bit apologetic and went behind a closed door for about 10 minutes consulting with a manager while I had to just wait. When I finally asked another employee if she was coming back, he snapped at me that she was working on the problem. She finally came back and told me she had requested a refund, but it might take a couple weeks. I wound up speaking to the manager who was just as rude as everyone else, but he did issue the refund right away. Of course it takes a while for a refund to show up on a credit card though. So.... their reservation system would not allow me to simply add a couple days to my reservation because I was there with a convention. After promising me that having to make a separate reservation for the couple extra days would not be an inconvenience, they locked me out of my room partway through my stay, told me I had to pay for the 1st reservation before reactivating my room key, overcharged me, then acted like I was inconveniencing THEM when I asked for a refund on the difference.

I rang the reception numerous times to get it changed and they did eventually. I don't know if it was the cheap rate I got on Expedia, that made me less worthy of their service, but it felt like you were treated differently just because you paid a $100 and not $200 and the reception clerk kept reminding me, that I booked it via hotwire, really annoying, specially when I asked for a late check out, had I known this would be such a pain in the butt, I would have chosen a different hotel, I even offered to pay the extra. Also the reception clerk upon check out refused to give me Priorityclub Rewards, stating I had prepaid and didn't book through them; again that feel of \"your not worthy\" of our service, cause you didn't pay full price. I was like, but I spent over $200 in room service in 2 days, give me some credit here and used the horrible slow valet at a wooping $32 a day!

The hotel is in need of a serious facelift, it looks dark and drab in many places. Rooms were beigy and yellow'ish colours, really just standard hotel interior, nothing special, no fancy touches, just what you needed and expected, nothing to \"wow\" you.

The reason for the different star ratings between the InterContinental and the Epic is poor customer service at the InterContinental. I stayed at the InterContinental on May 3, 2011. I was assigned one of the bi-level suites on the 33rd floor. The room itself was well appointed and all was fine with my stay with the exception of the last 40 minutes I was there. Approximately 20 minutes before I was scheduled to be picked up for my ride to the airport, I attempted to take a shower. The water that came out was only one temperature \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extremely hot. Nothing I did to try to cool down the flow would work and I could not therefore take either a bath or a shower. Because I was in a hurry, I opted to wash up using the sink. I then went down to the front desk to check out and to alert the hotel staff to the situation in my suite. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when the poor customer service began. After I received my folio I asked the front desk clerk to please note that the bath/shower in the unit was unusable due to extremely hot water. Rather than simply noting that, the front desk clerk informed me that I \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should have called down to let us know so we could have fixed the situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, if I had done that, would I have been able to check out now as I am doing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to which the front desk clerk sarcastically replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I then asked her to please clarify her initial statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you mean that you want guests who are disrobed and trying to use a non-functioning shower to re-robe, call downstairs, wait for an engineer who likely would not be able to fix the situation on the spot, and then (and only then) wash up in a sink?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The front desk clerk responded, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well if it could not have been fixed we could have tried to arrange for you to take a shower in the spa.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but then I most certainly would not have been able to check out right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At that point I got the sense that the front desk clerk really did not believe that what I was reporting was accurate. Not appreciating the apparent reality that my character and credibility were being challenged, I asked to speak with the front desk manager. I asked that manager to accompany back up to the 33rd floor so I could demonstrate that what I was stating was true. The front desk manager indeed tested the water himself and observed first hand what I had reported to the front desk clerk 10 minutes earlier. I explained to the manager that I was disappointed with how the front desk clerk handled my initial request and that I felt like she was challenging my credibility, thus causing me to now be 10 minutes late for my scheduled airport ride. The front desk manager did nothing more that apologize on behalf of the hotel and to give me his card. At no point thereafter did anyone at the hotel follow up with me about the situation. No phone call, no email, no nothing. That is in contrast to how the Epic handled the minor hiccups I experienced there. Not only did management at the Epic deal with the situation on the spot and offer me some sort of compensation for my troubles, but two different members of management emailed me within 48 hours after my stay to invite me to speak with them. In short, a non-functional bath/shower plus poor customer service resulted in a one star rating.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Augustine, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice but expensive extras\u201d", "Author": "JKSiragusa", "ReviewID": "UR106331803", "Content": "The hotel is beautiful and great location.

As I always do when a book a hotel on a blind discount travel site, I came to tripadvisor to check the reviews. I noticed right away that there were 2 reviews stating that when they arrived for check-in, they were told that they would not be able to honor their reservation due to current guest staying over because their flights had been canceled. Alarms went off in my head. We had planned to drive down from the Atlanta area after lunch for my wife and kids, it's a 10 hour drive, which would put us in Miami around 10pm. After reading a review here about someone losing their reservation when they had a late check, my wife decided to take the whole day off and let the kids skip the last day of school before the start of Spring Break. I called the Hotel Intercontinental Miami on 3 separate occasions to verify our reservations for a 2 bed double. We received confirmation each time. So, we hit the road at 4 am and arrived at the Hotel InterContinental Miami at 2 pm. The hotel sits on the water front across from Bayside and we were excited, the excitement grew when I entered the beautiful lobby to check in. I stood in line and watched 2 people trying to get checked in get turned away. I over heard the guy in front of me inquiring about the nightly rate, and the clerk informed him that it was $399 per night. I paid $175 plus fees, and I thought here we go. My turn, the clerk takes my name looks at the monitor and confirms that I have a standard double, I agree. Than it happened, she excuses herself and goes into an office, she comes out 3-4 minutes later and drops the bomb. I am sorry , but due to a guest having their flight canceled we are going to move you to a different hotel, you can leave your car parked here and we will pay for a taxi to take you to the Conrad Hotel and pay for another taxi to bring you back to pick up your car in the morning. I told her that was not acceptable, so she asked me if I would like to speak with a manager. So, she is off again to the little room for another 4-5 minutes, now while I am waiting, a young woman gets checked right in, and Ms Natalie Recinos comes out to speak with me. She gives me the same spill about someone having their flight canceled and having to stay over. I explain to her that I don't just a reservation, but a pre paid reservation. If someone has their flight canceled, they should be responsible for finding other accommodations, send them to the Conrad Hotel by taxi. She stated that that's not how they do things, that they have an agreement with the airlines. I asked her, if you are booked solid and don't have any rooms, how was that young women able to check in? Ms.Natalie Recinos states the she was probably a repeat guest or something. I then state that I read on tripadvisor that at least 2 other reviewers reservations were not honored due to flight cancellations, so whats going on here? She apologized again and repeated the offer to pay for a taxi to the Conrad. I told her why would I need a taxi when I drove my own car, she explained that I could leave my car in their valet parking area over night. What sense does that make? I told her that if I was moving, then how was I going to to be compensated for my trouble. She again stated that they would pay for a taxi. What? I told her that I wanted my money refunded and the Hotel InterContinental Hotel should pay for my stay at the Conrad. Well, she agreed. She goes back into the office and brings me out an agreement between the Hotel Intercontinental Miami and the Conrad to take me in. I told her that I want the agreement to refund my nights stay in writing before I leave. She states that she couldn't do that, but she would email it to me, so I write down my email address. I let it go because by this time, my wife and kids have been sitting out in the car for 30 mins waiting for me to get us checked in. I can't prove this, but I believe that the Hotel Intercontinental Miami dishonors discount hotel reservations when there is something large going on in the city, like the tennis tournament going on that week, in order to take in guest paying the full rate. When the hotels are full they bring out the \"guest flight was canceled\" excuse. Our family of five head on over to the Conrad where the lobby is on the 25th floor by the way. It is a nice art deco kind of hotel. I hand over my letter to clerk from the Hotel InterContinental Hotel, get checked in and head down to the 19th floor. The five of us walk into this tiny room with 1 king sized bed, so we thought that this was obviously an error. We head back up to the lobby to tell the clerk that she had given us a single instead of a double, easy fix we thought. Wrong, the Conrad was booked solid and all they had was a handicapped accessible single room. I asked her if she expected the five of us to sleep in one bed, she stated that she could send a roll away bed to the room and wave the $39 fee.By this time we are both livid and tired, so we acquiesce, and head back down to the room. Then I decided that surely they knew in advance that we were a party of five, so I head back up to the lobby to get a copy of that agreement letter between the Hotel Intercontinental Hotel and the Conrad Hotel for my records. I asked for a copy of that agreement from the front desk clerk, she goes into the little office, stays for about 3 mins and comes back out with a manager stating that they could not provide us with a copy. I asked why not and there was this strained look between the clerk and the manager, and they stated that they just couldn't. We decided to just let it go and go grab an early dinner. Then we found out that every time you leave the hotel parking, you have to pay!!!! It was a very bad start to our Spring Break Cruise, but we had an absolutely wonderful cruise.

I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to the bay side and the view of the harbor with the cruise ships docked was a welcoming sight. Regardless to the view, the room was very dated and the carpeting was badly soiled in our room. The dining room was only open for breakfast and lunch--and dinner had to be taken either in the lounge area (which was very noisy earlier in the evenings) or had to be ordered through room service--forcing you if you wanted a decent dinner to go out of the hotel, whether you wanted to or not. What's more, there was never a reason given why the diningroom was not available in the evenings in spite of the fact that we were there with a big athletic conference!

The location is perfect for anyone who is planning a cruise and wants to arrive the night before. Its at $8 cab ride to the Port of Miami and the cabs are always flowing.

I ordered a fridge and even though was told $30/stay, housekeeping told me $35/day. So I argued and they capitulated to $30/stay - which is still a hefty extra. Looking thru the room booklet I found that one can request to have the minibar emptied for private use. No one offered me that option. There is a free safe - at least that.

I called downstairs to make sure it was complimentary and they assured me it was. I never heard any noise from other guests at night and slept well. The lobby is a nice place to sit and people watch. When we were leaving they were busy putting out the red carpet for a celebrity event they having that night. There was never a problem finding a cab from this hotel and the bell staff was more than helpful with getting your luggage down the stairs in the lobby.

We chose this hotel because of the brand and also because it wasn't in Miami/South Beach away from the crowds and party noise. The problem is that Miami downtown is dead. In places it feels quite rough, in places it is! There is a Macy's store within walking distance of the hotel and a Walgreens and that's about it. There is however a great menswear shop that does free Cuban music and mojitos on a Tuesday. The Art Museum is close by too but we gave it a miss. Whilst there aren't many bars/restaurants near by the bar within the vast hotel foyer is a pretty poor offering, unfortunately. Likewise the restaurant feels likes eating in an airport. Interestingly we looked into the Hyatt around the corner and it was pretty much the same, I had thought it might have had a restaurant but it had just a bar serving standard bar food. There are some good restaurants fairly nearby but everything is a cab ride away if you don't have a car. I was shocked at how car dependent the city was. There are public buses to South Beach from just outside the hotel which is very handy. Using the buses can be a fairly humbling experience - although the bike rack at the front of the bus is pretty cool! So back to the hotel, poor location but very good spa (although they charge you to use the gym unless you are have Ambassador membership!!). We were on the club level and used the Club Room regularly. It was quite small but the staff there were superb. The food offerings were ok but the drinks were good.

Rooms are clean and elegantly outfitted, and rooms with bay views offer breathtaking scenes over Biscayne Bay. I arrived at the hotel later in the evening, and check-in was quick and efficient. Check-out was also quick and painless. The lobby features a generous seating area outfitted with stylish furniture. Much of the lobby is finished in marble, as is an imposing sculpture that greets you when you enter the building. Six elevators are available to take guests up to their rooms. The room was located on the twenty-sixth floor and had a gorgeous bay view. The room was quite large for a hotel room, and featured stylish furniture befitting a hotel in this class. The two double beds were comfortable, clean, and were outfitted with sufficient linens. A large, marble-topped desk provides wired internet connection and the room itself is outfitted with wireless internet accessibility, albeit at $11.95 for twenty-four hours. Internet access is granted by dialing 0, speaking with an operator who will release a code, and then the charges are billed to the room. The high speed internet was sufficiently fast and should not disappoint. The TV lurks in a stylish hutch, though finicky guests may recoil at the older style CRT TV. Snacks are available just above the mini-bar, though unsurprisingly, they are not cheap. There is ice available on each floor, and the layout of the hotel means the hallway is a loop, making it difficult to get lost. The bathroom was, predictably, also fitted in attractive marble. The shower had plenty of hot water and was powerful, though the shower head was on the low side. There are generous closets both in the room and in the bathroom. The faucet worked well and a hair dryer is provided. The toilet and shower are separated from the sink area by a door. Overall, while definitely not a brand new hotel, all of the hardware works well and there were no age-related problems such as distressed furniture or mold. The hotel features a variety of amenities. There is a Starbucks in the main lobby, and a convenience store sells a variety of goods in just across from the reception area. A mail box is provided just outside the convenience store. However, I mailed a postcard to myself and it took quite a long time to receive it, which makes me skeptical of how often mail is collected from the box. A business centre has a few computers and a printer for use, albeit these services are not complimentary. There is also a large, staffed concierge desk that proved useful in providing tourist information. There is a pool and extensive spa, though I did not make use of these areas. Valet parking is available, and the valets will also hail a taxi for guests, as a couple of taxis are already lined up near the hotel, ready to be summoned by a whistle. The location of the hotel is a plus. Most attractions are within a reasonable distance. The hotel is located at the end of a quiet street that ends at Biscayne Bay. Effectively, the hotel has the small street to itself, save for an office building at the corner. Across from the hotel is picturesque and quiet Bayfront Park, and a quick walk through Bayfront Park leads to Bayside Marketplace, where a variety of shops and restaurants can be found. There are also a number of bay cruises that originate here. The hotel is also very close to the Miami Metromover, the free elevated rail system that is useful for getting around downtown Miami or heading to major transportation hubs to connect to other forms of transit. Also nearby are a number of bus stops that will whisk one to many places in Miami. South Beach can be reached with route C in thirty minutes. Also nearby is American Airlines arena and the many electronics stores of Flagler Street. The Port of Miami is also close, making the hotel useful for cruise ship guests, a taxi to the port will cost about ten dollars. However, aside from the venues mentioned, the area does not have much in terms of entertainment, largely a financial centre. Overall, the Intercontinental Miami was an excellent hotel. Staff and service was solid, the rooms were comfortable, clean and contemporary, and the location was reasonable and tranquil. There is little fault in this hotel, other than perhaps the age of the hotel, but this should largely go unnoticed. A fantastic deal around the $100 per night range and highly recommended.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location- even with a car\u201d", "Author": "geosu", "ReviewID": "UR51045976", "Content": "Just back from staying 3 nights at the Intercontinental post cruise and booked independently with travelrepublic for a steal. The hotel is in the perfect location. The hotel is right on the waterfront with Bayside park right in front. The Bayside market area is 5 minutes walk through the park. This has lots of nice bars and restaurants as well as shops and stalls, which I dont think were highly priced at all- same prices as in Dolphin Mall. The room was of a higher than expected standard with a lovely view overlooking the park and towards downtown. The minibar is clearly marked with a warning that you will be charged if anything is moved so no excuses for misunderstanding. The staff were all friendly and helpful, apart from the stuffy woman in the spa. We didnt eat in the main restaurant but did have room service which was fine and reasonably priced. We had one drink in the bar though and were stunned by the cost so we went to Bayside market in the evenings instead. Wifi isnt unreasonable at 11 dollars a day, better than in U.K. Bit much to pay 34 dollars for overnight parking but this was only for one night and we knew the car would be safer than parking outside on the meter- here there were several instances of glass over the floor! Having said that , I found the area very safe. Lots of people walking about at night and we never felt threatened once. We did see a couple of down and outs asleep in the park late at night but they didnt bother anyone and we were never approached. I would think about staying here again, but the cost of the parking for more than a day puts me off. You need a car to see more of Miami so this is a big deal. But if you're just a couple of days pre or post cruise I would not hesitate to recommend it.

We found a last minute deal and got a great rate, so we booked and stayed this past weekend for 3 nights. People complain about the location - well, unless you stay on South Beach (either way too expensive or really bad hotels), this is the next best thing in my opinion. It is downtown, and just a 5 minute walk to the Bayside shopping area. The other downtown hotels (Conrad, Marriott, etc) are much further out. And this is only a 10 minute drive to South Beach so you're as close as possible. The lobby is very nice, the check in was easy, and we found the staff friendly. The rooms are slightly dated but still very adequate. We upgraded (for just $20 a night, not bad in my opinion) to a bay view room which was absolutely worth it. You have a great view of the water, the cruise ships coming and going, and it is very tranquil. As for the furnishings - we found the bed one of the most comfortable we've slept in. The bathroom was high end enough for us, and it had a separate bath and shower which is always preferred. We did notice a few dents and dings here and there, but nothing too bad. We ate a quick dinner one night in the lobby restaurant and enjoyed that too. Starbucks is downstairs as well which is very convenient. The only negative I can give is the parking price ($34 a day), and I believe they only have valet. We found that too expensive but Miami is an expensive city, so we got used to that. Overall I would definitely recommend the Intercontinental. For a classy, high end hotel in a good location with good views, this should be your choice.

I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deny the rooms were good and as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153diamond member\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they say they gave me a so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Honestly if that was my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd then they should speak to any other hotel and get a clue, just read my other reviews for the Crown Plaza in Key West or Hilton in Ft Lauderdale. Here is the biggest problem\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I just had 2 small bottles of water I wanted to keep cold. I look for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refrigerator,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd only to find out it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mini bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now I can easily fit in my two small bottles of water and went ahead and did so\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 My girlfriend pointed out a sign saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mini bar not to be used for your own use, call #51 for that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or something like that. I have heard all the horror stories of being charged an insane amount for just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touching\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an item (as they are all monitored electronically now). Just an FYI for a pack of Skittles that we bought that day from CVS for $0.50 they were charging $5.50 Come on! Talk about mark up! I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if you are on business if it were one of my employees buying that stuff I would fire them simply for wasting company money! So back to the issue, I called the number on the sign, after 2 minutes they pick up to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you need to call the front desk for that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They transfer me to someone else and I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hey I have 2 small bottles of water I squeezed into the fridge is that okay as I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be charged if it bumps something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He tells me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, you should not use that, let me call someone and see if we can get you a fridge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Okay so 15-20 minutes go by with nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We want to go out for the night so I call back and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hey someone was supposed to call me back but never did, we were told to get a fridge but we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So we leave for the night come back and a fridge was there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 all aggravating but now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153okay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I called the front desk and asked to have a boarding pass printed for my flight.

WHAT? That is right, I explained to the person last night I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to take the risk of being charged $7-$8 for 2 overpriced water bottles so he recommended I get a $35 a day fridge to keep 2 small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bottles cold without telling me! Come on, at least tell your customer before you try and rip them off. Had I even THOUGHT they would charge me I would have been content with some ice to keep them cold\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (Although knowing this hotel they would have charged me for the ice too). Now granted after many complaints at the front desk and demanding to speak to a Manager (who was not available to deal with an upset customer) a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supervisor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd came out, still absolutely hopeless but after they saw that I was adamant about not paying this they did agree to remove the charge.

I guess I had the wrong room with the wrong staff on the wrong day. It happens. Anyway, the following is the e-mail I wrote to the hotel GM, Jack Miller, following our return from Miami. I never received a response from him or the hotel. Feel free to read my letter and tell me if I was out of line in any fashion whatsoever. ------------------- First, let me say I am not looking for anything from you or Intercontinental Miami. Instead, I wanted to let you know how disappointed I am in the poor standards and even poorer level of service I received. I pride myself on doing a lot of research prior to making travel arrangements and booking the actual vacation. Being a Canadian travelling in the U.S., my goal is to get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvalue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for my money. Having personally stayed at hotels within your chain, I am more than familiar with the quality of the various brands and quite honestly, expected a lot from your hotel, if nothing else, based on the solid reputation of the Intercontinental Miami. Since March 2007, I have taken three cruises out of Miami. I have always attempted to stay at the Intercontinental Miami. Instead, I have ended up at hotels that I considered to be of good but lesser quality than the Intercontinental Miami. A few weeks ago, I made a booking for the Marriott Biscayne Bay, thinking I had received a very good rate for a good hotel. However, I later discovered that you were offering a special promotional rate of $99 U.S. per night. I immediately contacted the Intercontinental and made a booking, then spent 20 minutes canceling the Marriott reservation. Needless to say, I was thrilled to know we would be staying at what I and many others consider to be one of the top hotels in Miami, Florida. Upon checking in, I was greeted by a very pleasant and efficient front desk person named Christina. I advised her that, when I made the reservation, I requested two cribs for the room as we have twins. She advised only one crib was on the order but made a call and quickly arranged for a second crib. I also requested that a pot of boiling water be brought to the room sometime in the next few minutes if possible, as well as later in the afternoon and early in the morning of Monday, April 6. The first pot of water came up within 15 minutes, as did the two cribs. However, the second pot of water never showed up later the same day (Sunday, April 5). In addition, upon getting set up in the room, I noted that the one box of tissues soon emptied upon using only six to eight tissues. In addition, the bathroom sink seemed to be a bit slow to drain. However, as we were getting the babies fed and arranging to meet friends from Miami, we did not worry too much about either of the above. We left the hotel to meet the friends and came back to change the babies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 diapers. We discovered that both sets of key cards that had worked upon checking in were now unusable. I went down to the front desk and advised Christina, who re-keyed our cards and told me security would be up shortly. The security person came up and attempted to get our key cards to work. Instead, he had to leave and get a device to re-master our door. This process took about 15 minutes while babies waited to get changed. At about 10:30 p.m., we were getting ready for bed and it was at this point that we noticed just how badly the bathroom sink was clogged. It took about 10-15 minutes for the sink to drain. I called downstairs and was put through to Carlos. I advised him there was no point sending anyone up as we were leaving early Monday morning. However, I just wanted him to know that this was an issue that should have been addressed prior to our arrival. I also advised him that our requested pot of hot water had not been delivered to our room Sunday afternoon as requested. I then requested that a pot of water be brought to our room around 5:30 a.m. Monday morning and left for us to make baby formula prior to our departure. Upon waking up at 6:30 a.m., I opened the door to our room and much to my chagrin discovered there was no pot of water. I called down and advised the person who answered. She advised me that she would contact guest services as soon as she hung up. No one brought any hot water to our room. I also asked if someone could get our bags as we were leaving at 7:30 a.m. I was informed someone would be right up. No one showed up. Instead, we took two babies, two umbrella strollers, three suitcases and three pieces of carry-on luggage downstairs ourselves. I was not impressed. Prior to leaving the room, I attempted to check out using express check-out. The bill was higher than expected as we had been charged for taking things out of the refrigerator. While I understand you have an automated system for this, on Sunday afternoon, we had called down to advise someone that we needed to take some items out in order to store baby bottles. We were assured there would be no issue with this and that we would not be billed. To the hotel's credit, this was rectified immediately. However, to say I am underwhelmed by the Intercontinental Miami would be the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunderstatement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the year. I am more than unimpressed by the service received. Other than Christina and the gentleman who set up the two cribs, the service was severely lacking. I do not anticipate a trip to Miami anytime soon and am NOT seeking any compensation of any sort. I just needed to express my disappointment with your hotel and to let you know that, if it was a bad day for the hotel, as a result, it was an even worse day for us.

First of all, the hotel's location is not worth the money. Though the Bayside shopping district is less than a block, its much better to stay in South Beach for the \"true\" Miami experience. The Inter-Continental has valet parking only - so if you want to leave the hotel for whatever reason, you're going to tip constantly. Plus a fee of $35 a day to park your car. This adds up quickly. Secondly, the front desk clerks look exceptionally polished, but you quickly find out that they, like every other employee at this hotel, are lacking in guest service, hospitality and good old fashioned manners. I had to call for maid service every day as I returned by 5 daily to find an unmade room. I also called to let them know that there were several lightbulbs burned out in my room, of which none were ever repaired. The hotel itself was clearly built in the 1970's-early 80's, with a consistant brown granite that runs throughout the interior and exterior. Though it claims to be remodeled, and does have a comfortable bed, its only in soft-renovations (carpet, linens, wall coverings, furniture). The room's furniture itself reminded me of a Holiday Inn Suite rather than the $700 a night room that it proclaimed to be on the back of the door. The bathroom had a nice walk in shower. Its only disappointment was that its bathtub was clearly 25+ years old - low to the ground, shallow and very narrow. The pool area, though very nice with a great bar staff, only had around 25 deck chairs - far too few for one its size. You practically had to question everyone there just to find out which chair was taken. With the pool area being surrounded by sky scrappers all around you - literally on 3 sides straight up - the sun is very limited.

The lobby showpiece is a giant Henry Moore sculpture, the colour and texture of which are integrated in the lobby's decor. Striking and beautiful. The food in the bar and restaurant (which are side by side on the ground floor) are interchangable. So if you prefer the restaurant menu but the more casual atmosphere of the bar, as we did, you can dine in the latter with the former's menu choices. The club lounge (floor 29?) was inviting and attractively decorated, the snacks and breakfasts were lovely, and the happy hour drinks (a selection of wines, champagne, beer and spirits) were complimentary.

It is pretty touristy but we found a Cuban restaurant(more like diner) that we very authentic. We were the only people in the restaurant that spoke English and our waitress was friendly even though we had a little trouble communicating. The restaurant was The Latin American Cafeteria. Very good! Highly recommended. We walked around and then headed back to the hotel. There is no where in the marketplace to buy supplies for a cruise but we asked a friendly bellhop and he directed us to a CVS two blocks up the street. Just hang a left out the front door and head up two blocks. We stopped by Starbucks in the lobby but ended up going to the breakfast buffet that was provided in the hotel restaurant. It was pricey $57 with a tip but we really enjoyed it. Very relaxing and much better than an old baked good at Starbucks. The gym is really nice. They do charge and extra $15 per person for a 24 hour period. Since we checked in at 6pm we used the gym both the day we checked in and the next morning. I tell you it is the best $15 I ever spent. Not so much for the gym (which is very adequate, free water too grab and extra for later). but the spa! With the fee you get to use the steam room, they have chilled towels for when you get out, a drench shower with soothing music and lights, a green tea energy drink. Then the ladies room has towels, soap, shaving cream in the shower, hair gel, dryers, and almost anything you need. They do provide a robe and slippers to use in the sauna. It was the BEST! I would have stayed for a week just to use it. The cab rides in Miami are a little expensive just like any other city. From the airport it was about $25 and to the cruise port about $10. I did notice though that there was a monorail to the left of the hotel and the map was posted if you wanted to get around. It came by quite often. I have read reviews of this hotel and cannot imagine how anyone encountered rude staff. The staff here was nothing but helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable and very spacious. The televisions need a little updating(still big and bulky) and the ironing boards are a little flimsy. The views are wonderful from the higher floors. The elevators were not slow when I was there and most times I was the only one in it. Check out was under 5 minutes for me. I would recommend staying here post or pre cruise for the right price. I cannot comment on what it would be like to stay for business since I did not need any of the business facilities.

They would fill the ice box with ice, prepare the beds for sleep if needed and leave a card with the weather forcast for the next day. We once left a note to asking for teaspoons in our room and this was delivered before the end of the afternoon. Room service was very good too. We only ordered tea (as I had a fllu for a few days). This cost us $14 and we got about 6 herbal tea bags with lots of honey jars and lemons to last a few days!! We used the restaurant 3 times. Twice for breakfast and once for dinner (the Miami Spice offer). We were very happy with the food and service. The breakfast in particular had a lot of variety ranging from fresh fruit to cereals, cold meats, cheeses, pastries and hot foods. We have never had such fresh pastries in a hotel before. $21 might seem like alot to some people and we thought it at first but then, for the food we got, it wasn't bad at all. Both times we had breakfast, we didn't feel hungry at all during the day and only had a snack or light meal in the evening. We didn't use the pool but did have a look and wouldn't have minded relaxing by the pool except for the weather preventing it. We spent a lot of time away from the hotel, sightseeing the everglades, Key West and Key Biscayne. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in downtown Miami and right by the water front with views of Miami Port. Transport by trains and buses are a little inconvenient (time consuming) so we hired a car for a few days so we could explore the city and beyond. If you want a lazy beach holiday here, then stay around South Beach and Miami Beach. It takes about 10-15 mins to drive to the beach area from downtown and you have to pay for parking. The Bayside Mall is just near the hotel and has restaurants, shops and boat trips. They also have live entertainment in the evenings, which is nice to enjoy. There isn't that much to do in downtown so plan your trip well and make sure you know what you're doing. Having a car is an added bonus. We were happy to stay here as we loved the relaxing grounds of the hotel and short walk to the Bayside mall. Our room was very comfortable and we loved the views we had.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach", "Title": "\u201cWe got staff infections!\u201d", "Author": "tabadaba", "ReviewID": "UR18968182", "Content": "We all got Pseudomona a water born staff infection caused by poorly maintained hot tubs.

Once I arrived to the front desk I speak to Lauren Perez and advise her that I'm here for the paper. She replies, \"There's no paper here!\" and her response was accompanied with urban hand gestures, the rolling of eyes, and a clear view that she seemed bothered. I explained that I made this request in advance about 30 minutes ago. She asked if I spoke to someone and I told her. Lauren called Enrique and asked, \"Did anyone request a paper?\" Once she recieved the response she hung up the phone turned to me and abruptly said, \"Nope! No paper!\" I continued to say that I'll still wait for the paper because I HAD to show up to work with it. I also added if there was anywhere that I can eat breakfast in the mean time. Lauren suggested Starbucks. I replied, \"Is that it?\" So then Lauren replies, \"Well, everything else in here is too expensive!\" That left another bad taste in my mouth. Why is she assuming its too expensive for me? Isn't she supposed to promote the hotel? Who is she to judge? Is she implying that I can't afford it? I ignored her and proceeded to the hotel restaurant for breakfast which clearly was not expensive. The restauarant was very good and the waiter Vincente was very clean, prompt, and attentative. The eggs benedict were cooked perfectly with a correct portion of potatos. Overall a good experience at the restaurant. When I was done I went back to the front desk to pick up the paper and another agent Patricia helped me.

The hotel's location is probably the best location of any hotel downtown. Across the street from a Metromover station, right on the waterfront (with wonderful views of Biscayne Bay), 5-minute walk to Bayside Market. This area of downtown probably has the most restaurants/shopping of anywhere in downtown (as the area north of the causeway is a wasteland and Brickell is pretty much a business district). Not exactly convenient to Miami Beach or South Beach, but $1.50 direct bus ride gets you to both in about 1/2 hr. Didn't try the restaurant or bar as I had heard they were extraordinarily expensive. For us, the Starbucks worked as an acceptable breakfast option and all the restaurants at Bayside Market provided plenty of variety and prices ranges. Room was small but with a view to die for and convention rate was reasonably priced. Furnishings were in good condition and housekeeping was thorough (although slow, they typically didn't start working until mid to late afternoon and we needed to hang out in the lobby more than once while they were finishing up). Unfortunately, the pool is only open during daylight and one must walk through the spa in order to get to it (very odd layout). Nothing special about the pool area but attendants were attentive. Now to the nickel and diming. A $3/day housekeeping fee was added to the final bill. When asked about it, we were told that it was in lieu of a housekeeping tip and it was only added on the final five days of our stay (we were there nine nights altogether). So apparently, if you don't tip housekeeping staff, you get reported and it is added to your bill. We were also billed for a bottle of red wine (which we never even saw in the room) and a number of items from the fridge (which was opened and items removed to make space for a gallon of milk but the items were replaced by us the next day). We explained to reception that we didn't consume any of the items and that housekeeping never 'replenished' anything (as we put the original items back in the fridge) and reception was very good about taking the charges off our bill. Didn't go for the $12/day internet access because the conference provided internet terminals (what is it with 4 & 5* hotels charging an arm and a leg for wireless, but motel chains give it to you for free?).

The Bayside Marketplace and CVS were both a short walk away from the hotel to pick up any last minute items that you might have forgotten. The room itself was manificient, well-kept and quite large.

For some good sleep, I would have traded the view. My first night there, around 4:30 am, I heard someone trying to come into my room. My security lock hadn't worked, but fortunately the bolt was on. The person didn't respond when I challenged them so I called security. The maintenance man tried to tell me the security lock did work because he got it to work once. The minute he (and the security person and the manager) walked away, the lock didn't work, so I made them come back. Apparently the bellmen all have universal keys, and the bellman had come to the wrong room. Nevertheless, with no security bolt, I felt uncomfortable, so they moved me (and a month's worth of luggage that had been unpacked just hours earlier and had to be repacked for moving) to another room with the same view. A couple of days later, it turns out that President Bush's advance team camped out -- with all their electronic equipment -- on the floor I was on, so we were tripping over cables for about 3-4 days. There were other incidents over the course of the month as well, but the one that burned me most is a charge for a no-show that I have been trying to get removed now for 2 months.

I realized the day before departure that a per diem change occurred 10/1 to $146 and changed to this hotel. Boy was I glad I did! My colleague stayed there and believe me the difference is night and day. The H.I. is obviously an older hotel and it shows, from the small lobby, worn furnishings, rather small spartan room & bath, and back office building view he had. In addition, he had forgotten his contractors govt. id and after presenting mine as his supervisor the second day, they assured us they would change his $165 rate, which he found out they did not when he checked out. In comparison, I've stayed in fine hotels worldwide and this one has one of the nicest art deco lobby's. I checked in at 3:45 PM on Sunday and there was no line and a friendly staff. When inquiring about my room view they did sell the \"Ambassador Package\" which I declined and proceeded to my art deco back-side room on the 19th floor. I had a direct view of the pool below, faced condos about 100 yards away, and a side-view of the bay. The large bathroom was all in stone tile, as well as the separate room with door for the toilet and shower, including the fixtures. The two queens beds were plush and comfortable with 6 pillows each. I especially enjoyed the soft glow from the orange lamp on the TV/Armoire, which was a very pleasant in the evenings. I signed up and utilized the HS internet service with no problems. The housekeeping was excellent and upon occasion when my scheduled varied, I called to request service upon departing, which was promptly performed with a voice mail left for me each time to follow-up. The fridge has micro-sensors recording each item moved, and there is no room for additional storage. Opening the door numerous times did not result in any charge. Public parking is available in front of the bldg. with about 30-40 spaces for a rate of $1.25/hr, however not permitted from 2-7 AM. The only problem I did encounter was when I couldn't get into my room on the third day. I obtained a new key from the desk and still couldn't get in, at which point they sent a clerk up with me. Neither my nor his house key worked, so he radioed for assistance after which the hotel detective arrived, verified my ID and sent up a locksmith, who reset the lock with his computer and let me in.

The bar area was non-smoking and it was happy hour so we got a 25% discount on food and drinks. We split a Club Sandwich and it was served on two plates with more than enough french fries. No extra charge for a split plate. The service was great and we were very happy to just relax over dinner.

So....we endured the pitches for the ambasador plan and upgrades and finally got to our room. We reserved a King room and were given a room with 2 double beds. We called downstairs from the phone on the desk (the one between the beds didn't work). We said we would even take a smoking room with a King bed, but we had to listen to their pitches AGAIN before they would even check to see if one was available!

Don't be fooled with the opulent lobby and facade...trust me, their rooms are not all that! You will see once you see the size of their room doors. Lastly, here's one culture shock... Where I come from, it is rude to speak a language other than English to a colleague in front of English speaking guests as if the guests do not exist.

I picked up my friends at Miami International Airport on Saturday, January 27th approximately at 5 PM. I drove them to your hotel to check in and then we decided we would like to eat and the concierge told us that Indigo was convenient and located on the premises. My friends and I were seated promptly. The restaurant was not busy. There weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many people seating in the dining area. In fact, most of the tables were free. Granted the hotel was crowded with guests arriving for the Atlantis cruise, but most of them were in the bar area and not inside Indigo. We waited about 20 minutes to be greeted by a waiter. At which time we told him we were ready to order. He told us that he would take the drink order and come back for the rest of the order. We reminded him that we were ready to order and he interrupted us to only say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will only take your drink order for now!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd About 15 minutes later our drinks arrived. The waiter then took our order. About 20 minutes passed and our drinks were empty. The waiter was no where in sight. We asked another waiter who was passing by if we could get refills, and he simply glared at us and told us that we needed to tell our server. Alas, our waiter did not return or was even visible for quite some time. Another 20 minutes passed at which time my friend got up and went to the hostess stand to request to see a manager. About 15 minutes later a dark haired man in a blue suit approached our table. We told him that we still did not receive our food or even refills. He said he would take care of things. Another 20 minutes passed at which time a lemonade was delivered to our table but no other drinks. Mind you, I was having lemonade, my friend was drinking Diet Coke, and his friend was having water with lemon. These are not alcoholic drinks from the bar. This is not something that requires this long of a time frame to prepare and deliver to the table. Another 20 minutes passed. By now we decided we would leave the hotel and go dine elsewhere. As we were leaving I informed a brunette named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monica\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the service was horrible and that we were left waiting for such a long time. Meanwhile, the table next to us got seated AFTER us and they received their meal AND already had dessert and paid their check and were leaving before us! Monica merely said she knows and that there was nothing she could do. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apologize or even sympathize with the situation. Obviously this must be a regular occurrence at Indigo! To make matters worse, my friend Jeff found out the hotel charged his credit card 4 times for his one night stay.

We stayed one night pre-cruise at the Hotel Intercontinental - Miami on October 7, 2006. The BAD stuff: First, I will start off by saying that the hotel is beautiful and very spacious. Upon arrival, we were checked in by the front desk clerk, Stephen, who wasn't too friendly at all. My travel agent booked this hotel room for us 1 year and 3 months ago and requested a Bay View, King Room - Non Smoking. There wasn't any Bay View rooms according to him when we arrived at noon. My travel agent recevied confirmation the day prior upon arrival stating that we had those amentities and there were not granted. If we wanted a Bay View room that is was going to cost us an additional $35 for the high floors and $25 for the lower floors, although he didn't have ANY to even give us at that time. So, I just took what we could get and settled for City View which was on the 22nd floor, first off. I did check back again hours later twice for Bay View rooms and nothing was still available. The rooms were beautiful with classy, colorful decor and the bed linens are luxurious and very comfortable! The towels were big and fluffy and the bathrooms were big, marble and nice! Although I had a few problems that needed to be mentioned and addressed to the management staff. There was one wall close to the bed that had a plate size mold-mildew stain on it and my husband is allergic to it and I also killed a massive bug in the shower. So, we told management, although they wouldn't even come up to look themselves, they sent a bellman up to retrieve our things and move us to the 27th floor, to which I still didn't receive a Bay View. I wasn't going to let this start my vacation off bad, so we moved to a different room at 1:00 in the morning. We receive a complimentary continential breakfast, which was $19 and consisted of ONLY fruits, juices and a muffin. THAT\"S IT! We didn't get in the pool because we didn't have enough time. Although it was in a great location, the sun didn't shine down on it much because of all of the tall buildings around. But the view was AWESOME and some great pictures can be taken from it. The were so many boats to watch go by that I could sit there for days! The GOOD stuff: The restaraunt that was right next to the pool, I think it was called the Sea Blue cafe' was EXCELLENT. We had the best food there and great service and would go back in a heartbeat. The view is soooo nice! Bayside Market is very close and a short walk nearby with great shopping and restaraunts. I don't know how much taxi fare was because we didn't take one and only walked and we had a shuttle service from the Miami Airport to the hotel. But I would suggest to stay in a group at night because there were a lot of people out late in the evenings.

You can also take a tour of Millionaire's Row from Bayside - a fun activity that I would definitely recommend. In my opinion, this hotel is ideal for a night or two before or after a cruise.

It is about a 25 minute ride from Miami Airport.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cA lovely hotel.\u201d", "Author": "ducs", "ReviewID": "UR4626191", "Content": "Stayed at Intercontinental Hotel Miami for a conference for three nights in early March. Check-in took about three minutes. All staff very friendly and helpful. The bedroom and bathroom were quite spacious. The view of Biscayne Bay was spectacular. Housekeeping was unobtrusive. I was happy to have a coffee maker in the room, but the pot made two to three cups yet there was only one cream and one sugar, so only enough for one cup. The only other complaint I have is really about many hotels: Why don't they put air conditioning in the bathrooms? Especially in Miami where it's really hot and humid and even more so in the bathroom after you take a hot shower. I would definitely stay here again though. You can walk to a nice park on the water and the Bayside Marketplace with lots of shops and take a cruise around the harbor and see celebrity homes ($17 but there is a $3 off coupon in the Miami magazine in the hotel room).", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven, CT", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "chessiesrule", "ReviewID": "UR4473928", "Content": "Stayed here for a conference located at the hotel.

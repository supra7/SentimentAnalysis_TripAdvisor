It was a bussiness trip so accomodation arrangement made by my company itself.

The other reason was most of my companymates from India use to stay there so it is very common to get a friend there. Here are my experiences in points. Pros: -Complimentary breakfast -Free 1 hour long distance calls, 15 minutes call for Canada everyday. -Nice Plazma tv in hotel room, Microwave -Nice location all places which are good are near like university and other discs -Room service is quite regular and they are quite co-operative -Cold drinks are available most of the time -Snakes,Beverages in the evening which include two hard drinks(though we couldn't enjoy that much because of office timings) -Drury membership, That is the most interesting part of Drury you get some points for each stay. As we have to stay longer for out official work we get enough points in one month that we can redeem it to 50 dollar amazon coupon. So it is kind of gift from Drury to you . Cons: -There is not much choice in morning breakfast and they are repeating same things from years so after few visits you will get bored with that atleast. -Sometimes power cut off while you are using microwave so it was pain in my last trip -In my first trip they accidently charged on my credit card for room payment without my approval. Though they revert the charge back but I got charge for both as I was having an Indian credit card. I noticed it later and then raise it to hotel staff and thanks to the hotel staff I got my 4000 INR back. I guess I was just unfortunate for this event because otehr two times it went very well.

We arrived about 5 p.m. and got checked in right away. You get a ticket for 3 \"adult\" beverages during \"happy hour\".

Included with \"happy hour\" are chips & salsa, carrot sticks and dip and, pretzels. Our room was very nice and clean. There are flat screen tv's in every room which the kids enjoyed when they weren't swimming. The pool is a nice size and it is an indoor/outdoor pool, which means half is inside and half is outside. The kids love that during the cool weather and the pool is nice and warm. The only downside was that it had rained quite a bit that day and there was thunder and lightening, so they had to close the pool as a safety precaution until the storm passed. But it did reopen. The beds were so comfortable that I was going to check and see what kind of mattress they used, but I forgot. Very quiet during the night too. Water pressure in the showers was really good considering everyone is using water efficient shower heads these days. Finally, the breakfast. This is INCLUDED in the price of the room. It is a FULL BREAKFAST...biscuits and gravy, eggs (with crumbled bacon, cheese and salsa on the side), sausage, french toast, made to order waffles, cereal, doughnuts, bagels, fruit, juices, coffee, milk. That alone saved us at lest $25 - $30 if we had gone out to breakfast with the kids. If you want a great room, with comfortable beds, super friendly staff and LOTS of extras (comp mixed drinks/beer, comp soft drinks and popcorn, full breakfast in the morning) then this is the place for you. If you want less, then go somewhere else. I will seek out Drury Inn's in our future travels. A GREAT VALUE DURING A TIME WHEN EVERYONE IS TRYING TO CUT BACK.

The rooms were clean and the remainder of the hotel appeared in the same condition. One thing that stood out was the staff was very friendly. Everyone greeted us with a smile and hello. We arrived a little before check-in and our room was ready. They had popcorn and soft drinks avaiable but we were going to meet our son for wings at Wild Wings about 1-2 blocks away for a light lunch so we passed. We returned a little later and enjoyed a few cocktails in the lobby before heading off to the pool and jucuzzi for about 1 hr. They allow 3 per guest per evening and is a very nice perk. Drinks were very weak but what can you expect. We went out for dinner and returned about 10pm. The one thing I really like is the security in this hotel. When they say the lock the outside doors they REALLY DO. You need your key to get in any exterior door. Very impressive. Many hotels say this and never follow through. OK..besides all of that the ONE THING I DID NOT LIKE WAS....we had a room on the east side and in the corner. Now for those of you who have never been to this area BEWARE...the Drury Inn is located by THE BUSIEST intersection in Champaign. The traffic noise in the early morning hours litterally woke me up in the morning.....The trucks braking, loud muffler sounds echoed...If you book a room here, make sure to book on the East side and hopeully you won't have that issue. I enjoyed my stay as the room was clean BUT I doubt if I will ever stay at this particular location again. Also, we checked out at 10:45am ( check out is 11am) and I felt that we were being rushed. The cleaning people were next door and made us VERY well aware that they were there. It's a good thing I didn't need the extra sleep as I would not have gotten it.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievably nice!!!

This is our new choice for hotels! We will search out a Drury Inn over the \"other 4 and 5 star hotels\" everytime we travel. This was clean, (an understatement I might add), safe, quiet, very, very nice. The breakfast in the morning was not your doughnut and coffee but a FULL service Breakfast Buffet with everything from bisquits and gravy to made to order Waffles! Wonderful, wonderful experience. Wonderful hotel in a wonderful location. Cannot say enough good things about this place. For all you parents out college shopping, STAY HERE!!!

It is one of the cleanest (if not THE cleanest) hotel room I have ever stayed in. I literally stopped in my tracks upon entering the bathroom because I could not believe how sparkling clean it was. That is so rare for a hotel chain these days. The rooms have unusual decor, reminding me of Kentucky for some reason. It wasn't unpleasant, just midwestern, I guess. The rooms have mini fridges and microwaves and the mattresses & pillows are soft and very comfy. The rooms must be well insulated because I could not hear anything outside or my neighbors, despite the hotel being near capacity. Free hot breakfast is provided which included eggs, sausage, make-your-own-waffles, muffins, cereal, yogurt, coffee, and assorted juices. A free 1 hour long distance phone call is included with each room. I believe that there is also free internet access and a computer w/ internet is provided in the lobby.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4082717", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for two nights.

It is located just across the street from the Staples Center / Nokia Theater / LA Live Area and easily within walking distance of most of the downtown area. The hotel also has convenient access (through a 10 min drive) to the USC Campus (visiting campus was the purpose of my stay). Room - Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a suite (king bed in one room + living room / kitchenette in another room) which wasn't expected. The suite was spacious in the bedroom and living room. The bathroom was a bit on the smaller side, but didn't bother too much. Rooms in the suite were all extremely clean and put together. Service - We stayed at the hotel for only two nights, but all hotel employees that we encountered were extremely friendly and accommodating. We did not ask for housekeeping during the day after our first night since we arrived late and were in the hotel during the day. Housekeeping noticed and called the room to make sure that we did not need service and asked if we needed clean towels - a gesture not seen at many comparable hotels. Amenities - Parking ($25 per night - self-park or valet) was readily available immediately next to the hotel for convenient access. The lot is spacious and there were plenty of spots. The main downside of this hotel was lack of a couple amenities. I believe that they are doing some type of renovation, so the closure should be temporary. The fitness center was closed and the onsite laundry was temporarily unavailable for repairs. Also, they are building / renovating something on the outside of the hotel, but I'm not sure what that was. The Luxe does not have a pool which is a downside if looking for some relaxation in busy downtown. In the end, I would definitely consider staying at Luxe City Center next time I am in the area. The stay was great. If with family or wanting a pool, I might consider elsewhere that actually has a pool though.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pegram, TN", "Title": "\u201cGetting better and better\u201d", "Author": "rockstar89", "ReviewID": "UR126098587", "Content": "Stayed here on multiple visits to Staples Center and gets better every time.

They did have an awesome coffee maker, where you could make yourself a single cup of coffee or tea. We were also provided with 2 bottles of water daily, and mints in the evening. The very best part was how comfy the bed was (we slept great!), complete with plenty of pillows, and a shower that was made for tall people--which we are.

Newly renovated with super comfy bed, very chic furniture, comfortable sitting chair, nice energy saving features (that were also very friendly to use), great HD TV, free internet (wireless), and they even had evening turn-down service with chocolates, bottled waters, comfy foam slippers. The room was modern, sophisticated, very user friendly with plugs everywhere for my computer and cell phone, and a very relaxing place to be. Bathroom: A- - Rain shower head!!! with option to switch to hand-held. Previously water pressure was discussed as low - I did not have this problem. The water pressure was perfect. The sink was ultra-modern design and nice to look at but kind of got water everywhere, so not the best functionality. I gave bathroom an A minus because it also lost points for the bathroom products. The body wash and shampoo just kind of seemed watered down; the way the rest of the bathroom looks, I expected better presentation and quality of the bath products. Lobby: D+ - undergoing renovations as previously stated. I only needed it to check-in and meet my colleagues, but the smell of paint was pretty strong. I am sure it will get better once finished, but for right now, it's a mess and not very welcoming. Check-In: C - I'm being nitpicky here, but especially with a not pretty lobby they should want to move people through. I had to wait about 10 minutes to be helped...and I was 2nd in line. There were another 4 people behind me. Finally, the agent at the desk asked for help and 3 other agents started checking people in. For a de\"Luxe\" hotel (I had to sneak at least one of those in my review), I would expect that help should not have to be asked for - people should be monitoring that. And if nobody is monitoring, then the agent should be more proactive about asking for help before a long line forms. Location: A - right across the street from Nokia Theatre and Staples Center, easy walk to all downtown locations. The subway is a 5-10 minute walk (depending on how fast or slow you go). I had taken Amtrak to Union Station and it was a $15 cab ride to the hotel. I took the subway back and it was a faster ride (if you exclude walk to subway) and only $1.50. OVERALL: B+ - Overall, the experience is almost an A, mostly because of the most important part of a hotel for me, which is the room itself. And the room at the Luxe is incredible. They did it right, in my opinion, with the upgrade to what used to be a Holiday Inn. They did the rooms first and are doing the rest later. I hate it when a hotel has a beautiful lobby but the rooms are old and dingy - it almost feels like false advertising. But at the Luxe, they took care of the guest first and are redoing the rest now. I do wish the place had a pool.

The room was clean, the bathroom is very nice and has nice amenities including extra's like bathrobes and slippers. I had a safe and a minibar. My colleagues did not have a minibar. That's good and bad because they make you sign a statement that you will have to pay about $50 restocking if you put anything of your own in the mini bar. There was no room service menu. The only chair to sit on was the desk chair. The stylish brown chair and ottoman in the photos was not in room. The internet was very slow and I could not send larger files via email to my colleagues. Location is very good. Elevators are slow and there are only 2 of them. There is one at the back of the hotel that goes to the garage - however an employee told me I was not supposed to be using it because it was for employees. There was frequently a backup at the front desk as people tried to check in, check out, get new keys, etc.. and there were not enough clerks to help so we had to wait quite a bit. The employees were nice and polite at the front desk given how many people they had to serve.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peachtree City, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAverage, but really, so much more than that.\u201d", "Author": "MisterP723", "ReviewID": "UR118037735", "Content": "It sounds as if \"Inside Track\" had some personal issues with this hotel, and that's too bad. My wife and I were in town for a USC football game and really enjoyed this hotel. I will agree with all of his positive comments: the rooms are clean, roomy, and nicely furnished, and if you have an event to catch at the Staples Center or the L.A. Convention Center, the location can't be beat-all within easy walking distance, as are several restaurants, bars, a bowling alley (in downtown L.A.!), and even a Ralph's (Kroger) grocery store. Very convenient, and, with a few apartment buildings thrown in, the area appeared to be safe enough to walk in. However, the hotel does have it's downside. It IS undergoing renovation, so be prepared for some inconvenience. The lobby is a little torn up, and the restaurant is closed, but we stayed here when it was a Holiday Inn property, and the renovations were sorely needed. Until the renovations are complete, expect to eat outside the hotel, but with so much available right outside your door, in the long run, who really cares? Also, as was mentioned in the other review, the $25 parking fee is a little cheezy. When your parking fee per night is more than the rental car per day, there's a problem. It's just nickel and diming. lnclude the parking fee in the price of the room reservation, for Pete's sake! Also, the lack of a refrigerator for personal use is wrong. Nobody sane is going to buy a $5 coke or a $9 tin of licorice. Why not remove the in-room vending machine and replace it with a refrigerator that can be stocked with what l want, if I want to stock it? After all, there IS a grocery store down the street! Finally, we had issues controlling the temperature with the A/C unit, but it may not have been their fault. The daytime was too cold, and the nights were very stuffy. I don't think there are very many air conditioning units that can keep up with 85\u00c2\u00b0 temps during the day and 50\u00c2\u00b0 temps at night, but it sure would be nice if they could find one.

You can't beat the location - you definitely do not need a car if you will be staying in the downtown area for the duration of your stay, which is saying something in Los Angeles! We were a bit apprehensive upon check in - like many others here, we had not been informed that the pool, fitness center, restaurant, room service etc would not be available for the duration of our stay, which would have affected our choice of hotel considering we were on vacation and not business travelers. Also, the hotel is still clearly going through refurbishment - the lobby, elevators and hallways are still all sad looking. However, we were very happy with the room - very modern and clearly new. Bed was comfortable and spacious, the bathroom was well appointed (shower only, which did not bother us) and plenty closet space for a short trip. The room was cleaned regularly and well, but the cleaning staff was very loud - most mornings we woke up to their chatter in the hallway which was very annoying. Room also has free wi-fi which was great. We found front desk service to be fine when we needed a few items and a Federal Express package delivered. We did notice a discrepancy on our checkout for a mini fridge item that we did not use, but it was removed as soon as I pointed it out - just make sure you look at the bill carefully. Despite there being no room service or restaurant, we were fine with the restaurants in the area...you could walk to The Farm or the ESPN Sports Bar or several other places in 3 minutes or less, door to door. The biggest mar on our star thankfully happened during our early morning check out. As we were walking out of the lobby to our car we say them literally locking down the hotel - storm doors coming door, gates being locked...there was a big group of protesters lined up outside and they stared blaring horns and making a lot of noise. We had to be let out of a different entrance to the parking lot and the main one was blocked. Thankfully we were leaving right as it happened, but other guests must have had a rude awakening!

We were back in town in October for an event at Staples Center. The Marriott was booked so we decided to reserve here. Learned that it had changed hands and was being renovated, but Website made no mention of several key issues: there was currently no pool, fitness center, bar, restaurant, room service, or food of any kind at the hotel--no vending machines; empty mini bars. Oh wait--a bowl of apples at the front desk. Granted, LA Live is across the street, and LA Bite will deliver, but still. Charging full-amenity prices ($260 per night) for a hotel with few amenities--not cool. Rooms had been nicely renovated and were pretty comfortable, other than a weird oversized painting of Madonna on the wall. We were relaxing in the room in our pjs after dinner when my daughter looked up and saw an enormous cockroach crawling along the crown moulding. She's a bug-phobe and I'm not, but this bug was scary even to me. Front desk sent a very nice maintenance man to help us change rooms, but when he tried to kill the roach he lost sight of it and it crawled up his arm, then flew right at my face -- creepy! My daughter wanted us to move to the Marriott, which now had rooms available, but it was late and seemed like a lot of hassle at the time. The room to which we were switched was pretty clean but obviously hadn't been used in a while-- It was dusty. The toilet seat was half-detached from the commode, which was a bit of a shock. When I called the front desk to have this fixed (very nice maintenance guy to the rescue again), I was told we would be given 50% off our stay to make up for our negative experiences. That seemed fair as we were staying two nights. My daughter still really wanted to switch hotels, but since they were adjusting the price I thought we should stay. Rest of the stay was okay, although it was hard to sleep thinking about huge cockroaches. Upon checkout, I found that we'd been discounted 50% off one night and charged full price for the second--not what I'd been told. Mentioned this to the clerk, who called the manager. Manager didn't bother to talk to me at all, just told the clerk to call the manager who'd been on duty our first night. This manager, who also didn't bother talking to me, said it was a \"waterbug\", not a cockroach, and we were only to get 50% off the one night. The clerk was polite and apologetic but said there was nothing she could do. Note to managers: One of your primary tasks is customer contact, especially when your guests have problems with their stay. Also, cockroaches are still cockroaches even when you call them waterbugs, and it is not good when they appear in guest areas of your establishment. I called Luxe's corporate offices after I got home and my bill was promptly adjusted to what I had been offered. Apparently the ownership change is still in progress, and even though Luxe's logo appears everywhere, it's not fully a Luxe property yet.

My company sentenced me to a four night stay at the hotel, and on the second to last night the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front desk staff claim the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DWP cut power to the building until what coworkers said was 2-4am. The hotel still had lights in the lobby and hallways, as well as a functioning elevator. Unfortunately they lacked any generator to power the guest rooms. I left for the night and went to a hotel across the street. At checkout it was a struggle trying to convince the hotel not to charge me for parking as I did not park my car at the hotel that night. Apparently they have no way to check their parking garage, and instead take your word for it. The staff, whether holdovers from the previous incarnation or not, seemed to still possess a Holiday Inn mentality. At check-in the front desk clerk got snippy with me when I requested additional room keys because of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s system that powers the guest room lights and air conditioner. I also found that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d keep the key in the sensor to continue running electricity in the room, but the staff would apparently stop by rooms to remove the key and place it just above the sensor. So, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d return and no lights would work and the room would be in the mid 70s -vs- the 60s I set it for. The bedding albeit nice, was dirty and appeared to have blood or other heavy stains soaked into them, that continue to be washed and cycled through guests. The 16x9 lcd screen was a waste, as they had no true HD programming available. So all the money spent on the new TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is only wasted on programming that is grainy, distorted and lacks the correct aspect ratio. Funny that for a hotel directly across the street from ESPN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest HD studio, the ESPN signal received at the hotel looks awful. The bathroom and shower were very modern and you could tell they were recently renovated. Though I found the sink to be awkward. The sink design is rooted more in style than function. The entire bathroom countertop becomes a pool in water that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it to the sink. For something as simple as washing hands or brushing teeth. The sink\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faucet is even worse it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough to find the right temperature without defined controls. The shower design is modern and stylish and a departure from bath/shower combos. It features a selectable rain water, or handheld showerhead. The water pressure was weak, almost laughable. Internet was free, and at decent speeds, parking was $25 for self park (July 2010) in a garage littered with renovation construction materials.

The business center was fine, 2 computers available and we never had to wait. We used the valet parking option, the cost to park is $25 a day whether you valet or self park. That rate is not bad but added to the higher room rates it does add up. The staff was very nice, no problems there. We were disappointed that they didn't really have any sort of gift shop. They do have a ticket broker and in that space they sell a few larger priced jerseys etc. Since it was pouring down rain the entire weekend we did not use or even see the pool.

It has a fairly good restaurant with booths that have individual TVs at each booth for solo travellers to stay entertained while waiting for your food. It is very convenient to the LA Metro trains.

I felt very safe in the hotel; security was top notch. The Bad: We were a little confused on how to get here. The street starts out as a two way street, then changes to one way right in front of the hotel, so that threw us for a loop (or two) a few times. There is a new building being constructed across the street, but the view should be better once it's complete. Staples Center is near, which can be good if you're attending something there, but we did not realize that a championship game between the Lakers and Spurs was going on the first night of our stay, so it was kind of packed in the lobby and bar, but we probably should have researched that. The Ugly: Paper thin walls. So, at just after midnight, there are kids screaming and running up and down the halls. The headboard of the bed next door (or maybe it was from upstairs) banged against our wall for about ten minutes. The customer service is terrible. We've called the front desk several times and rarely get an answer. Going to a Dodgers game, we asked the attendant to hail us a cab. What pulled up was a REALLY nice luxury sedan. The attendant said this to us: \"Oh, here is our hotel's courtesy taxi. Enjoy your game!\" Now, there were three of us, and we all heard that. So, we get dropped off at the farthest place possible at the stadium, and as we get out of the car, the driver tells us that its a $30 charge. So much for a courtesy taxi. Game was awesome, we call back to the hotel just shy of 9pm, asking for their \"courtesy\" taxi to come pick us up. She tells us that they have no courtesy taxis, just a taxi company they have a contract with and \"every employee here KNOWS that.\" Then she says that all of the drivers have gone home for the day, so we should just call another taxi company. Then click. Didn't offer to call a company for us, much less give us the numbers to one. So its raining outside, and we found a cab parked MUCH closer to the stadium, and it was only $11 from the stadium to the hotel. This was even after we were stuck in traffic for a while.

Got a good rate ($159/night) which - along with the convenient location - was a major factor in where I chose to stay. I found this hotel to be a good enough value to warrant another stay should I need ready access to the Convention Center and have to watch the budget. It is a five minute walk to the Convention Center; just on the other side of the Staples Center. It's not an attractive area, but didn't seem too bad . . . more construction than homeless. The nearest restaurants are several blocks away. There is not much in the immediate vicinity. So, it may be best to stay elsewhere if being close to the Convention Center or Staples Center isn't critical. The public spaces are generally kept clean, and so the hotel made a positive first impression despite the modest decor. As a Priority Club Member, I was upgraded to a larger room with free newspaper, free bottled water, and a discount for all food/drink purchases. (Membership is free and does not require a prior stay - so I'd recommend signing up before arrival.) The room was large and clean. Yes, the furniture had some stains, the carpet was far from new, and the beds were doubles (not queens). But it was a very acceptable living and working space. The internet access is free - although not wireless. The connection (via an ethernet cord they provide) worked perfectly every single time. Just boot up and go - no need to go through a registration site. For those who are frequent business travelers, reliable connectivity is always appreciated. I never had a problem getting on-line, and the connection is fast. The work space was quite acceptable; large desk and two chairs. Good lighting and a phone. (Also a phone by the bed.) I ate several meals there, both room service and restaurant. The room service was always on time or early. Okay, so they cooked my burger medium rare instead of medium - and there were a few other minor hiccups such as that. However, overall, good quality and quantity (e.g., salads, burgers, and appetizers); above average and reasonably priced. Staff was very courteous and professional, at a level that is above average at this tier of hotel. There is a sports bar, small convenience shop, and pool on site - but I didn't get to use them. One complaint is not unique to this hotel: getting a hired car when one had merely requested a taxi. I had asked the front desk to arrange a taxi to the airport; arranged the night before a 6am flight. The staff will always tell you the costs are similar. Don't believe it - the hired car (a Lincoln Navigator in this case) was $8 more to get to the airport. ($50 versus the $42 flat rate the LA taxi commission charges to go from downtown to LAX.) In summary, this hotel is a good option if value and convenience are important.

My number one criterion for a hotel is cleanliness. The room was sparkling when we arrived and was kept sparkling throughout. The housekeeping staff was excellent; very detail oriented. My next criterion is price-- and to spend $119 per night plus tax (AAA rate on the website) for an LA hotel right across the street from the Staples Center is a true bargain. However, I do wonder what will happen to prices when the construction across the street is finished in 2007. In spite of the constant traffic along Figueroa and the construction site across the street, our room on the backside of the hotel was quiet. Noisy guests weren't a problem either. I found the pool area a very pleasant place to sit (even with the exhaust fumes and traffic noise). The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel restaurant was so-so; we used it for breakfast. My one complain would be about the chairs in the room -- two of the most uncomfortable pieces of furniture I have ever had the misfourtune to sit on; that is why I went outside to sit! As for convenient, let me enumerate, First, it is walking distance to the Staples Center and the Convention Center (which is a huge, huge complex stretching over a couple of LA city blocks). Second is the 25 cent (free with a valid Metro ticket) DASH buses that criss-cross the downtown area, Chinatown and Little Tokyo. There is a stop near the hotel and it is a great way to travel and tour the downtown area. The hotel is also walking distance to both the blue line and the red line of the Metro system. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel --everything from greasy spoons to five star dining. The 7+Fig shopping mall is a five minute walk from the hotel.", "Date": "August 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "bay area", "Title": "\u201cNot so great\u201d", "Author": "NoTellin", "ReviewID": "UR5610092", "Content": "This hotel caters to convention goers/business people.

The restaurant service was below average in general. The pool is right next to the bar, on display, and there zero shade. It's also tiny. The hotel is not in a safe location.

I'd definitely recommend this hotel! In my opinion, if you are looking for a cheap and nice hotel for an event at Staples Center this is a great choice for location and price. Tip: if you reserve your room online (on the Holiday Inn website), you can get the AAA rate which is only $119 compared to $140 a night. We do have an AAA card, but were never asked to show it at the front desk. A side note: the taxi ride we took from Holiday Inn to LAX was in a Lincoln Navigator and the cost was $45 plus tip. We took the \"super shuttle\" from LAX to Holiday Inn for $15 each ($30 total plus tip) and honestly I wasn't impressed. They make 2 trips around the airport and pack in as many people as possible in the van.

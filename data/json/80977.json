{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Skid Row Location - Motel is rated corrected at 1 star I was forced due to circumstances (had to take our dog along) to make reservations at this Motel 6. The motel rates around the bottom of the pile which is actually pretty accurate - it definately could use some sprucing up but I'm not so sure that's possible.Here's a list of things that we noticed about this place - first the good stuff:1) Staff was friendly and helpful - even they admitted up front that the location is not exactly the best. (see bad stuff below for a bit more on this topic.)2) Motel (dog friendly), parking convenient, our room was clean, beds comfortable, TV and shower worked and the room doors locked. This is the extent of the security.Here's the other side of the story.. bad stuff:1) Absolutely the worst location in San Francisco - this is a skid row front seat from your room window. Homeless folks, drug addicts, drunks, pimps and hookers abound - they are everywhere (inside and outside of the motel) I mean everywhere! I have pictures if yer interested - write me.2) These are some mean streets - the motel sits on the corner of Geary and Larkin, next door is a strip joint - across the street there's a flop house, seedy bars and liquor stores - people are literally using the street and sidewalks as toilets and barf bags.. it's really bad - really!3) Noisy - big time noisy! The streets are so loud (sirens, cars, trucks, people yelling) that we forgot about getting any sleep and just hung out of our third floor window and watched the hooking and drug dealing, pimping, pandering and a variety of sex acts in public on the streets below - actually was better then Tru TV when I think about it.4) Smoky - if you smoke no big deal - we don't... even though we had a non smoking room (which reeked of smoke anyway)the place is so full of smokers that it permeates everything.. our clothes all smelled like smoke when we got home.5) The pictures of the lobby and room are dolled up to make them look bigger and nicer then they are - they are ok, mind you, but not as depicted on web sites.If you don't mind sharing the elevator with drunks, prositutes, drug dealers and 'hypes', taking your life in your hands when you go outside, risking getting your car broken into or just laying awake in a noisy, smoke filled environment then this is just the place for you.. do yourself a favor and leave yer kids at home but bring the Marines and some body armor with you to this one.", "Date": "Sep 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR185801111", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "StefaniesDad"}, {"Content": "Nice Motel...

Well, not this one -- If you're used to staying in Motel 6's, YOU WILL GET BURNED. This was just recently RE-BRANDED as a Motel 6; it used to be a Day's Inn. All they did was change the sign and slop on some paint.I read the other reviews and can't believe the level of naivete. Pretty funny. Can't we just call this place what it is: a skid-row flop-house and by the hour motel used by prostitutes? Oh yeah, and there happens to be a few tourists and business travelers there, the unlucky ones fooled by the Motel 6 website, which lists this as a new motel.I had to smile upon reading other reviewers' mention of drop-outs and weird people around this motel. This M-6 is in the very heart of the Tenderloin, SF's infamous skid-row. Many, if not most of the street people you see are HARD-CORE methampetamine and crack cocaine addicts, OK? Some have recently been released from prison or half-way houses. That makes them a just a tad more dangerous than just being weird. Yes, for the most part, if they see you're not drunk or very stupid you will be left alone. But they WILL rob you or get violent if they think they can get away with it.Of course there are some good points. Because this was a Day's Inn, some of the rooms are slightly larger than what you'll usually find at a 6. I really enjoyed the two large outdoor decks on the second story -- fairly secluded and peaceful, especially when you consider the motel's location. Another significant advantage here is the free parking. Comparable places charge $20+ per day for parking. And yes, the location is great for many reasons: right on Geary and Van Ness, SF's main drags; fun, safe neighborhoods are within walking distance (just head north instead of south). Dozens of dive bars and affordable restaurants nearby.But at $80+ per night, I don't see much use in staying here. I could imagine a group of young guys partying here, like for a bachelor party or something. You could get pretty roudy and it would be acceptable. Other than that scenario, I would avoid like the plague. This dump is absolutely NOT APPROPRIATE for families, couples, or women traveling alone.", "Date": "Dec 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR813809699", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Gimmeshelter76"}, {"Content": "TRUST ME, you don't want to stay here. This hotel desperately needs a major renovation.The place is just horrible, the coridors are dark and dismal.

The hotels near Fisherman's Wharf are more than double the price of this Days Inn.I wouldn't recommended this hotel if vagrants intimidate you. There are lots on the street outside. However, they are harmless and didn't hassle us. The location is not in the most desirable area, but I did not consider it dangerous.The front desk staff were polite and efficient.The room was clean and functional. There was some internal remodelling work going on while we were there, although I couldn't see any proper evidence of what was being done.The rooms have internal front doors and the lift can only be accessed from the ground floor with a key card.The hotel offers free parking, which for a hotel in central SF was a bonus. We had no trouble parking, but we were there over the quiet Christmas holiday.The breakfast at this hotel is limited to donughts and muffins and coffee and juice. There are also complimentary copies of USA Today.Union Square is around a 15 minute walk from the hotel. We generally travelled around the city by bus, and there is a bus stop (which has services to Fisherman's Wharf) only a couple of blocks away.", "Date": "Jan 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR829544090", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Loulabelle44"}, {"Content": "\"Theatre District\" location is a little misleading Beware.

Very central location for exploring SanFrancisco on foot, but always turn right on leaving the hotel. We made the mistake of turning left onto Larkin and felt uneasy at all the drop outs and weirdos we encountered (even worse on Market Street, between Larkin and cable car terminus).However, after this inital mistake we only turned right and found the location to be okay. Room on 2nd floor was spacious and clean, with small but functional bathroom. Breakfast was served in the reception area for taking back to your room and it was quite good.

We stayed at this hotel in June of 2004. We were traveling with 4 adults so when I made the reservation about a month before the trip I asked about the rooms to find out about what type of room would be best for 4 people. They said they had a 1 bedroom suite with a separate bedroom with a queen bed and another queen bed in the other area. I thought it sounded perfect and would give my husband and I a little privacy from our friends. Let me tell you this was nothing like I had imagined it from the description. There was no bedroom, not even close. You walk in and there is a bathroom on your right and a wall on your left and a bed on the right next to the bathroom. Then right on the other side of the wall is the other bed. How is that a one bedroom suite?? There was half a wall separating it from the other bed. Anyway, I was extremely upset and it just got worse the more I looked over the room. The second bed wasn't even a full queen, more like a full size bed. There is no way 2 adults could sleep in it comfortably. The room was filthy and smelled like someone had been smoking in it all night. This was their NON-smoking room. Of course I complained to the front desk clerk but she didnt take my reservation so she didnt understand why I was told it was a 1 bedroom suite. She offered to move us to a smaller room, one that probably didnt smell like smoke. It was a smaller room and just your standard hotel room with two queens very close together. We decided to drive around and see if we could find something better. Unfortuantely most everything was booked on such short notice, some kind of convention was in town. We were tierd and didnt want to waste our vacation time driving all over so we just decided to rough it. It really made the trip so uncomfortable and I was really disappointed. Also, do not be fooled by the pictures of the hotel. It looks absolutely nothing like the picture. They must have worked very hard to get the best possible angle and of course it was taken at night so it doesnt look so bad. There were many other really nice hotels we checked out when we drove around and next time will reserve a room at one of those hotels. Do not stay at this hotel unless you like stinky dirty uncomfortable rooms.", "Date": "Mar 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR250212816", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "So-so experience. Went there on 2003 for the Chinese New Year Parade. I got a horrible view from the window. Mostly another wall. Maybe due to this, the room looks n feel gritty. It's also quite dark and unwelcoming. Still, the staff was friendly and I didn't check out the breakfast. The breakfast area didn't look too great either. The best part of this place is the location and free parking.

When I first arrived, the desk clerk was away from the desk. I had to wait about 5 minutes outside before he came back. After the wait, check-in went smoothly. I went up to my room to discover there were no towels in my room. I told the clerk and he acted like it was a bother for him to do anything about it. But to his credit, the towels were in the room when I returned from dinner. Later that evening, I went down the hall to buy a drink out of the drink machine. The one on my floor didn't work so I went to the other floors. None of the drink machines in the hotel worked. And there weren't any Out of Order signs on any of them. When I was taking a shower the next morning, I noticed hair from a previous guest in the shower. I proceeded to check out as quickly as I could. On the way out, I checked out the continental breakfast. It was ok. There were muffins and croissants. Nothing special. The best things about this hotel are the free parking (virtually nonexistant in the city) and the location. There is a garage for guests only underneath the hotel. It was nice to not have to worry about finding a spot and paying a fortune for it.

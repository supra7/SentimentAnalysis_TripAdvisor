Our travel agent booked a package which included the Express Start Breakfast and seven nights free parking with shuttle service to the Baltimore Cruise Terminal the next morning. Our cruise was 12 nights; we paid an additional $5 parking per day for parking for the remaining 7 nights. This was a nominal charge for secured parking in a gated area along the side of the hotel, accessible with the room key. Additional parking is available in the back of the hotel in a large lot, also the location of the outdoor pool. Leon ensured a smooth check-in. We registered for a 10:30 a.m. shuttle with our 5 checked bags. Shuttle service also is provided to the Inner Harbor every 30 minutes. It is suggested that guests not walk to the Inner Harbor or M&T Bank Stadium, even though these venues are within walking distance. We walked around the property and found a paved path one block away for exercise purposes. We did not use the path the following morning but opted for the Fitness Center. The hotel is in a commercial and industrial area. Several gas stations (BP, Shell, Exxon) are very near the hotel. Exxon sells Subway and the BP sells gyros. Room 434 is a non-smoking room with two queen beds overlooking Russell St. We were not bothered by street noise but, rather, entertained by a diverse parade of passersby. The hotel is a \u201cre-launched\u201d Holiday Inn property, decorated in neutral colors. The room (and hallways) are well lit with a spacious desk and internet port. There is a refrigerator but no microwave, which we are accustomed to having in all HIEX properties. We found a powerful microwave at the end of the hall in the \u201cPriority Club Lounge,\u201d available to any guest with a room key. The internet description lists microwave and refrigerator among the amenities \u2013 a little misleading. Our room had great water pressure in the sink and tub. The bath towels were quite rough but not stained; there were plenty of towels and washcloths. The beds were very comfortable with four pillows and triple sheeting with a duvet. The bathroom had the usual amenities: two bars of soap; shampoo, conditioner and lotion. There is a grab bar in the tub and a curved shower rod. The room has a flat screen LG TV and a four-cup Hamilton Beach coffee pot with a deep basket. I mention this feature since we prefer to bring our own filters and coffee. There is a nice lounge area in the lobby and the largest breakfast area I\u2019ve ever seen in a HIEX including two large flat-screen TV\u2019s at one end of the room and several smaller flat-screen TV\u2019s above the tables for two on the room\u2019s perimeter. Other public spaces include one nice-sized meeting room with round tables and one smaller meeting room. Also available is a well-stocked display of brochures for area attractions and transportation. The Fitness Room is available 24/7 including one universal weight machine, two treadmills, a stair stepper and 2 TV\u2019s. The Business Center, also available 24/7, has two computers and a printer. I was able to access the Cruise Critic and TripAdvisor websites with no problem. We departed the hotel at 11:00 a.m. on March 19 and arrived at the port at 11:10 a.m. Since there were several cruisers at the hotel, one van held the luggage while passengers went in a separate vehicle. Hotel personnel took charge of the bags and handed them off to the port handlers. Be certain to keep your carry-on with you in the van or it may go to the ship as part of the checked bags. We had a business card to call the hotel after the cruise. Hint: store the phone number in your cell phone; on disembarkation day, the port is congested and busy with many cruisers and their luggage with no time to search for the business card. We were off the ship (Royal Caribbean\u2019s Enchantment of the Seas) by 9:20 a.m. We waited 30 minutes for the shuttle, a normal wait time. There is only one way for vehicles to enter the port parking area so it is easy to see the shuttle arrive. You may need to walk to the end of the parking lot with your luggage if the driver is not able to park directly in front of the \u2018pick up lot.\u2019 We arrived at the hotel at 10:20. After loading our luggage in the car, a restroom break, and a cup of coffee, we were in our car by 10:45 a.m. I can recommend this HIEX for a comfortable stay, reasonable rate, free breakfast, free parking for seven days and an \u201cexpress\u201d shuttle to the pier.

The hotel itself has clean, nice rooms with large t.v.s, mini fridge, coffee maker and hair dryer. The walls are a little thin so you can hear people talking in the next room. If you're a light sleeper and happen to get a room next to someone loud - it isn't going to be good. They have a shuttle every hour to the Inner Harbor which is a very nice amenity for tourists. The breakfast room is large with the standard free breakfast. The only suggestion I would make is that they put microwaves in the rooms as a convenience.

I used 123stay.com to book this hotel and to get the 7-day free parking (park and cruise). I looked at a lot of options and the consistent issues among ALL the hotels shuttling to the ports was difficulties with the shuttle. So, I ruled out the hotels near the airport and took the Holiday Inn Express neart the Stadium so that if any problems occurred, the cab rides would be inexpensive. TIP: We tried to book directly with Holiday Inn using points, but they charged a fortune for the parking. The best rate was through 123stay.com. I registered with their site, had no problems with them. and their Instructions were good, The hotel had their reservation, All done via the Internet. And, I had a printoff with the reservation number. LOCATION: This is at 1701 Russell Street. A GPS was essential, and will still benefited from printing off a mapquest street map because it's hard to envision that I-295 heading north dumped right onto Russell Street. You don't want to get on the wrong road spurs and head across bridges, etc. The area is a bit industrial and no restaurants nearby except a Subway across the street. Eat before you arrive or plan an excursion and bring along your maps. On the way to the ships, we passed the Stadium. It really seems within walking distance, but not particularly good for walking alongside the roads. Heed other reviews if you are going to the stadiium. THE ROOM: Clean, quiet. And, really that's all of what we needed for this overnight stay. Our room was small and overlooked the gated parking lot. The TV was old, and the bathroom was clean. The sink was outside the BR in the hallway. Good towels. Two queen beds, good mattress, and a ton of pillows for each bed. No hallway noises. This might be different if there's a game at the stadium, so sometimes, maybe you can ask for a quiet room. Maybe some other reviews mention which ones. I think we had to bring all our luggage up to the room. There was no option to store it downstairs. THE BREAKFAST: This was just fine. The night before, we heated some microwave dinners in the oven by the soda machines and sat in that room. Better than eating in the room. The food was a hot breakfast, nice selection of breakfast things. Good coffee, juices, yogurts. THE STAFF: The night-staff person on duty was new, but was handling numerous requests with politeness and calm and clear instructions. Most people were concerned about the shuttles to the boats the next morning.. Obviously, they too had read a lot of reports for the hotels offering the park and cruise. THE SHUTTLE to the boats. They handed out a small instruction note, gave us a choice of shuttle times available. I do think you should do that on arrival or before if they'll allow it. They used two shuttle buses per run. One had the luggage, the other the people. TIP: The vans are a bit hard to get into if you've got any handicap --especially if those front runners take all the good seats leaving YOU to the hard-to-get-to back seat. AAAaaargh. If you've got problems, I suggest alerting the driver, give him you tip early and ask to board first. True to their word, we never saw the luggage again until it appeared in the ship's stateroom. TIP: Make sure you understand where the van will pick you up after your cruise or event and make sure they have a cell phone number for you if they can't find you after you've called for a pickup. PARKING LOT: Locked and lit. I was confortable leaving the car there. They give you a card or a code to get in. To get out, the gates open automatically as you approach them.

Room was typical but clean, comfy and all that we expected. The only bummer is that there really is absolutely nothing within walking distance - no where to take a walk or get an ice cream. You can certainly walk back from the stadiums during the day (my 16 year old daughter and I did), but we left before the end of the race and there weren't a lot of people about and it wasn't the most comfortable walk I've ever taken with another woman (and I am a former New Yorker).

It would require several trips back and forth between the hotel and convention center. We had a situation in our group that necessitated reliable transportation because long distance walks were not possible. We made two phone calls directly to the property to make certain that we had a CLEAR understanding of the shuttle service before we booked. Upon arrival - we learned that what we were told was not correct - and in fact - were told that THEY would never have give us THOSE details - it must have been a rep from corporate that gave us the wrong information. Upon check in - we were told that the shuttle only runs once each hour - and only the first 13 people that sign up can get on it. When we asked if we could have a cab called - we were told \"Oh Friday - it takes at least a half of an hour to get a cab over here\". We were also told that the shuttle would NOT be available for from 10 - 1 on Saturday, because they would only be taking 'cruise' people to their port during that time. We were given a card with a number to call for pickup when we went out on Friday night. We we called for pickup, we were told - the shuttle only makes 2 stops - one at the convention center (at a specified corner) and one at the aquarium. The website and corporate BOTH say that the shuttle takes you anyplace in a 3 mile radius inside of the city. Needing a ride - we agreed to meet the shuttle at the convention center and were told ....\"Start waiting at 8 o'clock - he'll be there eventually\". When it arrived - the only way that our party of 6 would fit - is if we 'stacked' people. Within another block - he stopped again to pick up 2 more folks. The driver said - don't worry - I am getting you all in there! I believe that we ended up with at least 16 people in back of the shuttle van - children stacked on parents. There is NOTHING to do around this property. If you would like to pop out to grab a bite to eat - there is nothing here. Before making reservations were told that if you had to walk to the convention center - it would be about 20 minutes. Absolutely no way - nor would you want to. There are desserted lots - and underpasses that you would have to walk past and thru - They did offer (eventually) to 'try and have transportation available there on Saturday during the otherwise unavailable hours....but they could not guarantee it\". Not what we needed. Our exit was not lovely - but we did not stay at the property. With assistance from the Priority Club (NOT the front desk staff) - we moved to the Holiday Inn, Inner Harbor (which was very lovely). The room at this property was not above average - and the view that we had of the highway was not the best. Trains could be heard in the short time that we spent in the room. The bathroom was TINY. The property did not look new in any way. So - if you are there to attend a game and need only to walk to the stadium - book today! If you need reliable transportation to the convention center (or anywhere else) and you were planning to use THIS hotel's shuttle service - think again. We had never been in Baltimore before - and chose this hotel because the advertised shuttle service APPEARED to meet our needs - it did not.

My main gripe was that when I called (all three times) I specifically asked if this was the Holiday Inn right at the Camden Yards that you can see about 1.5 blocks away. I was assured by three separate people that yes, it was. We followed our directions to the hotel and we both felt we were going in the wrong direction. We arrived and my fiance said this is the wrong hotel (and he was not happy). We went in and asked the lady at the desk and she said there was one closer...it is called Holiday Inn at Inner Harbour; this one was Holiday Inn at the Stadiums. So we were somewhat upset since the main reason we wanted the hotel was so we could walk back and forth to Camden Yards and use our restroom since they are few and far between before they open the gates. The lady said we have a shuttle or you can also walk. We opted to take the shuttle (and was glad we did) and I was baffled by how you could walk on the highway with no pedestrian area. When we got back I asked her about that...she said you don't take the highway, you take the street in back and walk straight down the street. In any event, the shuttle worked fine, except the last run was at 10:00 PM so we missed the end of our baseball game. The other thing that got messed up was our dinner. Since we had to leave the game early and wanted to go somewhere nice to eat, we couldn't because of the shuttle; the food we got at the game that night wasn't that good. The hotel has frozen dinners and a microwave so we thought we would do that...then the fiance suggested we just order a pizza...which we did, but luckily we did so by 10:30 PM cause that is when they close. All in all the hotel, room, free breakfast, staff, shuttle bus driver were all excellent. It would be nice if they offered late runs on game nights and have several delivery places that deliver at least until 11:00 PM. Our view was the man that wanted to clean windows and a vacant lot being demolished. He seemed very non threatening and was just trying to get some money for doing some work. We actually saw more homeless and people begging around the Convention Center. We have reservations at the other Holiday Inn at Inner Harbor in two weeks...the one right at Camden Yards...and I will be anxious to compare the two. There is a Royal Farms being built across the street, which will be good. If they increase the shuttle times to later in the evening so we can watch the full game, it will make a difference on whether we stay there again.

The room was extremely clean and the hotel staff was really nice as it is a new hotel but we did not feel safe outside the hotel I guess thats why the parking is closed in by spiked gates. Would definitely visit Baltimore again but remember stadiums are usually in bad areas of town which is true in this case, next time we will stay at the Renaissance Harborplace right in the middle of the action and just take a cab to the game otherwise cabs back and forth to Little Italy and the Harbor get quite expensive..", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canfield, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Scary Neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "loveguru", "ReviewID": "UR15060899", "Content": "Very nice hotel, very new, lovely rooms.

Plus the rate was $40 dollars less! The decor was new, our room was spacious and a full line up of TV channels, which is rare on our bigger city trips...Breakast was free and a good variety of hot food. The hostess was very helpful and Tiffany at the Front desk gave us some great dinner recommendations....one of which was Fogo De Chao, which was an amazing Brazialian Steakhouse across from the Aquarium...and the shuttle dropped us off right at the door to it!

I took few shots of my room, which had everything I needed. It was quiet, super clean, with the new modern furniture, good selection of cable channels, lovely bed with soft sheets, full size mirror (important!), good-size working desk, etc. The bathroom is not very big but perfectly suits to a single traveler. It has all the amenities you need. Ladies will certainly appreciate the big mirror (again), good lighting and plenty of counter space. The business center has 2 computers with medium internet speed. This time I drove my own car, so I liked that the parking was gated and they had a security guy on at night. The front desk was efficient.

We checked in with no problems, the desk was helpful gave us area menus and told us that there was a liquor store that would deliver wine to the hotel if we called and ordered. We got to our room and we were pleasantly surprised the rooms were immaculate, the furnishings and pictures on the wall were very nice. The room we had overlooked the pool. We spent a couple of days by the pool, it was extremely hot the week we were here. The stadium is only a two minute shuttle ride. The shuttle runs on the hour, it is very convenient, you just have to be in the lobby by the hour you wish to go anywhere and then you call them 15 minutes before the hour you want to be picked up. They would drop us at the aquarium in the inner harbor and pick us up at the same place when we called. This was very convenient and the drivers were very friendly and informative. We thought the breakfast was very good , we never ran out of anything and let me tell you by the time we were leaving on friday, the place was full because the redsox were in town. All in All I have to say we would definately stay here again, we never felt unsafe.

IN fact, it is just one of the best business class hotels I've stayed in ever! The property appears to be very new and it shows. As you arrive the attractive and modern lobby greets you. The staff here are extremely friendly and I was checked in to my room within minutes. The hotel offers covered, secure parking right at the hotel, however they do charge $10 per day for it. (Probably my only complaint about this hotel). But I guess every property in downtown Baltimore charges for parking.The rooms themselves are much nice than the HI Express nameplate or room price let on. Plush, comfortable beds, stylish furniture and work area, granite counters in the bathroom are all some of the things that make this a great hotel room. The free Hi-Speed internet access is very fast, and the air-con worked very well. The room is a tad on the small size, but for a solo our couple traveler, it is just fine. There are many other perks that make this a great hotel. There is a very nice workout room and pool. On Tuesday night there was a free managers reception just off the lobby that offered free food and drinks including beer. On Wednesday nights there is a free reception for priority club members in their dedicated priority club lounge on the 4th floor. This lounge for members has a large screen TV and nightly soda, water, and snacks. One small gripe about the hotel is the location. The website and hotel brouchures claim the hotel is only 1 mile from the Inner Harbour and Convention Center. That might be stretching things a bit. The hotel is about 3 miles through a not so great neighboorhood. But, the hotel offers a free shuttle to anywhere downtown and back, or taxi cabs run about $7 plus tip. All in all, me or my fellow travelers can't say enough about this hotel.

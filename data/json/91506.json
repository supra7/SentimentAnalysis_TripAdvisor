I called and asked if they were handicapped accessible as my parents are both elderly and do not do stairs. The person at the desk stated that they were. When we arrived, we found that all the two bed rooms were up an outside flight of wooden stairs. As it was raining and slick, it was impossible for them to use the rooms we booked. They were relocated in a ground floor one bed apartment, but it was some distance from the room we were in. The rooms themselves were clean and nice. The two bed room we stayed in had a pull down bed on the main level. A standard bed was located in a loft area with its own bathroom. A curtain separated the bed/dinning area from the main sitting area.It was very much like a small efficiency apartment. The fireplace was wood burning and we did not use it, but there are several stores nearby where a paper log could have been purchased. We used the pull down bed as hubby was afraid we'd fall down the open stair in the middle of the night and it was about as comfortable as the average sleeper sofa. There were plenty of blankets and pillows. We had no trouble with the internet and tv. Room temperature was comfortable and could be adjusted, The free breakfast was located in the main\"clubhouse\" area and again it was not handicapped accessible. It was located up a flight of stairs. It had a good selection of items and a generous supply. I took plates of breakfast items over to Mom and Dad and we made coffee in their kitchen and ate around the breakfast area in privacy. My recommendation is -if you do not need two beds opt for the single bed rooms. It is a bit off the main street area and may be hard to locate. We had no problem with noise during the night, but ran into Monday morning garbage pick-up around 7 am. Not a problem for early risers, but may be annoying if you want to sleep in.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cThe Bates-House Suites\u201d", "Author": "Christopher M", "ReviewID": "UR121815063", "Content": "My first impression was that we got a great deal. The room was big, had a full kitchen, and seemed like it would be comfortable enough to get a decent nights sleep. After visiting my niece at Riley's hospital in downtown Indianapolis, we were ready to fall straight asleep. The TV was fuzzy and hardly visible. Then when trying to fall asleep, the bed wasn't very comfortable (I am always a very sound sleeper), there was a draft from the wood burning fireplace in the room and I began feeling sick. I turned up the heat a few degrees when I noticed the picture facing the bed kept banging against the wall because of the furnace behind it. That's when it started to get terrifying. I took the picture off of the wall to keep it from banging and waking up my wife and myself revealing a PEEPHOLE. I was thinking to myself, this could not actually be a peephole, but on the back of the picture was a stack of paper towels duct-taped to the back so the biggest peephole just below the picture frame could have a direct line of sight to our bed, without being able to be noticed by the naked eye. My wife asked what was wrong and we looked behind the furnace room, and found a closet to the furnace room with a LOCKED door. Hmmm. We were tempted to break into it, but after thinking what we might find we decided against it. Needless to say, it was 3 am and we just needed a good nights sleep after driving 9 hours that day. All we wanted to do was fall straight asleep. Even if that is all you are planning on doing, do not stay here. We packed our things and fled the property as soon as we could and drove until we found another hotel that we felt safe at. I have a feeling our experience is not the only one, considering the lobby is isolated and has a TV in it, I wouldn't be surprised if someone was keeping a close watch on you there.

There were cobwebs, dust on the couch and what looked like some sort of berry left on the floor in the kitchen. It could have used a bit more cleaning. We got a room with a fireplace and I asked one of the desk-workers if they supplied logs to burn (since this was a wood-burning fireplace instead of a gas) and she said she had no idea and thought that the fireplaces might just be for looks. Only on checkout, when I inquired again, was I told that there were logs you could purchase in the gift shop for $4 each. Breakfast was advertised as being served until 8:30 on the weekdays and 9:30 on weekends. We got there at 9:10 on a weekend morning and most everything was already put away. We got the last two muffins and the only other choices were toast or cold cereal.

We stayed in one of the queen studios (which are at ground level). The hotel is set up \"apartment-style\" with clusters of small buildings (each containing 8 rooms), where the rooms are accessed from outside. The room itself was fine (albeit a little dark), and the bed was good (a little firm for my taste, but not bad). The room consisted of a sitting area (love seat, lamp, small desk, TV, fireplace), a food area (full kitchen, including oven, full size fridge, dishwasher, and table/seating area), sleeping area (bed, nightstands, lamps, sliding door to tiny patio area), and bath area (around a corner from the room, with tub/toilet in separate room). Highlights: Breakfast is pretty decent (although it's essentially the same thing every day, with a few other items rotated in now and then - it got old after a few days of it). Usually had eggs, potatoes, meat (usually sausage), waffles, bagels, cereal, fruit, occasionally biscuits and gravy or french toast, and one day there were doughnuts. Unlike some extended stay hotels, they do come and clean your room every day here. Staff was always friendly when I encountered them (and that included both an early check-in and a maintenance call, as well as daily interaction with housekeeping, since I was working in the room). Convenient location (near lots of stores, etc.) and good price (cheapest Residence Inn in the area). Downside: The property is beginning to show its age (especially on the outside - the insides appear to have been remodeled relatively recently). The toilet in our room actually sprung a leak twice while we were here (the first time was one week into our stay, so they did a temporary fix rather than making us change rooms - the second time was on our last morning). If you get a room on the back side of the property (like we did), you will have a lovely view of the back side of a somewhat run down strip mall. There was a huge gap all the way around the door (worst at the bottom, where the gap was probably about 3/4 inch) that made it so you could hear everything outside. Usually this was not a big problem, except for the night that some people staying at the hotel came home after the bars closed at 2 am and decided to make a bunch of noise out there in the parking lot. There is also an unexplainable sulfur smell in that part of town that we noticed twice while there (which of course could work it's way into the room due to the large gap around the door). The first time it woke us up during the night and we looked all around to try to figure out if something was burning or something, but eventually figured out it was coming from outside. With all that said, it was not the worst experience I have ever had at a hotel, but if I had it to do over again I would probably stay somewhere else. I don't want to make it sound like the hotel was BAD or anything, but I guess it just wasn't quite up to the level I expected.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guy_From_Normal", "Title": "\u201cCustomary Residence Inn\u201d", "Author": "Guy_From_Normal", "ReviewID": "UR22560719", "Content": "We recently stayed one night at this Residence Inn in a queen studio room.

There was a full size kitchen, a living room area, and a bathroom with a separate sink/vanity area. The breakfast was also very good and had a good combination of hot and cold items. Besides the stairs, the other drawback was this hotel is located off of a busy street (Michigan Av). You can hear some of the louder traffic noise in the room. We were able to solve this problem by turning on the fan, which blocked the noise. Finally, if you are looking for a hotel that is convenient to downtown, you may want to look elsewhere. You can take Michigan Av all the way to downtown but it will probably take at least half an hour with all of the stoplights. The other option is to follow I-465 to I-65 but that takes at least 20-25 minutes as well.

They have tons of parking available and its outdoor so I don't really see why it couldn't be included. Internet is generally free these days so this is a little dated on the part of the hotel too. I did have free internet at this location through AT&T but none of the other guests in my party did. I guess being with AT&T was a bonus here.

Yes, the bedrooms are a tight squeeze, as mentioned by another reviewer, but they are comfortable and most importantly, clean. Two small bumps for me: the pool was closed, due to someone breaking a glass in there. Maybe tonight my daughter can get a swim in, before we check out tomorrow. The other thing is the spotty wi-fi signal. I'm constantly having to re-connect. This has also provided a problem for my husband, who has to work online.

Four stars to the staff for the improved attitude. I will also give the housekeeping staff a positive review for the basics of the room cleaning. They also have improved significantly. For the first time in all my stay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s I was provided with a bathrobe in the closet. However the first time they cleaned my room I never saw my robe again. The bad: This property is directly adjacent to a major freeway. The road noise can be challenging. My room had a soil mark the size of a dinner plate in the living room. This is a maintenance issue and I cannot fault the housekeeper. The management needs to shampoo carpets regularly. Toiletries are the most basic and I would recommend using your own. The SPG club room is sad. During my stay, someone twice, set off the smoke detector while cooking toast. You are advised to leave the hotel using the stairs. Many people not knowing it was a false alarm trudged down the stairs. This room is monitored by a very attentive staff member who has been there for several years but he is working with an old setup!

It was only a 5 minute walk but the difference of walking into the lobby at the Hilton and the lobby at the Sheraton was miles apart. Many of the reviews here seem to really slam the Sheraton, and while it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a four star hotel it was certainly worth the money spent. I am a Gold member Starwoods member but for the second time checking into a Starwoods property I was not upgraded nor received any of the benefits of the Gold status. The guy at check in said that they were booked and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even put me on the Starwoods Preferred Floor AND to top it off my room was right next to the elevator (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to stay in these rooms since you can either here the elevator going up and down or hear the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when the doors open. Luckily, It was on the other side of the elevators and I never heard a thing. I was on the 7th floor. Additionally, my room rate included free wifi and a buffet breakfast each day. The rooms at this Sheraton are all suites and consisted of a room with a king size bed and a room with a couch and a desk, along with a bar area (without a sink). It also included a microwave and a refrigerator. The room was clean, however, it was showing some wear. The wall behind the desk was all marked up, probably from people reclining back on the desk chair. The set up in the bedroom room was a bit difficult to maneuver around. The closet is located along the wall with the windows and when you open the door to the closet you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get around the bed which made unpacking and repacking a bit difficult. Additionally, there is not much room between the bureau and bed but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manageable. The bed was very comfortable and there were lots of pillows. I even used the pillows meant for the pull out couch which I never used. Sheraton or Starwoods is starting a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If you decide not to have your room serviced for any day of your stay excluding the final day, you can get 500 Starwoods points. Not sure if it is really worth it. It seems that they only give you new shampoo and conditioner if you throw the old ones away. For 3 days I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gotten any new amenities until I tossed the empty the containers in the trash. They also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you an extra roll of toilet paper. I had one the first day and never saw an extra roll for the rest of the stay. The staff at the hotel was very friendly from the front desk clerks to the people running the buffet. I had a problem with the TV in the bedroom and the maintenance guy was up quick only to tell me that it would take a day or so to fix it. When they fixed it they left a bag of microwave popcorn for me. Additionally, one evening I was waiting for a friend to pick me up and the doorman asked me if I needed a water. The breakfast buffet is fine, typical food, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, and yogurt. As I mentioned earlier I was supposed to get a complimentary breakfast each morning so I sat down the first morning, no one was there serving and got a plate and a water. After about 15 minutes someone finally showed up and I told him I had a free breakfast so he asked for my card/coupon which I never received. He went to the front desk and the desk clerk came over with coupons for me for the week and apologized for any inconvenience. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work out in the gym but I did check it out. It was on the small side and you could do a workout with dumbbells. There is one cable machine and some treadmills. There are also two pools, one inside and one outside with a Jacuzzi inside. This hotel was fine for a work conference, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to stay here on vacation. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a rental car and there is practically nothing within walking distance of the hotel.

I went to bed at 10pm to get a good night sleep for my conference across the street at the Hilton Anatole (very convenient walk). I got 2 hours of sleep. My room was literally right next to the highway. All the comments on highway noise do not do justice. I have a sleep machine on my iPhone that was turned up as much as possible, and it still did not drown out the noise of the freeway. It was one of the worst hotel nights I've ever had. That morning, I visited Tanya at the front desk. She exceeded my expectations by allowing me to move immediately that morning prior to leaving for the conference. Tanya is no doubt the highlight of this hotel. She was awesome. She moved me to another room on the same floor (? what happened to SPG benefits to be on the Club or even SPG floors?). Oh well, I was relieved to no longer face the highway. The new room was a double (I told her I would be happy to take that if that was what was available). The bedroom was actually much larger in the Double, and had more space to walk around. The only other difference is a smaller sink. The only issue I had was a leaky shower head, but I covered that with a washcloth to deal with it. On the Club, it seems to have one of the better food options I've seen-full buffet breakfast of eggs and such in the AM, and pasta dinner the one night I went up to the lounge (I was not in the pasta mood, so that didn't really turn me on).

We learned quickly that there was a problems the minute we stepped in the slightly musty lobby. Large drying fans were running and tiles from the ceiling were missing. I could barely hear the front desk guy while we were checking in, the fans were so loud. So far, not so good. Made our way up to the room. The lobby (outside of the wet-zone) was nice. You could tell that some remodel work had taken place. Didn't take in the restaurant, but neither was anyone else based on the empty tables. Didn't notice a bar, so no commentary there. When we got off the elevator, we were greeted by another drying fan on this floor, including the musty smell. Seems that this was more than a isolated problem. Inside the room, I have to admit, this was a 3.5* room with 4* space. Decent sheeting and amenities - 2 flat screens, sitting room, fridge, microwave. Except for the musty smell throughout, the room was perfectly acceptable for a Marriott/Hilton/Hyatt 3.5* property. Seems that Sheraton is trying to step up their game. If they fixed the leak, this would still be a 3-3.5* at best. Marking this a 4* does a disservice to a TRUE 4 star property right across the street.

It's a reasonably nice hotel a few miles outside of Dallas but unfortunately in the middle of nowhere (essentially no restaurants around except a Denny's) and in a not-so-great neighborhood. Nevertheless, I've had reasonably good experiences here. I just tried to check in here shortly after 2 pm on a Sunday (moving from The Sheraton downtown to save some money). The parking lot is nearly empty which makes it highly unlikely that the hotel is sold-out tonight. So does the fact that rooms at this hotel have been available on Hotwire for days (I've stayed here enough times to be able to recognize this hotel on Hotwire). So does the fact that there is nearly no activity at all in the lobby. I understand that check-in time is 3 pm. But normally hotels will try to accommodate you if you arrive early and rooms are available. Particularly if it's already after 2 pm. Here, the female front desk clerk, whose name I'll be kind enough to omit, told me with a straight face that they had a full house last night (although probably not completely true since rooms were available on Hotwire, I'll assume that the hotel was nearly full and that her statement was mainly accurate) and that she wouldn't be able to give me a room until 3 pm because no rooms were ready yet. This is a complete insult to my intelligence. Obviously, they've been cleaning rooms as guests depart since early this morning. Obviously many guests have departed since the parking lot is nearly empty. Obviously, making the minimal amount of effort necessary to place a call to housekeeping to find an available room would allow me to check in. Instead, I was invited to spend money for an hour in their 11th floor lounge. Instead, I sat in the lobby working on my computer for a few minutes while the front desk clerks seemed to do nothing (other than turn away another guest until 3 pm). Then I realized how ridiculous the situation was and asked the same woman at the front desk to confirm for me that there were no clean rooms at 2:20 pm at what appears to be a now nearly empty hotel. She then proceeded to tell me that 172 parties had checked out last night. So I asked her if not one of those rooms was clean by this time. It was then that she - voila - made a call to housekeeping. And now, \"miraculously\", a room was available So she checked me in and can see that I am not handicapped yet places me in a room designed for the handicapped. I'm 6'2\". The mirror in the handicapped room, among other things, is very low off the ground. I'm here for 3 nights. Common sense would dictate you wouldn't put a non-handicapped tall person in a room designed for the handicapped for 3 nights where i would have to, among other things, duck down to be able to look into the bathroom mirror. So I returned to the front desk. She blamed the 3rd party reservation system (Hotwire) and then, miraculously again, found another available regular room, despite the fact that it was only 2:30 pm.. A room that no doubt was available when I first asked to check in shortly after 2 pm. The room is fine - they are nice rooms which is the reason I've returned here a number of times, despite the less-than-ideal location. I also wanted to add that they've now instituted a $7.95 daily parking charge (new since the last time I was here). Sorry but this is a major rip-off It's one thing if the hotel was located downtown or where public transportation was available. But there's clearly no public transportation around here and essentially no way to get here or stay here without a car. So the reality is that the rooms cost $7.95 more than advertised. But rather than be intellectually honest about that and disclosing it (the website just says \"self parking facilities\", they instead just inform you of the parking charge when you arrive. Why not be honest and have free parking but charge $7.95 more for the rooms? Because being honest would be less profitable, i imagine. (If it's an issue keeping non-hotel guests from parking in the lot that could easily be solved by giving hotel guests a ticket to stick on the dashboard) Incidentally, this is the first time I've ever taken the time to write a review of a hotel. But I've pretty much been turned off to the Sheraton/Starwood brand on this trip and I'm a very frequent business traveler. There is a certain level of nickle-and-diming, I've unfortunately come to expect at \"4 star\" hotels. But between this and getting charged $5.01 for a 1 liter bottle of water at the gift shop at the Sheraton Dallas downtown , enough is enough. Particularly with the no-effort and lack of common sense service I just received at check-in. I thought others should be forewarned. P.S.

The living area was decent. The room only looks bigger because the furniture is so compact. I'm a petite person and the only place where I could really find space to relax in was the king bed. The service was the worst. Housekeeping eventually told me that not only were they overbooked, but they were also understaffed that weekend. Parking is not free. I was surprised because I've never been to a hotel where they charge for parking when there is a huge lot surrounding the hotel. My friend ended up parking right outside the bordering ropes so he did not have to pay the fee. With all that said, I did enjoy the location of the hotel. Our main need was to be close to downtown.

That mistake was actually well worth it since the pricing was much much better (we pre-paid our room for an another discount), and although downtown was only 2 miles away, the Market Center Sheraton provided a courtesy shuttle service (based on availability). The hotel facilitated this service for us to get to and from downtown which is about a 10 minute ride. The room was very nice, looked brand new and it had a separate living room from bedroom each containing a panel TV, and kitchenette had a microwave, fridge and coffeemaker. Usually room coffee is just ordinary to me, but here they had tasty Starbucks I really enjoyed. We were on the 10th floor and for some reason needed to use our key card in the elevator to get to that floor level. This was my first time in a Sheraton but last time I had to use my key to access the floor of my room was at a Ritz Carlton where the floor had certain niceties that were available only to the guests of that floor. I didn't see anything special on our floor at the Sheraton. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub. Really liked how the pool is partially indoors and outdoors. During our visit the weather was too cold to use the outdoor part, but indoors it was nice and heated. The gym faces the pool and looked all new but we didn't use it although it was tempting to use what looked like all new equipment, or at least sit there and watch the panel TV in the center of the room. Another enjoyable amenity is the Sheraton Link which is their comfortable lounge setup by the lobby where guests have free internet access, and if you didn't bring your laptop you can use on of theirs along with a printer that's situated there. Although the hotel has a nice looking restaurant, the only time we ate there was for room service on the first night. Our last meal was at a Denny's just a short walk around the corner. There was also the option to go around the other corner but that would end up at the Medieval Times. Those 2 places are the only ones within a short walk from the hotel which is why I believe their courtesy shuttle service is really a valuable amenity. I believe the service goes as far as a 3 or 5 mile radius from the hotel. The best way to work this is to mention to the front desk in advance (like the night before, or early morning) that you'd need a ride for a certain time that way they can arrange to accommodate. There were a couple of occasions where I didn't pre-arrange and the shuttle was completely booked, and the other was when the next shuttle was leaving at the time I needed to already be in downtown at 4pm (it was already 3:30pm). For those 2 occasions we took a taxi. Keep the front desk number handy in case you'll need to call to make sure shuttle is on its way to pick you up. Due to our schedule, our only sightseeing in Dallas was in the Historic West End District. I thought the Dallas Aquarium would just be a fishbowl, but I was impressed with how much was put in one place that there was actually a good number and a variety of exhibits that it's really much more than an aquarium. It's was more like a zoo and an aquarium in an indoor ecological setting. My favorite exhibit was the jaguar since most zoos keep them at a distance, but here it was right next to us only separated by a thick glass wall. After the aquarium we only had enough time for one more place so we ended up at the 6th floor museum since that is unique to only Dallas, afterwards going outside to the 'grassy knoll' and the 'X' in the middle of the Elm street. So in summary about our visit to Dallas, our stay at the Sheraton Suites MC very enjoyable and was well worth the savings that even though wasn't conveniently located as the downtown location, their shuttle service more than made up for it. The service staff from the front desk, room service and shuttle drivers were all friendly and hospitable to us.

We were in town for the National Cheer Association Cheer competition. The hotel was completely booked so it was not surprising that there were a few issues. Upon arrival at 5pm there were several in our group who were told their rooms were not ready and some had to wait a good hour and a half before getting into their rooms. When people in our group had booked their hotel rooms some had been told breakfast was included and others were told it was not included. This confusion continued at check in. As it turned out another cheer group was supposed to have breakfast included. Because so many had been told breakfast was included the RIGHT thing for management to do would have been to give out the breakfast coupons. Young kids don't eat much, and I hardly think it would have caused them to lose money. By far the biggest concern was that one of the elevators broke down on Saturday afternoon. Now, I did not mind having to climb the stairs to the 7th floor. There were several in our group though who came down the stairs to find the ground floor stairwell door LOCKED. What if there had been a fire in a completely booked hotel with one elevator and one service elevator? We had two in our group who were in wheelchairs. I know it was overwhelming for the staff, but it was quite obvious that only a few were well trained. I did find the room to be small but clean. I did not notice glasses just being wiped clean. MY only complaint in regard to cleanliness would be that the blanket for the pull out sofa was definitely not clean and there was only one sheet. Fortunately when I asked for another sheet I ended up with a much nicer blanket (but no extra sheet). One more thing, I think it's important for guests to be informed of the parking fee when they check in.

I made a last minute reservation for a club king. I also had called the hotel prior to my arrival with some questions about parking, I was told it was $8.61, ok not a problem. When I arrived at the hotel that evening I was checking in and the young lady stated she was going to put me on the 6th floor. I asked I thought I booked a club floor room and then she checked my reservation again and said that the 10th floor was the highest she could put me. I was fine with that and I am not very picky on room location unless I book a specific room for example club or executive. Also I asked if I was going to be charged for parking and she said they are not going to charge another big plus plus. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not upset with that at all. I was also informed that the club lounge was closed a big disappointment for me because I booked it because the lounge serves breakfast and afternoon snacks. I was given a complementary breakfast buffet voucher for every day of my stay. I arrived to my room on the key access floor; the room was very spacious and nice. The room also had a cordless phone and in addition to the bathroom door there was a pocket door that went into the bedroom. I will agree with the other reviews about the bedroom being small but there is still ample space to move about especially if going out on the balcony. The other review that I will agree with is the service. Another large concern is that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wares from the glasses in the room, ice bueckts, and dinnerware did not look like they were properly washed and sterilized. The drinking glasses in the room had spots on them and on some one could tell they were just wiped on the inside. How are they being cleaned and if they are then what is being used. This reminded me of the incident a few years ago where a hotel maid was using dirty linens to clean the glasses in the room. The hotel needs some help in this area and staff communication is poor when it comes to sitting down for breakfast and if maintenance on the room is needed. I called the 1st night with a maintenance issue; the desk stated that they would send someone right away. One hour passed with no knock on the door. I called again and another desk agent answered and I had to fill him in on the issue and within less than 10 minutes a maintenance representative came to the room to address the issue with the room.( pocket door on the bathroom was broken). Also there was an extra charge on my bill from the 1st night that was not mine. I called the desk and inquired about the charge. They agent said he would get back with me when he had looked into my bill. Turns out that someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bar tab was posted on my bill without verifying the room number. I had explained to the agent that I am not a drinker and I ended up going down to the desk when there was not need, but I will give him credit for working on that for me. He was very nice and helpful to resolve that issue. At breakfast my last day there I felt ignored by the wait staff, I was greeted when I came into the restaurant but no one check on how I was doing when I sat down at the table, when I was finished with my meal someone finally can to check on me and I was ready to leave so I handed the person my voucher and left. The staff is very friendly and nice but lack organization, there was too going on for a small crowd, I would have expected this only if the restaurant was super full and busy. My overall experience is that this is a nice hotel, but the staff communication needs much improvement. I will return to this hotel the next time I am in the area. Please note: I recommend if you are a new guest to a hotel to print a copy of your reservation just to make sure you get what was reserved and if there is real drinking glasses in the room to use plastic cups unless one can tell that the glasses are replaced daily with clean ones.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice and Close to the City\u201d", "Author": "stevemustangred", "ReviewID": "UR51222947", "Content": "Stayed one night for the Dallas White Rock Marathon.

I initially selected this hotel based off reading past reviews and the $99/night rate. I thought I scored gold when the rate went down to $74/night after I booked at the higher rate & the hotel adjusted it. When we checked in, we were impressed at how nice the hotel looked. We got to the room and thought it was a little small. The king sized bed left very little clearance for walking around. If we weren't careful, we would bang our sides & arms on the closet handles and dresser. My boyfriend is a pretty big guy & the tight fit was very frustrating. We stayed in room 811 which faced out on Stemmons Freeway. The constant noise from traffic was unbelievable. If you are a light sleeper, you will be very unhappy here. We heard sirens from every emergency response vehicle that went by, the noise from motorcycles and the engine noise from all other vehicles. We came back to our room very late the first evening after having fun in the city. We got a disgusting surprise when we discovered that our shower did not drain properly. I took my shower first and after being in it for a few minutes, the water was up to my ankles. By this time it was 2 o'clock in the morning & we decided to complain the next day. I made a call to the front desk & was told someone would come take a look at it. NO ONE EVER CAME. We came back late the next evening to discover the same scenario & also realized that OUR SHEETS HAD NOT BEEN CHANGED. I know this because earlier that morning before we left, I dropped my lipstick on the bed & it smeared on the top & bottom sheet. Low & behold, the same sheets were still on, but the bed had been made to cover it up. Housekeeping came the next morning while we were still getting dressed. I cracked the door & told her we needed just a few more minutes. We left for the day & came back to a dirty room & unmade bed (this was around 5pm). I called guest services & they assured me that someone from housekeeping was on the way. We even left so we would not be in the way. We came back two hours later and THE ROOM WAS STILL NOT CLEAN. I went down to the front desk to complain & the person on duty told me that someone would be up right away. HOUSEKEEPING KNOCKED & HANDED ME A STACK OF TOWELS & SHEETS AND WALKED AWAY. I HAD TO MAKE UP MY OWN BED!!!!!! I was thoroughly disgusted by this! I went down to the front desk & the manager seemed very surprised by this, but didn't do anything. She offered to remove my parking charges, but other that that it didn't seem like a big deal.

I was highly annoyed that I had to pay a daily fee for internet access on the club floor. The daily parking charge of $7.95 plus tax was ridiculous as well, but I suppose the management feels that if the Hilton Anatole across the street can charge $17, they can get away with only $7.95.

I got an e-mail at work about this great Valentines package for $129 a night. that included one night stay in their newly renovated suites, chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne. I immediately forwarded the e-mail to my boyfriend who booked it. When i got the confirmation e-mail it said my stay was at the one on Olive Street. So of course I came to tripadvisor.com my trusty source. After comparing the reviews we called to have our reservation switched. Boy was I glad we did. The hotel was nice and big. Nothing too fancy down in the lobby but it was tastefully done. The front desk guy was very nice except he had to answer the phone while he was helping us but no biggie. A shocker was the price to park. $7.95 to park in their parking lot per night. We got our room keys and went up to our room. We requested a downtown view when making the reservations and were plesently surprised. As soon as we walked in the room and put our stuff down we had a knock at the door and it was a well dressd bellman with our strawberries and champagne. He offered to pop the bottle for us so we accepted he even poured our glasses for us but immediatly left the room so we could toast to ourselves. The rooms are amazing! The living room is seperate from the bedroom which is great! Two flat screen TV's with some great channels like I find at home. The bathroom was big and very nice. We didn't find the balcony till later that night after returning from dinner its off the bedroom. Not much room out there but great view of Medieval Times, AA Center and Reuinion Tower. Our valentines package also included breakfast for two at the Grill or room service. We decided to go down to the grill cause I wanted a bloody mary. come to find out the Bar doesn't open till 4pm. We had a buffet style breakfast. You seat yourself, get your own plates and food which is typical. But when it came time for me to get a drink none of the waitstaff came to check on me so I couldn't tell them. My boyfriend had to go ask the cooks to get us a dr. pepper which took 4 minutes to bring out. The food was OKAY. The milk and orange juice they have sitting out isn't put in ice, its just sitting on the counter. I don't know about you but I am not a fan of room temperature milk or orange juice. The chef made omlettes and eggs to order but I heard people complaining about their food. The food wasn't the best but it filled me up until we were able to go to Pappadeaux where I got me a bloody mary. Part of our package was late checkout which was 1:30pm. VERY nice. Overall I would reccommend this place to anyone. The rooms and hallways were quiet and clean. However after seeing the retail price sticker on the back of the room door next to the fire emergency plan..$369, I was shocked! I admit the rooms are worth the price but normally you have awesome amenities with a price like that. Not so much here. They did have a new business center though which we didn't try out. We did check out the pool though but didn't jump in. They have indoor outdoor pool and workout center. Nothing to fancy. Smelt strong of clorine.

The hotel was about 1.5 miles from downtown, which was very convenient and we didn't have any trouble navigating to the places we went downtown. The rooms were very nice and had plenty of room for the two of us. The breakfast was on \"special\" for $10.95/person and was really good - I am not sure how much it normally costs though. I did see on the website when I booked there were room rates that included breakfast, just not for the rate I booked. The hotel also offers a shuttle within 5 miles of the hotel. The driver was very nice and instead of dropping us off at the pearl street dart station, he took us all the way to Cotton Bowl stadium. The only complaint I have about the shuttle was when we wanted to go downtown one night, they wanted us to get on it an hour later. When I booked the hotel, I was under the impression that the shuttle ran whenever you wanted to go somewhere as long as it was available. Also we called from downtown one night to see if it was in the area, but they told us it was done for the night. It wasn't a big deal, but other hotels that i have stayed in with shuttles are much more accomodating.

Probably one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. A large comfortable bed and the couches pull out bed was even comfortable. There was a large flat screen tv in each room. Both tvs worked great and were the best tvs I have ever had in any hotel room. The rest of the room was very nice and pleasant. The 6 nights we stayed there were great and our time spent in the room was comfortable. The main bedroom was a bit cramped with the door opening in towards the bedroom, but it is nothing you cant deal with. It was just a very nice, comfortable room for the 3 of us. We did have a room on the noisy side of the hotel, facing the freeway. But while travelling we all sleep using earplugs, so the freeway noise was not a problem. But I could see how that may affect many guests. The hotel supplied our group with a buffet breakfast each morning. The breakfast was delicous and very satisfying. We did not have the need to visit the hotels restaurant or bar. The workout room equiptment was very nice. The room itself was in the final stages or construction. The indoor/outdoor pool was nice, along with the indoor whirlpool. The hotels computer and printer was very helpful. I did not bring a laptop, as I certainly did not want to pay for internet service from my room. They really need to provide free wireless internet hookup. Our arranged group rate per night was very reasonable. I certainly can not complain about that. The hotel has a shuttle van available to its guests. I believe the van is available for locations within a couple of miles from the hotel. (3 miles perhaps?) Overall it was a great place to stay and I would stay here again if I had the chance.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cRidiculous Hidden Charges for an OK place\u201d", "Author": "IncredibleAsia", "ReviewID": "UR16604871", "Content": "I recently stayed at this hotel while attending an event at the World Trade Center. This hotel is overpriced and over rated for the services and facilities rendered and should not be considered if you are traveling to attend any of the Dallas markets. If you want to overpay for a cramped bedroom chopped into a suite of 2 mini-rooms, pay $10/day for Internet access, pay $8/day to park in an open parking lot, (a charge not disclosed in the reservation process) pay for LOCAL telephone calls, and eat mediocre over-priced food, go for it. There are 10-15 other brand name hotels within a 3-mile radius that are better value for your hard-earned money. See my review of the nearby Holiday Inn Dallas Market Center. When I drove up to the hotel, I thought it was closed as it is under renovation. There was no front door staff or bellman on duty at the door, so I dragged my bag across the open parking lot myself. I stepped to the counter to check in, handed over my credit card and Starwood Preferred Guest card to one of the two employees. One was helping another guest try to locate a Federal Express package, and after beginning my registration, the person helping me stopped to assist her co-worker look for the Fed-x package, keeping me standing, watching, waiting while they fumbled around and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the package. My room was on the 11th floor, the SPG floor, but the lounge where I was looking forward to relaxing with complimentary evening appetizers and a glass of wine was closed for renovation. If it were my hotel, I would comp similar services somewhere in the hotel or provide an SPG coupon of some sort, but no such offer was made. My newly renovated room had a large sitting area with a granite topped bar, table desk, sofa and flat screen TV that was a total invasion of necessary space in the bedroom which was way too small for comfort. The bedroom was consumed by its king size bed that was so large that when the door between the bedroom and sitting room was open, you could not walk by the bed to the open closet area. A second flat screen TV was tucked in the corner, but it was somehow positioned requiring that you sit up and carefully point the remote at the exact perfect spot to change channels. The 2 TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were literally 1 foot apart, each on one side of the wall between the 2 rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6something so silly that could have been remedied by making the opening between the 2 rooms a niche where the TV could swivel and be viewed from either side. The division of the room into 2 rooms just made the whole thing seem cramped. Since there was no space in the bedroom to open your suitcase, so you actually had to use the sitting room as part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153private\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd space normally reserved for the bedroom of a suite. What was the idea of this design? Dinner in the hotel was another story. The menu is from the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and so was the food preparation. I ordered what I thought was the healthiest meal, fettuccini with grilled shrimp, but it arrived swimming in oil. The servers were really friendly, but not trained to simply look at the table and determine what was needed, so I sat with an empty water glass and finished my meal without a coffee at the end as the server never offered either. I mentioned this on the comment card on my departure and was surprised that the Food Operations Manager immediately acknowledged my comments in an email.

The Best thing in the Hotel was the hot Bar Tender. The exercise room was in an old guest room. You had to walk through the parking lot to get to the pool. The most exciting part of my stay was the women stuck in one of the elevators screaming for someone to let her out. After smiling a little bit and celebrating that it was not me in there I went back to my room. I was shocked to find the women still crying historically from the elevator nearly 45 minutes later when I went back down.

(I recently stayed at a brand new hotel and there are differences between brand new and needing refurbishing.) However, there wasn't anything unacceptable about my room. Housekeeping appears to be doing a good job. My room was clean. I didn't see any mold or mildew on the walls and the wall covering was intact. Registration was professional and courteous. The public spaces are pleasant and inviting. To me, the biggest distraction was the carpet in the corridor. It was loose and wrinkled.

In the first room I was given, the lights didn't work, and I could see mold growing on the walls. The wallpaper was peeling and moldy from water damage. I asked to be moved, and I was moved to a room just as bad. The room smelled of mold, and you could see the mold growing near the windows. The curtains conveniently hid the mold. The vents all had mold growing out of them. There were stains all over the floor, and water damage everywhere. The couch and chairs were all stained as well. I bought Lysol and an air freshener at the store, but that did nothing to get rid of the smell. I was physically sick while staying here. 15 people left and went to another hotel, and it was the best move I've ever made. Towards the end of the training, the horror stories from the Sheraton Suites continued. People came in to training and their clothing smelled like mold. One person had mold growing on their clothes that they had put in their closet. A few people talked about ants in their room, and one person said they woke up with ants all over their body.

Rooms are all suites and very small. With the king size bed in the room, you can literally extend your arm and touch all 4 walls. The televisions don't seem to have been updated since 1980s. They are in working condition and that's just about it. The furniture in the room seems to be at least a decade old, if not more and it really shows with chips in the paint etc. The bathroom is equally old and the bath tubs have chips all over. The amenities weren't any known brand. The only saving grace is that the room and bathroom is kept relatively clean. There is Starbucks coffee in the room and a refrigerator with a mini bar. However, don't dare look around the fridge or under the sink. The fitness center on the ground level will remind you of Norman Bates Motel and has an extremely eerie feeling. The lighting is dim. The little equipment and weights there is - seem to be from the 1960s and very rusty/squeaky. The false ceiling is falling apart and with the pool right next to this fitness center, the dampness was very uncomfortable. The top two or three levels I think are club floors and if you are a an elite SPG member, do try to push the staff for an upgrade to that level. The small dining room on the top level has a small limited complimentary breakfast, but enough to get you full. The restaurant on the ground level is decent and has the regular buffet, lunch and dinner offerings. The staff at the hotel is courteous. Parking... this is another quirk. Why are they charging 7 bucks? This is not a downtown hotel and none of the adjoining hotels including Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Doubletree have parking fee. This hotel shares its parking lot with Courtyard. There is no additional security or restricted access to the parking, so I don't know why they should be charging a fee. A very disappointing hotel in the Starwood chain. If this were my first experience with Sheraton, I would never stay at another Sheraton again in my life.

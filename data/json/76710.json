In addition, price is right especially when compared to other Branson properties! If you want to stay on the strip, this is not the place for you. But if you want a nice, clean, comfortable, well-priced place to spend your nights...I suggest you look into Branson Towers! I enjoyed working with the group tours staff as they were always very cheerful and helpful! As an added bonus, they have a nice feature serving cobbler and ice cream beginning at 10:00 p.m. When you come back from a show it is a nice option to be able to have a little before bed snack!!

Even though it was not one of the premium (newly renovated) rooms, it was spacious, clean, comfortable and met our family's needs. The beds were very nice and we made full use of the refrigerator and microwave in the room. The free breakfast buffet was very good with offerings of waffles, eggs, sausage, donuts, bagels, biscuits & gravy. The nightly ice cream social and live entertainment was a nice treat that definitely makes this hotel memorable. We had one issue with our shower not working properly. But once I called the front desk, there was someone at my door within 15 minutes and the problem was fixed promptly. This was a great hotel with a friendly staff.

Just walking around in my socks in the room turned my socks black. The shower had pubic hairs in it. There were no trash can liners. Fixtures and other things in the room were broken. I actually could handle all that. However, the walls must be paper thin because I could hear every footfall above us. Some idiots were drinking and partying down the hall from us all night. Finally, at midnight, I had to go out in the hall and ask them to be quiet (I have young kids). I should not have had to do that. They did not stop, so I called the front desk and no one responded. I don't think the noise stopped until 2:30 am. We were all exhausted and extremely unhappy. The breakfast is ridiculous. It's nasty. Plus, they let performers from theaters around Branson come hit you up for business while you're trying to eat. I found it very rude. Needless to a say, we stayed elsewhere for the rest of our trip.

The only drawback about the room was that it took a while for the water to get hot in the shower. As long as you know to run it for a while before you get in it is ok. The pool was nice but you should know that you have to walk outside to get to it. This was fine for a warm May weekend but I don\u2019t think I would like it if we were in Branson during the winter. It is a very short walk though. I estimate it to be about 20 feet. They did have bathrooms in the building with the pool so you could easily change before making the dash back to your room if it is cold. The breakfast was good as can be expected for the money. There were two people working the breakfast bar and they did an excellent job of keeping everything well stocked. There were 3 waffle makers so the line was short to make a waffle. In the evening they had piano music with ice cream and cobbler for sale at $1.25. It really adds a nice touch. Since our primary objective of this trip was Silver Dollar City I liked the fact that it was a short distance from the park and on a route that avoided the crazy Branson traffic.

They were showing a lot of wear and tear. That's about the only negative. They do need need to offer a sharps container for medical purposes. I need 3 pages to compliment the the breakfast buffet.

We've stayed in several different hotels and have found this to be the nicest for the money - we've stayed here several times and will definitely stay at the Branson Towers on our next visit. It is a nice hotel in a great location with a breakfast included that can't be beat anywhere - not even even at a Holiday Inn Express. With that said, I must say we were disappointed in our suite during our recent visit in late Oct. 2011. We stayed here in June 2011 and enjoyed a nicely updated double Queen room. When we came back this Fall we were looking for something a little more romantic so we booked a king suite with a fireplace. When entering the suite, I was disappointed to see it had not yet been updated. I was very surprised, considering it was a suite and costs more than a regular room. Following I will list the pros and cons of booking a suite so you can make your own decision: PROS: Very large and spacious suite, a nice whirlpool tub for two and a very comfortable bed and pillows (mattresses and pillows have been upgraded so we did enjoy a great nights sleep!). There is a full or queen size sleeper sofa in the large living room, as well as a table for 4, small refrigerator and sink. This suite would be perfect for a family of 4 or even larger as it would easily accommodate a roll-away bed. CONS: Furniture not updated, as it was in the double queen room we booked this past June and there were a couple of stains on the carpet that needed cleaning. Also, the fireplace did not work to our satisfaction - in fact, the flame was not visible while sitting on the sofa. I had to sit on the hearth to be able to see the flame. The fireplace was my single reason for renting this suite (not the tub, as we prefer showers) over a regular room so obviously I felt we wasted our money. With all this said, I think the suite would be perfect for families and if you're into a nice soak in a whirlpool tub then I would book this room. However, if your plans are to cuddle up in front of the fireplace - forget it and book a regular, nicely updated room", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "GFTraveler81", "ReviewID": "UR120601453", "Content": "Made a last minute trip to Branson over the weekend following Veteran's Day.

Their beds are to die for, all have pillow top mattresses & I'm one that always has to take her own pillow, well I forgot mine, and was really upset, as I just knew I wasn't going to sleep well.

The Branson Towers Hotel offered a good value for our money on nice accommodations with an excellent breakfast included in the price. We booked an updated room, which had one of the most comfortable beds (and pillows) we have ever slept on in a hotel (in any price range). We were traveling with a baby and they allowed us to bring our porta-crib and set up in the room but I believe they will provide one for an additional fee. We also had a mini-fridge in our room, which was convenient for storing milk and soft drinks. In addition to all the usual pastires and cereal fare, the breakfast included a good assortment of hot items, including biscuits, gravy, sausage, eggs and waffles. We were able to have a big, hearty breakfast before heading out each day - so good and so convenient! The staff was friendly and helpful - we needed extra pillows and someone brought them to our room within 15 minutes of calling the front desk. Besides the comfy beds and excellent breakfast, what I really like about the hotel is the location. We much prefer a quieter location away from the noise of the 76 strip. There was absolutely no traffic noise at all. Yet, it was close enough that you could be at any restaurants, shows or shopping along the Shepherd of the Hills Highway in about 5 minutes. If you're into hustle & bustle and lots of traffic, stay on the strip, but if bumper to bumper traffice gets on your nerves then this is the hotel for you. The only negative was it did not appear the carpet in the hallways had been updated and there were a couple of stains in places (not too bad). Our room appeared to have fairly new carpeting and everything was nice and clean, as was the Gazebo room where breakfast was served. This is not a 5 star hotel but I give it an Excellent rating because it's one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in at this price point.

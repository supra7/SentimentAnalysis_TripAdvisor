This is our second stay. We travel to LA once a year, and we have stayed at several of the less expensive, top-rated hotels on Trip Advisor. We last stayed here three years ago, and tried two other places since. This year we decided to return to the Royal Palace in Westwood and this is where we'll return to next year. We always travel with our child, so for us suites are the only way to go. Daughter can watch child-oriented programs on one TV, and we can watch a movie on the other. The suites at the Royal Palace are spacious, updated, well-appointed, and CLEAN. The beds are super comfy pillow tops and the bathrooms are large.The televisions are flat screens and cable (including two HBO channels) is included. Regardless of room type, the Royal Palace offers free high-speed internet (which is actually quite slow) and free parking, which is a rarity in LA. It isn't 5-star: there are lots of little things that knock it down a notch, such as the broken fan and heater in our bathroom, the garbage at the bottom of the stairs near our room, the sloppily-fixed ceiling leak in the breakfast room, the necessity of double-parking due to inadequate parking space, and no fitness center. But for value, the Royal Palace cannot be beat. The breakfast is basic but good and comparable to the other places we have stayed in LA that are in this price range. But compared to those other hotels, the rooms are nicer, the beds are more comfortable and the location is more central.

We were told that they could accommodate us for a couple nights but then were completely booked for several weeks. Miraculously, accommodations became available to meet our needs. The property is updated with a limited size for the lobby and breakfast room. You can only make as much space available for such things as the building footprint (which is small) allows. We were made to feel EXTREMELY welcome and everything possible was done to meet our needs while my daughter was having surgery at UCLA and her daughter was undergoing the stresses of Mama in the hospital. The manager and the front staff are helpful and caring. The maids speak limited English and that causes slight confusion but once needs are communicated, they too, are equally helpful and caring. If you do not want maid service, be sure to utilize the DO NOT DISTURB signs (the night before so you won't be bothered the next morning early). The bed was very comfortable, nearly as comfortable as my sleep number bed at home, and that is saying a lot from me as I have a severe back problem! Breakfast could be accomplished in your own room with coffee, tea, microwave and a fridge OR you could go downstairs to the snack room where a snack machine is available (expensive) and a Continental Breakfast of coffee, many types of tea, a variety of rolls, jelly, peanut butter, cream cheese and fruit (apples and bananas) and instant oatmeal are available. The room is small but there is no need to linger over this type of breakfast. My only complaint...and it is not limited to the hotel but shops in the area and UCLA Med. Ctr. as well, is the poor quality of toilet paper...worse than cheap tissue paper. Perhaps this is typical of California but is not a big problem in the areas that I am familiar with in my home state of Florida. There are shops of all types, including Trader Joe's and Ralph's where you can obtain groceries and beverages, all within 4-5 blocks...as is the UCLA Medical Center which has a shuttle that will pick you up right it front of the hotel. Just ask about it at the front desk and about the UCLA security escort if you should need such services. If there should be a problem that is unresolved, ask for Denise (who may be off site as she manages at least one other property) either in person or by phone and she will do her best to solve any situation that may arise.

It would appear that some rooms in the front are larger and have balconies. However, balconies facing the street would seem to have little value to us. Breakfast is some coffee, roll or bagel or English Muffin, banana, and some cereals. The breakfast room is too small. Take the tray from the coffee machine in the room and use it to bring your breakfast back to your room. There is a Denny's right next door if you prefer a better breakfast. There are many restaurants in the area. The hotel is within easy walking distance to UCLA campus, the Hammer Museum, Westwood shops and restaurants, Trader Joes, Ralphs, etc. It is also within 15 minutes (non rush hour) to the Getty Museum and, in the other direction, to the LACMA.

The hotel itself looks very average from the outside, even checking in and seeing the lobby and going down the hallway to our room was also quite average, but once we got to the room it was a WOW. We arrived early and our king room wasn't ready so we got upgraded to a king suite and I have to say this hotel is very similar to many of the Marriott's and Doubletree's I have stayed in with regard to room furnishings, TV's, and room amenities. The kitchenette and bathroom had granite countertops and the bathroom was the roomiest I have ever had in a hotel. The bed was comfortable to the point that I looked under the sheets to see what brand it was in anticipation of my next mattress purchase for my home. We had an incredibly spacious balcony that was at the rear of the building so not much view, but surrounded by trees and very quiet and private. Our trip was divided up into two different stays at the Royal Palace and on our second stay there the following week, our room was equally as nice just not as large as the king suite was. I have to say that the hotel front desk staff seemed mostly indifferent, but the housekeeping staff was very pleasant and did a fabulous job keeping the hotel clean. I usually wear socks in hotel rooms rather than go barefooted, but in this place I was confident enough in the cleanliness to go totally without socks and shoes in the room. This place even smells clean, and that's no small feat for a hotel. The area around Royal Palace is very nice, felt safe, and had plenty of options to shop and eat within walking distance. It is also very close to UCLA. The only real drawback is parking is very tight here, but at least it is free and that's more than many LA hotels have to offer. I was impressed with this very small, unimpressive looking hotel and will definitely stay there on my next trip to LA.

It's located in the Westwood Village, about 2 minutes south (walking) of the UCLA hospital and campus. I've stayed (and put up guests) in places that cost 4x as much in the area (most do) and they have been no-more satisfied that when I put them up here at the Royal Palace. Not sure the name is appropriate -- it's pretty basic with no frills. Still, it's clean, close and affordable (it's hard to find a hotel for less than 200/night on the Westside of LA). The area is pretty safe but petty theft is not uncommon (LA's a big city) -- the university feel of Westwood can be deceiving. I felt safe enough to send my wife here when she came out to interview by herself. I've put my parents up here as well when they visited. Rooms are generally small, but no smaller than business hotels in big cities like Chicago, Beijing, etc. Carpet is old but clean. Beds are not huge or memorably comfortable, but are kept clean. I've had rooms with brand new showers and rooms with older but functional bathrooms. Most rooms have a balcony. Noise is minimal, surprising given the area. Parking is a pain - spaces are tight and many are blocked in (leave keys upfront if you are the blocker). It's a good place if you don't need to move your car around. Breakfast is basic but served early. Cereal, toast, milk, juice, fruit, bagels, coffee, Newspapers, etc. TVs in room along with soap & shampoo. Towels were clean and adequate. Staff is very friendly - especially the guy at night -- gave us several local eating establishments to which we continue to frequent! Upgraded me to a suite at the regular room rate for 6 nights last time - very considerate. Again, it ain't the Ritz or Hilton. Not a honeymoon spot, resort, or place to impress your friends. Just a clean, quiet enough location perfect for UCLA business/interviews at a great price. Sadly, it's about the same that someone would pay in rent (per night) for a 3 bedroom apartment in Westwood.

The parking wasn't a problem, you just had to leave them your keys if you blocked another car. Very safe, walkable neighborhood.

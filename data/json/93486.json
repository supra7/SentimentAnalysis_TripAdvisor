I never ever heard back from them, which only goes to show... they don't give a $#)^ about their customers!!! --- Here is what I wrote: Dear Administrator at Millennium, Generally I would like to commend your hotel's overall quality & service. For the most part I had an enjoyable stay while visiting in January 2012. There were only a few things that I feel could have made my stay more enjoyable, however 1 of those things being totally out of your control. So let's start there... #1. Next to your hotel there is major construction being done on another building. They start their construction work very early 7am (VERY NOISY), and so the chance of sleeping in late peacefully was not an option. -- In addition to that noise was the hotel room's doors... basically as people were coming and going, and without thought or consideration to other guests, patrons would come and go, letting their doors \"Slam\" shut... which would of course noisily vibrate the walls of the corridors & disturb other people in their rooms. To remedy this, I would highly recommend putting some air pressured mechanical arms onto the top of the inside of the doors to stop the doors from slamming shut allowing the doors to close more quietly. #2. The bathtub/shower had serious DRAINAGE problems. The water would fill up 4-6in's in the tub during showers... and would only eventually drain 10-15 minutes after taking a shower. I would definitely highly recommend snaking all of the hotels drainage systems in the rooms periodically to keep the water running smoothly without clogging. #3. During my stay, I paid for wireless internet access... that was a huge waste of my money, as the internet connectivity in your hotel is very poor at best. Although I could connect from time to time, the ability to stay connected was extremely difficult. I talked to one of your staff about it, and asked about a hard line connection... but your hotel room doesn't seems to provide any hard line connections as I did look to see if I could jack in to a port somewhere in the room but couldn't find any. This was probably the most frustrating part of my stay, as it made it impossible for me to conduct business while I was there. --- All in all however, I was very pleased with your hotel's staffs that were very courteous, and actually very helpful in providing information when requested. Additionally, the hotel's location was perfect for my needs, as all of my business was centered in and around Time's Square, and the restaurants, delis, and Starbucks was right next door. Please also understand that the few things that I have mentioned are not going to stop me from staying at your hotel again, but it would be very good if a few of these issues could be addressed before I come back to N.Y. --- Thank you", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, awesome staff and nice rooms!\u201d", "Author": "lisacas1", "ReviewID": "UR125678612", "Content": "We stayed at the Millennium off 44th & Broadway in the Premier building in room 1922 for 4 nights in the 1st week of March.

It's not loud at all. Some nights we slept with the windows open and the noise was almost non existant. I like that the hotel is on a side street with little traffic and walking distance from Times Square & the subway. The staff is very nice and helpful and the hotel was always clean. If you have a room in the Premier section, you get access to the Mezzanine that offers free continental breakfast and happy hour.

We arrived early but were unable to get our room so we had our luggage stored - both times ours was put in a back room somewhere, although on numerous occasions there were bags left in the lobby with a lock through them. The staff at the front desk were not very helpful and at times rude (the concierge and doormen were always helpful though). We found the bed hard and uncomfortable, even with being exhausted after a long day of walking we did not sleep through the night. Security guards doing checks in the hallways at night were noisy - we could clearly hear them talking back and forth on their walkies. Noise from the street wasn't too bad, and we were in a corner room facing Time Square. The one issue we did have was being charged for beer and water from the minibar that we did not drink. Our of curiosity we had opened the minibar the first night just to see what was available and the fridge was not even turned on! When I brought the issue up to the woman at the front desk on checking out she did end up removing the charges, but the fact that they tried to charge us in the first place left a bad taste in my mouth. Also, there is no free wifi in the hotel. Perhaps its different in most places in Canada, but I haven't encountered a hotel in the past few years that does not offer free wifi. Although there are plenty of spots you can pick up fee wifi, its not as convenient as having it in your hotel room! I probably would not stay here again if I had another option in the same vicinity. Being that close to broadway led to us getting rush tickets for one of the shows because we happened to be in the right place at the right time.

I will forever request a room like this, when I stay here! I was on an upper floor, with a view of the Empire state building, the Conde Nast building (4 Times Square,) The Paramount Building, and the shimmering, blinking taxis & lights of Times Square below. I have to say, I never once turned the TV on. I did order room service to request a coffee pot in my room, from which I made some excellent flavored tea before bed, and of course morning coffee. From the concierge, I ordered an in room massage, since my headache was getting out of control from that long flight and reservation mix up. Within a half hour of my request, I had an amazing masseuse set up her table in front of the windows where I could glance down at Times Square, in between the relaxing kneading of a deep tissue massage. After an hour, my headache was gone, and I felt completely refreshed and ready for a stroll to hunt down some good pizza. I had one King size bed which was so comfortable, I didn't wake up once until my alarm went off, and I woke up totally refreshed. The bathroom fixtures were all clean and working, which is a BIG deal to me. I can't stand a creepy hotel bathroom. The tub was big, and the shower head was high enough that a tall person could easily stand under it. The wi-fi location was good. There was no noisy maid service banging on all the doors like you hear sometimes, when they're trying to rush everyone out. There was just a newspaper at my door, and a polite maid in the hallway who chatted with me for a moment when I was on my way out. When I made my way downstairs, the Bellmen remembered me, said hello, opened the door for me and wished me a good day.

We have stayed at the Millennium Hotel Broadway each time, primarily because of the great location and the great rate that I have found on travelzoo (under $200). This time around we were upgraded to the Premier Tower (the travelzoo deal offered an upgrade for $15), which offers a complimentary breakfast until 10:00 a.m. and cocktails and appetizers between 5:00 and 7:00 on the mezzanine floor. The hotel seemed busier than usual - there were buses outside on 44th street and a lot of people standing in the lobby with a lot of luggage, and I heard there was a convention at the hotel as well. It was much quieter in the lobby of the Premier Tower. Monique checked us into our room and quickly addressed a problem with the connection to the internet later in the day. Monique also encountered a very obnoxious guest who checked in ahead of us and was much more pleasant to him than I would have been. The other employees that we encountered in the Premier, including the two gentlemen working in the mezzanine lounge, were very professional and friendly as well.

The concierge was so helpful, the doorman was cheerful and great with our kids, the check-in and check-out was a breeze. Our room was on the 52nd floor (that's the top) and we had a corner. We could see the Chrysler building and where the ball drops on New Years from our room. My kids thought that was awesome. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were big, and the bathrooms clean. Our master bath was really huge and I'm glad I don't have to clean it! The location was so convenient to tons of restaurants and the hotel's recommendations were spot-on for kids...something that you don't assume in that area. It was only a few blocks from the Gershwin where we went to see Wicked. That was great considering it was a high of 21 degrees when we were there. I only took off half a star because there were no sheets for the pull-out couch. By the time my mom noticed (I was at Wicked), she just thought the heck with it because it was late and our kids were tired.

The front desk staff were also very helpful giving us directions and maps on what to do, what times to go and how to get there. We were up on the 42nd floor and had an amazing view of Times Square. NY really is the city that never sleeps theres always people up and about no matter the time on times square. If you get hungry during the early hours of the morning like my friend and i did theres a subway right across the road along with a little convidence store and a walgreens chemist.

All of the Broadway theaters are just a short walk. (FYI: \"A Broadway Show\" = anything playing in a theater of 500 seats or more. \"Off-Broadway\" = less than 500 seats.) We saw 3 shows in the week straddling New Year's Eve 2011. As usual, I booked one really desirable show in advance and grabbed all the rest at the TKTS booth -- which saves a ton of money AND benefits the Theater Development Fund at the same time! There is a TKTS booth conveniently located in Times Square, but it does not open until the afternoon. A better choice is the TKTS booth at South Street Seaport (6 stops from TS on the 2/3 subway line), which opens in the AM and usually has better seats and show selections anyway. You can sometimes get discounted matinee tickets for the following day, but only at the South Street Seaport location. To help select a show, use the TKTS App on your smartphone, which updates available shows a few minutes before the booth opens and then as changes occur during the day. New Years Eve was an exciting time to be on Times Square, but I have to warn you that celebrating NYE on TS is a serious logistical challenge. It can be very CIVILIZED, however, if you upgrade to this hotel's Premier Tower, which has an entirely separate entrance, desk staff, bell staff, complimentary Happy Hour, Breakfast Buffet, etc. The Premier Tower shares a Concierge, a very fine bar, a gym, and that's about it! The beautiful lobbies are connected and there are entrances on both 44th and 45th streets -- which proved to be very helpful. I was told that the Premier Tower has several rooms with a view of the New Year's Eve ball drop, so you would not even need to go outside if the weather turned bad. ABC Studios (Dick Clark!) is right across the street. As with all hotels near Times Square, we were not allowed to check in on New Year's Eve. This is because the Police start closing the streets off in the area an putting people in \"pens\" beginning about 2PM. Warning: Once you are placed in a pen, there is no food nor rest room available until about 12:15AM. You cannot return to your assigned pen if you choose to leave it for any reason. On NYE, once the blockades were in place, our hotel room key proved to be quite powerful, since people are prevented from even navigating in the area unless they have actual business (Room key, Theater Tickets or Dinner Reservation). On NYE, we had the continental breakfast, saw a great show in the afternoon, returned to the hotel for the complimentary happy hour, and then had a lovingly-prepared, prix fixe Italian dinner on the West side of Broadway. From there, we planned to use our room keys to get as close to the action as possible to ring in the New Year. (The hotel is on the East side of Broadway, and it is not possible to cross Broadway late on NYE.) We certainly did not plan to get to Times Square, proper, but our son is a Naval Officer (on his first leave since deployment) and his Military ID was treated with great respect by the Police, who escorted us to THE prime location between the falling ball and Lady Gaga's stage at 11:15PM. In addition to the above mentioned, unexpected courtesy, all the Police we encountered did a fantastic job under difficult circumstances all that week. They were all very respectful - and especially so for New Yorkers! I asked why the periphery was manned mostly by very young officers, and they told us that senior officers get first dibs on the assignments closest to Times Square. Finally, the singing, ball drop, dancing in the streets, confetti, and fireworks ensued. And then Times Square was already being cleaned up by 12:30AM. The Millennium Broadway (Premier Tower) will definitely be our first choice on our next trip to NYC, and I would certainly recommend it for anyone attempting to celebrate a New Year's Eve in NYC.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "phoenixpride", "ReviewID": "UR122848245", "Content": "I visited NYC with my sister and two cousins for a girl's weekend.

I'm not a great fan of walking, so being seconds away from Times Square and a 10 minute walk to the Rockerfeller Centre, Empire State, Maceys, Bryant Park, Grand Central Terminal, maybe 15 mins to Central Park was perfect. The only time we needed to get a cab was to the ferry to Statue of Liberty and also Ground Zero, but am sure some people would be happy to do the 45/50 mins or so walk. There had been some bad reviews about service and cleanliness that I'd read before we went. When we arrived it was peak check in/out time during a busy time of year and the foyer was mobbed. We were about 2 hours early for our check in time so wasn't expecting to get into our room, however, the receptionist found us a room so we could check in and was very helpful. For us, our floor (44) had what looked to be refurbished corridors (not scuffed and tired as reported), and no mould in our bathroom (I'm very fussy about bathrooms). In fact everything was pretty much up together, but only what you'd expect for $450 per night (it was the week between Christmas and New Year). As reported by others, it was a bit weird having a sheet under a duvet that had no cover, but am sure there's a reason for it. The duvet seemed clean enough! Very very firm bed. Our room was large (Superior King), flat screen TV, with a side view of Times Square. Black out curtains stopped us being kept awake by all the flashing signs and we couldn't hear any noise. You need to be prepared to wait for the lifts at peak times. The Bar area wasn't very welcoming and didn't offer a huge selection of food - snacks/burgers only. Our first night there it was torrential rain and blowing a gale, but we went out rather than eat there. We did find a great Indian restaurant a block away (ask Concierge), and an Irish bar opposite which meant not having to queue in Times Square for food in the pouring rain. The hotel doesn't run a shuttle to JFK, so we had them order us a car rather than risk a cab not turning up in the rush hour. Only cost us $30 more including and inclusive tip, so well worth it to have a quality, spacious car.

I would recommend people stay away from this hotel. Here's the problems I had in one day: 1) Checked in at the Premier Hotel side of the property (which I had booked). When I got the the room I found a room with problems. 1) Toilet didn't flush (the whole handle was hanging off the side of the toilet), 2) found crumbs and hair in and on the bed,3) the bar soap in the bathroom was unwrapped, used and dirty, and 4) the bottle shampoo was 1/3 used. Basically, the room clearly looked like it was \"made up\" like for an existing guest, but not cleaned for a new guest. 2) I asked to change rooms. Was told ok, but would need to give up the room and wait one hour for a new room. Said ok b/c we just felt gross about staying in that room. In retrospect, this makes no sense--why couldn't they just call me when a new room became ready? 3) Moved all my stuff out of the room, waited an hour then spoke to desk. Now, I am told that there's no other rooms available in the Premier but they could move me to the Millennium side. I was actually referred to the hotel manager which I thought would improve things, but she told me she'd like to give me an upgraded room but they're fully booked so they can only give me a standard room on a lower floor. 4) Get to the room and it smells like smoke. But at least it looks like it's been well cleaned. However, there's no comforter on the bed. Call housekeeping twice and after about 30 minutes they bring up a comforter. 5) Around 8pm when about to head to dinner I finally notice that there's no bath towels in the bathroom. Oh well, I figure I'll just call housekeeping. when we come back. 6) At 11pm we return to room and I call housekeeping. Front desk answers and replies to my request for towels by saying the laundry service was late today and they're delivering towels to all rooms now. 7) 20 minutes later I call front desk again and ask if I can just come down and get towels and they tell me the towels are not at the front desk. I ask if I can go to housekeeping and they say no, that's back of the house. Claim that they'll call housekeeping and ask them to come to my room. 8) 10 minutes later I walk down to the front desk and tell them this is ridiculous, its 11:30pm and we have no towels. Guy there says \"how many do you need\" and then grabs two for me from behind the front desk. So they basically lied when they told me earlier that the towels were not available at the front desk. I will say that the location of the property is great and the manager at least offered to allow me continued access to the Premier Hotel lounge as well as free internet (after I asked).

We made the reservation through a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd third-party booking website in early May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the moment that we saw a very reasonable rate for a four-star hotel in December. When we found that we would be staying at the Millennium, we read lots of Tripadvisor reviews and were somewhat concerned. We are older travelers, and one of us has serious medical and mobility issues; travel is always a challenge, and we rely upon front-desk and other hotel staff to help us. We were impressed that Melanie Turner, Director of Front Office Operations, responds to Tripadvisor reviews and so, two weeks before our arrival, we contacted Melanie through Tripadvisor. We requested a coffee maker so that medication could be taken as required and, because we spend more time in our room than lots of people, we asked if a room with a Times Square view might be available. Before we arrived, Melanie responded with a lovely message confirming that we would have a coffee maker and a room with a view. But we were totally unprepared for our gorgeous corner room on the 49th floor that had an unbelievable view of Times Square, the Paramount Building, and the Hudson River skyline. We spent many hours sitting in the comfortable armchairs enjoying that unbelievable view. And we were thrilled to find a treat-laden welcome tray in our room after dinner on our first evening \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a card welcoming us and enclosing a card for breakfast for one morning. We were so impressed with Melanie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughtfulness and her efforts to ensure that we had as wonderful a trip as possible, including finding that our room was available at 1:30 when we arrived and that we could stay past the usual checkout time of 12:00 noon on our day of departure. We have sometimes found it difficult to manage in large, big-city hotels, but Melanie made sure that we felt welcomed and cared-for. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thank her enough. In terms of the room itself, it was very large and extremely clean, with everything in good repair. We were very pleased to find two comfortable armchairs, as noted above. The bed was indeed firm, but we found it very comfortable; we thought that only the pillows could have been improved. There was lots of room in the bathroom for toiletries and to move around, and there was a full-size tub/shower. Front desk staff were friendly and responsive at check-in and throughout our stay, and every person we interacted with at the bellman/porter station and the concierge desk was friendly, helpful, and responsive. We left our luggage for a few hours after checking out, and the staff were friendly and efficient on a very busy Sunday. The buffet breakfast has something for everyone, and the quality of the food and coffee was outstanding. In every respect, we found that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service and amenities were four-star. We will be talking and reminiscing about our wonderful New York weekend for a very long time to come; it was our best trip to New York ever. As travel has become more difficult for us, we approach each trip with greater anxiety, but we needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have worried about the Millennium Broadway. We hope that Tripadvisor members give the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management and staff the chance to make their visits memorable, too. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel highly enough.

The rooms were fine on both sides. Yes there was a stain on the floor in our first room, but big deal...the rooms get used and things happen. Should the hotel change the carpet every time someone spills something on the floor? Do you have stains on the carpets at your house? I think we all do at some point. Anyways, we had a view of Times Square from the 6th floor on the preferred side which is funny that some guy said there was no view anywhere in the hotel of Times Square. I open my curtains and had a prefect view of the New Years ball and some of the big bright billboards. The hotel does not smell of sewage in the rooms nor in the lobby. It's clean and just fine. The staff at the front desk were great with us on both occasions. The one doorman, can't remember his name, was great as well.

The hotel is well located if you want to be in Times Square between 6th and Broadway/7th, and for several reasons we decided to be on this visit. The nice thing is that it is steps to Times Square on one side if you are heading to Broadway shows, and 6th Ave on the other. The pros are that the hotel lobby, elevators and room were clean, with friendly service, fast elevators, nice flat screen TVs in the room and steps to a Starbucks and two excellent Italian and French restaurants. The beds were a little firm but fine, as were the linens, and we all slept well. The bathroom was nice, a decent size with large marble sink and counter so plenty of space to lay out stuff for all four of us. Towels were of nice quality. We were able to open windows and let the breeze in. View was fine from our room on the 38th floor...not stellar but we had a bit of a view into Times Square and the area buildings and roof decks. Cons were lack of a coffee maker (although I found out later a friend's room had one so maybe it was being repaired or something) but with a Starbucks just outside the 45th St entrance, I wouldn't have made coffee in the room anyway. Also, there were 4 accessible electrical outlets, and we made it work, but 4 people charging cell phones and laptops had to coordinate times a bit. So, in summary, if you want to be in Times Square, and the room price is right at the time you book, then no reason not to stay at the Millennium, but no reason to race there either. Personally, I'll be back at one of my many preferred hotels (Algonquin and Iroquis, Hilton, Westin, Warwick, Omni) where I'm more comfortable on most of my trips, but good to know that this is an acceptable backup.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cWhat a dump!\u201d", "Author": "Charlotty5k", "ReviewID": "UR121068128", "Content": "Don't book this dump.

Right next door to the Toys R Us (excellent cupcakes bottom floor.. to die for.) and steps from ABC news and the lights and action of Time Square. (If you dont like crowds this is not the place for you, I left my hubby at home because of this) We had a King room which was pretty enormous from what we were expecting. Plenty of room for the two of us and we could have easily roomed a 3rd person no problem. We only had a view of the building being built across the street, it was quite entertaining to watch (for a few minutes) the roof top crane operator work.. (dont know how those guys do it, hats off.) Hotel was spotless, elevators fast. My only issue was trying to call the front desk, conceirge desk or housekeeping from room , many times over 2 day period I never got an answer via phone. But walk down to lobby and they were always happy to help.... Would have been nice not to have to leave my room to ask for a few towels or classes etc.. Another slight problem that I did not enjoy was walking across the street to get coffee but I discovered an awesome deli (cant remember the name) they had great coffee, and bakery treats which I thoroughly enjoyed. No coffee maker in room and the lounge/ restaurant in hotel did not have any to go cups on my first morning... and pretty much told me I was out of luck in getting coffee and had to go across the street. Which I did with my loungers and slippers... not a pretty sight.... We saw all the sites, shows, tourist attractions , subways, double decker buses, and really feel this was a good location to be based out of. My daughter had a very memorable 16th birthday and is eager to go back to NYC and I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting the Big Apple experience!!!!!!

We booked a stay through Hotels.ca for a king room at a rate of $296.00 per eve. We asked for a high floor....and not to be near an elevator. I also asked for two beds...on the website it offered either two twin or one king. We arrived with Dial 7 limo service from LaGuardia at approx. 4:30pm on a Friday. Dial 7 is the best way to go. $29.00 plus tip, and tolls...came to $43.00.(their cheapest car) We were greeted coolly at first, by the front desk, but the conversation warmed somewhat as it went on. I asked if we could have the two beds, and the gentleman came back to announce we could. Getting to our room, we were beside an elevator, and not on the higher floor....but at least we got the two beds. I have read here that the hotel is looking \"tired\"...and yes, the rooms need an update, but they are fairly clean. We had no bedspreads, but we didn't mind at all. One of the comforters needed replacing...no fill left...and same was replaced that evening. One light bar was out in the bathroom, and it was replaced shortly afterwards by maintenance. The room was a good size for New York City standards. The beds were either 3/4 or maybe double....at least not single, which was great. We had some storage...two drawers, and a closet. Our two suitcases were stored on the sides of the walls. There is no luggage rack. We found the rooms dark, but that was ok. If we peeked to the left, we could see the lights of Times Square, which my son loved. The bathroom was a fair size. Plenty big for one. Lots of counter-top storage area. There was a hair-blower...good power to it..shampoo, 2 soaps, conditioner, and 1 lotion. There is a fridge, but if you move items, you will be charged for these items. There is no complimentary bottled water offered, which I found to be chinzy...as the very small bottled water I had, and my son't tiny orange juice he had, came to $11.00. There is a deli accross the street on 44th...go there and get your water. You can put it on the window ledge at night this time of year...it will keep cold....they will bring in another fridge for you ...we read...but space is limited, so opted to use the window ledge. There is a good size flat screen T.V. in the room. We used it twice. The beds are hard...very hard...but, we were so exhausted from sight seeing each day, we slept fine. The maid service is wonderful and friendly here. The woman taking care of our room talked with my son each day near the elevator when we saw her. She went out of her way to smile and ask us how we were etc. Some of the door men were pushy...and some were very friendly and caring. One fellow at the concierge desk was a bit arrogant, but that did not put us off....as the door man was our next contact, and he was very nice. The first morning we brought items from the deli into our room. There is also a Starbucks on 45th...go out the back entrance to the hotel....I didn't see it until the last day there! Room Service: We did order room service our second morning. We had scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon, juice and coffee for $24.00 each....However, there is an 18% charge added and then a $3.00 service charge added on top of that. As we were getting ready for early mornings outings ..I just went ahead and ordered. The fellow who brought the tray in was friendly, but still lingered for a tip...nope! not with it added....so just beware. The second day we ordered...not good....the gal on the phone told us hash browns came with our eggs benedict. I ordered both meals with hard cooked eggs. I also asked for cream for my coffee and got a side of toast, and side of bacon....It came to $89.00!!! Eggs runny, toast cold, no cream., no hash browns...but, we were in a bit of a rush. I got my son to sign for the bill as I was in the shower when the food came. When I got out - I received a phone call from a the same very snooty woman who told me I could not sign for anything in the hotel as I did not have a CC on file. I told her there was one put there the first day. She said a few other things....that made me feel like a small child being scolded. I told her about our meal...I was at first not going to phone and complain...but now I was. She told me to go ahead and complain...WOW....anyhow...after talking with the manager,,,and then the room service manager, we did receive the meal for free. I thought they handled it very well, and quickly Now, I didn't get my coffee, nor have my eggs or toast or hash browns, but at least I did not have to pay for it as well. Be careful of the charges. Very expensive for what you receive here. We found that the room was a bit tired (carpet, walls, bath tiles etc) but fine, most of the employees were friendly, the hotel is situated well, and the amount per eve, was quite good off of Hotels.ca....so all in all a good stay. I would not pay more than $300.00 per night - all in though. We got one of their car services back to the airport (LaGuardia). We were charged $43.00 for it...with tip...$50.00. ...so Dial 7 was a better deal. The driver however, was just wonderful. The service is inconsistent...and would rather give 3.5 stars...but .5 is not an option:). I am bringing another son to NYC...possibly in the spring...may stay here...may not...depends on price I guess. .", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sayville, NY", "Title": "\u201cNot worth my money... but there was a positive side...\u201d", "Author": "Baker-Mayy", "ReviewID": "UR120601591", "Content": "Positive side first..

When the time to stay drew near, I tried contacting Ms. Melanie Turner thru email to voice my concern and send my requests. She assured me that we will all be well taken cared of and that all our 3 rooms will be to our liking. My worries are all for naught. From the time of check-in til the time that we have to leave, we felt very important to them. Terrance processed our check-in with warmth and enthusiasm. We were assigned 3 superior corner rooms. 5101,5104 and 5118. The views in the rooms are awesome. Some reviewers say that the bed is firm. Yes its true that the bed is firm but it is very good for aching backs after a long day of exploring NYC and we had the best sleep. Melanie even threw in some perks after she found out we were celebrating special events during our stay. We were not able to use all but the gesture was very much appreciated. Security was good, they even went up to check why our doors when we left it open. And when we had slight problem with the room key, they asked for identification before changing the keys. We had to leave our bags in their storage area and they don't let anybody in since there is also a camera for security to monitor the luggage room. Location is perfect, walking distance to food, shops, transpo and entertainment. If you want to be featured in Good Morning America, prepare in advance your banner and wake up early, its just around the corner. Walgreens,subway are open 24hours for a quick bite. Forever 21 is open til 2am,sephora til 12 midnight. If you don't mind the craziness of Times Square and would rather opt for convenience, Millennium is the place for you. A major subway line is also nearby which can bring you to Central Park and Battery park without changing lines. Radio City, Rockefeller Center, Fifth avenue,Restaurant row are within walking distance not to mention most of the broadway theaters. Elevators can be a bit busy during morning rush hour so just allot some time if you need to go somewhere on time. I left tips everyday for housekeeping to make sure our room is cleaned everyday.

Two very small niggles, c.8.30 to 9.00 morning be prepared to wait a good five minutes for the lifts, they arrive but are packed. Eventually, we boarded lifts going up just to get a place when it was going back down! Secondly we requested a late check out but the most we were given was an extra hour, when I asked the desk clerk if it was possible to check out mid afternoon he said that it would be classed as an extra day and cost $275!

The Millennium staff was very attentive and congenial. They provided excellent service. I especially liked that they check everyone coming in after 10pm to make sure they are a current guest of the hotel. The breakfast was advertised as a continental breakfast. It was much more. Served buffet-style, selections included cold cereals, yogurt, pastries, fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, omelets, sausage links and bacon, lox, bagels and cream cheese. The hotel location was excellent - just a few steps away from Times Square with entrances on both 44th and 45th Streets. Our room was on the 45th floor. Although we could see only a sliver of Times Square, the room was a nice size and the bathroom was large. I liked that the granite vanity counter could accommodate make-up and toiletries for 2 women with no problem. The photos of the room had me worried that the 2 beds were twin size, but they were actually full size ... and very comfortable. My only criticism is that they charged $12.95 per 24 hours for internet access. With a room rate averaging $500 a night, charging extra for internet access just seems greedy. Since nearly everyone these days needs internet access, the service should be included in the room rate (as it was at the aforementioned Hampton).", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cShowing its age\u201d", "Author": "DonnPearlman", "ReviewID": "UR118578981", "Content": "I've stayed at the Millennium Broadway a half dozen times in recent years.

To me, in my neck of the woods in Florida, this is an 80-90 dollar room -- but consider the positives. You're in a nice, safe place in Midtown Manhattan, right off Times Square. You're going to pay for that, obviously -- and we did. My room was small -- it was in the \"premier\" section. It was nice, just small. I faced 44th Street, right next to the famous theatre. The good stuff? Classy place downstairs, no doubt. Lots of options in the building -- food, shopping, you name it. My room was solid -- impressive bathroom, good sleeping bed. The business/desk was average and the chair was one of the most uncomfortable I've ever had to work from, that was one thing. It just didn't seem to be set up for anything somebody would need to work from, business wise -- but hey, it's probably more for tourists, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The room service was expensive as hell, like everything is in NYC -- but I will say this, the food was OUTSTANDING and very, very fast. They say 30 minutes but they're there in 10-15 each time. Great food. Nice people too. I'm clueless about cabs and all of that, being from the south, so I called the concierge about 5 times the night before I left before I got a human being to give me some advice. Thought that was weird for a place this classy downstairs. Front desk always referred me to the concierge too, so it was a bit of a runaround. All things considered, the location of course is outstanding, the rooms are solid, you name it. I'd definitely go back if I come through that part of NYC -- since this IS NYC. ALSO, here's some important info --- do NOT pay more than 40ish for a cab to La Guardia. I got duped into 55. The clerk said he's seen non-locals get screwed over for as much as 250 (wow).

There are Subway stations nearby, or taxis are easy to get right in front of the hotel if you prefer that. The rooms are nice and modern, with a flat screen tv and cable. The bed was very comfortable and had a nice fluffy comforter on it. Traffic noise was minimal and never kept us up at night. We were on the 32nd floor and had a nice view of the Chrysler building and the Times Square new year's ball. I think there are 52 floors total. The rooms aren't that big, but big rooms in NY are not that common. There was plenty of room for our 2 suitcases, a king sized bed, a dresser, a table, a chair, and a closet to hang up some clothes. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were left. The only negative was when we arrived there were ashes on the floor of the bathroom, like someone had been smoking in there earlier in the day. Not a big deal. No coffee machine in the room. The mini fridge was packed so no room for our bottled water. We used the ice bucket as our \"cooler\". There is also a 24 hour gym on premises if you didn't get enough walking in during the day. So if you are looking for quiet, clean, and safe in the theater district this is a great spot. It was about a 30 minute ride from La Guardia airport.

We didn't spend too much time in the room as we were only there for one night & by the time I had a chance to look over things, it was 12am. I used the restroom only to find there was a constant dripping on my back from above. There was a clear wet spot in the ceiling coming most likely from the bathroom above. Gross. When I called to speak with someone I was \"transferred\" to the Front Desk Manager, which apparently means I sit on hold for 5 min while the phone rings. It's was 12am. I can't imagine it was very busy down there. I called again and before I could explain I was again transferred to an endless number of rings. I gave up until about an hour later when I actually went downstairs. The manager sent up a plumber, after I tried explaining to him that the toilet was not the problem, and a plumber wouldn't help. I would've thought they would have at least offered to switch rooms. Instead, a plumber was sent up at 1am who was expecting a toilet issue and immediately realized there was nothing he could. To make matters worse this was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. My partner and I both woke up with back pains and we have both stayed in a variety of hotels.

The amenities list show that there is a mini-fridge in the room but this is a little deceiving. The fridge is filled with drinks and is motion sensitive. Once you remove or even just move anything in the fridge, you get charged automatically. Which means you can't use the fridge to store personal things. It says to call housekeeping if you need a fridge but it doesn't say that they'll charge you a flat fee of $25 for it. Same for the snacks in the drawer, be careful to not move anything if you don't intend on buying them. The elevators were a little old but they were still fast. The location was awesome. There are two entrances to the hotel, one on 45th and one on 44th. The hotel was right next to a Starbucks, and this is where we went to get free wi-fi instead of paying for it at the hotel.

There are small instances of wear and tear, not enough to bother me (and I'm picky about cleanliness and newness), but enough that I could see someone be unhappy if they paid a lot for the room or were expecting a five-star hotel experience (the Millennium feels like a solid four-star-level hotel to me). The room included a standard size safe, a flat screen TV, and two leather easy chairs. There was plenty of room for my son's mini crib, with room left over. We never felt cramped. The front desk people were nice and helpful, including letting us check in early. We did have trouble getting the mini crib delivered to our room (it took three calls over three or four hours to get it done, even though I reserved the crib as part of the reservation and confirmed it upon check in), but the front desk clerk we spoke to last and the guy who eventually delivered the crib both apologized and seemed upset that it took so long. And it was the decisive action of the front desk clerk that eventually got the crib delivered. The hotel had several computers on the second floor on which you could buy Internet access, but it was free to print boarding passes, which was a nice amenity. I didn't eat or drink in the lobby bar, but it looked nice, and there was a little sundry/gift shop in the lobby that was nice to have (we bought some drinks there). The location of the hotel, 44th between Sixth and Seventh, is convenient for mass transportation, as there is virtually no subway line you can't easily access from there. But the hotel is in the heart of Times Square, as it is much closer to Seventh than Sixth, so that means hordes of tourists. There are some neighborhood delis on 45th between Fifth and Sixth, as well as a Duane Read drugstore (that had some food items) on Sixth between 44th and 45th, so you can avoid Times Square to some extent to find what you might need.

A few weeks before the trip, reports on TripAdvisor were not complimentary and we expressed our concerns to our travel agent who contacted the hotel direct. We were reassured by e-mail (Robert Bove - Reservation Sales Associate) that everything would be done to ensure we had a great visit and advised that our room had been upgraded. We arrived on 22nd June and booked into room 3007. We have to agree that the room matched the description of some TripAdvisor reports in that it was 'tired', and not up to the standard of other 4 star hotels we have used. If this was an upgrade, I can only assume that the original room allocated would have been bordering shabby. Granted the room appeared to be clean, but there was a hairgrip (not ours!) on the floor of the bathroom, behind the door, which remained there during our 5 nights stay - along with another one by the door to the hotel room. We also had 20 minutes of telephone madness, around mid-night one evening, when we were all asleep. The telephone rang 4 times within 20 minutes. Twice I answered the phone to music and no-one on the other end, and twice I answered to find other hotel guests on the other end who had also answered their ringing phone! One poor fellow, who was also awoken by the telephone, was just as suprised as me when he realised that I had not called him and he had not called me! I then called the operator to ask what was going on to be told, quite curtly, that she had not put any calls through to our room; however she did then ensure we had a 'do not disturb' on the phone until the following morning. To summarise, the location was brilliant, service okay, but ask to stay in one of the rooms pictured on their website and hope that the reality matches the image, because room 3007 did not look anything like the pictures.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brazil", "Title": "\u201cDon't come back if you are looking for a hotel experience\u201d", "Author": "IndienBrazil", "ReviewID": "UR114660316", "Content": "We would like our hotel stay experience to be better than home and that prompts us to select hotels while we travel.

After arriving from JFK via LIRR and subway, the front desk allowed for us to check-in early at 10am, even though official check-in is not until 4pm. Our room was located on the 29th floor. Immediately, we knew we weren't in a 4-star hotel, indicative by the interior design and general decor of hotel. But, we didn't care. Paying $250/night via Priceline.com and we were happy to stay 3 nights for less than $800. Front desk even waived the $12.95 daily internet wireless access if we signed up for their loyalty members club, which we gladly did. The hotel cleanliness felt decent. Floors seemed to be free of debris. A few problems, however: the TV remote had to be at least two feet from the sensor to even function properly. The right nightstand lamp's bulb was out. The bathroom didn't have a vent and the heat lamp was inoperable. What can I expect for a \"bargain\" 3-star hotel, right? One annoyance we had was that we had brought our own two personal pillows from home, which came with relatively expensive ($60 per pillow) pillowcases. We had forgotten to put the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door and when we came back from an afternoon of traveling the city, our pillows, albeit still there, was without our pillow cases. Instead, housekeeping replaced it with their own standard pillowcases. We called housekeeping and had them \"try to search for it\". I knew it was nearly impossible, since they were the same size AND color. But the person on the phone did say she'll check with the manager and call us back... which never happened. Fast forward 24-hrs later and nothing yet. We called again and housekeeping told us to call back after 10am to file a complaint. Our flight was at 1030am that same day so we left without a resolution. We flew back to SF and bought a new pair of pillowcases, which added an extra $100 to our $750 spent in this hotel.

It's very convenient to most things in Manhattan, but still the actual streets its on are quieter because its not directly in Times Square. As for the hotel itself, it's decent, just make sure your expectations aren't too high. Rooms are mostly clean (though don't look at the dust under your bed or headboard!) And things are just a little worn, but nothing that really bothered me. Just regular wear and tear. Beds, pillows, and bedding are all in good shape, though the matress is a little hard. We were on the 38th floor, and things were quiet and we all slept great. There is also a nice flatscreen tv in your room. The bathroom was also quite nice. The granite countertop was long with plenty of room for all of our stuff, and the shower actually had a double shower curtain so you didn't end up slopping water all over the floor like you do at most hotels. Know that if you want a coffee maker, they aren't in your room, but you can request one. Service was quite friendly when we were there. They were able to accomodate us for a late checkout, but not an early check in. If your waiting around for them to call you to check in, don't. They said they'd call us but forgot. Luckily we asked again if our room was clean, after the allotted time had passed, and it was. The hotel restaurant was very empty most of the time, and seemed to have a limited and unimpressive menu. If you don't want to go far, there are some decent restaurants across the street. Times Square Deli, Virgil's Barbecue, and even a Starbucks.

Five hours later we return and the room was still not ready but the front desk said give us a half an hour and it would be. An hour later and they said it was good to go, we got the room key and headed up. We opened the door and surprise, it was still dirty.

They gave us a corner room on the 40th floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building (everyone else's reviews say the Empire State Building and I originally thought the same, but my girlfriend who is an NYC resident corrected me on this point) and the NYE 2011 ball. We had a nice view of a few Times Square flashy billboards, but the drapes had no problem blocking out the lights at night time. The room itself had a cute and clean modern decor. New-looking carpet and bedding, as well as a nice oversized leather chair and ottoman. Our room had two twin-sized beds, but they were much larger than any twin I'd seen before. Somewhere between a twin and a full. It was a perfect sleeping situation for my sister and myself. I found the duvet cover to be plenty warm during the night and had no problem adjusting the heater to fit our needs. The bathroom was clean with ample fresh towels. The tile around the sink is a little dated, but I can't see how that would interfere with anyone's use and enjoyment of the room. It's NYC and the hotel has been around for a couple decades; it's not unfathomable that the bathrooms might have old tile. For $150 a night, right in the heart of Times Square, I can handle old bathroom tile in a room that is otherwise perfect and well-maintained. Upon check-out, I noticed that our invoice had an incorrect $30 charge for a bottle of vodka from the mini bar. We'd been storing some Gatorades in the mini bar fridge, and I think it must have confused the maid as to its contents. I called down to the front desk, and they removed the charge without a moment's hesitation. They didn't argue with me for even a second; they just said that they would remove it immediately and were true to their word. I appreciated that. We left the hotel at 6:30am to get to JFK for an 8:30am flight.

For the price I paid, I think I got a good value for my money. While I like to occasionally splurge & stay at top star hotels, but being that this was my first trip to New York my top priority was to splurge on Broadway, attractions and restaurants. I was in New York to enjoy everything outside the hotel! So for a place where I could rest comfortably and feel safe for the night, that was clean and close to major attractions, Millennium Broadway met my expectations. We booked out stay using Priceline's Negotiator and we would have been okay with the standard room assigned to us, but the front desk employee (I forget his name, but he is a big San Francisco 49er fan) who checked us in, offered us an upgrade to room with a better view on the 43rd floor. We arrived during a weekend that was NYC was experiencing frigid temperatures, so this was a warm surprise! He was very hospitable, and we had a nice conversation about where we were from and football. Check in was fast and easy. We stayed in room 4305, a corner room with a view of the Empire State to the left, Rockefeller Plaza straight ahead, and the Paramount building to the right. I would have to say the hotel has a masculine, Art Deco feel with its black marble all over the lobby and bathrooms. As for the room, it was nicely decorated in copper and orange color scheme. It was small for its size, but it fit 2 single beds, a leather chair, a desk, and a chest of drawers with a flat screen TV on top. Like the other reviewers have said, the bed consisted of a flat sheet, duvet cover, 2 standard pillows, and a decorative pillow (not high thread count quality). It was satisfactory, our Heater/AC worked fine, so we had no issues if we were too hot or cool in bed. The electronics were standard, flat screen TV, with a handful of cable channels. I think they should upgrade their alarm clocks to iPod/mp3 compatible docks. The bathroom was okay- good water temperature but it had a weak shower head. The bathroom in our room could really use an air vent! During my stay I didn't notice anything that screamed \"GROSS!\" For the most part, everything was kept clean and stain free. Most importantly, NO BED BUGS! I hate it when I'm at a hotel and the staff is either: too cold and unapproachable, or uncomfortably friendly for the sake of customer service. Service wise, hotel staff were accessible and hospitable when you needed them. We interacted with the Theater Tickets staff, Concierge, Bellmen and Housekeeping who we enjoyed having conversations with. They took a moment to see how we were doing, and if we were enjoying our stay. Other things worth mentioning- The hotel is centrally located in Times Square but on a less car/foot traffic street. Wifi is available for $12.95 for 24 hours. Good signal & high speed. If you have an evening flight, you can check out at 12pm & leave your luggage with the Bellhops at the lobby. They securely store it for you until you leave for the airport. The doorman can assist you to hail a cab or a car service for a ride to the airport. Our awesome doorman arranged for a Mercedes SUV to drive us to JFK for $62 all inclusive, on the spot! Nearby attractions: Toys R Us, Minksoff Theater (Lion King), National Debt Clock, MTA subway at 42nd Street, Walgreens & Duane Reed (1 block away), Starbucks (45th, 44th Broadway) If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go through the hassle of searching for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Broadway seats, purchase with the Theater Ticket staff by the elevators.

We booked this trip as a surprise for our young daughter who had heard so much about NYC from us as we used to live in the city. Her Christmas birthday provided a great excuse for our first family trip back to NY. I was excited to receive a wonderful deal through travelzoo for this hotel - which we had previously had a good experience with. The room we requested through travelzoo was with a king-sized bed. Upon checking in, the friendly clerk offered us a rollaway bed since he saw we were travelling with our daughter. We gladly accepted. He said nothing about a charge. Later that night when we returned to the room, the bed hadn't yet been delivered. We called the front desk and the front desk manager told us there would be $35 fee for the bed. We explained that we weren't told that when we checked in, and that the clerk just offered the bed. She wouldn't budge, which surprised me because for $35 you would think they would just send up the bed as a courtesy, but no. In fact while on the line she made a point of noting that we had booked through travelzoo, received a discounted rate, and had asked for a king room. At this point we just said, fine, please just send us the bed. When we checked out four nights later imagine our surprise when the invoice slipped under our door listed $35 for EACH NIGHT of our stay with a curt note under each line stating \"guest was informed.\" We called the front desk and again received no help. The clerk even made snide comments to us such as \"how many nights were you staying\" (which he could tell from the invoice) so that when we responded \"four\" he said \"hmmmm. well, that's $35 a night.\" It didn't matter that I tried to explain that initially we were told of no charge and later was just told $35. Anyone would have assumed that the $35 rate was flat - she definitely did not specify it was per night of stay. He put me on hold for over 10 minutes and then I was disconnected. We ended up stranded in NYC for another couple of days due to the blizzard and for convenience's sake we would have stayed at this hotel even with losing the travelzoo discount, but I was so unhappy with the customer service that we moved to another hotel - paying $150 per night more than we had at the Millennium, but enjoying superior service.

I lived in New York for awhile a few years back and chose this hotel for my return trip because of its great location. It is right in the heart of Times Square and yet, it doesn't have sky high Times Square prices. We paid $300/night for a room with two beds on the 30th floor. This is an older property, but it has been remodeled so it doesn't feel old. The rooms have flat screen TVs, duvets, a nice sitting area and was quite spacious, especially for NYC standards. While all of these features were very nice, the room still had old an old-fashioned alarm clock (an Ipod compatible alarm clock is standard these days) and the bathroom still felt older (which was a bit odd because the rest of the room seemed modern). However, the bathroom was large with a big mirror and lots of counter space (although only 1 sink) so that was nice. We wanted a fridge in our room to keep drinks cold so we had to pay a one time fee of $20 for a fridge to be delivered. Something to keep in mind ... Also something to keep in mind - the beds. They were relatively hard! I expect more from an alleged \"4 star\" hotel. Another perk: the room was very quiet. However, the long and the short of it is that this is a hotel in NYC - one of the most exciting cities in the world. So you aren't going to spend that much time in the room. Given this factor, all of these amenities aren't really that important. Which matters more is the location. And this hotel has a fabulous Times Square location and is very close to Bryant Park and the 42nd Street and 6th Avenue subway stops.

The room heat was up way too high (even though it was Winter and I appreciated it not matching the outside temperature, but it was like a steam room).

Very professional, very courteous. he actually seems to care that your trip is as great as it can be. Now for the things that weren't so spectacular. We had 2 rooms. One room was available at 3:00 the other they said would be available at 4:00. No big deal. However, 4:00 rolled around, then 5:00, then 5:30 and still they could not seem to find out when this room would be ready. I finally walked to the room myself and discovered that whoever had checked out that morning had left a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door therefore housekeeping did not clean it. When i called the front desk and informed them of this they sent housekeeping to it and had it cleaned so we did not get our second room until 6:00 and I am not sure that we ever would have if I had not gone myself to check on it. Secondly, the safe in our room did not work. And finally, the bed was way to hard for my liking. It really boils down to what you are looking for in a hotel. If you are looking for a perfect location at a decent price(for New York that is) and can overlook a few things then this is the place for you. If, on the other hand, you are looking for that ultimate luxury hotel experience you would probably be better off elsewhere. To the review that talks about being charged for things they did not use out of the mini bar in the room: at the front desk it plainly states on signs that you can't miss that the bars are equipped with sensors and if you move anything you will be charged for it. My suggestion is to not move anything in there if you do not plan on drinking it. We heeded the sign and did not move anything and were not charged a dime. Would I stay here again?

Our room had floor to ceiling windows and was a lot larger than other rooms I have stayed in when in NYC. Had a lovely huge bed, as well as nice sized bathroom. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and courteous with any request we had. If you are planning on getting a taxi to the airports I would recommend asking the hotel to order you a car. The one that took us was a lot more comfortable than a yellow taxi and cost exactly the same. I've put a few pictures up to help set give an idea of the room quality.

I have never written a review before. I travel a lot, but I have never been more compelled to warn fellow travelers. Room DOES NOT look like any promotional photo I've seen anywhere. Where are the rooms in the pictures? I literally teared up when I saw the room and realized we wouldn't have time to change hotels before we had to get to an event we came to town for. I asked the bellman if there were some other rooms that had been renovated and maybe my room was one that had not? He said it had been renovated a year and a half ago? I asked if there were any nicer rooms or if they were all like mine with dirty carpet, walls, etc. and he said they all looked like mine, but some rooms on higher floors had new headboards. Um, the headboard was the least of my concerns. Out of fairness I would try to balance this review with the positives, but as far as the room is concerned, there were not any. I will post some pictures which pretty much speak for themselves. We wore socks the entire time, i used a dog blanket from the car instead of the duvet which had no cover on it (and i'm sure is not regularly washed), i took a shower standing on a towel! thank goodness i had some anti bacteria wipes in my purse so I could use the remote control and wipe down a few things. I don't drink, but i had a drink with dinner in the hopes i would pass out and not have to think about how grossed out i was sleeping there. Check-in was a pain too. We checked in at 5pm. i reserved 2 beds. Didn't want to share a bed with my mom, thanks. I reconfirmed the 2 beds a day or 2 prior. Get to the desk and they want to put me in a king. I ask how long the wait might be if we decide to wait for a double room to become available? She doesn't know. I ask if a room is expected to be available that night? don't know. then she says they are \"low\" on double rooms. They weren't even out of double rooms and shes giving me a hard time. So I asked if I could have one of these available rooms and she had to ask a manager. that takes a bit of time. the people behind me are annoyed. i think there was only one other person at the front desks. So finally we get the room but really, what are they holding on to the rooms for? Obviously this was no VIP room they needed to keep open. A little more about the room before i sign off-- no duvet covers on the very thin, beigh/tan comforters. At least with covers, you kind of feel like there's a chance they wash those every once in a while. But I doubt these comforters are washed regularly just because it isn't practical and especially in a place like this. Carpet spotted, stained and dingy. Dreary color scheme. brown, tan, off white and then there is the nightmarish abstract \"art\" on the walls. just black and white splatters. Very cheerful. Not. Really brightened up the room. not. I just looked at the promo pics again. they show rooms with duvet covers, throw blankets at the foot of the bed, reading lights in the headboards, desks, desk chairs. My room had NONE of these things. How's that for bait and switch. Somewhere in the written hotel description they use the word \"tranquil\". Um, no. The fact that there was some sort of band playing outside until 2am is not the hotels fault, but they also shouldn't imply that the noise from the city is magically blocked out. They do not have any special noise reducing windows, etc. I have no idea where the music was coming from, but from the 35th floor I could make out the lyrics word for word. It was that loud. I'm really sooo disappointed. I do not understand how a hotel gets away with such a bait and switch. I book a lot of travel for people at the financial company I work at. I'm so glad it was me that found out about this hotel. If I had sent my bosses to a hotel like this, there would be repercussions. The room really affected the quality of my trip to NYC. While we were away from the hotel, I was dreading going back. And even though I'm home in my nice clean house, writing about this is even giving me the creeps. 6/30 - It's 2 weeks later now and the experience still bothers me every time I think about the trip. I did my research before booking this hotel. I saw photos. My mother rarely travels and so I wanted her to have a nice time--not to have to worry that she forgot and almost got out of bed without putting socks on before her feet touched the floor. I emailed the concierge about 7-10 days ago to ask for an email address of someone in management that I could forward this review to. I have not received a response, but I'm not surprised. Just today someone asked me about that trip (FYI Millennium, she also books tons of corporate travel to NY) the first thing out of my mouth was how horrible the hotel was. Last week I booked travel for some of the people in my office. The hotel they normally stay at was booked and they wanted something close to our offices in NY and near enough to the park for jogging. If I had a good experience at this hotel, I would have booked it for my Team in a minute. So on top of leaving me with a bad memory, the hotel lost out on a 3 night stay for 7 people. 21 rooms. As well as any future business my office could have given them. Hope the money they save by not cleaning, getting rid of ripped sheets, changing ruined carpets, removing spider webs, etc. is worth the money, the loss of business, and their reputation.

I got to the hotel around 2 and was told the room wouldn't be ready until 4, so I checked my luggage and came back after 4. Since I had a Priceline reservation, I wasn't expecting a good room and didn't get one. They put me on the 18th floor (the 3rd floor of rooms) and it was a handicapped room. Fine, that's the price I pay for the relatively low price (~$150/nt below their website price). The first night was fine although the bed was very hard, the hardest I have seen in a chain hotel. The next morning I tried to turn on the TV to watch the news while getting ready and it didn't work. I called the front desk after I got back from breakfast and they quickly sent up maintenance and the guy was able to reboot the system and get it working. I was still having problems with the remote so he said he would come back with fresh batteries. So far so good and I was pretty happy with my stay. I headed out at noon to meet a friend staying at another hotel. At 1:30 in the morning I came back after being gone for 13 hours and my room door was wide open. It wasn't like it just didn't quite latch tight, the door was visibly open. I was obviously freaked out and went in and made sure all my stuff was in there (fortunately my laptop was in the safe). Nothing was missing, but apparently the maintenance guy had left the door open after putting new batteries in the remote. You would think closing the room door behind them would be pretty high on their priority list, right? I called the front desk to complain, it took a couple calls before anyone answered and his basic attitude was \"yeah, so?\" They didn't seem particularly concerned, I guess it happens a lot there. Also greeting me in the room was EXTREMELY LOUD music, I may as well have had a jukebox with a big subwoofer in the room and the bass was bumping. It was coming from outside, and from what I can tell it was from a rooftop terrace about the level of my room, possibly from The Night Hotel on 45th St. By 3AM, I couldn't stand it anymore and called the front desk and the guy was like \"this is Times Square, what do you expect\". Well, I've stayed all over NYC, including twice in Times Square and never heard anything like this, not even in that same room the night before. I finally fell asleep around 4:30 even though the music was still playing. I don't know what time it finally stopped. Given that the two primary reasons you get a hotel room are to protect your belongings and to sleep, the Millennium Broadway was a major disappointment during this stay and I would not recommend them. One other minor quibble that I've encountered at other hotels too, they have a sign in the bathroom about \"saving the planet\" and saving water by not getting the towels laundered every day if you put the towel on the rack, so I did and they gave me a clean towel (and removed my used one) anyways.

I didn't get that far... The hotel's website provides customers with comfort that if you book through the website, they guarantee that you are getting the best rate. The terms and conditions of their Best Price Guarantee are relatively straight forward - find a competitor who is offering a cheaper price and provided that what is being offered by the competitor is the same as that being offered on the hotel's website (ie the same room type, meals package, etc), then you can proceed to book through the hotel's website with the comfort that they will refund you the difference plus further 15%. I researched prices online and for the same room, I found that expedia.com and hotels.com were $700AUD cheaper for the 6 nights stay. I sent screenshots of the expedia.com and hotels.com offers to the hotel and asked for confirmation that this would be acceptable evidence for the purpose of their Guarantee. After 7 days I had not received a response. When I followed this up I was told (by Jackie Soberal on behalf of the hotel) that despite the terms and conditions of the hotel's Best Price Guarantee, they do not consider expedia.com and hotels.com (amongst others) as \"competitors\" for the purposes of the Best Price Guarantee. Instead, they consider them as wholesalers. This means that for the purpose of the Best Price Guarantee, there is effectively no such thing as a competitor, which renders the Best Price Guarantee useless (not to mention extremely misleading and deceptive in my honest opinion). I understand from the many reviews before mine that this is a lovely hotel in a great location (which of course is why I began researching prices to stay there myself!)

When we arrived at 1 p.m., they would not let us check in until 4 p.m. That's getting late for a check-in, and there wasn't any place to sit as there really isn't a defined lobby. Alas, we left our luggage with the bell captain. When I approached the Theater Ticket/Concierge Booth, I asked the location of our theater. She did not know but looked it up, replying only with the name of the theater. For someone not from NY, this didn't help. When I asked the address, she had to look that up again---and the theater is only one block away from the hotel. Yet, she didn't know the name of local theaters or addresses? This is sort of her job. When we did check into our room, we unpacked and were going to relax for awhile. Then, my spouse came out of the bathroom and asked if I had seen it. The blood. There was blood throughout the bathroom--on the floor, in the toilet, on the edges of the tub and sink. Someone had done some damage to themselves and while there had been a minor attempt by housekeeping to clean it up, the evidence was still visible and still present. We went down to the front desk, who did apologize (and called security) and said they would give us an \"upgrade\" for the inconvenience. This resulted in a room on a higher floor, but a smaller room and one closer to the elevator. This was not an upgrade. The bed was firm, the blanket in the closet covered in a man's black body hair, and the TV remote didn't work that well (clearly needed new batteries). But each time you left, you were reminded that you were in a great location. The staff was friendly enough, the room was adequate, and the space relatively quiet.

However, when I gave them my car I let them know that I was going to need again in 2 hours to go to my next meeting and they said, \"no problem just make sure you call down 20 minutes before you need it.\" When I went to get my car they told me I was going to have to pay ANOTHER $55.00 to retrieve my car. That was NEVER explained to me when I checked in and that is my issue. When I tried explaining to one of the people standing out there all he said to me was, \"I'M NOT CHARING YOU...the hotel is charging you.\" That comment, of course, ticked me off even more. Of course, coming from the hotel industry I know that once a guest gets upset over something they will find everything else with the room. So as far as the room goes: there was blood/coffee/soda stains splashed on the wall by the trashcan and there was hair all over the bathroom floor which doesn't make you feel like the room was very clean.

The room was beautifully decorated, quite cozy and allowed us lots of room (more than normal size hotel rooms). We had a view of the front of the hotel and enjoyed watching all the action on the street below. Our room was spotless and extra blankets and pillows were in the closet if needed. We walked out the door and up 1 1/2 blocks and were able to purchase discount theatre tickets one hour before the Friday night shows started. There is a Starbucks 1/2 block away and TGI Friday's one block away. We thought the hotel restaurant was a bit pricey, especially for breakfast, so we walked up to 46th Street and found a great little cafe that fixed us a made-to-order breakfast for $4.95 that included very good coffee and the coffee was free. It is a short walk to the bus from the Millennium and we were able to get around all over the city since we were in a prime location.

Don't get me wrong we have stayed in NYC for cheaper, but not right in Times Square. The location can't be beat...close to everything! The room that we had was very nice and modern in design. It had two beds in it, and each bed was a little bigger than a twin size bed. Perfect for two people traveling together who don't share a bed. The room was clean and nicely laid out. We had a view of Times Square from our window and the drapes pulled together nicely to keep the early morning sun out. Some thing that we think (or should I say wish) were different are/were: 1. There should be a fan in the bathroom. Taking a hot shower in there just fills the bathroom with steam and it gets so hot in there that you can't even keep the door shut. The mirror gets all foggy and it's uncomfortable to stand in there and get ready since it is so hot. 2. There should be a light in the shower area. Seriously who designs bathrooms without any light in the shower area. You can't see what you are doing in there! 3. We wish the staff would of been more friendly. Upon check in the person at the front check in desk wasn't much help at all. He didn't even tell us our room number when we checked in....thankfully it was written on our card packet. Nothing was told to us about the hotel or anything. This kind of put us off. Then upon check out we had them hold our bags while we enjoyed the city for one last afternoon. We went to pick them back up the person who was in charge of placing them in the back room was rude and seemed annoyed at the fact that they had to retrieve the bags. That was.....until I gave him a tip and then he was more than willing to help out or carry the bags to the taxi. I look back and think I should not of tipped him.

The next day we couldn't wait to get out of the room (which was much better than the smokers jail but still far far away from even getting close to a 4* hotel - again, a hole in the old carpet, dirty grout, cracked toilet..but at least no cigarettes smell), basically, even the taught of getting back to the hotel in the evening, ruined our whole day, the only good thing in this hotel was the very nice and helpful concierge who recommended on 2 good restaurants.

When you went out the front door you were on 44th street, just a half a block to your right you were in the middle of Time Square. Once you reached Time Square two blocks to your left was 42nd street and the entrance to the Subway system was there. You can purchase tickets, caththe N,R,Q,W and 1,2,3,4 lines. Right across the street from the hotel is Virgils Bar B Que, being from Texas this Bar B Que is excellent and portions are large.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conneticut", "Title": "\u201cGo for it!\u201d", "Author": "LucytheLunchLady", "ReviewID": "UR53125987", "Content": "We wanted to spend 2 days and one night in the city and we booked through Priceline for a rate of $125.00/night.

I really want it clean and I was worried from some of the other reviewers. We arrived early on Saturday and were given the keys to our room. We stayed on the 17th floor. I am happy to announce that it was spacious and clean. The beds are very hard but after all the activity of the day (ice skating, theatre, ESPN Zone, etc.) we could have slept on anything. The location is GREAT. 1/2 block from Time Square and it has an entrance on 44th and 45th street. After 11pm the 45th street side is locked so don't try to get in on that side at that hour. There are no coffee makers in the room but there is a Starbucks 10 feet out the door on the 45th street side. The restaurant/lounge was not appealing to me. It was dark and did not have much atmospher, but you are in the Times Square District, you will find a fun place and delicious food. We ate dinner before the theatre at Connolly's on 45th (just out the door and across the street from the hotel) and it was great. Pub food and reasonably priced. Got us in and out before the show. The location of the hotel can not be any better and the room was really fine. Heater/AC was easy to work and the temp of the room was perfect.

I had no prior knowledge of this hotel when I received an accepted offer through Priceline for this stay. We arrived on 12/26/09 and departed on 1/2/10, so I have sufficient experience to draw firm conclusions. The bottom line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without significant changes I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return to this hotel. PRO The location is ideal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centrally located in Manhattan; less than 1/2 block from the center of Times Square. The hotel is within walking distance of public transportation, shopping, city attractions, and dining. The price, as booked through Priceline, was reasonable at $300 per night. Most hotels in this area are outrageous between Christmas and New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day. CON I encountered two gentlemen working at the front desk. One was quite helpful and the other was condescending and rude. Upon early morning check-in, the first gentleman advised that our room would be ready within 2 hours. Upon our return 2 hours later, the latter gentleman made a condescending remark about how check-in is at 4:00. He put us in room 4415, which was a handicapped access room. The room was dirty (mildew in the shower), there was no blanket on the bed, the bed was very low and rock hard, and several lamps did not function. When I asked to be transferred, the more helpful front desk agent moved us to 4915. It was the same layout, but included luxuries such as blankets and working lamps. It had also been renovated at some point, although it still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the cleanest room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in. The restaurant is no longer open, and they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t updated the room service menu to reflect that. We ordered chicken strips, which were shown to come with freshly made potato chips. Instead we received cold fries. We also ordered buffalo wings, which were shown to come with celery, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any. The food was essentially reheated frozen garbage, and the price of $50 for these two items and two glasses of tap water seems a bit steep. There must be a soap shortage, because we received two small bars in the room upon arrival, but never received more. The climate control in the room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Regardless of the setting, from 60 to 75 degrees, the room was a sauna. We turned it off and opened both windows. With 20 degree outside temps, it kept the room in the high 60\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to low 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The website cites recent renovations with new pillow top mattresses.

Being so large and complex, makes it complicated for travellers to find a good value of a hotel, beyond the 5 star league (which is not only obvious, but quasi-monopolic - in th good sense-) In this trip, paid by the company, I was given the option to select a hotel for under $300 a night. I must say that the choice was so difficult, because of the tremendous amount of options and for the polarized and vast reviews, which spoke great and then bad about one same place. In any event, I ended up booking at the Millenium Broadway Hotel \"The Premier\", mainly because of the proximity to my business meetings. (Although, I've never liked Times Square and Broadway, too cheesy for me, sorry) Arrival is very impersonal and cold and is comparable to entering a subway station, only that in the subway station at least you know it is a subway station. In this case, the entrance leaves you wondering whether you entered the hotel or if you just happened to enter into some strange passageway or tourist trap electronics mall in Times Square. The reception clerks were helpful and efficient, point blank. No additional advice nor interest in the guest whatsoever (in fact, no ID check --- unbelievable) I was directed to the adjacent tower, which is sold as the \"The Premier\", in an attempt to be an upscale version of the same hotel, which has an overall feeling of a pimp's high-rise motel, comparable to some that DO exist in Germany and that were very popular during the Soccer World Cup. The quality of the furnishings is terrible. The linen, the bed cover and the furniture shout \"cheap\". I am sorry t be so harsh, but truth cannot be hidden. The room would be adequate for a 15 year old backpacker looking for a room or for an adventurous couple seeking for a quick fix, but by no means should this hotel be taken seriously as a 4 star business hotel. I called the operator to enquire about their laundry service, and all that I got was a \"we call it a valet, you're i the Big Apple!\" I was shocked at her rudeness after a simple question and for treating a guest as if I was some farmer from beyond cornland. That lady should have known better, much better. I could have taught her a lession in geogaphy, history, culture and education, but frankly I decided to just hold it to the hotel's reputation. The laundry, sorry, valet service was very corteous, although provided by an outside company. Food is very basic and service in the restaurant was uninspiring and grey. Out of the thousands of options to stay in NYC, I will definetely rule this one out for my next trip. I am sure that there must be a much better option under the $300 bracket.

I had reserved a room with two beds via a Travelzoo special which included an upgrade to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room. We arrived after midnight and received a suite on the 51st floor instead (according to the clerk it was the last room available). Although it was nice, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel it was worth more than a normal room, but was fine for the price I paid. It had a separate sitting room with two leather chairs, coffee table, side chairs, desk/chair with minibar and large TV. There was also a half-bath off the entry. The bedroom had only one bed, but it was king sized so we decided to accept it without complaint. The bedroom also had a dresser with large TV and closet with safe and two bathrobes. Both rooms had large windows although they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153floor to ceiling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as described on the website. It was nice having a little sitting room, but it would have made much more sense to have a sofa bed instead of the chairs. The main bathroom was fairly large, with tub/shower combo and a long counter that had the sink, hairdryer, coffee maker and supplies (only tea-bag type of instant coffee and tea), with room for personal items. Shampoo, conditioner, soap & lotion were supplied, and replenished daily by the very efficient maid service. We were never bothered when the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign was out, and the room was always cleaned when we returned.

Minibar was not for personal items, but refrigerators provided when available on request (not sure if there was a fee or not). I noticed each day that the line was extremely long to leave luggage with the bell desk, so you might want to keep that in mind if needed. The staff we encountered were helpful & friendly. The location is good if you want to be in the Times Square area. Plenty of dining choices and theaters nearby with the 42nd St. subway station a couple of blocks away.

It also has a modern yet unique exterior that adds to its charm. Unfortunately, when you enter the lobby where reception can be found, it was the opposite. It was dark and very cold from the air conditioning (even though it was hot outside, I found myself shivering). When we (my mum, dad, me and my brother) went to check in, we were snapped at by the harrassed-looking man behind the desk to wait in line, even though we were the only guests checking in at the time. When he eventually dained to serve us, he could hardly speak a word of English and wasn't very welcoming at all. He didn't tell us anything about the hotel facilities (there was a swimming pool, gift shop, spa and gym that we never found) and were barked the location of the lifts when we asked where they were. The lifts were pretty fast, and the rooms were average size for a double room with 2 double beds inside. The TV was a good size with an LCD screen and Time Warner Cable, but the remotes for the TV didn't obviously come with it, so you had an extra sensor under the TV which didn't always work. The traffic noise was constant as well, even though we were on the 24th floor. The bathroom was nice and clean, but the toilet and bath were very low, and the bath very shallow. Also the flushing system of the toilet seemed to last about 10 minutes, so when you wanted to get up in the night, you woke everyone up in your room. I paid $120 a night for the room, and paid \u00c2\u00a355 for an almost identical room at the Holiday Inn in Leicester. The cleaning of the rooms started at about 8am, so if you wanted to make sure you weren't disturbed during a lie-in you had to put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. Also a few days in a row the maids forgot to replace the coffee/tea cups in our room so we had to drink tea out of glasses! All the staff seemed pleased to help in general (those who spoke good enough English to understand you) but only if they felt like it. We breakfasted every morning in the Charlotte Lounge, which was pleasant and nicely decorated, but had the same dismal lighting as the lobby. Unfortunately when we had booked the holiday, the hotel did not inform the travel agent that there was a inclusive buffet available, so we had to order and pay for breakfast every day. In our room, the price guide for breakfast says around $40, but actually it came to around $60 (for one cooked breakfast, a plate of toast and 3 bowls of cereal). We also had to wait around 20 to 30 minutes for our meal once we had ordered, I mean how long does it take to put cereal into a bowl? They don't even serve milk at the same time, so you have to wait for that even if you have the cereal! Also, if you want any juice that isn't orange juice, you have to order it with your food and wait the amount of time above! And they still expected a tip. One server however, I must praise. I don't know his name as they didn't wear name badges, but he looked of spanish or mexican decent with spikey black hair. He served on the first morning and was the promptest server we had. We had him a few days later, and he could remember what drinks we wanted so we had them even quicker! A worthy man for a tip if anyone was. The men outside of the hotel who hailed taxis, cars and limos was also very polite and obliging, so he deserves a mention too. Unfortunately, other staff members who saw fit to mill around the lobby all day (I don't even know what they were employed for) stared at you mercilessly whenever you went in and out of the hotel, as though you were some sort of prisoner on day release, not guests! I hate to criticise anything about my stay in New York, as I had such an amazing time, but this hotel was supposed to make me feel welcome to a foreign city, but actually made me feel the opposite.

They DO charge for wifi, so be aware if you take your laptop with you. Thankfully, this is NYC, so position your bum near the window, and you'll be fine. Thanks for keeping your internet connections open people! Didn't LIVE in the room 24/7, because NYC is all about exploring, night and day, and there's nowhere better for seeing the Big Apple than right in Times Square. It's about 2 mins walk down the block, and from there, you can get the subway to wherever. I'd recommend exploring when you get there for breakfast type food. The hotel IS expensive for anything to eat, and there's a bagel shop and grocery store just down the street where the local commuters all seem to stop in the morning. That was our breakfast most mornings, and meant we could explore and shop all day. If you're in NYC, I'd definitely go to Top of the Rock at the Rockerfeller centre. it's a 360 view of NYC over 3 floors, and it's MUCH better than the Empire State Building - since for a start, you can SEE the Empire State Building in the NYC skyline. Very impressive. Since you're so near Broadway, I'd recomend seeing a show. Definitely look up the Wicked Lottery on google if you want wicked tickets but don't want to pay $180 each. We queued up for an hour with 200 other people for 13 pairs of tickets, and were drawn out of the hat twice. We gave our second pair of tickets back though.

I usually stay in Hilton and Marriott brand hotels. Also, the last time I was in NYC was less than a month ago and I stayed in the Westin on 43rd street. I am writing this review from my room at the Hilton on 42nd street at Times Square. We shopped around and found the Millennium on Broadway on Travelzoo and felt like it was a great deal. We booked the Superior Room for a 6 night stay in NYC. The other couple we were traveling with did the same. When we arrived (took a limo which was great) from the airport the hotel was really nice on the outside and the lobby was clean and nice as well. When we went to check in we were told that there were no Superior Rooms available and we could either wait until later that evening on the off chance that one would become available or could take a standard room on a lower floor. Honestly, once you make a reservation, 2 months in advance, you expect the room to be reserved..... especially when they have the credit card information on file. We felt that we had to take the lesser room because we honestly had no where to go. As the lady at the desk told us \"at least you will be sure that you have a place to sleep\". We are already frustrated and entered to find a room with small holes in the wall. The map shade had a burn hole in it. The entire room smelled strongly of rubbing alcohol. The worst part was the hardness of the bed. That had to be the hardest bed I have ever thought of sleeping on. We called our friends who had also checked in. They also had a Superior room reserved but were told that the hotel was oversold. Because there were none of these rooms available they were put into the tower. Instead of being on a high floor facing Times Sqare (this was the reservation) they were on the 8th floor facing nothing. The sounds of the street were very audible from the room. They had also booked a King Size Room and ended up with a queen size bed. I went downstairs to ask about another room and was once again told that there was nothing available. However, as I am standing there other people are booking into rooms that are on much higher floors and are Superior rooms. The explanation was that these were reserved rooms and she was \"not really sure off what was going on\". They did offer to put us on a waiting list and if something better came open they would move us themselves as long as our luggage was packed. Our friends in the tower complained that there room was very small and they could not get the room to cool below 79 degrees. The maintenance people told them there was really nothing wrong and it was just hot outside (82 degrees on that day). After becoming very frustrated with shady character of management at this hotel I relented. I called down the street and found a nice comfortable room at the Hilton on 42nd street. This hotel obviously overbooks rooms. In addition, if you are able to get a discounted rate you are treated as a 3rd class citizen. I am not knocking the staff, just the management of this place. Some rooms may be nice and I understand that the tower has better beds. The problem is you just don't know where you will end up. A reservation at this hotel doesn't really mean a lot and they will place you in whatever room and floor they feel like. When you take a vacation you should be able to enjoy your stay and not have to really think about your hotel. We moved to a different hotel because I didn't want to deal with the irritation of this hotel every single day. In short, the location is great, but the management is horrible. In my opinion they are simply trying to turn a dime and the service and professionalism is second. I cannot recommend this anyone and apologize several times to our friends for their stay.

Location...was our prime criteria for hotel selection. Well! It's just perfect! So close to everything. A few steps from Times Square and nearby subway (helps to get to shopping spots!!!). We were provided the room requested upon booking (through hotels.ca) i.e. 2 singles and upper floor. Room 4509 provides a nice view of Times Square (sideways). Our room was very clean upon arrival and throughout our stay. It's a little small but...it's New York so we were expecting this. Beds are comfortable. We requested a fridge at Reception one morning and it was delivered a few hours after. Very efficient and friendly (and yet courteous) service at Reception. We asked Concierge to recommend restaurants...recommendations were so-so (and the address of one of the restaurant provided was wrong...wrong street!!). If you are a sushi lover, try the Sushi Zen (on 44th Street) a few steps from the hotel. I've eaten in a lot of sushi places in my life but never encountered anything as delicious, beautiful to look at (the plate) and excellent service. Another fun place to go for happy hour and dinner is the Havana Club on 46th Street. Nice latin ambiance (Cuban live band after 8:00 p.m.), nice decor and real Cuban food with a little New York touch. That trip was fantastic. We had a good time and I only dream to go back soon!

We chose the Millenium Broadway for it's location, and it appeared to be a decent hotel.The morning of our stay I called the hotel from home to request a refrigerator in the room because my husband and I were bringing a few slices of our wedding cake to enjoy on the 21st. I was told it would not be a problem. When we checked in about 3 hours later our room was not ready, which was fine. I again requested that a refrigerator be added. A room was ready for us around 1:30 P.M. and when I went up to the room there was no refrigerator. I called the front desk and was told that they do not have any left and that I may be able to get one for Monday. I was disappointed, but we decided just to eat the cake that day so it didn't spoil. Our room smelled very musty and was not as clean as I would have expected. The comforter had some stains on it, the smoke detector was hanging out of the wall and didn't seem in working order. One of the lamps in the room did not work. Our bathroom did not seem very clean either. The toilet had hair on it, the glasses were dirty, and it just didn't feel very clean at all. The positive aspects of this hotel were the concierge and the location. The concierge was eager to help us make dinner reservations for both nights of our stay. On the first night we ate at a sushi place right down the street which was moderately priced and decent. The second night we got reservations to IL Cantinori which had fabulous food! Overall, if you are looking for a good location in Times Square, this is perfect for that. If you expect a clean room, then this hotel will disappoint you.

It reached the point the bell captains recognized us upon our return visits and were the 1st to greet us and make us feel welcome. On June the 13th we began a road trip and wanted it to start on a bright note, so we thought the Millennium would be a perfect. start.. After getting our usual welcome greeting it was all down hill from there. The room they placed us in was NOT what we had booked so the switched us to 4011. We went in dropped our luggage went to St. Patrick's, then shopping and to dinner, when we returned to the room our 1st stop was at the bathroom. Much to my horror, there was a large BUG going up the wall. (Which I killed in a tissue to take to the front desk) then I looked around, the soap in the tub was covered with hair, the toiletteries where half filled and it was clear the bath room was not cleaned after the last guests....I took the bug down stairs to showed to evening supervisor aka hotel manager... Her response to everything I said was \"I am sorry\" I am sorry\" she then said she would switch our room and she would call us in the morning to straighten out the problem/ At this point it was almost 11PM...But no one ever showed up to assist us with the move to the new room 4008. We had to do it ourselves!!! When we got into the new room, the 1st thing I tried to check was the condition of the bathroom....however, the lights were blown along with the lamp in the bedroom area.... 2 calls had to be made before someone was finally sent to the room at almost mid-night.... The following day I awaited the call from the supervisor ,as had been promised, until almost noon time... but none came.... We finally gave up and headed out.... When we returned there were no messages from anyone.... at that point I reconciled that the incompetency of the staff was not going to spoil my 48 hour NYC stay, so i chose to straigthen it out on my time ... when I was checking out. The following morning we went to the desk to check out and asked to see the supervisor.... another person who \"claimed to be the supervisor on duty\" kept us waitng for almost 15 minutes, appeared and the only thing she kept saying was \"I am sorry\" .. by now it was obvious that the quality of the customer care had been programed down to \"I am sorry\" ...... She did offer to pay for one night's parking ($59) which I told her was unacceptable and that I would rather pay for it myself... her response.... you guessed it.... \"I am sorry\" When I asked if her supervisor was in the hotel... she said no not until after 4PM..... At that point we left because our car had arrived from valet and was sitting out front\" In conclusion, I was very disappointed in the cut backs at the hotel and in particular the cut back in the cleanliness area.... there is no excuse for bugs, and dirty rooms and essential equipment that is not operating. I am sad to say that after many GREAT stays with the Millennium, I think thier qualty has slipped faster than the stock market and they have reached \"junk\" status.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cFantastic central hotel\u201d", "Author": "charlene132", "ReviewID": "UR32973090", "Content": "Hotel is very central..about 20m away from times square!

Being that we had a debit card, we had to run to an ATM and just pay the entire thing in cash up front. I had to ask for more hair conditioner as my hair was becoming a hot mess from the snow and wet and my coat. I called down to room service NUMEROUS times and only 30 minutes later did I finally get someone to bring me some conditioner. I wised up and bought a big one at the store later. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, but only if I paid what I paid. No way would I pay full price.

It's location is excellent to Times Square, literally a 10 second walk. The room was spacious with a queen size bed and widescreen tv with the usual accessories; desk, hairdryer etc. Previous posts note that the bed was hard but I didn't find this to be the case at all and slept comfortably. The sheets are slightly light so it was a bit cold but I left a note for the Housekeeping asking for an extra sheet and when I returned to my room in the evening I found an extra sheet had been left as well as the heating turned up! The only 'moan' I have is that I checked into the hotel about 1 hour before my room was ready so left my luggage with the porter and returned within the hour, by which time there was a huge queue for the reception/check-in desk. As I'd already checked-in I approached a member of staff to explain that all I needed was to pick up my keys. He wasn't pleasant at all and told me to join the queue. After a few minutes of explaining that I'd already checked in and didn't see why I needed to queue for at least another 1/2 hour the manager was called and I was given the room with no problem. Other than this incident I found the staff very friendly and helpful (calling taxis when required, making conversation etc).

There is absolutely, positively NO WAY this is a 4 star hotel. Not in any way, shape or form. I'd say 3 stars would be a fair assessment. Maybe 2 1/2 if you count the service. The location of the hotel is fantastic. You won't find a hotel closer to the center of Times Square for the price. This is almost right across the street from the ticket booth in Times Square. That is about where the benefits to staying here stop. The worst thing about the stay was the bed. I have stayed in many hotels including many cruise ships and five star to two star hotels. This was the worst bed I have ever stayed in. Honestly, I wondered if the carpet and floor might be softer. Forget the fact that there is no box spring ... just a matress on a wooden platform. The matress was literally so hard, if you jumped on it, you would probably get a bruise. I woke up feeling like I got no rest at all. On top of the matress was a very thin comforter that bearly fit the bed. Most nights, even with the heat up to 90 degrees, I felt cold because the bedspread was so thin. I can't imagine two people sharing a bed as each morning I woke up, the bedspread hardly covered the bed. Another thing about the hotel that is weird is the lack of activity. I was there on a Friday and a Saturday night and there was nobody there. Everytime I walked into the cavernous modern lobby ... it felt as though I was walking into a museum before it opened. Most hotel lobbies have people walking or sitting ... this lobby has no couches or chairs! There is a very small side room with a few couches ... but amazingly, the lobby is just a giant marble cavern. On Sunday, I saw the most people in the lobby I had at one time ... about 8. We were waiting to check our bags and there were people just standing against the giant marble wall because there was noplace to sit and wait while the bags came. The hotel is very overstaffed by tip hungry beggers. It is almost like being in Tiajuana. The moment you step out of the car, there is a person literally pulling a bag from your hand to put it on a cart. I had an overnight bag and a garment bag which were very light and as I unloaded it, the person literally grabbed it from my arm. When I told him I could manage he kept saying 'please ... please ...' It was like a scene from a movie. Finally, he put my two small bags on a brass cart and wheeled them up to the room with me. Very ridiculous. These bags were literally the size of backpacks. There are two people at the cocierge desk. I asked about getting tickets to a sold out show on Broadway and the guy told me the ticket lady had gone home. (it was 4:30 p.m.) He said to call back in the morning and she could call up a ticket broker for me. I got the impression that if I asked for a restaurant recommendation, I would have been directed to a guide book. When I asked one of the 5 employees standing around the hotel lobby at midnight, even though it was completely empty if he knew a good bar to go to (this is at midnight on Friday) ... he told me, 'Room service delivers until 11 p.m.' When I reminded him it was midnight and that wouldn't help me much, he said 'This is New York City. There are bars and restaurants everywhere'. Forget about asking for recommendations ... the Irish Bar across the street is about as Irish as the Bahamas. If you want a decent bar ... you have to walk about 8 blocks to Hell's Kitchen. All the bars near the hotels are tourist junk. The doorman managed to get us a stretch limousine for $20 to drive to Tavern on the Green in Central Park one night. That was great because a cab ride would have been around $8 - $10. Valet parking was $55 - $65 per night. (Internet says $55 but they tell you $65 on the phone.) That is a bit pricey ... even for New York City. I think I paid $45 at the Wellington, which is right down the street. The rooms are comfortable ... a bit on the small side, which is typical for New York City. Aside from the terrible bed ... the furniture and decorations are okay. I was a bit surprised that there was no desk in the room. I guess this is not known as a business hotel ... more for tourists looking to spend some time in Times Square. The bathrooms are actually a very nice size and have a large counter near the sink and a good sized shower. The hot water was great and the showehead was good as well. Each room has a flat screen TV and there are plenty of cable stations, including some international stations. Location and price are what make this hotel an okay deal. The service sucks. The beds are terrible (honestly, based on the bed alone I would not stay here again. In fact, I'd probably pay $50 more to stay somewhere else where I'd know that I'd actually get a good night's sleep. If you are used to a softer bed, you will want to leave this hotel the minute you even sit down on the bed. For $85 (plus $55 - $65 for valet) ... its good for singles, college students or people on a budget. But there are more luxurious hotels for around the same regular rate. If you bid on priceline for a 4 star hotel in the Times Square or Broadway area, you will probably get this one.

I had found a great deal on TravelZoo, $199.00/night for a Superior Room - Floors 28 and higher. Based on the room we were given, I wouldn't pay anymore than that. The photos speak for themselves. I had gotten nervous upon reading other reviews. Some were correct - so I was ready in advance on what to expect. Others, well, I think they may have just encountered a bad stay. Upon entering the hotel you notice it has an extremely nice lobby. The front desk had only one person checking people in, but he did it rather quickly and we had no problem in getting to our room. He was extremely friendly and polite. (We did get in about 2.5 hours before check- in @3pm. ) Our room was on the 51st floor. We had a beautiful view of the Chrysler Building. It was clean, had no smell and as other reviewers stated the room was chilly and had no blanket for the bed. We turned up the heat and called housekeeping for an additional pillow, a blanket and a refrigerator. (No- they don't charge for the fridge and that is nice.) They all arrived in short order. Being on the 51st floor, I was concerned about having no hot water for bathing. This was never a problem -early in the morning or late at night. The bed was extremely comfortable. Nice firm bed and pillows to match. Had a great night's sleep. The TV worked fine and was quite nice to watch when getting ready to sleep or wake up and find out what kind of weather was rolling in that day. However, there was no Express Check-out through the TV and we never received a bill under our door. So the morning of our departure, the front desk provided a copy of the bill for our review. This hotel has a GREAT location. Right off of Times Square and in walking distance or subway access to almost anything you need or could want. The prices in the hotel restaurant are expensive, but why eat there when you have anything you could possibly want at your fingertips in Manhattan. There is a Starbucks on the backside of the building (45th Street) and there is a little deli/diner across the street (44th Street) where you can take out a nice little breakfast or eat upstairs. Boy, is it reasonable! I guess the biggest reason I stated in the beginning about pricing is that the hotel has some issues with housekeeping and updating of the property. The coffee make did not work. The wallpaper is \"piling\" on the edging of the walls - so it looks like cobwebs, but it isn't. The bathroom moulding has been painted - but poorly to where you can see the previous color paint. The tubs don't drain properly (we had to remove the drain and the maids left it out). The previous guests had something to eat as evidenced by it being left on the side of the night stand up against the wall when we arrived. However, the next day it had been removed without my telling them. Lastly, if I had paid $350 plus for this room - the amenities given, the furniture and bathroom decor - is not what I would expect to find in a \"high end hotel \" and I would have been extremely upset. However, it is not what I paid, and these things are a tad bit nit-picking. I would stay here again at the price we paid, and overlook the small things. The things we needed from them were provided with no problem. None of the \"cosmetic/housekeeping issues\" interferred with our stay.

All in all i can sum the hotel up by saying i did not receive not one hint of a complaint from Lucy my sometimes hard to please typical 13 year old (bless her),enough said,thoroughly recommended.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBetter bedding would make this hotel a winner\u201d", "Author": "JC2", "ReviewID": "UR22873698", "Content": "On the plus side my room on the 49th floor was spacious by New York standards and the bathroom was a very nice size.

Personally, I hate being anywhere near Times Square, but the location of this hotel is near my firm's New York office, so it's convenient. To me, what takes a hotel from good to great is the quality of their bedding and towels. I'm especially picky about the bed spreads, which often gross me out. Unfortunately, in pulling back the bedspread there was a 3 inch round stain on the underside. I quickly put the bedspread on the floor and got out the extra blanket from the closet. This blanket should have been thrown away long ago -- I can't even describe the fabric, it was rough and felt like a thin sheet of foam rubber that had perhaps been baked in a oven (or a too-hot dryer). Plus it had fuzz and a small wad of hair stuck on it. Anyway, it makes it hard for me to sleep when the bedding is even a little cruddy.

This is our company preferred hotel, so I did not have a choice as to where I was going to stay. When it was time to catch a cab to the airport I was \"taken\" by the shaddy Bell Men. I asked for a cab to the airport and was told I had to take a hotel recommended taxi. I thought this was strange, but needed a taxi quick to make my flight. The Bell Man told me I had to pre-pay $10 for the cab (his tip--they have something worked out with cab company). Then he told me it was another $10 for using my credit card... At this point I laughed and walked away. They came running after me and told me they would not charge me the $10 for the credit card and would only charge me $5 prepay. I confirmed with him that I would be paying the standard flat fee of $45 plus the $5 pre-pay. They agreed and away I went. I was handed a $80.00 tab when I arrived at the airport. The taxi driver told me that was not the arrangments made by him and the bell man at the hotel. Bottom line--the Bell Man at the Mellennium are shaddy.

We have done this for 5 years now and have stayed at various upper-end properties such as the Grand Central Hyatt, the Roosevelt, and the Hilton on 6th. The sponsoring group books the rooms. We pay for the stay, but get reimbursed for the first two nights of the meeting, then we pay for any extra nights if we want to stay longer. We only booked to stay one extra night. So at check in, we did not ask what the price was (and were not told), but assumed it was in the $350 to $400 +/- range, which is typical for a higher quality hotel at this time of year and was the range the other hotels have been in. Upon first entering the room, I was not happy - it was very ugly and with stained carpet and cheap furnishings, with a faint smoky smell. It was by far the worst property we have been booked into and is on par with mid to economy grade hotels. But since we were only paying for one of our three nights, I didn't complain since we would not be in the room much. Had I known the price we were paying (I did not find out until we checked out that the rate was $495/night plus $71 in taxes = $567/night!!!!) - I would have complained big time - although I am not too sure what they could have done since I was told at check in that we already had the premium room type. This probably only meant we had an upper floor with a nicer view. This room was more expensive than any of the hotels we have stayed at in the past and was by FAR the worst. The bedding you get is a single set of cheap generic hospital quality sheets, one pillow per person, the shammed pillows you throw on the floor to sleep, and one bedcover. No double sheeting, no down pillows and no better quality sheets for $567/night??? Trying to sleep, I found that the bedcover, (which I would have prefered to remove, but there was no other blanket provided) has a satin like backing so it kept sliding off the bed and I was awoken many times freezing since all I had left was a thin sheet. I found an old scratchy blanket and one more pillow in the closet for the next two nights - but they were of lowest quality and not very comfortable. The bath has the obligatory upgrade of the out-bowing shower curtain and newer tile, but not much else was changed. You only get one shower soap, one sink soap, shampoo, cream rinse and mouth wash. For $567/night you get no body lotion, no vanity kit, no shoe shine - and they are so cheap they didn't even replenish with fresh soaps every day. Further - we had to call maintenance to fix the toilet, the sink drained so slow that by the time I warmed up the water to wash my face, the sink was full, and the TV has only basic cable with bad reception on several channels - so for $567/night, don't even think about getting an in-room movie or catching Emiril on the Food Network! I also need to warn people that there is no lobby. I have always enjoyed re-grouping with our frends after the meeting to discuss dinner plans over a cocktail in a nice lobby bar that is decorated to the hilt for the holidays. Don't expect it here. There is a depressingly dark small bar and a small area in front of their restaurant you can sit, but no comfy lobby gathering area. They did make an attempt at decorating with a central Christmas tree and a lighted ball above the stairs. There are only 2 good things I can say about the Millenium Broadway. The concierge folks were all very nice and helpful and the location is good since it is just a half block from Times Square. But if location is an issue - save the money and use the subway. This would be a good hotel for budget minded travelers in the $200 and less category.

We liked it first time because the location is excellent for Times Square and you really feel like you are right in the middle of the action and excitement! I now feel a bit disappointed having read the reviews below mine, especially from the USA visitors, and feel that maybe we were ripped off with our room rate. We too booked it via an offer with Travel Zoo, visited the hotel's site directly and entered the code etc to get the good rate. My average rate was more like $240 for what I thought was a 'Superior Room' (we stayed for five nights). I couldn't agree it was a 'Superior' room either. In fact it was identical to the room we stayed in on our last visit and we certainly didn't have an extra place to sit/lounge (we had one chair), no marble bath (!!) and the view from the window can best be described as the 'brick wall' as my husband says. One other thing about the room - there was a lack of drawer space for things like jumpers. We had desk drawers and bedside cabinet drawers but none large enough for anything other than a couple of bra's and pants! As we had nowhere near enough hangers in the tiny closet a drawer or two would have been handy. Anyway, there is nothing particularly wrong with this hotel. Its very comfortable. There are no noise problems and the rooms are very clean. The bar is overpriced - $8 for a pint - but its fine for one drink or so to relax after a busy day before heading off for the evening. The deli opposite the entrance on 44th is really useful and great for snacks and sandwiches. They also have a hot and cold take away buffet and fruit counter. One alarming thing that happened was on the day we left. We were about to get into our car to return to the airport when what I can only describe as about 10 NYPD police cars and I don't know how many policemen swamped the street! Directly opposite the hotel entrance is a state rehabilitation centre (for drugs and alcohol) and they'd obviously had an incident of some sort. We were bundled into our car and told to leave as fast as we could! Prior to this we had no knowledge that this place was across the street as we'd never heard or encountered any trouble so I do think they keep a close eye on things - but it was scary. Would I stay here again? No, I don't think I would. I feel that we were hugely overcharged for the room and weren't given the 'Superior' room we had booked.

I was in the airport, on my way home, when I realized I had NO money in the bank. I wanted a coffee. I called the hotel and they called my bank to remove the 2 large pre-authorization holds. Why TWO??? When I arrived home, I found myself overdrawn again. They had charged the price of the room to my debit card, when it had been prepaid through Priceline on another card. They apologized and said they would reverse it and it should show in 24 hours- they must not know banks- it will likely be 48-72 hours. Now I sit here with NO money.

One can also request a refrigerator if desired. The room was quiet and effectively insulated us from the noise of Times Square right outside our window. The convenience of this hotel's location can't be beat. We were literally within walking distance to all of our destinations: theaters, subways, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Restaurant Row, and major shopping stores. ABC's Good Morning America studio is across the street and I had obtained tickets to the show prior to our arrival. It was very convenient to arrive there at the requested time of 6:15 a.m. The concierge was very pleasant and helpful providing detailed maps and directions to our destination requests. There is a business center on the second floor with internet access for a fee. However, airline check-on and printing of boarding passes is available at no charge. The fitness center is on the 16th floor. We never had a problem obtaining an elevator when needed. We did dine at the hotel's restaurant Charlotte. The food is delicious albeit expensive.

I had no problems with the comfort of the bed or the bathroom. There was wireless internet access for a fee. The front desk was very helpful with tips on places to go to eat, and the bellhop had no problems taking and watching our bags when we were several hours too early for check-in. Even though you are in Time Square, you don't hear a peep when you're inside your room. That was nice, especially after a hectic day of walking around. Just a heads up: If you come back to the hotel very late, one entrance to the hotel will be locked and you will have to go all the way to the other side to get in. And make sure to have your room key with you to show the front desk on the way in. So I really enjoyed my stay and with the deal I got, it was a great value.

It was in the perfect area of NYC, right beside Times Square and only a few blocks from the subway. There were some fantastic restuarants only a two blocks away on Restuarant Row and if you are going to the theatre they are all around the hotel. It was quite expensive to stay there over weekend as there were quite a few things going on in the city but we found a rate on travelzoo and we called the hotel directly and they gave us the same rate which saved us some money on the stay. In terms of the hotel itself we had an outstanding experience. We arrived to the most polite hotel representative who gave us a warm greeting as we arrived. Our room was ready first thing in the morning so we were able to check in at 10:45 to begin our site seeing. Our room on the 43rd floor and was much more then we expected, the rooms were quite large and newly renovated and the bathroom was very spacious. If there was one problem with our room it would have to be the TV it didn't work that well but it really didn't bother us because we were never in our room. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly, they alway said hello and had a smile on their face which made our experience there even greater. The concierge were very knowledgeable with the city, things to see, places to shop and great places to eat. *Side note* eat at Benjamin steakhouse, one of the concierge suggested it and it was the best meal of the weekend.

I read some of the reviews here and became rather concerned, but ended up keeping my reservation. The Pros: The location is pretty hard to beat. You're literally half a block from the center of Times Square. In fact we had a partially obstructed view of the Good Morning America studios from our 36th floor room. There's also a deli across the street, of which we didn't try, but it seemed fairly busy and it would have certainly been convenient. The bellman and doormen are very friendly and helpful. As soon as we pulled up, a fully uniformed doormen was at my side. Once in the door, the bellman were very helpful in storing our luggage until our room became available because we arrived early in the afternoon prior to check-in time. The rooms were clean from everything I could tell. The a/c worked well, in fact too well. In the middle of the night I got up to turn it down because I had set the temperature too low. The bathroom was spacious with a nice large marble top counter and high end 'sample' toiletries. An in room safe was provided along with a large closet and a flat screen tv. The Cons: I have never ever slept in a more uncomfortable bed in my life. I literally felt like I was laying on a wooden board underneath a very thin sheet. The pillows weren't bad, but I was literally vertical because the mattress had absolutely no give. My friend and I both tossed and turned all night long, trying desperately to find a more comfortable position, but it was of no use. The front desk staff was only marginally helpful upon check-in. I asked for an early check-in, they took all my info, had me sign the papers, and then went on to tell me that there were no rooms available yet. He asked that we come back at 2pm, there would definitely something ready to go by then. So we checked our bags with the bellmen and headed out into the city. We returned around 3pm, hungry and with sore feet just wanting to take a quick cat nap before going out for the rest of the evening. I return to the desk, a different person this time, and I'm told that check-in time is 4pm(which I find rather later anyway). I told him that I had already checked in, that I was just waiting for my room to become available. He repeated the 4pm mantra. So my friend and I crashed in the seating area off of the lobby to wait it out. 4pm rolls around, and by this time there's a long line to check in. I finally get up to the front, just to get a crossed eyed look by yet another different person. She goes back behind some secret little door and finally emerges 10 minutes later with a key. I had previously asked her if it was at all possible to maybe get a room with a view or at least a high floor. Yeah, didn't get either. No big deal, but she kinda blew me off entirely, not saying a word that our room had neither a great view or was on one of the higher floors. I was just less than impressed on the whole with the entire check-in process. No ice machines that I could find. The ice bucket was on the top shelf of the closet and upon inspection of the 'welcome' book that sits on the bureau, ice is available upon turn down service or calling the operator. So we ended up going with room temp soda for the night. While parking expenses are ridiculous in NYC on the whole, $55 a night is still steep I think. Yes, it's valet, but for the valet garage being one block over, it took us over half an hour to get our vehicle back. which put us right in rush hour traffic. So on the whole, while some aspects were nice, I don't think I would choose to stay at this establishment again, though the location is quite appealing.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alpharetta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Millennium- we'll go back!\u201d", "Author": "SunGoddessMom", "ReviewID": "UR19430674", "Content": "We stayed Aug 22-24.

OK, we weren't in the Premier, but in a Superior King on a high floor, so we thought it would be good. Firstly, the good. It was a large room by NYC standards, and the reception staff were excellent. We asked for a fridge for the room, as we were there for nine nights, and it promptly arrived on the second request. However, the bed was really uncomfortable and the pillows virtually pointless (you might as well have had your head on the mattress). The external noise, considering we were on the 31st floor was instrusive, and the A/C very poor. Now admittedly, we are night animals, so were out until late, and the cleaning people called the first few mornings to ask if we'd like the room cleaned. So, we quickly got out, and allowed them to do their job. However, that soon stopped, and for the last five days our room wasn't dealt with at all, and no question as to whether we wanted it cleaned. That's just wrong! Until, miraculously, the cleaner arrived in our room at 9am on our departure day, asssumingly to ready the room for the next incumbents, despite the fact we had the 'do not disturb sign' on the door (we had a 24 hour journey home ahead.) Unfortunately, we had recommended the hotel to friends who were on honeymoon this year. They had a great time in Vegas and loved NYC, but really didn't like the Millennium. I'm sad to write such a negative review, given our previous experience, but its what we encountered.

Alas, we were to pay dearly for our frugality by discovering, in brutal fashion, the reality of this \"four-star hotel\". The first inauspicious signs were the awful kitsch frescoes hung in the lobby. Commissioned, I presume, to remind one of Italy in the days of the high Renaissance, they possess, like so much in this hotel, the ---look--- of the high class, but a half glance more reveals their utter tawdriness. The staff workers generally suffered from a lack of attentiveness and decorousness, and it was some time we had to wait before being able to check-in, a process acquitted with complete indifference. Our room itself, supposedly of \"superior\" class, was of standard size, large enough by NYC standards, but its condition! Again, completely meretricious, faux-everything, distinctive only in its aspirations for motel quality. Cracks in the wood; paint-peeling, marks, smudges in the walls, water stains in the bathroom, a lopsided, half-broken faucet, shower head with insipid water pressure, towels which were \"too dry\" and creaked like an old-house, an itchy bed with ineffectual blankets coupled with an old, rock-hard dilapidated mattress, TV whose audio was shot and full of static, dirty carpeting. We called house-keeping for extra blankets, because of the inadequate sheets. Thirty minutes later no one had come and after calling once more, I found out these had been delivered to the wrong room. They sent out the goods again; a man showed up bearing an armful of their \"first-class\" bath towels! Upon telling him that it was extra blankets I wanted, he finally appeared a few minutes later with something folded in a coat hanger. How shall I describe this unique object? It was a piece of thin foam, the kind one finds used to package electronics items, and about half the size of an adult human. But the worst of it was that it was possessed by the stench of the contents of someone's vomit. Of course it was unusable --- its fragances were so noxious that it was indeed impossible to live in the same room as this thing. After this fetid final straw we resigned ourselves to our fate, and checked out the next day with a morbid haste, having learned a very hard lesson. All the above could be excused --- no, expected --- if this were some mom-and-pop strip hostel out of Smucksville, charged at $40/day. But I think it is scandalous for a Times-square property from an international chain, at the nominal rate of $400/day.

On top of that, you will receive a complimentary upgrade to a Superior Room and a complimentary coupon for a cocktail or beverage in our sensational Charlotte Restaurant or Lounge.\" Well, when checking in they refused to recognize any of this. I had to argue about the upgrade to a Superior room. And they didnt know anything about any coupons for cocktails, which resultated in that I had to run several times back and forth between the reception and bar and discuss with bartenders and reception staff....just to get the drink I had already paid for. - Not so funny. Also, they claimed that the 20% discount off was already reflected in the price in the confirmation, which is totally wrong according to the information on the Hotel website. Later they admitted that the information on the Hotel website was misleading and gave me my 20% discount. Also, they claim that their Superior rooms (located on floor 28 and higher) all have flat-screen TVs. (see the website). My Superior room on the 39th floor did NOT have a flat-screen. I asked the reception staff why, and they answered that SOME of the Superior rooms have flat-screen TVs, but not all. Well, why on earth do they then claim it in the room descriptions???.....

My room was very clean and fresh. The only issue found upon arriving in the room was that a light bulb had burned out, yet a quick call to the front desk and two minutes later the bulb was changed by a very polite hotel worker that quickly apologized and changed the bulb. Bathrooms were clean and once again cleaned every morning there after by housekeeping as we headed out into the city.

The only true issues that I can find at all after two very nice stays at the Millennium Broadway are as follows: 1) WiFi access is done on a day-by-day 24 hour fee basis. In order to gain internet access you must charge a 24 usage fee to your room, and charge again for each day you wish to use WiFi. Free WiFi would be ideal, but if charging is necessary, a flat rate fee for you stay would be second to ideal. 2) As with any hotel, the beverages and snacks in the mini-fridge come with a hefty price, but to charge $5 for a 12oz glass bottle of Coca-Cola is a little extreme. However, there are solutions. One would be to take a short ride down the elevator to the gift shop and buy a soda or water for about $2. Or secondly take a short walk to a Duane-Reade just around the corner and just buy some there. Overall, I really cannot find one reason to make a case of why this would be a bad place to stay.

I am happy to say that they were wrong. We just returned from a 4-day, 3-night stay and it could not have been a better experience. Arriving at 5 PM Friday, we were checked in by a helpful desk clerk within 5 minutes. We had reserved a superior 2-bed room, and had requested a non-smoking room on a higher floor. Having read other reviews, we requested a renovated room at check in. Room 4706 was everything we had asked for. From the 47th floor, we had great views of Times Square, a view of the Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, the bay and more. The room was very clean, did not smell of smoke, had multiple pillows on each bed with a spare in the closet, blankets, a flat-panel TV, a coffee maker with a variety of coffee and tea selections, an iron, a hairdryer, in-room refirgerator (we did not touch the drinks or $5 snacks and were not charged accordingly) and plenty of personal shower items and towels. The air conditioner was on upon arrival and it worked perfectly throughout our stay. The only noise we heard came from an occasional fire/police siren on the streets 47 floors below. All the hotel staff was pleasant, helpful and welcoming. Maid service was prompt, polite and non-obtrusive. The lobby and corridors were clean, as were the super speedy elevators The hotel is literally steps away from Times Square and all that it has to offer. Starbucks lover? Exit the hotel on 45th , turn left , take 20 steps and you are there. Hungry? Exit on 45th turn right, cross the street and you have Cranberries Cafe featuring made to order pancakes or french toast for $2, a ham and cheese omlet, potatos and toast for $3, a fresh fruit bar and chineese food buffet (after 10 AM) for $6.99 a pound, or made to order sandwiches all day. With plenty of seating room upstairs (including a flat panel TV), it is a perfect spot to start or end your day. Want something more formal? Exit on 44th, cross the street and you have Virgil's BBQ. A meat lovers haven, it features prompt service, good food, and friendly staff who will recognise and greet you as such if you return again during your stay. A few more step away on Boradway you will find TGIF's, Planet Hollywood, Bubba Gump Shrimp, and anything else you may like including pizza, NY style hot dogs, and various street vendors. You can walk to Central Park, but the subway is advised to spare the sore feet that will result. 5th Avenue and all the premier shops it offers is a quick walk away from the hotel. Although we did not go to see any Broadway shows, most are 1-2-3 blocks away from the front door. Check out was a breeze with a complete and accurate statement slipped under our door the morning of our departure. The bell hop will check your bags for late departures and last minute shopping. Cabs are flagged down right in front of the hotel. Limo service is also available ( a little more than a cab however). The subway station at 42nd and Broadway will allow travel to all points in Manhattan for $2 per trip or $7.50 for an all day pass. I would not advise using the bus as they are always crowded, get stuck in traffic, and take longer that the subway. Yes, the subway is safe even late at night. Clean? That's another story. So, all in all, our stay was memorable, exactly what we expected, and not like any of the negative reviews left previously for the Millennium Broadway. We booked a great deal through Travel Zoo ($199 for the upgraded room) and would definately return again. Either the management of the hotel is reading and responding to the negative comments left here, or they are just trying harder. If you are looking for 5-star, go across Broadway and stay at the W for up to $1,200 a night. If you are looking for clean, comfortable, 3-star value steps from Times Square, stay at the Millennium Broadway. One last point. You may want to pay a little more for the Superior room as it looks like the negative reviews tend to be about the standard rooms on the lower floors. The Superior rooms are larger, have large (for NY) bathrooms, and are on the higher (great views) floors.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "akeka", "ReviewID": "UR17106799", "Content": "Booked with travelzoo rate on a superior room.

I chose to return to my room to check out using the TV remote, which let me bypass the long lines in the lobby. I was given a corner room with a partially obstructed view of Times Square.

The TV was ancient, with a separate IR receiver attachment dangling from the front of the TV swivel stand. The bed and the pillows were thankfully firm (but that is usually a matter of taste) and comfortable. Unlike at many hotels where you have to get on your knees to plug in your laptop, my room had a desk-height power plug on the wall. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked with amenities. But the unusually high water pressure turned the faucets into water cannons that drenched everything nearby. It felt like the shower head gave me a water massage whether I wanted one or not! There was no coffeemaker in the room, but the front desk had one brought up on request. There's an ice bucket in the closet, but I never did run across any ice machines. The minibar was one of those move-it-and-get-charged types, which almost cost me $9 when my travelling companion ignored the warning message on the fridge door. A card on the nightstand explained that housekeeping changes the bedsheets only once every three days unless the card is placed on the pillow. The card claimed that the hotel was doing this in the interest of conservation, but the hotel might just be conserving their money.

The details: We arrived and check-in took a few minutes, but the front desk staff was available immediately any other time we wanted to speak to them, so it doesn't appear waiting is an issue anymore (see past reviews). This hotel has an absolutely incredible location if you want to be near the Theater District/Times Square. All the shows and lots of great restaurants (try the sidestreets, not the tourist traps in Times Square) are within a 5 minute walk. If you aren't a fan of Times Square, it's fairly easy to avoid from the hotel as well. The subway is about a one minute walk. We stayed in a Superior King room which we got for $189 on Travelzoo. The room was clean, everything worked properly, and the bed was comfortable. The view was great too. However, some areas of the room and hotel appeared worn and dated, and there was no blanket on the bed - just sheets and a bedspread. The room was quiet.

Internet access in your room is $10.95 for 24 hours. We had a nightcap at the bar a couple of times, and contrary to a previous review, we found the drinks quite strong.

The room was decent size. We had 2 twin beds and a comfortable leather chair by the window. The bathroom was relatively clean although the shower curtain was nasty and the shower faucet was broken.

The hotel room was much bigger than I expected a NY room to be, and it was a really beautifully decorated and designed room. The curtains were shut when we entered the room and I went to open them and we were looking straight down into Times Square. At that moment the cost of the room was worth it to me. Everything in the room worked perfectly. In case you are worried we couldnt hear any of the traffic or horns from our room. We could hear sirens from fire trucks or police, but those were not frequent. We also really liked that the room had a nice size safe.

For breakfast be sure to go across the street out of the north exit of the lobby and turn right about 150 feet or so away is a NY style deli, convenience store, diner...you know all things in one place kind of deal, that has a great selection of breakfast drinks, but you gotta get fresh bagels here. We did this the first morning and repeated everyday after. The name of the place is Cranberries 2 (I think). Remember to use the concierge for everything.

Fall seems to be an extremely busy time for New York as rates were abnormally high. Our first impression at check-in was great. The lobby was very nice and the front desk agents were very friendly and the check-in actually was pretty fast. Our impressions of the hotel changed very quickly after we arrived to our room. When we booked this hotel, I was under the impression that it had recently completed a renovation, well it must have missed this particular room. It was absolutely disgusting! Immediately when we walked in there was a damp musty odor, the desk drawers were very worn and cracked and not sitting evenly. The \"leather\" chair upholstery was also split and cracked in areas. By the desk area was a spot where the mini-fridge use to be, you could tell by the thick layer of dust that it had been over looked by the housekeeping department for some time. My husband had the unfortunate experience of taking off his shoes and finding out where the musty odor came from. The carpet over by the mini-fridge was competely soaked and when you opened the cabinet door it was starting to get warped from water damage. We immediately called the front desk and we were placed in a different room. The second room was much better, but after such a gross first room experience we were kind of nervous about the whole place. This room however was one that had to have been recently updated as all the decor and bedding was newer, but like most New York hotels, the rooms were a tad small. Our view was also alot better as it overlooked Time Square. Given the location, the room overall was very well soundproofed and pretty quiet. We never ate at the hotel so I can't give any opinion on the restaurant or room service. Had we not had the unfortuntate problems with the first room, I probably would have given the hotel better marks. Even after we returned home, I sent a letter to both the General and Sales Managers of the hotel explaining of our experience and I did not get a reply back at all, not even the generic, thank you blah blah hope you have a better trip next time.

Our room was big by our standards, a corner room at 27th floor. Nice enough view, we could actually see down at Times Square. Big, comfortable bed and a big, lovely bathroom. Even the complementary bathroom articles as the soap, shampoo, conditioner and bodylotion were good. And I used them everyday as I forgot all that at home.. There was a small hall with closet and a minisafe. The room itself was the bed, two comfortable chairs, a table, a workdesk with a chair and the TV. The bathroom was all tiles with a bathtub and shower curtain. Big mirror! The check-in desk is very subtle, can even look like an office building desk, but nice and quiet. We experienced only friendly staff, from the check-in clerk, to the bellboy and doorman. There is a great deli across the street, Times Deli, that serves delicious sandwiches for breakfast. The hotel is literally 20 seconds away from Times Square. But even so close to all that traffic, our room was very quiet. We at least didn't hear any noise from the Times Square bombing that happened while we where there. The only negative thing I have to say is that we woke up in the middle of the night because of the fire alarm.

The only negative point about the room would be the bath/shower. The grout around the tiled wall was somewhat stained, and some of the enamel around the tub had been worn away, exposing the metal.

Booked a 4 star in theater district on Priceline and they accepted our offer of 189/nt from 25-28 December, when prices are usually rising due to the imminent ball drop Upon checkin we were upgraded to a superior room. The wall of windows in the room was impressive, offered a nice view. Location: Literally a 1 minute walk to Times Sq. 2 1/2 blocks from the nearest subway. 5 minute cab ride from Penn Station. For you coffee addicts, there is a Starbucks right next to the 47th St entrance to the hotel. The rooms ending in 14 are on the side of the hotel furthest away from Times Square so you don't see much of it from your room. If you are lucky enough to be on the east side of the hotel you have a pretty good view of the North side of Times Square. Check in/out: From what the bellhop told us check in/out on Sundays could be hectic with a line of 8-10 people waiting to check out right before checkout time (noon). Strangely enough, there wasn't an option for inroom checkout. Rooms: Ours was a \"Superior\"...Nice sized for NYC, bathroom was very big and the shower/bath was roomy, had great pressure and was nice/hot. No fan in the bathroom. Internet capable. The bed was firmly soft if that makes any sense. I thought it was pretty comfortable. TV was decent size, but the stations didn't come in crystal clear. Concierge: A little lacking, we didn't use them to book any shows, so I can't speak to that. We just got advice on breakfast and information on the statue of liberty. The two people I consulted had limited information. Maid service: Great. The couple of times we needed something extra we called the front desk and had the items within 10 minutes. Area eats: Don't eat in Times Sq! Prices are exorbitant. ($18 for a hamburger at the TGIF). The Red Flame, a block east of the hotel on 46th, had very fast service. Eggs ok, pancakes were pretty good. There are a couple of breakfast places just east of the hotel on the north side of 47th that looked pretty good, but we didn't get to eat there as they had stopped serving breakfast. The Heartland brewery directly south of the hotel on 45th had excellent steak. Would stay there again. Hope this helps in your decision.

When we arrived to the hotel, the doorman didn't feel like vallet parking our car and suggested we just use the parking lot across the street. Then there was a long line at check in, and not nearly enough staff. When we finally got up to our room, it did seem a little tiny (but it is NYC), but the bathroom was a decent size. We didn't have an exciting Time Square view, but it was okay. I had tried calling downstairs with questions and requests but could never get a human on the telephone. Then we went downstairs to see if the hotel staff could help us get a taxi - the guy outside said \"the cabs have been scarce here, but this guy here will take you in his limo car for $25\". Unfortunately we were unfamiliar with the area/cab prices and agreed. On our way back to the hotel, we took a regular yellow cab and it was $11 - so the hotel guy charged us more than double. After we got back, the drinks at the hotel bar were a little outrageous - $12 for a glass of wine. We got back up to the room around 10 pm and could still here some honking and some traffic noise, but it did get quieter after that and wasn't too bad. What was really disappointing was the breakfast we had in the hotel restaurant downstairs. We had made reservations - didn't need to - it wasn't that crowded. The food was obviously overpriced (as most hotel restaurants are) we paid about $15 for pancakes... but the service was extremely slow and really not on the ball. I had to ask 4 different people over the span of 40 minutes for a glass of water. Really disappointing and frustrating! Then our check out process was also a long ordeal - and the complimentary guest baggage storage was also a little shady - they basically just put a cord through your suitcase and leave it in the lobby - only quasi attended. So while nobody could probably walk away with your suitcase, someone certainly could walk away with the contents of the suitcase. Overall, the hotel was ehh okay. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it and it was disappointing after paying the amount that we did. If you are looking for the location and don't really care about having a nice hotel and decent food/service, and you don't mind the price tag - then this would work for you - it is a minute's walk from Time's Square and a few minute walk from most Broadway shows. But if you're looking for a nice get away and somewhere a little more special - keep looking. I've stayed at Hampton Inn's that were 10 times more luxurious and enjoyable than this hotel.

I am always puzzled why clean bathrooms are not number 1, because it can destroy a hotels' reputation. The concierge was great, she arranged our dinner reservations at Virgil's across the street. The restaurant is over rated and the service sucked, despite its reputation. The restaurant was our selection not the concierge's, and we have no intentions of recommending it to anyone. We did go to a really nice little 40 year old cafe in the village called \" the pink tea cup\", it was great.

The location couldn't be beat for some first time visitors in the city. It's right in the heart of Times Square. We were traveling with a 2 year old, so it was important for things to be convenient, comfortable and safe. Here's the breakdown: Location and Cost: I was able to find the room for about $200-300 a night (rates changed between the three nights) via the Travelzoo website. They were have a special, and I was able to get in on that before the rooms ran out. For a 4-star hotel, in the middle of downtown, I don't think I could have done much better. I think usual rates fall in the $500-600 range. Remember , this is in the heart of tourists traps. This price didn't include any kind of parking fees though - I believe they only have validation at a rate of 35-45 for 24 hr period. We opted to take the train into the city. The hotel is a few blocks from Penn Station, so it wasn't a big deal to walk over to catch the train. You definitely want bags with wheels though! Room: We ended up getting a Superior King room, which fit a king size bed, and a desk. It was small, but not cramped. The bathroom was a nice size, with hairdryer and coffee machine. The view was nice too from the room, we could see the heart of the action from the room. The bed in this room was by far the BEST bed I have ever slept on in a hotel. Clean, comfortable - and the room looked like it had been recently renovated to a more updated style. Very pleased with the room in general. They have sensored minibar and snack drawer - so I was worried when my kid started moving things around. But there was no problem when I called the front desk, they took care of it right away. Summary: All in all , a nice place to stay. It gets really crowded in Times Square on the weekend, so be ready. For a first trip into the city - the location was great. I would say that the regular rates are pretty steep, and that staying one or two blocks off the main drag are well worth it, and we'll probably do that next time. But the hotel was clean, convenient, and the staff was pleasant.

However, the staff really seem to go the extra mile to make sure that nothing goes smoothly. We'd booked our room through a TravelZoo promotion - $199/night for a Superior room (renovated, 26th fl and above) and were visting from DC for my son's 9th birthday. When I made the reservation, I called ahead and spoke with the concierge, asking if he could do something special - even a balloon - to make my son feel special. I'd also confirmed that we'd be booked in a Superior room, as I'd read on TripAdvisor that the Standard rooms were not nice at all. We arrived last Saturday afternoon, and were greeted by a dour-faced guy named Chad who assured us that we would not be getting a Superior room because the hotel was overbooked. I said, I'm sure you are because of the promotion. Nevertheless, I booked a Superior room and expect to stay in one. He argued that there were no guarantees of room type and that I should have \"read the fine print.\" I handed him my screenshot showing my booking and assured him there was no fine print. He told me to come back in an hour when the check-ins started but that I shouldn't hold my breath. I used that hour to duck into Sephora around the corner and call the number on the confirmation. The woman at the hotel told me that Chad was mistaken and that I was already booked into a Superior room. Basically, it appears they try to bully as many people as they can into taking something substandard. Our room was on the 49th fl. Nothing had been done for my son based on my concierge request. The hair dryer didn't work. They put a $375 pending charge on the day of check-in on my card for a $230 room with tax. And then breakfast - ordered pancakes for 7:40am. Got nothing. Called room service. They were nice and sent something up quickly, but it was a muffin. Went back downstairs and came back in a few minutes with pancakes. They were nice enough, but 4 stars? 3 stars?

Let's put it this way: I didn't even pay for the room, yet I created an account here on tripadvisor.com largely so I could share my experience. Before I tell you the bad, let me tell you the good things. It is a very short list. The bellmen were friendly and helpful. The lamps in the room have rheostats on them. The hotel is located near the theater district...but then so are a raft of other hotels. Yep, that's about it. And now for the bad: The worst thing about Millennium Hotel is what you can't experience on the website. On the website you'll never hear the phone in the next room ringing and ringing and ringing as I did in my corner room at Millennium Broadway. You'll never taste the vaguely chemical taste of the scrambled eggs that room service brought to my room twice (my family and I decided the eggs must be powdered eggs as nothing else can account for their awful taste). You can't see the horrible flourescent lighting because the photos on the website are professionally lit. You won't see the battered and dated vacuum cleaner that housekeeping left in the hallway just outside my room for at least an hour one morning. And you won't get a feel for the lack of cleanliness. So, I'm here to tell you all about it. The worst part of the stay was the bathroom. The hotel has installed low-flow showerheads and low-flow faucets in the sink. I live in Southern California and we virtually pioneered water saving devices. I have encountered all manner of low-flow showerhead and faucets, but I have never met a low-flow showerhead as bad as the one in my bathroom at Millennium Hotel. I had to stand under the shower for about ten minutes just to get my hair wet. Of course, I'm exaggerating, but the water flow was really, really bad. Once you do get shampoo in your hair or soap on your body it is a struggle just to rinse it off of you. Same story with the sink. Washing your hands in the sink was a ten minute affair. I finally took to bypassing the sink and washing my hands under the faucet of the bathtub...which, unlike the sink faucet or the showerhead, had completely unrestricted water flow. The shower backed up one evening as I showered just before going to bed. Water pooled around my feet and ankles and refused to drain which cut short my shower. By morning, the backup had cleared and it worked fine again. I concentrated on washing my feet that next morning. Yuck. The lighting in the bathroom was awful. I've met airplane lavatories that had more flattering lighting than the bathroom in my room at Millennium Hotel. I looked so awful in the mirror that I toyed with the idea of booking an emergency botox/facelift appointment. Thank goodness the lamps next to the bed, at the desk and at the sitting area came equipped with dimmers. My room was not exactly clean. The carpet was heavily soiled. There was a large, black stain just inside the door. It looked as though about a quart of oil had been spilled on the light-colored carpet. There was a stain on the wall that looked as though someone had tossed a meatball basketball-style into the trash can, using the wall as the backboard. During a three day stay it never was cleaned off the wall. Every time I ordered room service, they screwed something up. Usually it was something small such a forgetting to place salt and pepper on the tray. Once, they failed to include the Diet Coke I ordered as my beverage. When I called down to tell them I wanted the Diet Coke, the woman who took my order said, \"You didn't tell me you wanted a Diet Coke.\" I sweetly said, \"No, I ordered a Diet Coke.\" She put me on hold and then came back online and said \"Okay, I'm sending a Diet Coke up, and I'm not going to charge you, but next time make sure you say that clearly.\" And I thought saying 'I'll have a Diet Coke and a glass of ice water' was clear enough. Silly me. Room service stops (if I remember correctly) at 10:00 PM. After that hour the hotel will order for you from restaurants in the area and have it delivered to your room. While I admit the food I ordered at that hour did arrive quickly, my selections were limited to things like pizza and burgers...nothing even remotely healthy was offerred as a choice. The worst thing about room service (and the restaurant downstairs) was the eggs. They had a vaguely chemical aftertaste. After twice ordering them for breakfast and twice having to choke them down because they were so awful, I mentioned it to my familly. We all agreed the eggs must be powdered eggs. Avoid them.

I think that's preposterous, especially when in any Hampton Inn, you get free internet access and a nicer room for half the price. Plus, I had asked at the front desk about holding my laptop during the day when I was out. (I was somewhat leery of thefts) They told me they wouldn't take responsibility for it. There's a safe in the room, but it wasn't nearly big enough to hold a laptop. I've been at hotels before (ones less \"classy\" than this one) where the front desk will hold valuables. I didn't think, for the price I was paying to stay there, that this service would have been too much to ask. On the upside, it was a quiet place with a good location off Times Square, and if you stay there, you DEFINITELY have to eat at Virgil's BBQ, right across the street. On the whole, the vibe I got from the place was that they want to have the image of a high-class hotel, when in reality I've been treated better at the likes of Holiday Inns and Hampton Inns. I mean, there's a mini-bar in the room, but so what?

Things like, mold in the bathtub (which had a broken stopper for the drain), old nightstands with new marble tops which were mis-cut, no pen in, on, or around the desk (or anywhere else), and instead of drip caffeinated coffee for the coffee pot they supplied Folgers One Cup brew (like a tea bag). (The decaffeinated coffee was automatic drip). Eventhough the \"imperfections\" are all minor (ok, maybe not the mold) I feel that for the amount of money they charge, these \"imperfections\" are significant. Now for the positive.

Check in Very smooth and efficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were allocated room 5018 (on the 50th floor). There are five rapid lifts from reception and they are very quick. Room Our room was very nice and located in the corner with dual aspect windows overlooking Times Square (Paramount building etc) and north to the Rockefeller Centre buildings. The bathroom was also good and spacious, albeit the shower was not hugely powerful. Nice toiletries are supplied daily. The TV has 40+ channels including HBO and BBC America. Pay per view films are also available. Food We stayed room only and ate out for every meal! There is a good Deli across the road that has reasonably priced Pain au Chocolate, fruit and Orange juice etc. They also do eggs and omelettes. At night we ate at Viva Panchos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Mexican across the road that was inexpensive and tasty, Trattoria Dopa Teatro \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Italian place down the road left out the front door, and at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bubba Gumps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Time Square which is a great Gump themed restaurant. Things to do in the vicinity Obviously, there is loads to do and this hotel has a great location to see the sights of New York. We did Liberty and Ellis islands, The Empire State building, Central Park, and the famous shops, all of which are in easy reach.

I am always apprehensive when a hotel says it has a 'fully equipt' gym and you turn up to find just a bike and one treadmill, the Millennium's had four treadmills, four cross trainers, a stepper, seperate weights room, showers/changing facilities and lockers. Two things to remember - make sure the air con is on as the place heats up quickly and don't expect to get on a machine at 6.30 a.m. without a queue.

This is my second stay at this hotel. Location, Location, Location! This place has it in spades. You could even see part of time square from our room on the 48th floor. It is so close and in such a great spot it is easy to pop in during the day and get right back out to activities. Also, there is a drug store less than a block away, and a deli across the street for quick eats, or bottles of water and soda. Check In: Although I see someone stayed there the exact same time as I did, we didn't have any trouble. I had made the booking in my name, but my friend who was staying with me, was going to be there hours before me. I had put her name on the reservation, and she had no trouble what so ever checking us in. When I arrived (many hours later due to the snow storm blanketing the northeast that night) I was able to get my key and head up to the room. The Room: The room was nice. A bit more posh that the last time. I believe the difference between a regular room on my last visit and this visit was a flat screen tv and designer floor to ceiling headboard for the 2 beds. We were on the 48th floor, and you could see part of times square ( The Hard Rock Cafe & Bubba Gump restaurant) as well as the river! The beds were quite comfortable. The sheets were fine. There are a number of pillows to choose from when sleeping. The bed does come made just with a sheet and coverlet, but there was another actual blanket in the closet I used. The room had a leather lounge chair which was nice. The rooms are very quiet, the only noise we heard much of was some wind rushing around the building. The curtains are blackout curtains, so it can be completely dark, or you can have the times square lights flashing you to sleep if you like. The bathrooms are large, with the rounded shower bar to allow more room in the shower. The shower did drain slow and the toilet seemed to not like to flush. Although not backing up really, although we didn't complain, so clearly it wasn't that bad. We did ask for more towels as it comes with just 3 large towels, we asked at the front desk to send up 1 more while we went out for the evening, and they brought us a whole set including wash clothes and hand towels. Safety: In the evening, they had someone checking to make sure you were a guest to get into the hotel. They didn't do this in September 2006 when I was there, so it was a nice added measure of security. Check Out: My friend and I split the bill half way and they gave us no trouble with that. We left our bags with the bell hop with no problems. When we came back to get our bags, they were very helpful. My friend was flying out of JFK, and when they went to get her a cab, they offered her a hired car, for $59 including taxes and tolls. The website quotes a taxi rate of the same to go for \"JFK International Airport $45-$60 (metered rate) plus tolls and tip.\" So, she had an upgraded ride for the cost of the taxi.

The next day upon checkout, calling for a bell-hop to come retirve our bags and store them for a few hours proved fruitless, as the phone was never answered by the bell hop.

On my most recent visit, I had reserved a room at the $179 travelzoo rate. I arrived around 10:am and was informed that no superior rooms were available at that time. I opted to take a standard room.

From the outside the hotel is attractive and well-maintained. There was almost always a doorman to obtain a cab. Inside the lobby is nicely appointed in dark marble; it has a very high ceiling but is narrow and, when there are more than a handful of people inside, becomes cramped. We arrived before the 4:00 standard check-in time. There was a line with several guests so we waited about 10 minutes (there was one desk clerk working). One of our rooms was ready and they allowed us to take our bags up and leave them. There was a bellman working but he appeared to be swamped with other guests. Later encounters with the front-desk staff were varied - at times there was no wait and the staff member very courteous and accomodating. At others there were long lines (sometimes with only one or two clerks working) and the staff member curt and dismissive. We found long lines stretching thru the lobby in the mornings and afternoons every day - this seems to be a persistent condition. On our second and third days into our stay my wife left voice messages for the front-desk manager who never acknowledged or returned them (issue described below). The same is true of the concierge staff which is across the lobby. One gentleman was very helpful in restaurant advice yet another ignored us for a few minutes then gave us reluctant, brief directions to the subway station. We'd requested interconnecting rooms (travelling with 2 children) and the hotel was able to accomodate that. I was pleasantly surprised as I've found it rare this request is honored. We only visited the hotel restaurant, Charlotte, once. I found the food to be very expensive and ordinary. As has been written elsewhere, venture a couple of blocks away from Times Square and you can find much better food at a reasonable price. Our rooms themselves were in the \"premium\" price-class. They were nicely decorated and we did not see any of the cleanliness issues cited in other reviews. They were a little small but about average for NYC. There weren't allot of extra's - a small bottle of shampoo & conditioner and a bar of soap, 2 small glasses, working television with cable, a phone book, etc. - the basics. The room was to include a coffee maker; there was not one in the room but I called down and one was brought up within an hour. Heed the warnings in the other postings regarding the in-room refreshments. There's apparently some kind of light-sensor that can tell if you even lift a candy-bar up out of the drawer. There were individual temperature controls; one room worked well in heating & cooling but the other did not with the cooling not working well. The windows will open slightly from the bottom allowing some outside air in. Our room was on the 35'th floor facing roughly south. We couldn't really see anything noteworthy but it was nice to be up high enough to not be boxed in by surrounding buildings. The only issue during the stay was housekeeping. On the third day our rooms were cleaned but there were no towels available (hence the first call to the front desk manager). On the fourth day our room was not cleaned at all and again there were no towels (the second un-returned call to the manager). I found the housekeeper in the hallway and she told me that she had no linens of any kind and everyone was complaining to her. She said she had informed her manager and recommend I do likewise to try to get some towels (no one answered the phone at Househeeping and I went to the concierge desk and they reluctantly helped us get two towels.)

The view was amazing, I could see Empire State building laying in bed, seeing the lights go off on the Empire State Bldg. at midnight sharp was really something. Our room was at the corner, so there were some extra room by the door, perfect for stroller storage. The room itself was spacious enough for the four of us. Nothing short of my expectation. The toilet does run constantly like the other reviewer said, but I didn't hear the noise with the bathroom door closed at night.

Whenever you visit somewhere new you always wish to stay in a location which is the centre and everything else revolves around it or is in close proximity.

Times Square lived up to and surpassed every expectation, a vibrant and restless hub on an ill at ease island that wrestles with numerous conflicts in recent history, yet glorifies in it's diversity. An ideal base to explore the tentacles of Manhatten however from reading a number of reviews I take it I didn't pay bottom $ for our room that was situtaed 40+ floors above terra firma and therefore being British (a race that doesn't complain) we experienced minor niggles: a. Suggest you don't use the Consigne service, little benefit, Tourist buses, you pay the commission to teh desk, they give you a voucher to buy a ticket from the buses office. What's all that about? b. Broadway tickets are top $ and they are not available until after 2:00pm on the day of the performance. Why not just go to the discount ticket office? c. Staff are keen to clean your rooms after 9:30 am, why? d. On the day of checking out which has to be done before noon why do they deactivate your access card prior to 8:00am when you are denied access to their modest gym? Don't get me wrong, a satisfactory hotel within the location however , like many others I have visited throughout the world I think they do trade on this. In conclusion would I recommend this to first time travelllers to NYC? Yes Would I return to this hotel?

On occasion I've been pleasantly surprised at the stylish oasis available in a very gritty city. Some have been hip and well serviced, (W Hotels) and some have seen better days but still maintain their grand dame demeanor (the Waldorf). However, some are so incredibly bad, that it saddens me to think how people get ripped off because its all they can afford. In November, I had to stay overnite to attend a company event. While the event went well and was serviced by professionals, the hotel has seen better days. The good news is that everyone I dealt with, at the front desk, bellman, and waitstaff, were all kind and did their best to make me happy. The room however and the meeting rooms were trashed. Apparently this older hotel has been renovated recently and the room did look somewhat modern, but for over $350 a nite, there was no excuse for foul body smell that permeated the room, the hair caught in the tub, or the cheap linens on the bed. The bed was the most horrible I've seen in ANY hotel, hard, with linens that didn't fit or blankets that looked like it was a leftover from a bad 1970's movie. The furniture was chipped and the curtains looked torn.

Only problem with it was that it stops at 11:30pm. The staff were friendly & helpful. There's not much going on when you enter- 1 small shop & 1 restaurant but the interior is spacious & NY chic. The structure is longer than it is wide - it ran the entire length of 1 city block. Its exterior is nondescript & one can easily pass it by & not realize its the entrance to a large hotel. The hotel is on West 44th street which is a narrow, slightly dingy side street off Times Square but its safe and literally just a few feet from the bustle & high traffic of the Square. I felt safe walking back alone at night plus there was always a bevy of well-dressed , courteous, gentlemen staff built like linebackers monitoring the entrance. Also there was always an alert, attentive valet outside. I stayed in a double, non-smoking room on the 31st flr facing south. I would recomnend a higher flr for a better view. The fitness center was OK, just a a little too tight in space, w/ only the most basic amenities- 1 refreshment vending machine, 3 tvs overhead the treadmills & 1 flr to ceiling window w/not agreat view.

We paid $159 for 3 nights with the last night costing I think $299. Obviously at this time of year during the week of Thanksgiving, the rates are going to be higher than usual. We had a \"superior\" room with a king sized bed on the 39th floor (room 3904) which was \"ok\". The superior rooms are supposed to be newly renovated, on higher floors, and with more of a view, I guess, than their standard rooms. I couldn't really tell that the room was newly renovated. The furnishings looked ok, but the color scheme and decor didn't look very updated. The carpet also didn't appear to me to be very new. The \"view\" was so-so (see pictures). We had a partial view of Times Square and a \"full view\" of some building under construction across the street. From the pictures on their website, I was expecting a flat panel tv set. However, we just had an average set in our room. Also, if you like coffee, you're on your own. I guess you could order room service, but there is no coffee maker in the room. Checkout is a 12:00 and you can try to request a late checkout by calling the front desk. They allowed us to check out at 1:00 pm. This was nice since we were going to try to go see the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. We went to the parade and ended up coming back to the hotel during the middle of it since it started to rain. We were able to partially open the windows in our room to see a somewhat obstructed view of the parade as it passed by. I wouldn't recommend this particular room though specifically for viewing the parade. There are much better views at other hotels along the parade route. As for breakfast, I would recommend the Pigalle cafe which is located nearby at 790 8th ave [----]. The food was good and reasonably priced. We never tried the restaurant in the hotel lobby as the prices looked too expensive ($9 per egg, as opposed to $2 per egg at Pigalle). As for other restaurants, there were so many places to choose from that we didn't know where to begin. We asked the concierge for recommendations for nearby restaurants, and we went to one of his picks for Chinese. Bad choice. I can't remember the name now, but it was horrible! There is supposed to be a good barbecue restaurant right there on the same street as the hotel, but being from the south, we wanted to try something different. We also ended up going to Lombardi's pizzeria on Spring St (need to take subway), just for the history and experience. It was not too bad, but not outstanding. Overall, I would give this hotel a 3 star rating (or maybe a 3.5). We stayed at the Broadway Crowne Plaza the last time we stayed in New York, and I thought it was much nicer. The rates were too inflated for the Crowne at this time of year, so we opted for the deal we got at the Millennium.

The location of the hotel cannot be beaten if you want to be in the middle of things. It is yards from Times Square. Unfortunately the crowds there are an inevitable fact of life, particularly if you just need the closest subway station. But it is also easy to go in the other direction to 6th or even 5th Avenue to avoid this, and there are plenty of sights and shops in that direction. We arrived very late (about 12.30 am) because of a delayed flight. The hotel was still expecting us and there was no hassle. Originally, the hotel had allocated our rooms on different floors, but one was quickly moved so that we could be on the same (non-smoking) floor. The rooms are a perfectly adequate size for an NYC hotel. (Compared to the Hudson, for example, they are positively palatial.) Everything worked, including the air conditioning which was easy to control. Some of the furniture - particularly a bedside table - was worn and rickety, but that was the only real downside. Bathroom toiletries were basic, but usable. Housekeeping was cheerful and friendly, and perfectly happy to work around our schedule. A 2 pm late checkout was free of additional charge. Unfortunately, the hotel deactivated our keys early despite this having been arranged, which involved a trip back to reception for each room to have the keys reactivated. And the hotel wanted to see photo ID, which was ironic because it was locked in the safe in the room. But a signature also sufficed. We were offered a hotel car to JFK at $59 including tolls and tip, which I think is competitive with a taxi, as taxi trips are metered not flat rate in this direction - and the hotel car was more comfortable than a taxi. So that was a pleasant end to the trip. I would definitely be happy to be allocated this hotel again. If booking directly, my loyalty is still to the hotel at the United Nations Plaza (now run by the same chain) because of the hardware there - the size of the rooms, their location and outlook, and the facilities.

Couldn't ask for any better than that. A cool feature of this hotel is the elevator ride. There are five elevators serving 52 floors...that's one elevator serving every ten floors...yet I NEVER ONCE waited more than 30 seconds for it to arrive. The Marriot Marquis can't say that. This is because the elevators at the Millenium Broadway are rockets. They go so fast that you feel like you're being hijacked...especially when you're on a high foor. Every time you get off your ears will be popping. You can feel the wind blowing in your face as the elevator car descends or ascends. The elevators are a thrill ride. But don't be worried.. they are just quick and perfectly safe. Don't stay at the Marriot Marquis and spend your whole day in the greatest city in the world waiting for an elevator.

We were there from May 6-9th. We got the room on Priceline so we got a great deal. From the previous reviews I had read I asked for a renovated room. We got there early so we couldn't check in yet. They held our bags at no charge. When we got back at 4:30 the room was ready however I had requested a king size bed and had gotten two twins. I asked them to see if they had a King size and they made a change for us. We had two rooms so they had to change them both but there was no problem. They were very accomodating. We were put on the 33rd floor in a corner room with a nice view. The room was not renovated yet but I was happy to forego that for the King bed. The room size was plenty big with a nice size closet and a very large bathroom. There was an in room safe, hair dryer and ironing board. The room needed to be updated but it was clean. We slept with a window open every night. You could hear some noise of the city but not enough to keep you awake. This hotel is convenient to everything in Times Square and the Theater District. We walked everywhere and there is a subway entrance 2 blocks away. On W 44th St between 7th and 8th there is a pizza place called John's. It was excellent.

This is an exceptional hotel with a staff to match. The doormen are always ready to help and the bellmen are first rate.......comparable to the best hotels I have stayed in. After a recent hospital stay I had special needs on this trip which were attended to so efficiently and with such kindness. Check-in is a breeze since as soon as one arrives at the desk, one of several desk clerks are ready to help. We were in our room in ten minutes from the time we entered from the street. The lobby is grand in the deco style with tons of polished black marble and a sweeping staircase. Fresh flower arrangements and huge mythologically inspired paintings were stunning and the many elevators are ALWAYS available and the fastest I have ever been in. Maid service was excellent and unbotrusive and the rooms were extremely quiet with unbelieveable skyline views. The concierge desk was always helpful and of course Broadway/Times Square is just around the corner. Taxis were always available. Check-out was simple since a bill was presented at the room door on the morning of departure and I only needed to call the desk to let them know our departure time. A terrific choice for anyone staying in this greatest of cities. Tips: If you are driving, drop off your luggage and drive just across the Queensborough bridge (59th and 1st)to the guarded municipal enclosed deck (bear right after crossing the bridge and look for the signs). There is a subway station right there that will take you back to Times Square and the rate is $11 per day. For the best Italian food try Cascina (9th ave between 45th and 46th) just a few blocks from the hotel. For Greek, the best is Phylos in the East Village. Both are reasonable, exceptional and family owned. If you want to see a great night club drag show a la \"Birdcage/Le Cage Aux Folle\" you must go to \"Lips\" in the village.

First, my flight got in early in the AM. They let me check into my room around 10 AM. The room is very nice and clean, nicely appointed decor and furniture. It includes high speed Internet access (requires an Ethernet connection). Far nicer than the Hilton hotels I have stayed at previously (perhaps the nicest hotel I have stayed in to date). This hotel has two entrances -- one on W. 44th St. and the other on W. 45th St. From 11 PM - 6 AM, only the W. 45th St. entrance is open (and, you have to show your room key to the security guard to get in). At any rate, I usually would exit using the 44th St. entrance -- it's right around the corner from the Swatch store on Broadway (about 1.5 blocks away from Times Square). (Also, there are some restaurants and a Cranberry Deli that are right next to the hotel.) I had no problem sleeping at the hotel. The guests were quiet. Also, the hotel is off Broadway and so it's naturally more quiet. The bed was comfortable, etc. Basic observations about the \"Classic Room\": 1) There is a closet with plenty of hangers, a full-sized mirror, iron, and ironing board. 2) There is a TV, dresser, workdesk, ottoman, bed, two chairs. 3) Several lamps in the room and overhead light. 4) While there are snacks that are \"provided,\" you must pay for them if you eat them (and probably they are not cheap). 5) The temperature control and water flow of the shower is excellent. Other things about the hotel: 1) On the second floor of the hotel, there are about 7 computers with which you can access the Internet, use Microsoft Word, book car service, etc. Generally, one has to pay for the Internet/computer usage by the minute (you can use cash or a credit card). There is also an attached printer. 2) There is a fitness facility. 3) There is a nice gift shop. 4) There is a bell stand -- you can store your luggage before check-in time if your room is not ready. Also, if you want to check out \"early\" but leave your bags behind (and come back when you have your limo/shuttle take you to the airport), you can check it with the bellman. 5) There is a theatre desk with an agent that can assist you in getting tickets to Broadway plays. 6) There is a concierge. --------- Slight problems I experienced (why this hotel gets an 'above average' rating instead of excellent from me): 1) When I got into my room, it was absolutely baking. The heat was turned on *high*! It was at least 90 degrees F.

Instead of an up/down button to call the elevator, they have a programmed keypad where you punch in the floor number you want to go to and it tells you which elevator to wait in front of.

They said is was a 4-star hotel, but I am in the process of disputing. This is a clean , adequate hotel. Well, mostly clean--read the other review below about the need for replacing carpet due to stains. But, it is CLEARLY not a 4-star hotel as advertised. The Marriott Marquis accross the street IS a 4-star hotel. This place reminds me of the Doubletree Metropolitan, where I have stayed previously in NY. Although, if you prefer a smaller hotel with fewer amenities over the mega-hotel with almost every amenity, then maybe the Millenium Broadway is for you. The business center is closed on weekends, and if you need the internet then you will have to use it in the lobby where it will cost you over $10 PER DAY. When I'm on vacation, I like to use the internet to check weather, make dinner reservations or see restaurant menus, buy tickets, check finances, etc. I brought my wireless laptop, but all for not! The room was TINY, even by NY standards (see attached pics). The good part about the hotel is the location. It is just a half a block from times square, and if you get the right room, you can actually see part of TS out of your window (see attached pics). Then, you can catch the subway at 42nd street, a good NY 2.5 blocks away, to get just about anywhere you needed to go. Beware that the location close to TS is both good AND bad. Good in the sense that if you need food, shopping, or entertainment, then you only have to walk about 5 minutes from you room. But, don't forget that NY is the city that never sleeps, and this is particularly true of TS. The hotel does recede from the street a bit, but be accustomed to noise well into midnight if your room overlooks the street, especially on the weekends. Restaurant at the MB is overpriced and understaffed. There are far to many place to eat around the hotel to waste your time here. If you get a chance, go to Carmine's on 44th (same as MB) for THE BEST Italian food ever. It is family style and a little expensive, but well worth it. Then, don't miss cheesecake at Lindy's.

The location was great - right in Times Square, 10 feet from the Toys R Us, and a short block away from the Shubert Theatre were we saw Spamalot. The hotel was nice and clean looking but my biggest gripe was the check in counter. There is a huge column right in the middle with 2 people on one side and 1 person on the other side to check people in. Guests came and they had no idea where to stand. I tried to form one line and stand right in front of the pole so I could see both sides of the desk. As more people came, they chose one side or the other and completely ignored that I was standing there. I was kind enough to point out to the man in front of me, who was standing to the right of the pole, that a lady on the left was available for check in. But then I got cut off by two old ladies on the left side and then a huge group of people went to stand on the right side! Frustrated, I moved to the right side where the group of people noticed that I was there first. My boyfriend had to stand on the left side but the two old ladies failed to notice we had been standing there and took the next available person. Everyone seemed confused trying to form their own line or split up into different lines. What a mess! The situation only seemed to worsen as later in the day, lots more people were checking in and were just milling about in huge clumps. All the hotel needed was to put some barriers in place to indicate one line and it would have been fine. My reservation was correct though I should have requested a higher floor as I was put on 17 which is the lowest floor for rooms (16 has a fitness center and other stuff). The room was a good size with a sitting area and king bed. The night tables were a bit odd as the one on my boyfriend's side appeared to have something hidden inside as it was locked on the front with a vent out of the top. Very strange... the room was sort of dark with just a couple lamps to light the room. The man who brought our bags was very nice and pointed out where everything was. The bathroom was probably the nicest part as it was done all in marble tile and the bathtub had one of those shower rods that curve out so the tub seems that much bigger. Also, the water temp and water pressure were good. The bed was a bit strange as there was no blanket. There was sheet for the mattress, a flat sheet, and then the customary cover. But no blanket! We found one in the closet but I was still cold. Most hotels have a blanket on the bed AND a blanket in the closet. I would have liked a coffee maker and some tea bags that even an $80 motel in rural Maine that I went to had, but this hotel had none. There was a strange tinking noise all night long (the fan I think) and the whole door seemed to shake whenever someone in the hall would close their door. I kept thinking someone was coming in. You couldn't hear the street noise at all though and the view was ok with a side view of Times Square. This is the 4th hotel I have stayed in NYC and I would rate it #3. Sofitel comes in #1 on my list with its plush down comforters and friendly staff. #2 would be the Hilton Times Square. The Millenium was better than my #4 choice, the Roosevelt, because of the nice sized rooms and bathrooms, the nice bellman, and the elevators that actually come.

This holds true for the Millennium - the service in my opinion was simply okay. Staff gets the job done for you, but don't expect the 4-star smiles and pleasantries. God forbid you hit a bump in the road that requires a talk with management, because I don't think you are going to get what you want. Thankfully our arrangements were smooth sailing.

There is just enough room in there to move between chairs, bed and bathroom. Overall it was a nice room and I liked it. The location is of course excellent if you are in the city to see the sites and be close to Times Square. It's literally stone's throws from TS and it takes less than 2 minutes to walk there.

We had a room at the end of the hall which was adjacent to two others, all three of which had doors that would slam pretty loud if you just let them go. If you are a light sleeper like I am it will wake you up. I tried to sleep-in a couple of times just to be woken by the door slamming of the adjacent rooms by house keeping and who knows what staff. The doors don't just slam once, but many times. So just when you start drifting off to sleep another one will come along in a timely manner to pull you right back out of your slumber.

Concierge deserves all the compliments. They are so helpful as regards restaurant and location information. In my opinion, especially the two ladies at the concierge upgrade the image of the Hotel. I hope the Hotel Management is aware of this! They are giving a remarkable help with the information. (Note: I did not buy theatre tickets through them.) On the other hand, the Reception is sending mix messages depending on whom you speak to! I came to the Hotel at about 11.30. The receptionist told me that my room was not ready and I should wait until 16.30! As you can guess it was a very long time. He told me to check the room status in every half an hour! Of course, this was why I came to NY; to check the status of my hotel room in every half an hour during the day! He told me they had 750 rooms! Frankly speaking, he seemed to me ignorant and careless, sort of a recorded tape. As you can guess it was not a very warm welcome in the July heat of NY. He gave me a hard time. And I thought no way. Hence, I shifted to another receptionist. She was polite and helpful. But it did not make a huge prompt change in my case. I have been told there were other waiting guests who arrived at 06.30! So after making my complaints, I left my luggage at the Hotel and left for the city. However, apparently she upgraded me and gave me a corner room at the 45th floor. Room and bath room were spacious and clean. Very big bed and an impressive view of the city. Elevators were quick. Many people in and out. Busy inside traffic. Lobby and breakfast room are pretty small. But that is ok, because we do not come to NY to spend time inside. But I would not say no for more space at the both sections. For the breakfast I paid $ 32 a day. So I was amazed when I read in tripadvisor.com pages that someone paid just $ 20 for the breakfast. What a huge difference! When I was leaving the Hotel, I asked a cab for the airport. The luggage guy (porter) told me I could use the Hotel's cars (with driver) instead of a cab by paying $ 60 (with his terms \"tip and everything included\".) I was in hurry and said ok.

I called the hotel directly that evening to get details and make some room requests. As soon as the person on the phone, who turned-out to be the overnight manager, learned that it was our anniversary, he went all-out to get us the best room possible. He upgraded our room and we were given a 10 AM check-in to a superior corner room on the 48th floor. It was spectacular. The view was great, and the room was beautiful. The beds are at-least as good as those at Westin, and the decor is very soothing (see photos). We were concerned that the elevators would take forever, being on an upper floor. However, we found that they were almost psychic in their opening as soon as you entered the elevator lobby. Once on an elevator, it took-off like a rocket. I had also called ahead to the concierge to get some good restaurant suggestions. Philip set-us-up with a reservation at San Domenico on Central Park South, making sure to discuss with the manager that it was a special evening and that we were \"VIPs\" (his idea...not mine). We arrived to be given a beautiful table in an elegant, upscale Northern Italian restaurant. His recommendation was spot-on for a romantic dinner, and we were treated to an outrageous \"Panna Cotta\" custard for dessert because of the occasion. The concierge also gave us good recommendations for more casual dining, and provided us with a great theater discount packet, helping us avoid the lines at TKTS for discount seats.

Some minor issues in the room (tub stopper was broken, so our 4yr old couldn't take a bath and the dial was missing from the A/C unit, but we didn't need to adjust the temp).

The corner is very busy with Toys R Us, so we used the entrance on 45th, next to Starbucks. Trip Report: We found plenty of things to keep our 4yr old occupied. We walked to Central Park (about 20blocks) via 7th ave and ended up at Columbus Circle. We walked around the park and stumbled upon Victoria Gardens. Spent hours there going on all the rides (over and over again). Took the E train to Queens to visit family, and back into the city without any hassles. The subway system was overwhelming at first, but easy to understand once you looked at the Transit map. Took the #1 train to Canal Street (be in the first 5 cars, that station only has room for the first 5 cars). Crossed the street and starting looking for the Louis Vuitton and Coach bags. They aren't displayed, you have to ask, then they'll take you into the backroom or downstairs. Negotiate!!!

Also, the next room we went into had a moldy smell. We called housekeeping and it took them a little bit to come and when he did he was very friendly and told us that it was water damage and to call and request a room change. However, we knew the hotel was booked full, we had our luggage everywhere, we were only staying for two nights and knew we wouldn't spend much time in the room, so we just decided to try to air out the room.

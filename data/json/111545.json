We only stayed at this hotel because it was a travel deal from Groupon for 3 nights ($150 total). The place might have potential if the rooms & building can be renovated. The elevators are a joke. You never know if it's going up or down and they are SLOW. I carried all my stuff down 9 floors to the parking lot after checking out because trying to get on an elevator was not possible. Other than the location, the saving grace of this place is the staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The worst part of this place is the restaurant. It is terrible!!! It took over 30 mins to get our food (burger & chicken sandwhich) and there were only 2 other guests there. Turns out all the 'to go' orders were getting filled as we just sat there waiting & wondering what was going on. Don't order the cole slaw... it's GROSS! Actually, it was all pretty gross. The rooms really need a face lift and the bathrooms need to be updated. This was the first time we have ever seen painted shower tiles.

Our room was clean, the beds were so COMFORTABLE, and the fridge and microwave worked. The door to the balcony could use some work, but it's nothing we couldn't get over. The elevators are much better this year and seemed to be working just fine during our stay. The only problem I have with this hotel is PARKING. You have to pay $8.50/day for a \"resort fee\" which includes pool towels, parking, wireless, etc. That's fine. However, there isn't always enough parking and sometimes you have to park across the 4 lane street (Atlantic Ave) and walk to and from the hotel. That parking lot is kind of sketchy, sketchy enough that they have a \"security guard\" manning in. We went out one morning to find an empty beer bottle next to our car, amongst a bunch of trash. The pool is very nice and clean. Its only open from 8am-11pm and it would be nicer if it was open later, but whatever. It's a nice place to hang out and swim. The view from the pool deck is also very nice and there is a window that goes to the bar from out there where you can order drinks. They also added a \"fitness center\", which includes a treadmill, bike, elliptical, and free weights. This hotel has some of the best views ever. The breakfast view from Atlantic Jacks is breathtaking and both times our room has had a nice view. We booked on Expedia this year and received free breakfast each morning that was delicious. We extended our trip through the hotel and they gave me a wonderful rate and included free breakfast. The lady that served breakfast was really nice and efficient at her job. We also really enjoyed the bar within the hotel and the staff there is very friendly. The bar is open crazy hours and will close if there aren't many people in there which kind of sucks. They also have a concierge service which offers COUPONS! The front desk staff was very nice. Jennifer always had a smile on her face and was good for conversation at 7am when we went to get our breakfast vouchers. The hotel is in a very nice location also.

Brittany at the front desk was really Nice. She welcomed us soon as we got to the desk, as there was a very long line. I took that as a great sign that we were at the right place. How many people would be standing in a line for this long, and still want to stay here? She was very helpful! There was also a girl named Kaelie (spelling might be off? Sorry) She was very helpful in telling me and my wife where we could go to grab not only a bite to eat, but also listen to great music! My wife \"LOVES\" reggae, and the place that Kaelie reccomended to us was perfect! The best was the atmosphere. We sat out on the deck part where there are only three steps between you and the sands of the beach. We watched the waves as we ate and listened to really great music. When we got back to the Hotel, I believe Kaelie was on her way out and even asked us how was dinner and the music. My wife just loved her, and said that she was the first person ever to steer us in the right direction of a great place to have fun, and ask about it and really mean it! We've been to some pretty pricy hotels in the past, with really up scale anemnities, and service that was outstanding. But She pretty much made us feel the welcome in our stay!! She told us that she would see us the next day and told us to have a great night! My wife was just so happy with the service, and at Atlantic Jacks I think it was called, we ate lunch there the next day and we shared a great chicken salad, and the fries are home cooked tasting. The only thing was that the bathroom was a little dingy, not dirty, but you can tell it was an older establishment. But hey, whos spending their vacation in the bathroom? Not US! The pool was really cool as it sat over looking the beach. It was a little cloudy, but that's because there were a lot of people getting in with suntan lotions and coming straight from the beach, so I guess you can't help that.... anything that me and my wife needed was taken care of, and in the morning, we decided that this was going to be our home, away from home when we come to Daytona Beach. Because of the service and attitudes of the girls at the front desk, and house keeping, we didn't notice any of the minor things that were a little less than perfect at the hotel!

Starting with the bathroom there was mold all over the wallpaper border, the tub did not drain at all, the floor had black hair all over it and looked like no one had cleaned it, the blow dryer was missing and it appeared that it had been ripped off the wall. It was disgusting. The bed spreads had cigarette holes burned into them, there were bugs all over the floor and there was an odd smell in the room. The balcony which was suppose to provide a beautiful view of the ocean was covered in bird droppings and since we had a view of the roof we could see mounds of trash that guests had thrown off their balcony, liquor bottles, towels, beer cans, food, wrappers, you name it. Again, very disgusting. This hotel makes it very obvious that they cater to the spring break partiers and everyone who works there is completely unprofessional and rude.

I as disappointed about the change, but they discounted the upgrade by $10.00 per night, which I appreciated. When we got to our room on the 6th floor it was clean but not up to the standards of a room we would normally stay in.

My older son appreciated the free wi-fi and it worked well for him. The pool area was great and my younger son and I spent most of our time there. They really seem to put alot of effort into making sure he outside of this hotel looks nice. I would suggest that they do all the pool maintenance and cleaning of the area before the pool opens at 8 am. I had to move all of my stuff one morning so that a maintenance guy could hose down/wash the windows in the meeting area. I think he should have done this before the pool opened. I found the front desk/restaurant/bar staff to be very friendly and interesting to talk to. The staff is likely the best part of the hotel, followed by the pool area.

The tiles in the shower and bathroom looked new. The room was spacious with what appeared to be new beddings and pillows. Some parts of the hotel were dated, but come on..this is Daytona. Most of Daytona is dated, in my opinion. The pool was nice & we were literally right on the beach. The hotel restaraunt was average with good service.

The only issue we had was staying the same time as the First Baptist Church of Tifton youth group (of what appeared to be 100+ teenagers).

I do believe the hotel staff and other guests were beyond ready for this group to leave!! :-) This is in no way the staffs fault. They appoligized over and over again. I believe a manager named John(?) even gave my husband his personal cell phone number in case we had any other issues. After the group left, there were no more issues. Again, I cannot say enough good about the staff at the hotel. If you have a problem, let them know. I feel sure they will work hard to correct it.

I read some of the reviews and they were fairly positive so I was surprised at how disappointed I was. First, the hotel is old and it looks and smells moldy; they are renovating so maybe they will take care of the smell. The receptionists at check-in were unpleasant at best. They did not make eye contact and acted like we were a nuisance. We were not told about any features of the hotel - the pool, the restaurant, the bar, amenities, etc. Our room was okay. It had a kitchenette, which was nice, but the fridge leaked so whatever you put in there got filled with water within hours. The freezer was so full of ice it could not be used. There was a microwave, sink and shelving. The room was a decent size and looked fairly clean but the bathroom had mold on the walls and the tile in the shower was literally crumbling. The water coming out of the shower was hot and came out fast - a big plus, but we did not have a tub stopper so we had a heck of a time giving our baby a bath. On a least two occasions, housekeeping did not leave us fresh towels or coffee and when we called the front desk to ask for some they told us they only had one working dryer and we would have to wait until the towels were washed. The patio was small but it faced the ocean which was nice. What wasn't nice were the other tenants that were smoking all around us which made sitting on the patio (and by the pool) unpleasant. The hotel is within walking distance of the boardwalk and ocean shops. The pool was clean but the shallow, three-foot area for kids was very small which made it difficult for my six-year-old to play. There was a one-foot baby pool that was filled with stagnant water - gross. The restaurant on site, Atlantic Jacks, was terrible. We had Groupons to use so we decided to have dinner there the first night. We were the only people there (which should have clued us in that this was not a good place to eat). We ordered and never got our food. We waited 20 minutes, I asked the server where our food was and she laughed. My daughter got bored and crawled under the table and announced that there was gum under the table. We got up and left. We decided to use our Groupons at the bar instead - they didn't have wine and the bartender didn't have what he needed to make most of the drinks they advertised on their sign. He got irritated when I asked him to put cherries in my daughter's Shirley Temple. The bar is connected to the restaurant so if you eat in the restaurant, be prepared to smell smoke. We found out on our sixth day there that they had a breakfast buffet. We spent $30 for, basically, a continental breakfast - cold bacon, cold sausage, toast, danishes covered in fruit flies from the bar, fruit, hard biscuits and hard, cold waffles. The elevators, stairs and parking are a MAJOR safety concern and I will be writing a letter to their corporate office about my observations. The stairwells run on the outside of the hotel and the doors leading to the stairs and to the rooms are unlocked so anyone with ill intentions can hide there. As a woman, I didn't feel safe using the stairs. Plus, they reeked of urine. Secondly, the elevators are very dangerous. The doors close very quickly and the safety feature that lets you wave a hand in front of the door to keep it from closing was not working so my family and I almost had arms and legs crushed by the door, literally. With two kids, bikes, a stroller, a beach tent, etc., it took a minute to get off the elevator and one time the door closed on my arm as I was holding my daughter's hand. She was still in the elevator and I had to put my body in the door of the elevator and push it open. My daughter was screaming and I was completely panicked. The same thing happened to my husband. The other safety concern I had was that we had to park across the street in the overflow lot. I did not feel safe walking there by myself. My husband had to make numerous trips there and he was often stopped by homeless people asking for money. And, it was across the street from Lollipops Gentlemen's Club. Not something I want my six-year-old to see. On our last night there, someone set fire to the dumpster that was right below our room. It could have easily caught the hotel on fire. No one was alerted, the smoke alarms did not go off but the next day, the entire dumpster and surrounding wooden shed it was encased in was burnt to a crisp. Other observations - The pool did not have a bar and the bar did not open until 5; no one was monitoring the pool so there were a few times where unruly kids were carrying on and being obnoxious; we got hassled by some guy as we were entering the building one night (not sure if he was staying there or if he was homeless); dogs are allowed so you may be kept awake by barking; elevators are slow (there are only two); the beach in front of the hotel was great - clean and quiet; the air conditioner fan ran all night which was great for us; the beds and pillows are very firm.

Well at 2:13am some dummy decides to have a party in the parking lot and turns his stereo up and wakes us up. I call the front desk & they say they can't do anything about it cause they are in the parking lot next door. I hang up the phone & I see a roach on the night stand & kill it then call the front desk back & ask if they can call the cops n she says no so I call the cops so I can sleep We get up in the morning and look for another hotel n the manger called because we called our travel company to get our points n money back so our vendor calls the hotel. So the manager gives us a third room with a free breakfast everyday for the rest of our stay, we were not n there 5 minutes and killed five roaches my wife called the manager to come up to the room to see the roach crawling on the wall. The manager told us they didn't have roaches they were palmetto bugs. Manager didn't come up to the room she called back and said she was handling other issues but she has the cleaning manager looking into another room. We said no thanks and check out.

I was pleased with some parts of this hotel. It is right on the ocean/beach and has a very nice pool and deck area, the lounges are comfortable and not hot. The outside front is very inviting. There is a restaurant in it which serves breakfast and lunch and I ate at the restaurant for 3 lunches and they were pretty good and priced reasonably. My check-in went well, but check-out wasn't too good since there were long lines because a huge amount of people were checking in in groups. The room I had was a small king size room and there was a hole in the wall, the bathroom needs updating. They had painted over the tile in the bathtub/shower area which was peeling and the sink stopper wouldn't work correctly. They obviously have purchased new towels that were just great. The bed was not comfortable and the pillows were horrible. The TV watching was hard since the screen was dark at times to see the picture. They had a microwave and refrigerator which was nice. This wasn't a great room, as I travel a lot and so I had said something about it to the waitress, who inturn told the new Mgr of the hotel and he called me. He told me that they are remodeling this hotel as there are new owners and new management company and for me to come back again in the fall to see the updates on the remodeling. They are putting in new carpeting, new beds, all new bedding/pillows, new TV's and the following year they will be remodeling the bathrooms. He sent a crew into my room after I checked out to fix the hole in the wall. The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful, as well the waitress. I was told they will turn this hotel into a DoubleTree establishment. So I will go back there in the fall to see all the new changes. It looks like they redid the blacktop on the property so parking is easy, however, the night before I left I could barely find a parking space on the property and saw a couple coming to a car in the back and so I waited and got their space. There is another overflow lot about a block away, but I am recovering from heart surgery and walking that distance is too much for me.

Our first mistake was letting ourselves get lured to Florida by a travel club whereas we had to visit 3 locations in Florida; one of them being Daytona. This is the hotel that we HAD to stay at. After waiting a few hours to get checked in, we finally made it to our room to find it pretty shabby. It looks more like a dorm room, with rusty old microwave and bar frig but we thought it is only for 2 nights - how bad could it be? After finding all kinds of junk on the carpet, including a pill, we headed down to the pool to try to relax before going to dinner. The pool area is pretty basic and after sitting there for awhile, I went into our beach bag to find it soaking wet. I thought it might have been my water bottle leaking but it was actually coming up out of the ground. Not quite sure what it was that was coming out of the ground, just hoping it was only water. When we went back to the room to get ready for dinner, we were going to shower until we saw how utterly disgusting it was. The floor of the tub is totally black and they tried to cover it up with a bath mat. The tiles and grout have been painted numerous times with different tints of paint, probably trying to disguise mold and mildew. No way were we going to shower in there. The walls and doors have all been damaged and instead of fixing them properly, they are just patched with paint (that doesn't even match) slapped over it. After managing to get somewhat freshened up, we headed out to find somewhere to eat. After asking at reception for some recommendations, we still had no idea what was good in the area. We figured there must be something within walking distance so headed north. After a few minutes, we felt very unsafe and turned around. We finally came upon The Oyster Bar which looked like it was ok. After dinner we headed back to the hotel and thought we would sit on the balcony and enjoy a drink while looking over the ocean. As soon as we stepped onto the balcony, our feet stuck to the ground. It seems that many of the spring breakers can't figure out how to get over the raised edge without spilling their drinks and the cleaning staff doesn't seem to clean out there or even the doors for that matter. You couldn't see out of them as they were totally covered with finger marks and god knows what else. We figured we might as well head to bed as we had to go to the presentation early in the morning. After about 2 hours of restless sleep, I awoke to scratching my legs. We had checked the bed quickly for bed bugs when we first checked in but didn't notice any. Obviously, we missed them because my legs were covered in bites. Not being able to get back to sleep, I was checking for other hotels to stay in for the next night until I was so exhausted I fell back to sleep until being woken up by 3 rounds of spring breakers coming in around 5:00 am hooting and hollering. I didn't care what we had to do, we were not staying there another night. When we told the travel club that we refused to stay there another night, they were gracious enough to have us moved to the hotel next door, The Plaza Resort and Spa but we had to pay an extra $30. At that point, I would have paid anything. Unless you are strictly there to party and don't care where you sleep, I would stay away from this place.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, New York, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Friendly Staff!\u201d", "Author": "fudungo", "ReviewID": "UR127766474", "Content": "We got the room on a Groupon for $159.00 for three nights and were able to put two Groupons together make it a six night stay!

(If you do, well there's a handy car wash about 6 blocks away!)) Overall hotel location = great. Quite decent wireless internet connection (and our room was at the end of the hallway). Super friendly and helpful desk clerk personnel. Nice size rooms--though it was hard to give a square footage guesstamate because it was so irregularly shaped. There's a nice workout area, though it's located in the neighboring, more upscale, sister hotel. Con's: Slow, cranky, kind of small elevators. The property desperately needed updating. The furnishing, rugs, linens, etc. Room suffered from an extreme shortage of wall outlets. There was a decent computer desk with built-in 3-prong outlets; but when I looked under it to try and figure out why none worked, I found the master switch wire had been snipped. Also, one could either plug in the microwave OR the office size refrigerator.

We were on a no-smoking floor, but the hallway nevertheless had a definite cigarette odor.

The front desk apologized for the rooms that were occupied and actually told us that they were unable to know which rooms were already assigned to other guests. (REALLY!) So multiple people and multiple trips up and down the slowwwwww elevators later keys were working and people were in rooms. Employees were in the hallways but were not very friendly or helpful and actually yelled at us for having our luggage in the hall. This was while we were waiting for new keys. Later that night after returning from work I came off the elevator onto my floor and was immediately hit with the smell of marajuana. When I got into my room it smelled as if someone had been smoking it IN my room. It was unbearable. I opened my balcony door (which faced the beach and was beautiful!) to air out and to left. When I came back a couple hours later the smell had weakened but was still there. I called the front desk who said they were sending security up since it was a non smoking floor but it continued multiple though out the night and made for a restless sleep. The wrap it up and review... The hotel is like most of the other hotels along the beach. Mediocre rooms. Sure there is a bed and toilet and shower. But, for example, the door kicks were rusted and the balcony had bugs. So don't expect luxury. It's right on the beach and close to lots of bars and restuaunts which makes it a great location. Where this hotel falls flat is in their seemingly incompetent staff and poor poor customer service. If that's not important then you should be fine here. Just don't expect any help or solutions should you run into any issues.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, Il", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal\u201d", "Author": "Linny_10", "ReviewID": "UR125044886", "Content": "We found this hotel in a brochure from the Florida Welcome center.

Daytona Beach Shores at night seems too dark for me. The not so good which can be very annoying: the pool seems to get alot of people who are not staying at the hotel but they dont care, the restaurant is not so good and I'm being kind and going to the front desk is like going to the twilight zone as you can sometimes wait 30 minutes on line to ask for a towel as they are 100% clueless. We want to go to the beach and the desk girl is chatting away about her personal life and there are 15 people on line! Service overall very poor but if you dont need them often you may be ok. And lastly you will wait and wait for elevators here. In summary I would stay here again if under $70 but not a penny more.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beckley, West Virginia", "Title": "\u201cIt was just like the pictures on the Internet\u201d", "Author": "jene38", "ReviewID": "UR115578126", "Content": "The staff was very friendly, rooms were nice ,bathrooms were ok, the pool area was nice, access to the beach was great, not enough light on the parking lot, lobby was just like the pictures on enternet, it was pet friendly didnt like that part. but for an overall stay it was ok .", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice place for an enjoyable weekend\u201d", "Author": "cthomas102060", "ReviewID": "UR115457138", "Content": "We arrived late Friday and checked in.

The hotel is steps from the beach and has a small restaurant and bar onsite. We had an oceanview room, which was average size and clean,although it could use some updating. Mini-fridge in the room nice to have with kids. The common areas of the hotel-lobby, bathrooms, restaurant, all appear fairly clean, and staff was frequently seen cleaning up. The staff was friendly and helpful with any requests. Pool towels can be signed out at the front desk which was nice. The pool was large, there are plenty of chairs and tables, upbeat music playing in the pool area. There is also a 1 foot deep kiddy pool for the little ones. Issues we had: Elevators!!!! - The hotel has only 1 set of elevators, so there is often a long wait for an elevator, on check out day we waited probably a half hour to get downstairs (had to let several elevators pass because they were full) The elevator capacity is 8, but because they take so long, many people fit as many as they can in one elevator. We were only on the 3rd floor, and would normally have just taken the stairs , but that is a whole different issue. SMELLS!!!!- The hallway didn't smell very good. The stairwells smelled TERRIBLE, awful, straightup smell of urine! we tried the stairs at both ends and they both smelled the same. It was so bad that my 10 year old son begged me not to make him take the stairs again. I don't know if they stairwells are just not cleaned regularly or what but it was really bad. The room itself was clean and not smelly . Pool Behavior- Several people drinking and smoking while in the pool. Several adults being inappropriate (making out, screaming obscenities) Overheard a few guys bragging about not even being hotel guests, parked on the beach and came to the pool. No hotel staff seen at the pool area , ever (other than the cleaning guy in the mid morning). Basically, adults acting like they are at an adult only resort, while right in front of kids. Best time to be at the pool with kids was early morning and late evening to avoid these people. Pool and pool area cleaning took place after the pool opened, didn't make much sense to me, minor annoyance to have to watch the kids trying to avoid the pool vacuum hose constantly but at least it was clean. Overall we had a great stay, once we learned to avoid the stairs and the drunk pool rats. If not for the hallway smell, lack of elevator I would have rated it a 4", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorest hotel ive ever stayed at\u201d", "Author": "wech", "ReviewID": "UR115172820", "Content": "The worest hotel i have ever stayed at.

Having read many of the reviews online, I still went with the plaza because the price was right. Travelers, you do get what you pay for. First, the good: 1. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. They offered to move us up to a seaside view for 10$ more a night, however that switch would not have been able to occur until the second night. We were going to, but once we had unloaded luggage and things we decided it was too much trouble. They called a taxi for our early morning departure as well. 2.The showers are very potent. 3.Walter at the lounge was way cool, and knew his way around. Gave great tips on places to hang out and eat. 4.Pool was clean. 5. Perfect location. we did not have a rental car, and did not need one, as there were plenty of restaurants and a walgreens near by as well. 6. Beds were comfortable, and did not appear to be coated with any sort of man/woman fluids. And the A/C was nice and loud/cool. The bad: 1. Housekeeping. WTF is going on with the housekeeping. Banging on the door at 8AM twice and just yelling HOUSEKEEPING HOUSEKEEPING. I seriously had to get out of bed to tell them to go away, because they didnt get the hint. heres an idea. Look at your census. OH these people are here for a week. We don't HAVE to clean these particular rooms at 8 in the morning. They can wait. At least they obeyed the do not disturb sign the rest of the trip. Really, its mostly about the housekeeping. One day, They didnt leave any toilet paper. Another, They didnt leave towels. Another, the rooms were clean, but the top blankets were left balled up on the floor. Over the last 10 years I have stayed at many different hotels on the gulf and atlantic side, and this one had the absolute worst housekeeping I've ever seen, and hotel management should be embarrassed. 2. Understaffed front desk. Only two computers, sometimes only one person available to help customers. Lines were a bit outrageous. 3. Our room had a partial roof view, and there was a diaper on the roof. 4. Bathroom was scuzzy. There was a black mold/substance on the shower curtain. So i thought about it. 20 rooms per floor. 2 dollars probably per inner curtain. 40 dollars x 11 floors, replace those nasty curtains (I've seen others complain on tripadvisor) and that's one thing to help your appearance. 5. And just a general sense of \"patchwork\". Lots of patches on ceiling, wall, crudely covered yet obvious. 6. And while very minor, as there was only a couple hours a day that we were chilling in the room... CRT television? in 2K11? For real? Having stayed at the plaza resort next door a couple years ago, and being that both are a part of the same company, I figured I would get slightly older accommodations due to the cheaper price, but the same very high level of service and cleanliness as their sister company. As you can see, this was not the case. In a nutshell, vacationers. If you are staying in Daytona, there are better values for your money. If you are fine with the housekeeping annoyances I've described, And find with quaint things like antique televisions and ceilings/walls that have \"character\", then book here. Otherwise, follow what other TripAdvisor posters have stated, and find a different hotel to stay at. The Good things I posted, are things that pretty much anyplace can get right.

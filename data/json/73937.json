Having a full kitchen and couch is fantastic. However... The bed was horrible. It was the softest bed I have slept in and that made for a restless night and sore back. The breakfast is free and pretty good selection that the staff tries to keep stocked. However, there were some teenage sports teams there while we were and they made breakfast a nightmare the last hour. If you go early, great. If you wait until the last hour you will battle for a seat and have to push your way through to every item and wait 30 minutes just to get to the waffle maker. This isn't the hotels fault exactly, but maybe they could have a seperate breakfast room for these groups. It would make all much happier. The pool looked nice, although I didn't use it. The staff was very pleasant.

Overall my room was clean and everything worked. I will say with I-17 freeway being so close I was able to count the cars at night, especially trucks. The room I was assigned is toward the rear of the property so things can't be better closer toward the freeway. I attempted to make a toll free call from my room two hours after arriving and could not dial out. Searching for assistance I called the front desk and was told to give it a \"little time\" and they would have the problem solved. A half hour went by with better results so I called the front desk again. I was told someone was going to come to my room to remedy the issue. No representative came to my room. I made four calls in three hours. After three hours passed they quit answering my calls so I called their main number from my cell phone. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told he had just left for the day. The person answering, Johnny, asked if he could assist me so I told him who I was and was in room ---. He said please hold. I did for a few minutes. Johnny came back on the line and said \"try it now\". I did and it worked. Whatever Johnny did he could have done in the previous hours. It was a very frustrating experience. Last night with rain falling in Phoenix I was awakened many times with the loud sound of a lot of rain pouring on something metal. This morning I went outside to find out what kept me awake most of the night. On the back of the building there are no gutters nor overhang from the roof. Rain from the roof was falling straight down and falling on a metal security light. That light was opposite the headboard. There might as well not even been a wall between the light and the headboard as it was loud enough to keep anyone awake all night. One other issue was upon driving up to my room after being gone all day I found a male employee attempting to enter my room. I asked what he wanted and he said there was a water leak in my room. After examining the kitchen and bath there was not a water leak anywhere. Not sure what his intentions were beyond that I was puzzled as to his true agenda. I am thankful I came back to my room when I did. There are many places to stay in Phoenix.

Even with our GPS we had difficulty finding this property. The road leading to the front office looks as if it is leading to a parking lot for an adjacent apartment complex. It is a one-way road. Upon arrival we were informed that the room we had reserved was not available as the people who were in it previously had not left. We had booked a two night stay. There were no similar rooms available. We were then given what they call an 'upgraded' room. I respectfully disagree. Although it was also a two-bedroom two bath unit, it was facing the freeway and was upstairs in a two story building with no elevator. It was also at the furthest point from the main house and pool area which we had requested to be near. I called the front desk to complain and was told there was nothing they could do unless somebody in one of the other rooms we wanted checked out. We had booked the two bedroom two bath penthouse with loft with a much more open floorplan. This room was more like what you would find if somebody converted an old hotel and just joined three regular rooms together in a row placing the living room in the middle. The next morning I went to the front office and voiced my concerns about the room again. I was once again told that I should be happy since it was an 'upgrade'. I was then told to pack up all of our belongings and place them in the middle of the living room floor. That way if somebody did check out then they would send maintenance to move our belongings to the new room. I was so displeased with the room we were in that I was glad to do at least that. When we returned we found that indeed we had been moved. I was pleased with the accommodations the second night that overlooked the pool area. The breakfast area at this hotel was lacking. Not nearly enough food and some weird spices were used to cook some of it. I would expect more consistency throughout the chain than this.

Check-in was a breeze, and they even had our last name on a placard with several other names as guest arriving for the day which I thought was a nice touch. The staff was very friendly. There is an evening light meal served as well as a hot breakfast in the clubhouse type check-in area which includes a soft drink fountain dispenser with several choices as well as a large flatscreen TV to catch up on the evening or morning news, weather, or sports. There were several tables and chairs in and around this area. There are drinks and snacks available all hours of the day for purchase that are located to the right of the front desk. They had a huge selection of pamphlets with activities for the area near the front desk which was very helpful. The pool was very clean and gated. They had a great play area with a slide and climbing area just outside our room location with a bench for us to sit on while our child enjoyed himself. This was a great convenience to allow him to blow off some energy stored up from the long travel time that day. The grounds for the hotel were immaculate, and we felt very safe once on the hotel property. We did go the back way to get to the hotel thanks to our GPS. There are some areas on the way that are not as nice as you would like them to be, but this was no different than any other city I have traveled to or lived in. The Hotel is right off I-17 north with easy access via West Northern Ave. then right on North 27th Ave. and right on West Butler Drive and finally right on North Black Canyon Highway which is the way we should have traveled. This would have been much more convenient, but our GPS had other ideas LOL. With the price match guarantee from Marriott, we booked this room for 46 dollars which was a steal!

Now, I am not sure why the others posted a nasty review. I had a great stay. Room: I stayed in the back, in room 814, a studio room in the lower of a 2 story complex. Very quiet!! Maybe those other people stayed in the front.. if so, ask for building 8 or 7. My room was near the pool but I didn't use it. The room itself was plenty big for 2 people. The king bed was adequate but the pillows were very flat, so if you like firm pillows, either bring your own, or ask for more. The kitchen had enough utensils and accessories for 4 people, and the R.I. will also go grocery shopping for you, if you dont have the time! Fortunately they also had a frozen food area in the lobby so I got some lean cuisines and ate that as a late night snack. Nice feature: The room had a fireplace and a separate sitting area for TV, and a desk for work. You can get the apprpriate \"firelog\" at the front desk, but since it was 90 degees outside, we didn't bother. We did watch TV with the free microwave popcorn though! Bathroom: The water pressure in my room was great! The soap was teeny tiny, so if you need a BAR of soap, bring your own. Extra freebies: The hotel offers a light dinner on weekdays (Mon-Thurs). The menu is posted in the room and on Thursdays it seems they have a BBQ by the pool!! WOW! My stay was on a weekend, and I got a complimentary hot breakfast. They had a medley of food!! Cold cereals, hot eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuit n gravy, fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, juice , milk, coffee, tea, cocoa, and do it yourself waffles, which were a snap to make!! Bad part: Ok, I had to write this one... my neighbors upstairs were either elephants or the hotel had thin floors. When they got home at 10 pm, I could hear their footsteps. I called the front desk to remind my neighbors, but it was still noisy. Lucky I am a sound sleeper, but if you are not then ask for an upstairs unit!

So is the bag of popcorn the hotel leaves near your microwave. Decor is a little worn, but not horrible. The bed is pretty uncomfortable -- it's more of a mattress pad than a mattress. Hotel is right on the freeway, surrounded by a ton of chain restaurants and other hotels. I'm not really a chain restaurant fan, but we had a surprisingly good dinner at the Lone Star Grill across the freeway. Continental breakfast was heavy -- waffles, biscuits and gravy, etc. -- but not great. Fruit was very bruised.

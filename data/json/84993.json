We were lead to believe that the hotel was on an exclusive Island...ummm...not quite as there are very large condominiums that also share this island with the hotel. For the price paid, there were a lot of things that could be improved for very little money. Our first clue should have been the check in staff who were not dressed in any special manner when compared to other 4 and 5 star hotels we have stayed in in North America and in Europe. There wasn't a thorough explanation of the property, a list of the amenities offered, or a map given of the outlying area. When we reached our room it was obvious that while it once must have been high end for it's time, it was in need of some refreshing as the door knobs were scratched and well worn, the patio furniture was dusty and in need of new cushions, the coffee table was dinged, scratched, and the rattan under the glass was faded and half of the color was scratched off. When we went to use the portable phone, the base unit appeared to work, but obviously no one had checked the phone itself as it no longer worked. Fortunately there was a table phone which was in working order. Upon checking the bathroom we were not impressed as the tub could have easily been re caulked (there was mold around the caulking) which would have made it look more presentable. The cabinet under the sink was cracked and in need of much repair. We decided to high tail it outside as the property itself was really quite inviting and kept well. I think that is probably where all of their money goes. WE sat upon the lovely lounge chairs overlooking the water on a small sandy man made beach. My husband ordered to glasses of wine for us and when he returned with the plastic wine glasses which were in need of washing he looked very annoyed. Hmmm, not only were we charged for the wine, but they automatically add in their own gratuity. $30.00 for two glasses of wine is a bit steep. Well, upon first sip of this wine which should have been amazing for the price charged I had the urge to spit it out. It was awful! Once we dared to force ourselves to try a few more sips, I had had it and returned it politely to the bar staff who appeared surprise by my complaint. He assured me he would bring us another wine to replace the one we truly did not care for. Once again we took our first sip, blech! It tasted the same as the original wine given to us in which case it was returned again and we were given two glasses of beer which now lowered our bar bill to $19.00. We just felt that something wasn't right which led us to steer away from their in house restaurant which also had very high prices. When we finally retired to our room for the night we thought about ordering a movie, but I'm sorry $18.00 dollars for a movie is ridiculous! We gave it a miss. By the end of one night stay we paid a hotel tax, a parking fee, a overly priced bar bill and our bill came to a whopping $ 460.00. We were more than disappointed and would never consider staying there again, which is a shame because with some tweaking the hotel could have been a much different experience.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWORST HOTEL EVER!\u201d", "Author": "John7171", "ReviewID": "UR122299742", "Content": "This is BY FAR the worst hotel that my husband and I have EVER been to...and we've stayed at Holiday in Express!

The tennis facilities are excellent though the scenery around the tennis center can be quit distracting. The staff at the tennis center is first class, very accommodating and ready to help. The suites at the hotel are quite large and comfortable for a stay of a week or less. The lack of in-room laundry facilities make stays of more than a week problematic, if you're a serious player.

I took him there as a surprise for his birthday for 2 nights and i wish i would have taken him somewhere else! Before I get into the negatives and why we won't return, I will give credit where it is due. 1. The food at the restaurant (Gibraltar) is Outstanding! We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner...thank goodness as it is very pricey! 5 star prices, 5 star food, good wine list, and well trained wait staff. The young gentleman who took care of us communicated with us as though he's been in the fine dining business for 20 years and didn't look a day over 18. 2. The spa was great! Not only was their communication prior to me arriving pleasant, but we loved our massages and facials and everyone there was very helpful and professional. I would recommend a visit to the spa. Besides a dinner or spa visit, I would steer clear of this hotel for the following reasons(some reasons are minor, some major, but overall u expect much better service from a hotel like this). When we checked in,the valet was too busy playing on his phone and almost seemed confused about helping with a cart for our bags. My first thought...\"odd, oh well, maybe he's new\"). Next was check in. I purchased a romance package with spa services, valet, breakfast, best suite they have, a specific bottle of wine, etc. I did this after thoroughly researching everything and deciding that the value of the wine(we like wine and this was a good bottle) and the deal on spa services made it a decent package. I called before we arrived to ensure everything was set with the reservation and especially to verify the wine would be in the room, and I was assured all was according to plan. At the front desk, the young gentleman who checked us in said nothing of what is included in the package, of our reservations for services the next day at the spa, of our breakfast that's included, the drink coupons, etc. I again found this odd, as I've never checked into a hotel and not had them guide me along or verify these things or chat about all the great benefits I'm about to receive with my reservation. When we got to the room is where it really started to get bad. First of all, the bathroom grossed me out. The tub was so stained and dingy an the bidet was falling off the wall due to rust and mold all around it on the wall. And this is an expensive suite we are staying in! I called sown to change rooms and they didn't have any. When I looked to pour us a glass of nice red wine, all I found was cheap champagne. I called down and he said they put \"house champagne\" in as a substitute. I went down amd asked for a manager...no manager on duty! It's 7:30 pm...are u kidding me? So they get the restaurant manager, who was a very nice guy, but obviously didn't listen to what I was telling him, because then he sends up the wrong wine again. He sent up a substitute red that not only is worth half the value of the wine reserved with the package that we were supposed to get and I specifically asked hom for, but it wasn't very good. Either they try to trick people and hope they don't know any better or they are extremely pooy managed and either one doesn't sit well with me. So we didn't drink the Cabernet they sent up and ordered and paid for a good bottle at dinner in their restaurant. We would have anyway, but it's the principle. As a woman, I woke up in the middle of the night with a surprise and didn't have the womanly things I needed for this moment. I went to the desk to ask for emergency supplies...what do u think....no! Not only did they have nothing to get me through till the morning, but he acted like this is normal, not like thy ran out. They don't think of these things and don't have an on site store so I was left to drive 5 minutes to a gas station in a strange area in the dark. Before ordering breakfast, I asked the desk how I know what I am allowed to order from room service according to the package and he said it is listed on the menu in room. It wasn't, so we ordered what we wanted. They gave is no certificates or coupons or info on it. You will see why happened at check out below that relates to this... So we go to check out, and it was a fiasco! My boyfriend insisted on paying so I went to get the car from valet. Thank goodness I went to check on him because he almost payed a few hundred dollars more than he should have and he wouldn't have even known since I booked everything. They charged him for the full breakfast (no break for worth of continetal) valet for both nights, and the couples massage....all of which were included in the price of my package! When I checked the bill and got upset (and embarresed that I brought him to such a disorganized mismanaged place) the girl at the desk took off the valet and massages but again no break on breakfast. At this point I am exhausted from dealing with this place, and a man steps from the back and says he represents the corporate office and he's just visiting and apologizes and has her fix the breakfast. That's all? So it took me 20 minutes to check out to only end up at what we were originally owed based on our reservation....and acting like thy did is a favor by fixing it? Let's not forget the $100 value of wine in the package we never got. And we spent over $300 on dinner and tons of money in the spa on extra services and skin products. This place is a joke!

While the location is private and very beautiful I left feeling like I did not get my monies worth. I first noticed there was an issue with the service when I called to get information about local attractions the day before my arrival. The person at the desk told me I could \"Google\" the information. While she was correct I wanted to know what the local residents recommend. The second issue I encountered was requesting a cab to pick me up for dinner. I scheduled it through the front desk earlier in the day for an 8:10pm pick up. A cab arrived 20 minutes later than the time scheduled and I was late for my dinner reservation. Now I would say that had more to do with the cab service than the hotel but it turns out I received a call the next morning at 8:10 am indicating my cab had arrived. Ooops! Too late. They desk made the cab reservation for the wrong time. One of the really nice things about this hotel is that they are pet friendly. Unfortunately, my dog got ill in her pet carry and I needed to clean it out. I stopped one of the cleaning staff, explained the situation, and asked for some disinfectant to be brought to my room. The staff member said she would bring me disinfectant spray but never came back. I waited over an hour. The kicker of the entire experience occurred my last day when called room service to bring up 4 towels. I waited more than 30 minutes and called back to the desk indicating I still did not receive them. After waiting another 30 minutes I received 2 towels, not 4 as requested. This is not the type of service I expect from a 5 star hotel. On the positive side, the pool bar staff (Richard and Sebastian) were very attentive and helpful. Additionally, the 80 minute massage was very relaxing and I highly recommend it. However, if I had to do it again I would stay at a hotel more centrally located in Coconut Grove.

I thought I had died and went to heaven. I woke up the next morning to the most Beautiful sunrise off the water while laying in my bed. I felt like Scarface. The only thing that was missing was my own private yacht out front. That evening I sat on the patio and watched the sunset and the moon rise. The next day as I walked the halls I ran into Nicole and she remembered my first and last name. In fact half the staff remembered. They made me feel like a celebrity. I had to ask if they thought I was the way they treated me. They said no they didn't and that was just how they value there customers. Well I felt like one anyway the whole weekend. I went out to a comedy show came back and even the valet attendant remembered my name. This is indeed to me a 5 star hotel. I live in Las Vegas and know all to well what a 5 star hotel is and this hotel is at the top of my list. For the money this hotel is a hidden treasure, So much so I started not to write about my stay because I don't want to many people asking about my private room. I don't want it to be sold out when I go back again. They should name it the Vegas Suite. Anyone that does not believe how Beautiful this room is tell Nicole Kevin sent you and you want the same room she gave me. Men I promise you if you bring your lady she will not want to leave this room the whole weekend, and once you get on this private Island I think that would be the idea if you know what I mean. All I ask is that you name your first born after me.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington dc", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service, Beautiful Hotel/Resort.\u201d", "Author": "tewkewl", "ReviewID": "UR118119175", "Content": "I stayed here on a living social special... and wow. it was fabulous.

The dining was also top notch. we had continental breakfasts included every day, and was very happy with both the food and the service. We also had lunch there and I have to say that the presentation was excellent as well. At night, the restaurant transforms into a posh jacket and dress type establishment with a nice bar, music, and a romantic view of the bay. We were too busy out in miami beach to have dinner there, but we hope to try it next time. The restaurant staff also provided some great off resort recommendations for dining (we went to The Forge, and it was really posh and hip at the same time).

I checked in on Saturday and the rooms were a bit old but clean and a nice view. The restaurant, Gibraltar was great. The hotel and restaurant knew we were celebrating a special occasion and the host gave us the table alongside the bay. It was a beautiful and amazing view. The next day I had planned a 1:30pm spa session for us both and reserved the \"Watsu\" pool for 45 minutes after. They called it the \"romance\" package and I reserved it a week in advance. When we arrived we were escorted to the relaxation room and left to wait for about 15 minutes. Next we were told by the spa receptionist that we had to choose which one of us two were going to get the massage because they only had one therapist??? I immediately replied it was unacceptable considering I had called a week in advance and I specifically told them it was my first wedding anniversary. She then told me I could always just reschedule. This is my first marriage and I am not that experienced in this field but I do know rescheduling a wedding anniversary is not a good idea or feasible. I then walked out and immediately went to the lobby and asked for the hotel manager. I was expecting a more sensitive, understanding, and helpful individual. Instead I dealt with a manager who told me they had no control over not having sufficient therapist. I was disgusted as there was a lack of compassion and above all a resolution to please a client. What can you expect from a staff that is lead by this type of individual? Overall I will NEVER go there again. I couldn't believe they ruined my first wedding anniversary. Fortunately, I have a loving wife and she was just pleased with my attempt to make it a memorable time. However I am not pleased with the hotel spa's lack of customer service oriented individuals.

I had actually been considering using this hotel for a future wedding. I had requested some information on the spa and was speaking to a representative through Email about the services. After I was ready to book the appointment, the spa representative asked me to submit my credit card number, CV code and expiration date through Email. Seeing as this completely unprofessional, risky, and I believe can be illegal coming from the Spa, I decided to write back to the rep. and tell her that I felt very insecure about doing this through Emai and if they could just use the credit card that the hotel had on file because I would be staying the weekend at the hotell. The lady told me that because I felt unsure about sending her my credit card information (through Email) I could call them, but she would need the information in order to book the appointment because the spa and hotel ran on a different payment system. After seeing how unprofessional they were and a little nervous about even giving them my credit card, period, I decided not to call and continue the booking of the appointment. On the day of check-in I received a voicemail where the spa was calling to confirm my appointment. I was a little bit confused since I had not actually booked the services because I had not given my credit card information. I called the hotel, and after being transferred three different times, I finally spoke to the poorly trained in customer service spa representative. Apparently, the spa representative that I had spoken to through Email had just assumed that she should go ahead and book the services, which came out to almost $300. I explained to the representative over the phone that because I was told that a credit card was needed in order to continue the booking, I did not understand why my services were booked and I was not even sent an Email confirming the services. Then she continued to tell me that because I did not cancel ahead that I would be charged for the services anyway and that because I had a credit card on the hotel, now (suddenly) they were able to use that credit card. After much discussion with this representative (who should not even be allowed to speak to customers) she told me that she would cancel the services and just hung up on me before I could make sure there would be no charges. Before this incident, I had seriously thought about booking a spa appointment IN PERSON, but after that experience, I will neither go nor recommend it to even my worst enemy. You do not assume to charge somebody almost $300 worth of spa services and then fail to send them a confirmation. I work in the business profession and I was appalled at the horrible customer service I experienced. If the spa hadn't been enough, after our stay I went downstairs to check out and review my folio because I had noticed a strange $100 charge. I asked the receptionist and she shrugged and told me it was an amenity charge. I explained to her that I know that I had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room, but I requested them for $50 as it says on their reservation page on the internet. With a ridiculous amount of attitude, she said that they were $75 plus tax. At this point I was already fed up with the customer service that I told her that when I requested it online, it said it was $50 and I was paying no more than that (plus tax and service charge). She finally credited the difference to my account, but there was absolutely no sympathy or apology for any of their mistakes. The rooms were very nice and the island is beautiful to walk around and take in the scenery, but for the type of experience I had with the (I can't find a bad enough word for this) poorly trained employees. I will never recommend or stay at this hotel ever again. For the amount of money you pay a night, and after adding amenities, it is no where near worth it. I expected to have a carefree and relaxing Valentine's Day weekend, and I experienced the most stressful and aggravating stay of my life. The only people who were pleasant were the valet staff and the servers at the restaurant, tips, of course. There's nothing more that I can say except to stay away from this hotel and spa.

I am very picky about my hotels and to say I look the rooms over is and understatement. 1. The Staff were wonderful and the front desk person took us on a quick tour when we got there. The valet parking guys were over the top nice and I was impressed when using the elevator that the staff would wait until the next (not that I cared). We did pay a valet fee and tipped several times however, it is clearly stated and the guys were quick and willing to help with directions. 2. The room was extremely clean and I am the type who walk into the bathroom first and look at the floor corners first. I know sounds funny but after seeing 60 Minutes stories about rooms has ruined me. The room was cleaning in the AM and then at night we had turndown service and towels were refreshed again. I guess if I had a complaint it would be the extra resort charge we paid for things like water in the room. Maybe they should include free cookies or something like that. They did have a basket full, refrig full and wet bar of items to purchase (way over priced like everywhere else). 3. Location was out of the way which we liked but easy to find. The little town of Coconut Grove was very close. 4. Pool and bar area are good but to be honest I only used once. Again, if I had a complaint it was no one came over to ask if I wanted a drink but not willing to make a big deal of it. 5. The restaurant Gibraltar. We decided to have dinner there instead of going to Emeril's place after looking at his prices. I want to give some extra points about our dinner. The staff and expecially our waitress were unbelievable. I totally disagree with anyone who does not give them a good rating. We ordered several items from salads, chicken, swordfish and finished with desserts. They brought fabulous breads with two different spreads, two appetizers for us to sample and always filled out glasses not in a pushy way. We decided to try two different desserts even though we were full and let me tell you, the key lime pie was over the top including a topping of shaved white chocolate. They finished the meal with two plated chocolates. We even asked the staff to raise a divider that had been lowered as it was a little windy and they immediately raised it so we could enjoy the view.

Absolutely yes, yes, yes, book this place - I'm 25, full time grad student, full time employee and was in dire need of sun and relaxation. I was in no rush to be \"typically young\" on the strip with swimwear on all day among loud music and other young people who came specifically for that (no offense). MY boyfriend and I wanted to be at arms-reach to the \"South Beach-ness\" if we chose to explore it, and this hotel sold us as being on a separate island...in search for tranquility and peace? Gove Isle Hotel did just that. We stayed in a Junior Suite I believe (the view of the bay was absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking) and from the moment you enter the room you instantly are de-stressed (and it was rainy that day our flight landed and I still instantly fell in love with the room so you know the room had to be nice)... Some of the things you absolutely HAVE to do there: -Watsu Pool: although it was a bit tricky to start the jets inside (but was easily attended to by the staff), the water was clean and very warm! (my boyfriend said the waterfall beating down on his back and shoulders was amazing and took all his kinks in his neck and shoulders out) -Enjoy a nap on the balcony: After a dip in the adult pool and Jacuzzi (adult pool has the bar alongside of it) I went to our room and laid out on the wooden sun chairs and I just so happened to look up to see clear blue skies and felt a breeze that felt incredible from the many palm trees that surrounded our room. So relaxing, I cannot say that enough! -Baleen Restaurant for Breakfast: Sit closest by the bay (inside)...we were inundated with lush tropical plants and blue water, just a sight to see. And do order the crab and roasted pepper omelets, it's a large portion and very tasty. I wouldn't go big over the food in general (sent back my waffle, was too dry) but I have to say the roasted asparagus and potatoes made up for it. Just the presentation itself at the restaurant is an experience. And the prices didn't make me stumble either as said in previous reviews. -Locker Room (Steam Room): with a cold class of lemon and cucumber water ladies? enough said! If you don't rent a car (like we didn't being constant city drivers from DC and wanting a real break) definitely look for Juan, he was the absolute best cabbie-slash-tour guide-slash-hotel employee.

YES INDEED bring a sweater, the room is cold! (but you can adjust the temperature, it will just take awhile), enjoy the spa lotions, shampoos, and soaps provided (saves space in your luggage), and snuggle up in the robe provided!

Half an hour later we went to the pool 'champagne-less' calling by the desk to request a 7pm delivery instead. This elicited a curt response of 'they are probably dealing with it now' and a most reluctant re-scheduling (our fault of course). The 'champagne' arrived at 7.15 but not until a further phone call. At the pool, no-one bothered to bring us towels or tried to place us. We found loungers and had to fetch our own towels. I've had better service at some motels! The kids referred to by some other reviewers were all too evident. Very romantic touch. Baleen is good and the service attentive, a pity about the mosquitoes. Being bitten 15 times kind of impacts on the sense of romance once again. At check out we were denied the $50 credit that was meant to be applied towards our meal at Baleen and the agent was abrupt in telling us you had to have a two night stay for that. That isn't what the website said when I booked the package but it has now changed. Sadly I hadn't printed out the exact description of the old package when I booked it. Foolish trusting me. Indeed, they also tried to charge us for breakfast (also included in the deal) but I got that reversed as the girl reluctantly conceded that this was 'originally' the case even if it wasn't any more. So it seems that unless you check real carefully and stick your heels in, they'll do their best to rip you off. Let's not mention the maid who insisted on entering the room when she was asked not to (we had a late check out - although we were so irritated we didn't take it up) or the fact that our room was 'turned down' for the night sometime between 5.30pm and 6.20 pm. Huh? I'd also have thought that a DVD player would have been a standard feature in most 'luxury' hotel rooms these days... One would have thought with the ample competition in Miami and with the economy being what it is, that management might have tried a little harder to get the basics right.

Restaurant: Baleen We ate dinner on the deck at Baleen. The atmosphere was incredible. We overlooked the water. The deck was lit with tiki torches. It was very intimate. The food was really good, and the service wonderful. We had a really nice evening. It is fairly expensive (about $100 per person), but worth it. There is a pool and sandy area with cabanas and many deck chairs. There is a fire pit surrounded by chairs which is a romantic place in the evening. There are many private sitting areas, and it's a nice walk by the water in the evening. I didn't have time to visit the spa, but the services sounded wonderful.

All the reviews online were beaming so I booked it. But, when we got there, it was very disappointing. The hotel itself was beautiful and the rooms were very tastefully appointed. However, the \"charm\" of being on a private island is no charm at all. We could have gotten the Trump hotel for cheaper and it was on South Beach! There is NOTHING to do on this island. It is not really even an island. It is a high spot 150 yards off the coast and it borders the marina. It does have some spectacular views. But, the views do not change and I don't expect that we would be sitting there staring at the ocean the entire time. I thought at least there would be some beach or something but NOPE; they have a man-made area about 10' x 10' that is basically a sand box, right next to the pool, that is supposed to suffice. That is why you do not see any pictures of the \"beach\" for this hotel. There isn't any. There isn't even any snorkeling, diving, kayaking, etc. Nothing. The only place to eat on the island is at Baleen. It has a nice ambience but I have had better food in the back alleys of Mexico. Disgusting. And way too expensive for the quality. I could have almost died by drinking their iced tea. After waiting nearly 20 minutes, long after my husband got something to drink, they brought me what was supposed to be (and probably used to be) tea. It was so many weeks old that it had cloudy, chunky pink algae in the glass. My husband thought they had made me an alcoholic drink or something with tomato juice and he took a big swig. He immediately starting gagging and choking while spitting it out. It was putrid and rancid. The manager came over, saw it and almost starting vomiting himself. So, they come back 10 minutes later with another glass of iced tea but, when they made it, they made it in the same container. There were small stringy bits of pink algae all in the glass. Can you imagine how we were feeling at this point? We figured we would go ahead and take a cab into town to get something to eat there. It is $7 just to get off of the island and $7 to get back on. And the closest thing around is the Coco Walk. It is about 2 miles. Needless to say that getting around was going to be a real hassle especially since we couldn't see anything without a taxi and there was nothing to do on this island. So, the next morning we called around to get a rental car. After all, we came there to see South Beach, Miami, etc. Because it was Memorial Day, everyone was empty. Except for Hertz on US Hwy 1. I usually don't rent from them because they are higher than Enterprise. But, Enterprise only had 1 Focus left and they wanted $79.99 a day for it!!! Hertz gave us a Toyota Corolla (much better car) for .......get this......$29.99 a day! And, YES, they came and picked us up and dropped us off. For free. If you rent a car, get it from that location. Those people are wonderful!!! The best rate that the hotel could get us was a Focus from Enterprise at $50 a day. We figured we would go down to South Beach the next day. We had a blast. We even went all 38 miles down into the Everglades the day after that. People in Miami don't know how to drive but we were having a blast. If you are staying at Grove Isle, GET A RENTAL CAR!!!!! It is not close to anything. I left my comb at home. So, having been spoiled by the Hilton and Hampton, I called down to the concierge to get a $1 comb. But, they were astounded that anyone would ask for such a thing! They acted so astonished and dumbfounded. They sent each other in every direction looking for a comb. Note: if a hotel is 4 or 5 stars, they should have a virtual convienence store on hand at all times. They didn't. I'm surprised they even knew what a comb was. I had someone sarcastically remark to me that he would go off the island and get me one if I \"absolutely had to have one\". Needless to say, my hair dried in frizz and I went and got my own comb later. The bath products are nice. The shower and water temperature were excellent! The room is nice. Nothing is free except the coffee. They tempt you with $8 Godiva chocolates in a basket by the bed. The robes were great. Relaxing on the patio was awesome. Most of the front desk help were rude, dumb and pretty. Mark, our butler, was exceptionally helpful, professional and polite. He is probably the one person at that hotel that stopped me from giving it 2 stars. All in all, we won't be staying at this hotel again. Not because it is a dump, but because it's location is more of a drag than a thrill, because my health was threatened and because they fell way short on the small things that make a hotel 4 or 5 star quality. Besides, Miami is HUGE. Next time, we will be staying in North or South Beach so we can be where we really wanted to be in the first place: on the white sandy beach.", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, TN", "Title": "\u201cIsland Paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3555266", "Content": "Recently, my boyfriend and I visited Grove Isle Resort and Spa.

She was not only extremely rude during check in Saturday morning, but continued her poor attitude throughout Saturday afternoon, and well into Sunday. It was to the point which no one wanted to walk through the lobby because they would have to endure the scowl on her face. I was even awoken at 8 am on Sunday and asked to come into the lobby, (in my pajamas ) by one of my guests having difficulty checking out due to the fact that they wanted to pay for the room even though the room was initially booked under my name. While standing at the desk , I overheard Evelyn ask my guest if anything was \"missing from the room\" (as opposed to asking if the mini bar had been used ), my guest replied with an \"excuse me\", with which Evelyn replied \"did you take anything from the room ?\" Also, when asked if the room charges could be split 3 ways, we were met with a roll of the eyes. After my guests departure at 8 am I returned to my room to find that coincidentally enough, my suite key had suddenly been de-programmed. Luckily there was someone in the room that let me back in. Upon my check out I was met with more attitude and when I presented my credit card I was told that I was giving her the wrong card. I explained to her that this would have to be impossible being that I only have one credit card that I use for personal use.

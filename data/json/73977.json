I entered the lobby and was received by \"Sheila\" with a friendly smile. I requested a room and got #210. It was clean and appropriate for a short stay and, as I was in an \"unofficial\" business trip, adequate. It was also surprisingly quiet for a place central and very close to a highway! I requested a cooler a/c, a fridge and microwave in my room. For a very small charge (@ $2 /day) I got what I requested immediately! \"Randy\", a very friendly and efficient security guard fixed the a/c and installed the items. In a \"nutshell\"< I would not recommend the place for a honey moon, but certainly for a short, very economic stay, ideal for backpackers and travelers in a budget. I am a bit of a snob and prefer 5 star hotels(unfortunately they come with comparable prices!) but I am also very adaptable. \"Randy\" and \"Sheila\" made the difference! If the owner would spend a bit on TLC the place could attract a better clientele!

They do charge you for some amenities, but if you are just looking for somewhere to sleep, it does the trick. They charge for phone & remote, etc. I am young enough to get up & change the channel like a youngster, but do miss the remote. Who needs to demand a phone is included? Everyone has their own mobile phones anyway, so I was happy to save cash on that unnecessary amenity. Maid service is weekly, but I do not need my bed made daily, or I could do it myself if important to me. It worked out to be a nuts & bolts purchasing operation, allowing budget travelers to pay for just a decent place to sleep. The AC worked well, they had hot water & the bed was restful. The power went out for a few hours one evening, but who knows who was to blame for that? I did stay there 10 days, saving loads of money compared to other similar options. I will return again if needed in the future if they keep their good prices! I would, however, stay elsewhere if it was not so affordable though. I would recommend other resorts if seeking romantic lodging, staying with ladies, or children needing supervision. All in all, it was a lucky option to have in our current economy. They did offer free Wi-Fi in lobby during limited hours. That was nice, but I chose to do my Wi-Fi needs in local Denny's instead cause theirs was very limiting & inconvenient, but alas it was without charge. I hope the hotel continues to offer the rates they gave me for the services provided.

We were both in very good moods when we walked into the hotel. However that was short lived, - i walk into the building and look to my left and see a room with the lights out and furniture pilled in there like they were soon going out of business or moving. I asked the lady at thr counter, who had already begun to glare at me, with a smile on my face \"are we allow to rent here?\". You see, there are no lights on the outside of the building, and the inside is a mess so it seemed like a logical question. However this woman snapped at me telling me how stupid of a question that is. I was shocked and appalled.. this pathetic excuse for costumer service will no got unpunished in my book. There are tons of people out there looking for jobs who would gladly take hers and i bet the owner would love to hear how many people are actually going someone where else because of this woman. So here's a number, PLEASE call and let them know. Weather or not you do i will make sure that for the remainder of the time that this woman works there is absolutely miserable because i hope that job goes to someone who can at the very least treat people with respect.

I needed a place for my son for a week and the sign says 125.00 for a week but I paid 165.00 plus 35.00 deposit and that didn't include the remote control for the T.V. or phone!!! As we was checking in I was asking questions and the young lady told me that she couldn't answer my questions because everything is written in front of me!! What nerve I am paying and she is working and she getting paid to do job that she did not want to do!! What really pissed me off was that I had placed a $10.00 deposit on the phone and and the next day I called my son and they told me that there was no phone service to that room. As I was asking how is this possible the manager told me I should talk to the person who is wasting my money and hung up the phone on me!!! Customer service 101 never make a customer mad!!! I called back to ask for corporation number but I was informed that this place is privately owned and was hung up on again. What I wanted to know the first time when I call was there any way to add another deposit on the phone and did it incoming phone calls count if no one answers the phone. Since out going phone calls are .25 and incoming calls are .10 !!!! As for the room it looked clean until you look at the carpet which really needs to be replaced!! For the price they charge this room should be at least 3 star hotel which it isn't. Do not waste you money on this Motel!!! Why stay some where when the employees are making you feel like they are doing you a favor instead making you feel welcome and they glad you pick their motel. As for the owner you should review your tacts & policies on your rooms as well hiring personal. Yours signs are misleading and could be consider false advertisment!! Your manager is rude and really needs some customers services skills. Like the old saying go (Your team is only as great as your leader is!!!)

Filthy is putting it lightly. My boyfriend and I live locally, but we decided to get away from the house for a night. We stopped at this hotel because the sign said $35. It was $44. Then if we wanted a remote it was $1.25. Plus $5.00 key deposit. I felt like we were being interrogated during the check in process. The lady made me come in with ID so she could get a copy of it also. My instincts told me to take our credit card and leave, but we tried to remain positive. When we got to our room it was cold, so we tried the heater and it blew out cold air. The carpets were discustingly dirty and burn holes all over it. The sheets looked clean, but I wonder if they were. I've stayed at cheaper hotels in Phoenix area and they put this place to shame. AND then, when we brought our key to check out the lady was at first nice to us, and as I was leaving I turned around and asked the lady for my $5.00 key deposit back. She gets this sour look on her face and tells me to hold on while she makes a phone call and has the maid inspect the room. UNBELIEVABLE!! The lady tells me that the sheet has a burn hole in it and I told her I didn't believe it. So she calls the maid, supposedly, and tells her to bring the sheet up. Well I waited and waited and finally I just threw ten dollars at her and told her I wouldn't be back to this place ever.

We decided to move out of the Paris for our last night and try to save some money, before catching our early morning flight. We booked online. We arrived earlier than check-in, and due to a full night, our room was not ready. The staff was extremely helpful (Michael was very pleasant), and held our bags so that we could get lunch. The hotel is located across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe, and a block from the Hofbrauhaus. There was a CVS Pharmacy on the corner (which was doing booming business in the beer and soda trade due to Las Vegas prices). We returned at 3 pm and our room was ready. The room was a very clean King that offered a little kitchenette with stove top, microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. It had a small bathroom with sink located outside. The air conditioning was perfect for our 110 degree day. Also, our room was right next to the street, and we heard no street noise at all. There was free cable TV with too many channels to name, free wi-fi, access to in-room dining service and a pool. The hotel offered a complimentary breakfast in the morning, and free airport shuttle. There was a computer with printer for use in the lobby, and coffee in the lobby 24-hours, and snack vending machines.

I had originally booked another hotel but upon reading the reviews of that hotel, I decided to switch. Comfort Inn Airport had a good rate and had lots of valuable amenities so I switched our booking. We had shipped two packages, one large hockey bag and one heavy metal crate down to the Comfort Inn that arrived prior to our arrival. They kept them housed for us for a few days, which was very nice, and they had them ready for us when we requested them. l also called ahead twice to make sure that it would be okay to ship directly to them and that they would have adequate storage space as the hockey bag was quite large. Both of my telephone conversations were nice and the employees on the other end were very helpful and pleasant (this has not been my experience with other hotels in general and I was very happy! gave me hope that this hotel/staff would be great). When arriving, we made the mistake of going directly out to the shuttle area near the baggage claim and were told that there was no shuttle for the Comfort Inn (which is not true at all! we were just in the wrong place) and the shuttle we had to take cost us $7 each one way. We were able to check in before 3PM (I think we arrived around noon actually, so well in advance and no additional fee either!!) and had two rooms in building 5, both on the lower level. I believe there are 9 buildings both two levels with a pool in the middle. Our room had 2 double beds with plenty of pillows, a tv, desk, small fridge, extra sink and tap, microwave and good storage for food or dishes (should you have any). The toilet and shower were separated by a door from the vanity area where we had good room to keep two suitcases open (and this was nice as I was rooming with a colleague - I was able to do my makeup and hair while he was contained in the room with the shower) Onto the amenities! Complementary Shuttle: Of all the amenities the hotel offered, this was by far the most valuable for us as we were traveling to the Las Vegas Convention Centre every day and went to the strip a few nights as well. The shuttle was normally waiting at the lobby area and if not, it was always back within 10-15 minutes of us arriving at the lobby to catch it. All of the drivers were very nice and friendly and a few gave us some good recommendations for where to eat, find things and generally were talkative and personable. Complementary Breakfast: I saw a few complaints about the breakfast but for free, there's nothing to complain about!! They offered danishes, english muffins, bagels, muffins, juice, coffee, tea, hard boiled eggs, make-your-own-fresh waffles and some fruit. Being in Las Vegas on business, we never had enough time to go out and find breakfast at another venue so this was perfect for us! I saw a bunch of complaints about the eggs being 'de shelled' but really, I could care less. The shell is the most annoying part of the egg and someone else took care of it for me. That, and they were a very popular breakfast item - most guests we saw in the adjoining breakfast seating area were eating the eggs every day. Most days we were up for breakfast around 7:30 but on our last day we made it there at 9 and the supplies were running low (breakfast ends at 10), which is to be expected, but it wasn't like they were out of food, we were able to have our choice of all the items offered. Complementary Internet: most hotels in Las Vegas charge at least $15 (some per day and some per stay) for internet, wireless and wired internet is free, which was a big must have for us tech people on business. Very nice to have this and it be fast. I had to download content at the last minute before leaving for the tradeshow and was able to do so within about 8 minutes (BIG file too) on the wired internet. We had a few nights where there was some noise outside our room but it was mostly other guests heading to their rooms after partying and the only reason I heard that was because I'm an incredibly light sleeper. The proximity to the airport wasn't really a big deal either as the last plane takes off around 1130, latest. There are lots of things to do in the area around this Comfort Inn, including being across from the Hard Rock, and a 5-minute walk from a CVS, pizza place (pretty good btw), an italian sit down restaurant, a sub/sandwich place, a Subway and more. I doubt that you could ask for anything more from a hotel at this price point!! Don't let some of the mixed reviews of this hotel sway you - our experience was great and it exceeded all of my expectations!

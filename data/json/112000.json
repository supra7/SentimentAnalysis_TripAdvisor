It was our first trip to New Orleans and staying at Soniat was like being transported back a hundred years...but in a good way. The rooms are beautifully appointed with antiques and look out onto a lush courtyard. Our suite had a jacuzzi tub and the Molton brown amenities are a plus. The staff were so lovely and assisted us with restaurant bookings and transportation. We were only in our room to sleep and it was a comfortable bed. I highly recommend this place if you appreciate history, architecture and ambiance. If you need Marriot type amenities (pay per view, pool, gym, etc...) then i don't think this is a good fit. The hotel is not open access in that you need to have a key or see the doorman to get in...so it is very safe. Finally, just a note on location. Soniat is in the heart of the French Quarter, but on a quiet street, it's a 5 minute walk to Bourbon St and 5 min walk to Jackson Square. We also walked to Frenchmen st from there. Also, a taxi from the airport to Soniat is $33 but dont take a taxi cab if you're travelling in the quarter or to the business district ( you will be stuck in traffic forever, especially if it crosses bourbon st.) i recommend the bicycle cabs, they get you around and its nice to be in the open air.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, LA", "Title": "\u201cUtter disrespect and disdain - stay away!\u201d", "Author": "Renee L", "ReviewID": "UR137171133", "Content": "Im a New Orleans local and have traveled all over the world.

We checked in early on Friday morning around 9:30am and our room was ready, which was great. Check-in was friendly and efficient and the bags were brought to our room right away. They even honored my request to have the exact same room we had during our last stay (Jr. Suite #63 which is across the street from check-in). The room was exactly the same and just perfect. Again, this is a boutique hotel with lots of charm in an old creole mansion so if you're looking for an uber-hip, modern place with a big flat screen HDTV and waterfall rain shower, you will be more comfortable at the W Hotel. We didn't interact with the staff too much but anyone we ran into (maid service, the porters, etc..) were always quick to smile and say good morning. They do offer a limited breakfast of homemade biscuits, coffee and juice but we always skip it in favor of going to a local coffee house for some cafe au lait and a healthier breakfast option (CC's coffee house and Croissant D'Or are right around the corner). I will say that if we ever come back and stay in one of the Grand Suites with a balcony, I would probably do the coffee and biscuits just to have out there so I can still be in my robe. They will serve you the breakfast in their lovely courtyard too. We liked the location as it's in the quarter but in a very quiet area by the Ursuline convent. You can walk to Bourbon Street in less than 5 minutes but when you're ready to sleep you won't hear a sound, which is exactly what I want.

Located on the edge of the French Quarter, Soniat House provided an oasis of calm and quiet at the center of the busiest area in the city. Our suite reflected the Historic Landmark designation - filled with period furniture and lighting with a nod to modern luxury - Frette linens. There are two buildings across the street from each other. We were housed in the 'annex' and although we were in a 'grand suite' our balcony was narrower, no grand wrought iron or foliage, and had just enough width for a metal table and chair. The balcony on the main building was deeper with more comfortable wicker furnishings.Too bad, because the balcony was a great place to sit and watch and listen to the many tours - both walking and horse drawn carriage - that come down the hotel street. Both buildings have spectacular courtyards with fountains and candlelit at night. We also felt a bit out-of-sight out-of-mind in the annex: not until our 4th night did we find an ice bucket and bottled water left by the very pleasant evening housekeeping staff. Not sure what happened the other nights. Also, there is no coffee/tea available. One can order for morning(with a 30 minute lead time) a continental breakfast including coffee and biscuits($25/2), and there is an honor bar for wine, beer and canned soft drinks($12 glass wine, less for beer and soda and once again located in the main building,) but you can't get a cup or a newspaper in the morning. Strange in this city of really excellent coffee. Fortunately, just around the corner is a fabulous bakery/cafe, Croissant d'Or, open early with delicious pastries, quiche, and coffee drinks.

We really enjoyed it and would stay again. The common rooms and courtyards are beautiful and well kept. The service was very nice and polite though we rarely had any encounters with the staff other than check-in and check-out. We thought the honor bar in the main salon was a nice touch, albeit rather pricey so we only used it for an occasional water bottle. We also did not do the biscuit breakfast but saw many trays being delivered in the morning. Personally, I think $25 for 2 orders of biscuits, coffee and orange juice is a little high. Instead, we would walk around the corner to CC's coffee house for coffee and a pastry/muffin for $9. We stayed in a Jr. Suite and it was lovely. It was across the street from the main hotel/check-in and was on the 2nd floor (#63). The room was large, clean and had a gorgeous and romantic canopy bed. Maid service came daily and promptly but never knocked or bothered us - it was as if they were secretly watching when we left the room. Yes, the TV in the room is small but who comes to NO to stay in their room and watch TV? It was sufficient to watch the news and weather in the mornings. The bathroom was large, clean, well-lighted, had lots of marble and a big jacuzzi tub. Excellent water pressure in the shower and tons of hot water. The best part was the room was super quiet and when the curtains were drawn it was nice and dark - perfect for a great night's sleep. The mattress was very comfortable and the frette linens were a nice touch. My only quibble would be that the room could be a little dark in the evenings and the small lamps around the room had rather dim bulbs. The room is furnished with antiques so some of the dresser drawers may not be perfectly on track or a chair may be a little wobbly but I liked the personal touch of the old furniture, which was in keeping with the old southern style of the room and hotel. I did see 1 or 2 very small stains on the carpet but that is bound to happen - they can't replace the carpet after every guest and it was obvious that the carpet was being vacuumed and the room was cleaned very well each day (no dust on the window sills, etc...). The location of the Soniat House was good - about a 5-8 minute walk to Jackson Square. It could be a bit of a haul if we had dinner reservations on the other side of the quarter (Arnaud's, Galatoire's), but it only bugged me (and very little) when I was walking in high heels. It was doable. One benefit is the free pass to use the New Orleans Athletic Club during your stay (no gym at the Soniat House). We used it twice and thought it was great and they were super friendly at the club even though we were just visitors. It's about a 15 block walk to the club (we obviously didn't mind the extra exercise) but I could see how it might annoy you if it was pouring down rain. Overall, I thought it was a lovely boutique hotel. Perfect for a romantic weekend getaway. I did manage to peek in and see one of their standard rooms on the ground floor and it looked nice. You really couldn't go wrong with the standard room either.

The staff is very nice but in the check-in they failed to tell us about the only 'extra' I might have used......the 'honor\" system bar. I heard about it on my way out when another guest was checking in. So, for $535 for a junior suite.......you don't get breakfast....... or even coffee. How about a chocolate when you turn down the bed? Nope. What do you get for $535 that makes the place worth it?.....I honestly can't see why they should charge more than $250. The biscuits they serve are a disappointment. They were hard, dry and overcooked........and 5 of them with coffee and orange juice was $25! Absolutely not worth it. I couldn't believe it when the staff called 15 minutes after we got it and asked if they could pick up the tray. No, thanks....we were still drinking coffee! The room we had was large but that is it's only good point. The wallpaper was peeling, the one chair is in desperate need of recovering because it is worn and dirty. The room is dark and the roman shades in the room are in need of a cleaning. The eyebrow window over the door is extremely bowed out and I was worried if we shut the door too hard the glass would fall out. The courtyard is nice but by no means is in what you expect at a luxury hotel. I guess I just can't get over how much the place costs compared to what you get. I have stayed at beautiful places for $200 in Savannah, Napa Valley, etc and was dazzled by the extras. If you stay here you will simply get a room.....maybe it will be a beautiful one.

But there was not enough hot milk provided to make more than 2 cups of this thick coffee into cafe au lait. For our second stay, we were assigned a much less appealing room in the back of the hotel. It was large, but smelled musty and needed redecorating. The cost was over 300.00 after New Orleans taxes were applied. This room was at the top of their rate system for a single room, but clearly not worth the price. Needless to say, we did not have the breakfast. In summary, I would rate this hotel high on customer service and ambiance, but low in other areas. The experience of entering the doors off a residential street into the typical New Orleans courtyard was great, but even the \"top quality\" rooms vary in appeal.

This hotel was everything it said it was online and more. The hotel was beautiful, quaint, understated....considered to be a small, luxury hotel. I am writing this review while sipping wine on the lovely lacey wrought iron hotel balcony and listening to the slow trot of horse drawn carriages coming up the street. In the distance you can also hear the muted sounds of rivership horns on the Mississippi. This is not the Marriott though....you will not be able to get room service at midnight. But for those of us looking for atmosphere, this is the place to stay. It is located in the lower Riverside part of the French Quarter....inside the quarter but not too close to Bourbon Street. Our room was across the street from the main hotel building along side a very serene inside garden courtyard. At night small tealight candles light the way through both courtyards in the main building and across the street. Both properties lock with a key to an iron fence door along the street but we always felt safe within both buildings. The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. There is a lovely warm biscuit breakfast served to your room on a silver tray. Yes, this is the only breakfast option, but who wants to eat every morning in the same place while your on vacation? Especially in NO where there is such a wide variety of food. The hotel also has a sitting room with an honor bar where you can get bottled water before you go out to tour or get an afternoon cocktail. We did a lot of walking while we were here but we didn't mind a short walk to here or there. We took the street car to the Garden District which was rather far from here. The homes in the garden district were grand and incredibly beautiful and definitely worth the trip. But the shopping and dining I found to be a bit too eclectic for this stunning neighborhood. The dining was too BBQ and picnic tables for the area, I thought. This was our first time in NO. We knew Bourbon St. was going to be tacky but yikes!!!! I guess it would have been fun about twenty years ago when I was a college kid but at middle age it was kind of scary!

Dear Mr & Mrs Smith, My wife and I checked into the Soniat House this past Thursday, 16 October and were scheduled to stay for a three night break from our young children. We had carefully selected the hotel on the strength of your website, reviews on tripadvisor.com, and on the basis that we appreciate boutique hotels with old world charm. We had booked your 'romance' package which included a dinner, driver to/from the airport and bottle of champagne on arrival (we did not receive this). We initially checked into room 53 but found it to be dark and musty and were subsequently moved into room 32. We found the exterior of your hotel to be beautiful and exactly what we were looking for for our weekend in New Orleans, but were completely dissappointed with the room's interior decor, particularly your bathrooms which are outdated by 10-15 years. We checked out the following morning because we were so upset that we were paying $500/night; we felt cheated and for the price expected a lot more. To our surprise, the hotel refused to refund the additional two nights, which we feel is disgusting given that you misrepresent your hotel's interiors on the internet. Whilst the hotel has old world charm and is beautiful, your bathrooms are old, had wallpaper peeling off in sections and generally in need of an upgrade (although it is apparent they have been upgraded before, perhaps in the 80's). We took photographs of the room and bathroom as evidence, and before we complain to 1) our credit card company 2) to your affiliation with Small Luxury Hotels of the World and 3) to tripadvisor.com, we wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to our request for the credit back of two nights accomodation on our credit card. I hope you will consider this request given the environment we are in -- where for the money, your clients will be demanding perfection. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The sitting room for guests was beautiful, quiet and cool. The honor bar was very handy, though a bit expensive.

Forget about the rooms - get a junior suite or a full-size suite instead. We opted for their $1,500 package, which included a FABULOUS junior suite, a complementary dinner at Gautreau's, an elegant culinary Uptown restaurant in the Garden District, limo transportation from the airport to the hotel, and yes, the delicious buttermilk biscuit breakfast for which the hotel is known. I wanted to steal half the furniture with me from the hotel room, it was that beautiful. Frette linens and robes, a very comfortable four poster king bed draped by THE Alain Simard - like sleeping under the most exquisite tented ceiling. There was a small ante-room where we took our breakfast every morning. Two television sets, tiny (mercifully, huge TVs are ugly in an antique-filled suite) which we never watched, because we were so taken with every corner of the room. The bathroom had a whirlpool tub, marble, wallpaper, sconces and was equipped with Annick Goutal toiletries. Safe, hairdryer, in-room wireless...and those lamps...so help me, I would have bought them all on the spot, had they been for sale. We would have opened the windows to our French balcony, but alas, it was a little too chilly outside. Our accommodations were facing a lovely courtyard...it was so romantic, so elegant, so charming and so put us in the mood for exploring the French Quarter. In addition, the property is located at the quiet end of the Vieux Carr\u00c3\u00a9, meaning away from all the insanity on Bourbon Street. It was the perfect location for antique shopping, eating, strolling and still, at night, there wasn't a sound. And we were there for New Year's Eve!

The newspaper came once during our stay. The concierge booked a swamp outing for us. They made dinner reservations way in advance. They diligently tried to get a taxi for us on New Year's Eve.

I usually have a hard time sleeping comfortably on hotel mattresses, but the bed here was so comfortable (my friend in Room 52 said the same thing). My friend stayed in room 52, directly across the courtyard from me. Room 52 is a slightly smaller suite than room 53. We were the only two people who used the courtyard the entire week we were there -- we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. The hotel is in the French Quarter, about 3 or 4 blocks away from Jackson Square. The rooms we had were expensive, but it was worth every penny for the excellent service and accomodations.

This is a magnificent place to stay if you want to capture the heart and soul of Old New Orleans. Fourteen foot high ceilings, heart of pine floors, period antiques, a balcony on Chartres Street, a lush courtyard - I half expected to run into William Faulkner in the room next door. This is as romantic as it gets in the French Quarter in NO and worth every penny of the $259 rate at this time (we were automatically upgraded to the best suite - just wish we were able to stay longer). For those dissing the hotel, apparently they were expecting modern hotel rooms with all the amenities - on par with Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton. All I can say is they should have stayed at Windsor Court or the Ritz Carlton. If you want all that I mentioned up above plus more, try the Soniat House and try to get room 64 first or 60 if 64 is not available. I completely understand why it is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels program - it deserves to be a member based on our first stay.

We will not ever recommend this property, nor stay here again. The owner, 'Miss Francis', by the way, is the mother-in-law of the Chef at Gautreau's, so if you ask for assistance, this is where you are funneled! The overall attitude here was rude unfortunately.

Our most recent trip having been earlier this month, November 2003. For us, the Soniat House has the perfect location. We enjoy the Faubourg Marigny Section with the electic shops and clubs, yet we're still nicely immersed in the excitement - and relative safety - of the Quarter. We get a tremendous amount of use out of the lovely courtyard, we prefer the quiet courtyard across the street from the front desk because this courtyard is insulated from the activities of the other guests coming and going. The rooms are very nicely appointed, and the bathtubs in the larger rooms are very inviting. There are plenty of very nice touches. Our room was very clean and the help was very friendly and polite. What I would like to see changed: The front desk is not appropriately staffed. Many times my husband and I had to wait, to check in, get information, etc. For a hotel that touts itself on having so much help per guest, the front desk fails miserably here, depending on the time of day. Even when finally getting to the front desk, the phone would ring off the hook and so we would have to wait further because usually only one associate was stationed at the desk. We have now stayed here three times, the third time even bringing friends who stayed at the hotel as well. The two times we inquired about an upgrade, the hotel was apparently booked. I'm a little suspicious about that response. I understand that the summer is entirely different, and that there are rooms aplenty due to the suffering heat, but I suspect the hotel refused us an upgrade to reserve the room in case another guest came along at the last moment to ask for one of the rooms. Meanwhile we had booked seven months in advance. The first time we stayed at Soniat House, we had the breakfast and we thought it was good, but not worth the extra money. In fact, we found this extra cost a bit insulting given the amount of money the rooms cost. We've been there three times, and I had no idea that the coffee was available and free, until I read one of the postings. So, the hotel may want to be a little more inviting to their guests. Overall, we do love this place. It is beautiful, and as I mentioned the courtyard, the rooms, and location are all great. We would just like to see some effort made towards return guests, better staffing at the front desk and perhaps make the biscuits and coffee complimentary. I'm sure the owners, Frances and Rodney Smith, might then see their hotel among the great hotels in Relais and Chatauex annual book. We visit New Orleans annually and plan on trying a different place. We had considered the Windsor Court, but one posting pointed out that one doesn't feel like one's in New Orleans. At Soniat House, one does. Still, unless there are some changes, we may check out a few other places. Places to consider: Windsor Court (I know it's not NO, but it is nice), House on Bayou Road (we checked this place out and it's great) and Claiborne Mansion. For pampering try Earthsavers (Chartres) or Belladonna (Magazine Street, take the bus). A great club is the Spotted Cat in the Faubourg Marigny section, check out this section as well, as it really feels like NO. I'm so in love with this city, I could write a book on it.

I read a book before going to DisneyWorld called \"Disney on a Dime\" and it had a lot of great tips for saving when going to WDW. One of the other great tips I got from this book was pack your own snacks when going into WDW, and eat bigger meals off site. If and when we go back I think we'll go for 5 days to WDW doing each park the first four days (spending two days at Magic Kingdom), and only get a park hopper for the last day. Another good tip - if doing WDW mutiple days in a row take one day in the middle off. It's exhausting to go all day everyday, even though it's a blast!

I was expecting a resort fee - common to most resorts in the Disney area - but was surprised to hear it as \"One dollar plus tax.\" Usually its four or five dollars. Then I was really surprised to hear that I needed to pay a $10 Room Key deposit, refundable at check out. No big deal - but just had not experienced that in the last couple of decades! I'll list the pro's first: -New carpeting and fairly new drapes and bedspreads. -Free Wi Fi in the hotel. -Spacious rooms with two beds, sofa bed, refrigerator & microwave. -The Big Orange in the parking lot. Certainly can't miss it! -Adequate breakfast (muffins, bread, cereal, oat meal packets, bananas, oranges) -Curteous and efficient staff -Decent pool area And now, the cons: -Wall paper corning off wall in several places -Mattress definitely has seen a lot of guests -Two holes in the bath tub wall where a handle of some sort used to be -TV was locked to the cabinet, and couldn't be turned for better viewing -Some of the furniture's surfaces were peeling or peeled off Overall, the hotel was clean, I slept good, and had a great shower and breakfast before heading back to Disney.

I was extremely worried about this hotel based on the horrid reviews. I had my arsenal of Lysol, Bleach, and Air Fresheners lined up (I even brought my own sheets). Upon arrival, we had trouble getting into our room (the key card did not work not once, twice, but three times). It was a defective door lock, beyond their control; however every time we went to the front desk to tell them, they asked for photo verification. That showed me they take security into account! We switched rooms (to matching rooms, no upgrade). Mace and Lysol in both hands, I found the room to be pleasant. Yes, there was a slight musty scent, but once we turned on the A/C, the musty smell disappeared. The room was spacious with a sofa (possibly a bed, but never used it), two double beds and a television refrigerator and microwave. I was quite content (I have a sensitive nose, so I smelled everything and nothing smelled bad.) Most of our day was spent in Disney, but the hotel was spacious enough that when we did retire from Disney, or take a break. There is ample lighting in the parking lot, plenty of shops around. Maybe it is because we don't make our hotel a home is because we enjoyed this. The carpet was a bit frayed, but we never walk around barefoot in the hotel (regardless of any hotel). The only thing I would change is the smell of the Lobby and the Breakfast Room. It really stunk! The Breakfast Room was just another room converted so it was small and stunk! Due to its price in consideration to the proximity to I-4 and Disney, restaurants and shops, I recommend this place.

When it was my turn, everything was perfect; Sophie gave me the type of room I needed: first floor, no smoking, two beds (one for me and one for my bags/things), and although there was not a room available on the parking lot side, she gave me one near the walkway from the parking lot. Sophie assured me (just as I was getting ready to inquire) as to the security of the facility. I was very impressed.

The first time (June 2006) we got smoking double queen pool view rooms. The rooms are very large which is great since we have 8 people in our family traveling. The rooms were clean, the pool area was well kept, and the kids loved the play area/game room!! Since our trip was for a week that time we enjoyed the use of the onsite laundry. The breakfast was kind of the joke of the trip (but not a deal breaker). The location was awesome!!! The whole family was impressed at the hotel for the price we paid! The only bad thing I can say about my first stay was that the carpet really needed replaced. So when we decided to go back to Disney World and Dayton Beach last summer (July 2008) we knew we wanted to stay here again. When I booked the rooms I was told the breakfast was updated since we stayed last and the hotel was painted, OK Great!!! So I book two double queen smoking rooms again. Once checked in I was keeping out the room ( I'm actually in the hotel industry so I love seeing hotel rooms) I noticed the carpet still needed replace really badly .. to the point that the tacks were exposed. Then I noticed no ashtrays in the rooms I stopped my mm from lighting up because I realized we were in a mom-smoking room. One I know it is a current trend to charge a huge fee for smoking in a mom-smoking room. Two I think of the other hotel guests that we be coming in after us expecting a non-smoking room to not be smoked in. I walked down to the front desk and let them know the situation very politely. I know these things happen. They \"upgraded\" us to two smoking double queens with Kitchenettes. It wasn't pool view but I'm excited we could really use the kitchenettes. I thanked the front desk person and went on my merry way. Once we got to our rooms it felt like we were banished to the dungeon. The rooms just felt dirty and gritty. The carpet was worse then the other rooms, the mattresses need to be replaced, the internet signal was very low if we had a signal at all (they did seem to have a network set up with multipliable routers), The Kitchenette was great other than the toaster and larger coffee pot (there was a smaller coffee pot in the room that worked fine) was broken, the pool area was still very well kept (but there were non-guests that looked kind of scary lurking around the pool/play area), and we got charged for making a local call to a pizza place. The location is still great, (just a short drive to Disney World) The flea market next door was great also. Lots of shopping with in walking distance. This hotel has so much potential. With some heavy cleaning, the replacement of things like the mattresses and the carpet (not to mention the replacement or removal of broken appliances ) during the slow season, maybe another router to boost the signal to cover the rooms we were in also,and a security guard this hotel could truly be great! Oh we never did get around to the breakfast due to us having the kitchenette. Oh and the charge for the local calls... please at least inform your guest local calls cost (we have cell phones this would not have been a deal breaker for us either) at best maybe see about a phone company that doesn't charge for local calls.

We do not have a great deal of extra money, so we needed to make the most of the money that we had budgeted for our trip. I did hours and hours of research via the internet checking out hotel review after hotel review trying to find a hotel that was clean, with a few amenities, and for a budget price. Of all of the hotels I read reviews on, this hotel seemed to be a good option at a great price. We only ended up staying 2 nights. These are the things that occured during our short stay. First, we paid extra money for a room with a pool view. Our view was of the laundromat/game room. The door was warped, and did not close properly, which is what allowed the little lizards into our room! Granted, they are not dangerous, but it is creepy to have little wiggly things running around on the floor. We have a 6 month old, 7 year old and 10 year old, so we have to get up in the night sometimes. Stepping on lizards, or having to put on shoes when you get out of bed is just not acceptable to me, no matter how inexpensive a hotel is. The pool scene was just plain gross. There was an orange peel and trash lying around, and the worst thing was that there were about 30 people(mostly teens) in the pool roughhousing, and one of them was bleeding from the mouth into the pool, not getting out! I realize that this is not the management's fault, but it was gross just the same. After leaving the pool, we saw a bunch of barbequed chicken bones lying on the ground! I thought, what a great way to attract bugs! When I took my children to the complimentary \"breakfast\", it consisted of a room about 15 feet by 15 feet that had literally 50-60 people in it all shoving past each other to get their food. The entire room was filled with smoke from the toaster. We went to the Waffle House next door. I went to talk to someone about our room conditions, and was told that there were no rooms available that we could switch to, and that the heat had warped the door, and that it was not a big deal. The next day, after I almost stepped on a lizard in the room I went to talk to the manager. She offered me another room, but did tell me that in Florida, those lizards get in everywhere. I find that hard to believe. The air-conditioner smelled musty, and we all woke up feeling like we had colds, complete with headaches. The manager also offered to take 10% off of the price of our room if we stayed! We did not want to stay. The hotel was really kind of gross. We didn't see any cockroaches, but there were little flies or gnats in our room. We ended up going to a different hotel for only 20 dollars more a night, and it was clean and a really nice hotel. I think some people embellish stories in reviews, and also expect too much from budget hotels sometimes. However, I am not one of those people. Travelodge did not do anything to me, and I am not out to get them. I just don't think that it is a relaxing place to stay, especially if you have children. I also think that it should be a lot cleaner. There should not be bones and fruit peelings left around the premises for people to step on. Also, if someone does go to the person at the desk with a valid complaint, such as not getting what you pay for, having lizards in the room, or a door that does not close properly, they should not be brushed off. That is not a good way to run a business where all revenue depends on satisfied consumers. If Travelodge needs to raise the price of their rooms a little bit to hire a groundskeeper, exterminator, get new air conditioners, buy some trash cans, or build a bigger breakfast room, it would be well worth it, because as it is now, I would be surprised if many people would return to this establishment a second time.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "90210", "Title": "\u201cNot a bad place at all...\u201d", "Author": "Jay15oc", "ReviewID": "UR14440357", "Content": "This is a fine place to stay if you are looking for a non-fancy reasonably priced place to stay while doing Orlando touristy stuff.

We knew we would be arriving late and decided to stay at the Travelodge for that night because the price for a room that slept 5 was quite cheap! You can't miss this motel, because of its proximity to a very Large Orange (souveneir shop). My first impression came from the clerk checking us in. It was late in the evening and I'm sure she was tired, but she was curt, not in a rude way, but certainly not friendly or welcoming. She did eventually make eye contact with me when she handed me my room key and wished me a pleasant evening - unfortunately no smile. We pulled into a parking spot, which I thought was going to be the last time we would see our car, because I was sure that it would be stolen by the morning - the area doesn't instill a sense of security. We tried to turn the light on when we got into the room, but the bulb must have been blown, we finally were able to get some lights on. First impression was that the room was a nice size, with 2 double beds, and a full size pull out couch, the bathroom was small and adequate. There was quite a bit of mold on the bathroom ceiling and the carpet was worn and our socks were darker on the bottom after walking around on it. There was a lingering odor, sort of smoky, but we decided that it was probably other guests smoking outside and the odor was wafting in under the door. You could easily hear what was going on outside the door, which was probably due to a poor seal between the door and the frame. Our car was there in the morning, the beds were so-so and my back only hurt a little. We were in a hurry to get to the parks, so we skipped the continental breakfast and checked out. Our clerk who checked us out was friendly and asked how things were. When I told him about the light and the mold - he thanked me, made a note of it and said he would have it taken care of. All in all for the price I paid, I felt I got my money's worth. I knew what to expect after reading other reviews on TripAdvisor.

(Basically, we would be there only to shower, sleep, and to take advantage of the \"continental breakfast\". Which is what every one said it was, packaged cakes and donuts.) Hence, you absolutely get what you pay for: Budget accomodations for a budget price. We paid $69.95 a night. We booked it on the Traveldoge site. They confirmed and sent a total price, tax included, for almost $100.00 less, as they did not add the appropriate 13% tax. So that was the beginning of a bad experience. The next was room 101, which is the very moldy, floor tiles held in place with duct tape, cracked sink room that I read about in several reviews. The man at the front desk was accomodating and switched us to a room which was less moldy and although some floor tiles were craked, they were where they were supposed to be. I decided to take no chances and went to the local Walmart to buy a bleach cleanser to scrub the sink, toilet and bathtub, as well as the shower walls.

The housekeeping staff gave us extra anything we asked for; the hotel staff promptly raised the temperature of the hot tub at the request of the achy marathoners, etc. The hotel was ideally located, as there had to have been at least 10 or 15 restaurants and a few overpriced markets and liquor stores within walking distance. The 24-hour CVS was right across the street. The pool was warm, the hot tub was clean, the rooms were neat (which is really the best one can say about motel-type accommodations), my dad loved the couch cause it felt just like his couch at home :-), all the appliances in the room worked well (refrigerator, microwave, television) and once we figured out how the lights in the room worked, everything was gravy. We did have a few instances where we came back to the room at 5:30 to find that it hadn\u2019t been cleaned yet but frankly, given that the room cost something like $1.50 per night, I wasn\u2019t expecting The Four Seasons type service. In fact, I only had two gripes about this place (and one was a MUCH bigger problem than the other) - the 'breakfast' and the mold/mildew problem in the room. Continental breakfast in a hotel generally seems to mean 'whatever we have left over, that's what you get' and this was no exception: weak coffee, pre-packaged Little Debbie type pastry things, Tang-alternative, etc. This wasn't a huge problem, as we just went to the Super Target and bought our own breakfast supplies - problem solved! The mold issue was something else entirely. At first, my family thought that we were having vague allergic reactions to the difference in temperature from cold New York City to unseasonably warm and humid Florida. But, by the third day I realized that we were ALL waking up EVERY morning sneezing, sniffling and hacking with sore, scratchy throats\u2026which would go away once we left the room for the day and return after being in the room for longer than an hour. When we finally went looking for it, we found that there was visible mold in the bathroom (along the sides and top of the shower \u2013 not surprising, I guess), on the vanity in the room AND along the air vents.

After reading every travel book available on DW at my local bookstore, and every review imaginable on-line; after booking, then canceling at several off-property hotels; after thinking and rethinking every hotel and motel in the Disney area, I finally...hesitantly...began the trip to Disney World on May 6, 2006 with reservations booked at Travelodge East Gate Orange. I was a Disney kid...grew up going to Disney at least once a year, usually staying on-property, and always thought it was such a magical place. So naturally I wanted my own children, on their first visit, to have as magical a time as I had. But my family's finances didn't afford the luxury of staying on-property. I guess we could have scraped by and done it, especially at one of the Value resorts, but my husband and I wanted a larger room (two small children in very close quarters for a week is not my husband's idea of a vacation). So, off-property seemed the logical choice. And to make a long story a little shorter, I focued on \"suite\" type rooms which had at least a micro-fridge combo and a sitting area, that were reasonably inexpensive, and which were still close enough to DW that we could get to the parks easily without too much travel time. And after about six months of research and second-guessing myself I settled on this Travelodge (second-closest Travelodge on 192). When we arrived at this bright, almost garrish, pink hotel that sat next to a flea market with a bright orange roof on it, my stomach almost did a filp. As far as the hotel's style went, I was a little nervous about what I'd find on the inside. But, thanks to my children's amazingly good behavior on the car trip down, we arrived a day BEFORE our reservations and were extremely tired. I had been hoping that we would be able to check in a day early and that the hotel would be able to accommodate us. Now I wasn't so sure, but I kept an open mind and went into the lobby. The lobby itself was small, but its style was a little toned down from the bright outside decor--nothing too posh, but nothing scary either. On waiting to check in, however, another vacationer in front of me was in the process of telling the manager that his family's room was not acceptable, that it didn't \"live up\" to the photos on the web, and that when his wife booked it, they had been expecting something all-together different. The manager was very polite to the man, took care of him with no hassles, and even thanked him for trying the hotel. I decided to keep my open mind open a little longer and just see how the room turned out before I bolted. When the manager waited on me, he was very pleasant and professional, didn't make any excuses for what I'd just overheard, and even accommodated my extra night without having to move me around during our stay to do it. He also offered local info on restaurant and attractions. I took the keys and proceeded to my room. When I opened the hotel door, I found the room to be EXACTLY as the photos online had pictured it. I'm not sure if all of the rooms were as clean and well-appointed as mine was (there did seem to be some renovations going on in rooms around ours), but there was nothing I could complain about. I'm not sure if the man who I had heard checking out before he checked in had expected a four star hotel on an economy budget, but as far as I was concerned, my room was more than I could expect for the paltry $46 a night I was paying. The room was spotless. There was not even any dust on the lamps! The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but the room made up for this with a Working refrigerator and microwave, a clean sofa with a coffee table, and an extra dining table with two chairs just perfect for feeding my two little ones during an afternoon snack. All in all I was quite pleasantly surprised. When my husband made the discovery that our remote control had no batteries, I thought \"uh-oh\", but a quick call to the front desk had a new remote there in under fifteen minutes. After that we had no other problems. No bugs, ants or roaches, always enough towels, and I was even able to keep our laundry done in the coin laundry by the pool while my husband and I watched the kids play in the water. And the pool was NEVER crowded. On two nights, we were the only ones at the pool. Safety had been another concern of mine, but I never felt that we were at risk here, even though this hotel only has exterior corridors. Our room was around back (not poolside, but close to a breezeway that gave us quick access to the pool and laundry), and there was never very much noise. The hotel was located very close to some good restaurants like the Macaroni Grill, and Boston Lobster Feast, and it was right across the street from an easy Krispy-Kreme doughnut breakfast. Oh yes, and as far as that garrish pink exterior went, after a long day at the parks, I was able to spot the hotel a lot easier than others around it. Evey evening I just looked for the bright pink and orange! Not to mention the fact that my kids loved staying at the PINK HOTEL! Since we've been back, all I've heard is that they want to go back to that Pink Hotel. When we do make a return trip to DW, they'll probably get their wish!

The sidewalks are limited for walking dogs as it's near the airport but there are several dog parks in Miami to help exercise your dogs. This location was within walking distance to Mcdonalds, Wendys, Subway and Denny's. The hotel also offers a breakfast (oatmeal, bread, fruit, coffee etc.) but arrive early in the AM as it can get extremely busy. The pool was basic but was used frequently by guests and us. TVs in the room are awesome and so are the nice comfy beds. I would highly recommend this hotel. It's literally 10-15 min from all major things in Miami.

They have a free shuttle to and from the airport, which was convenient. We called for the shuttle after we picked up our luggage and only waited about 15 minutes for the van to arrive. All of the employees were friendly and helpful; the housekeeping staff all smiled and greeted you when you walked by and the front desk staff were all very nice and courteous. It is a motel, so there were only two levels and there were several different buildings. Our room was in a far building, so we had to exit the reception building and walk outside to our building, where we could take an elevator up. It wasn't that bad at all, but it would probably be frustrating if you had heavy baggage or if it were raining. Our room was neat and clean, and it was pretty large. We had a very large flat screen tv in our room, an area for seating, and a desk. There was a medium sized closet with luggage racks, hanging space, and a safe. We also had a coffee station in our room. The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable, which was a nice surprise and helped us sleep off our jet-lag. Breakfast was dissapointing. It was free, so I guess I can't complain much, but there were only bagels, white and wheat bread, muffins, two types of dry cereal, apples and oranges, and few types of jam. We didn't bother with the toaster because the line was so long. They were out of spoons when we got there, and the front desk said that they didn't have any more, which was dissapointing because we had already prepared cereal with milk. They had one or two types of juice, but they were from concentrate and tasted cheap. The dining area was also far too small to accomodate all of their guests. There were some small tables across from the reception desk, but they were all full, and several guests were standing and eating. There wasn't room for us to even stand and eat because it was so crowed, so we ended up bringing it all back to our room. There are a few fast food restaurants next to the motel; I would recommend just going there instead if you want a decent breakfast. Ultimately, I would recommend this motel for stop-overs or for people who want to save a lot of money on lodging. The location was pretty far from all of the tourist sights in Miami, so I wouldn't stay there for a vacation, but there were several vacationing families staying there when we were there, so I guess that you could make it work by taking a taxi or shuttle to downtown and the beaches.

We did notice that our smoking room did not have ashtrays so we stopped by the front desk on our way back from dinner. When we checked in there were 2 clerks and the front desk now only one. He helped me quickly told him what I needed and he told me it would be just a minute since they were in a closet across the way. That would have been fine except for the group of people that were hanging out in the lobby pestering the poor guy. Can I have a free toothbrush or 5 of them? Do you have a hot tub,spa sauna? What time does the pool close? Do you have free breakfast? Oh great I will call you and tell you what I want and you can bring it to me. These are the real questions I heard while I waited. The security gaurd had to ask the group to quite down at least 2 times and a few got really nasty with her. The phone was ringing with people wanting the shuttle. This group just kept on talking to him while he was on the phone trying to take care of things. And the clerk was very great the whole time. I work in customer service and I am not sure I would have been that nice to all of them my self. I never got the ashtrays since I had been waiting for over half an hour. Not the clerks fault he was not given a minute to breath. The security gaurd was great and I told her so.I did get a few bowls from the breakfast area and used those. I was told that was Ok and it was ok with me too. Now the shuttle to the Port of Miami we did not take the hotel approved one. THe only spots left when we checked in were for the 1pm and we wanted to be there before that. Our plan was to take the hotel shuttle to the airport and take a $24 cab to the port. But we got lucky. A shuttle pulled up and we asked if there was room for 2 more. Yep. Lucky for us another guest felt that the 1 pm shuttle was too late for them too and made arangements for the one we were on. I guess the hotel approved shuttles do not start until 11am. The only thing I did not like was a group got on our shuttle thinking it was the hotel approved one. A staff member (who I had not seen when I had checked out) ran up to the van and was very clear that this was not a HOTEL APPROVED SHUTTLE and if anyone had paid the hotel they needed to wait for the REAL shuttle. So out they went and we had to wait to unload their luggage. Too bad seemed like nice folks too.

It is undertadable that there are moments when \"stuff\" happens, and that will definitely have an impact on your stay, but we have to be fair when we rate the hotel and when we rate the experience. This hotel is located in Doral. This is more of a business area and an ideal location for the overnight traveler. It has a Wendy's, McDonald's and Denny's, all at walking distance (3 to 5 min.) and also a small shopping plaza that has a Subway's and two restaurants (cuban and chinese). Miami International Mall and Dolphin Mall are between a 15 to 20 minute drive away, depending on the traffic. The hotel has a pool (that I have never used) that looks very clean. The rooms are very comfy. Two queen beds, TV, coffee maker, blow dryer, etc. If you are looking to stay on a fancy place, this may not be it. It's good and clean, but not fancy. And the are, as I mentioned, is more business oriented, so don't expect bars or discos nearby. If that's what you are looking for, then I suggest staying near SoBe or Coconut Groove.

Apparently no one knew how to fix it so we had to put the phone on the floor and cover it with clothes for two nights to keep it from shining in our face. Returned late on Monday and found at 4 pm our room had not yet been cleaned. Filthy from being out in the everglades we were furious that we had to track someone down to get clean towels so we could take a shower and leave for dinner. While bathing we heard them come to clean the room but they were locked out for obvious reasons. We called the hotel mgmt and told them we'd be gone an hour for dinner and we expected someone to get up there and demanded our room be cleaned. Came back to find the bed made, no vacumming whatsoever, and 2 towels. No hand towels no wash clothes. and still no mattress cover. At this point we were furious and called the front desk demanding a mattress cover and wash clothes. We were called back a couple of minutes later by a woman who said that they didn't have any wash clothes, all of them had been stolen and they were on order. At this point I lost it......stealing towels I've heard of but not the washclothes. Within 10 minutes another employee showed up with towels, hand towels, and wash clothes. She also put a mattress pad on the bed. The next morning as we got up to leave we realized that our pocket size Nikon Digital camera was gone. We tore the room apart looking for it. In our furor I had mistakenly left it on the dresser when we left for dinner the previous night and called thenm for cleaning service. All of our Miami pictures were now gone. Fortunately I had been downloading all of our other 3 weeks of vacation onto my laptap which was hidden in the room. The front desk clerk reversed one night stay for our trouble. As I pointed out that doesn't do me any good regarding my camera. Only after I filed a complaint online with LA Quinta corp. (who never did respond) did I hear from the actual manager. He reversed the rest of the charges and when he heard I was seeking to find out if my travelers insurance would cover the loss of the camera he offered to pay any difference. Needless to say it didn't meet my homeowners deductible and travelers wouldn't cover it. I notified the manager via fax that I was going to have to bear the full cost of the camera and haven't heard a word since. The place is despicable and having been a long time fan of La Quinta I can say this one 3 day stay has soured me from ever staying at a LA Quinta Inn again.

The young lady assured us that there were no pay per view movies and would not need to swipe our credit card. When we got to the room and saw that there WERE movies, we tried to order and had to go to the front desk at 12 midnight to have our card swiped then. Last warning: there is a night club in the strip mall next door that provides a hangout for a lot of younger adults. I saw a lot of those patrons renting rooms as soon as they left the nightclub, if you know what I mean. They were using it as a motel; I saw most of these rooms being dis-occupied within a few hours after they had checked in. Not a great place to have your kids.

The front desk staff was so unaccommodating and unresponsive that they made us feel as if the theft were our fault. Despite the fact that we filed an official report with the police, contacted La Quinta coprorate headquarters, and followed up with legal filings, we were not compensated for anything. I was surprised to learn that one of the previous customers receieved a voucher for a free night due to service complaints -- not only did we have to pay for our stay that night, we were not offered any alternative compensation. Not that a free night would have made any difference - we will never stay at a La Quinta property again.", "Date": "April 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cIf you enjoy the smell of Mildew...this is the place for you\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4941484", "Content": "Well we got there pretty late at night after a flight from Toronto Canada. We took their shuttle from the airport to the hotel and I would say DO NOT EVER take their shuttle. The male driver flew down the roads hitting the gas and brake simultaneously and was cutting in and out of traffic. I thought I was going to die. So once we get to the place the front desk agent was very nice and informative. We walk to our room passing the pool and seeing leaves and other floating stuff in it. Honestly who knows when the last time it was cleaned?!? So we now enter the room and a strong musty mildewy smell hits us and almost makes us pass out. The room was very plain and had nothing special to it. The bathroom was great...clean to the eye and very spacious...just what four girlz need. So it's been 10 months since I'd seen my sister and mom and we wanted to go out and have some drinks as this trip was for my 21st birthday. Yeah it is the sketchiest neighbour hood EVER!!! We were told to go next door to this apparent club. If you're into clubs that have metal doors with no windows to see in then that is the place for you. There is nothing around this hotel.. no good food places..no pubs to relax in...NOTHING!!! So we ask the front desk agent where a nice pub is and she tells us about one and it was great but a ways away. The next morning my mother and I went to see what was for breakfast and it was nothing fancy by any means. Individually wrapped bagels and danishes with yogurt and milk. It was nice but definetly not worth what the room cost. If you are looking for a budget place and enjoy being scared to walk down the street late at night this is the place for you if not go elsewhere!!", "Date": "April 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cCreepy - Last Resort Only\u201d", "Author": "texmln", "ReviewID": "UR4723551", "Content": "We were trapped at the Miami airport and had to find a room late at night (11pm) to overnight in. We called the \"motel\" from the reservation board located in the baggage claim. The rate was outrageous at $125 a night but still much cheaper than several other hotels so I knew I might be in for a rough night. Though the motel claims to be \"only 1 mile\" from the airport what they really mean is they are 1 mile from the edge of airport property, being about as far away from the main terminal as possible while still able to make this claim. The cab ride is $14. When we pulled up the entryway light was flickering on and off revealing a passed out security guard laying on a baggage cart in front of a well-worn motel. The night clerk checked us in quickly and sent us to our room, which had a mildewy stench. The kind of smell that says you will wake up with a sore throat just from breathing the air. On the plus side, though I was expecting a nasty, dirty room the sheets were clean and the bathroom was fairly clean as well. The room is about as basic as they come. Nonetheless, this motel is located in an area that does not make one feel safe. I would not recommend staying at this motel unless you have no other option and want to be close to the airport.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Quinta Inn Miami Airport North", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d87076-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Miami_Airport_North-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$77 - $140*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7401 North West 36th St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33166</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "87076", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3b/23/3b239a14e37f0c5354fd45f5a0c9816b3large.jpg"}}

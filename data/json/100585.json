Lovely afternoon wine tasting in the lobby between 5 and 6. A little stingy with the appetizers but it was a nice way to unwind before dinner in front of a roaring fire. The windows open in the rooms so it is nice to get fresh air at night. Robes to use hang in the closet and if you're an In-Touch member you can pick something from the mini-bar. (Cashews were lovely!) I had booked a King Premier room with a $20 food credit per day. It worked out nicely for breakfast at Tulio. Tulio is a lovely restaurant and even though I have been traveling to Seattle for over 30 years I have never eaten there. On my next trip I will make a point of dining there!

Although the staff are super friendly and welcoming there are certain services they fail to deliver, like proper cleaning of the rooms and changing the bed linen. If you change the bed linen at least once a week in your house, why wouldn't you expect the same approach in a hotel, especially if it is 4*? The soap dish was clean for the first couple of days... like 2! From the 3rd day on it has been grimy due to the regular use and it was only when I kindly pointed it out that that was taken care of. Today it is grimy again! The laundry service is outrageously expensive, the most expensive I have experienced, like $2.5 for a pair of socks. Another expensive service is room service (I know, it is the case in all hotels). In this particular hotel I find the room service does not offer the expected value for money: The protions are tiny, the food is far from good and the prices are high. The rooms are spacious (single occupancy rooms have 2 queen size beds), the choices for room entertainment are great and there is loads of wardrobe and storage space. Another plus is the fact that they have a complimentary coffee service from 6-9 every morning, and a Washington State wine reception in the lobby from 5pm to 6pm every day. It is lively and the wine is always of the best quality. All in all, it is a good hotel, however I think they should improve a number of services.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coos bay", "Title": "\u201cVery small lobby area.\u201d", "Author": "Christie H", "ReviewID": "UR126651937", "Content": "Nice hotel but very small lobby area.

A nice perk for members of the Kimpton InTouch program is a \"Raid the Mini Bar\" card for up to $10 worth of your choice. Unfortunately that doesn't buy much at the mini bar prices. One downside to this and most really nice hotels is no in-room coffee. However, morning coffee service is available in the lobby... along with a big fire in the fireplace. Tulio is a pleasant Italian restaurant providing service to the hotel. The food was delicious and service was very good (Efren). Especially notable were the orecchiette with spicy Italian sausage and a scrumptious pork shank that falls off the bone. I felt bad because there was no way I could eat it all.

I have mainly been a Hilton guy and was curious to see what Kimpton had to offer. Finding the hotel (I came straight from SEA-TAC airport) was extremely easy, it was a 1 minute drive off the expressway, and has a nice vertical sign spanning several floors of the facade. They have a full valet service $35 for in and out rights. Across the street is a parking garage for self park, but I think it is close if not the same price. I took an earlier than expected flight and was several hours before check-in time. The front desk was able to accommodate me and placed me on floor 3. The room was smaller than I was used to, but very nice quality. My view was an alley with a parking garage. Cars were parked on the same level as the hotel window, so I had to pull my blinds to ensure privacy. Free wireless access in the room with a Kimpton account. I went down to the lobby to work by the fireplace. They have a few couches and places to sit. This is meant to be a lounge more than a work environment, but it worked out fine. Between 5-6pm they have free wine tasting in the lobby. This is quite popular, as there wasn't a spot to sit down it was so crowded. I wandered out for dinner with some colleagues and almost any direction you walk, you can find restaurants. The location for this hotel was the best part. After dinner I crashed out and woke up around 1am to a dog barking. The hotel must be pet friendly. The barking went on for quite some time. After that, every noise seemed amplified...ice makers, doors slamming (they have no mechanism to stop the door from slamming...it seemed like everytime a door slammed the entire walls shook). I would take advantage of the free wine, so you can hopefully be smashed enough to sleep right through the night. The morning came and I walked by the restaurant inside the hotel. It was not overly crowded, but busy. It smelled good, but I didn't have time to stop.

I didn't hear much street noise at all with the windows closed, although at one point I had to keep a window open slightly to keep it from getting stuffy. Breakfast at the attached restaurant, Tulio, was very nicely done and the service was attentive. The hotel also puts out free coffee and tea in the lobby in the morning. (It would be nice if it were left out a bit longer -- it's sometimes nice to have a cup later in the morning or early afternoon.) I believe there is also an evening wine reception, though unfortunately I missed it each night due to work. The location was great. I was able to walk to and from my downtown meetings and sneak in a quick visit to the Pike Place market area during my spare time. There's a very small fitness center with 3 cardio machines and some weights. It seems like it could get crowded quickly, though I never had to share it with more than one other person. The staff that I interacted with were incredibly helpful. One desk clerk even tracked down a compatible charger for my cellphone when I mentioned that the battery was nearly dead, and had it delivered to the room within about 5 minutes. Very impressive!

It was amazing, overlooking the city library, the skyline, and the courthouse. I could have spent all night just looking out the wall of windows! The suite had a sitting area with chair and sleeper sofa, nice sized flat-screen tv, fridge/dresser, and coffee table. The king bed was ridiculously comfortable, the bathroom updates with granite.

AMAZING beds, huge rooms, beautiful view (we were on the top floor [11th]), and incredibly friendly and helpful staff. I broke a nail on my stay and the front-desk went out of their way to get me a nail file. What impressed me most is that we had booked through Priceline name your price and paid about 50% of their retail rate, and they still give us the best room in the place and treated us like royalty. Very centrally located (we were looking right over the courthouse and the awe-inspiring architecture of the Seattle Library) although the area itself doesn't have a lot to offer in the way of nice/interesting dining experiences. But it is in walking distance of the Pike Street Market and the SAM (both of which I also recommend) and plenty of public transit options including the greyhound station (although it was my first time taking the bus and I will NEVER do that again...but that's another story! :)", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot for the younger crowd\u201d", "Author": "Daniel S", "ReviewID": "UR123507180", "Content": "We got this place through hotwire at a pretty good rate.

My partner and I decided to drive to Seattle for the w/e and enjoy the downtown sights. With 3 Kimpton hotels to choose from, we opted for one neither of us had stayed at previously: the Hotel Vintage Park. It was a wonderful experience and lent itself perfectly to our much needed R & R! The staff was super - polite, friendly (without being over-the-top, trying to be your new BFF), thoughtful and quick. I needed an item, called to the desk and it was brought up to the room within 3-4 minutes. Same when we asked for restaurant suggestions - menus were delivered to our room in a matter of minutes so that we could peruse them. We opted for a Premier King room, a little larger than the regular King room. The extra space seemed a treat, no tripping over each other's things! The bed was sumptuous, so comfy and cozy with a lovely duvet to snuggle under. The high ceilings really gave the place a spacious and opulent feeling. The one less than perfect item was the placement of the toilet, right in front of the door when one walked into the BR. That seemed very odd. The morning coffee in the lounge is awesome! Really delicious and lovely to sip with the free NY Sunday Times (!!!). If you prefer, there is also hot chocolate with real whipping cream available... The front desk was very accommodating with a request for a later checkout, polite and smiling as usual.

The room had a nice living area, mini-bar and the bed was really comfortable. It was good to get settled and relax. Until I realized I left my cell phone in my car. So back to the valet I went. After explaining what I had done and that I would go up to get my phone, he asked me to take a seat in the lobby and he would retrieve my phone. A few minutes later he came into the lobby with my phone.

In Seattle???\u201d", "Author": "Jan714", "ReviewID": "UR118816880", "Content": "I had a one-day business meeting in Seattle and selected the Vintage Park for its walking proximity to the location of my meeting, and because it was offering 30% off for a two-night stay. This is a beautiful hotel, with exceptionally well appointed rooms, beautiful corridors (not very often I get to say that) and a very comfortable bed. The entire hotel has a wine tasting theme and each room is named after a local vineyard. The hotel offers free wine tasting from 5pm to 6pm each evening. I was in a King Premier room which had a king-sized bed, a couch, easy chair and coffee table, flat screen TV and a tiny granite topped desk. The clothes closet has leopard print bathrobes for your use during your stay, as well as an iron and ironing board and a safe. They also offer soft slipper socks for purchase at $15. There is a mini-fridge, but it is filled with honor bar beverages which leave no room for anything else. There is a basket of edible goodies also provided which had nice variety but exorbitant prices (sometimes I wonder how hotel presidents look themselves in the mirror each day charging $7 for a fifty cent bag of potato chips). The location is top-notch and, Seattle being a terrific walking town, is close to everything. However, there were surprises. 1. First and foremost would be the lack of in-room coffee. I never expected that in the Coffee Capital of America. I was told I could order coffee with room service, but, like most avid coffee drinkers, I want that first cup of coffee WHILE I'm getting ready in the morning, not afterwards. They do provide free, fresh coffee downstairs in the lobby, however, that doesn't help either when you're used to having it when your feet first hit the floor in the morning. Even dumpy motels have in-room coffee so I certainly would expect that in a 4 star hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and particularly in Seattle. I did order breakfast as room service the next morning to save time, as this hotel does offer the ability to order breakfast the night before. The breakfast was good tasting and well prepared, however it was incredibly expensive. I had two eggs, toast and potatoes (no meat) with coffee and a glass of orange juice and the bill was over $36. 2. The second surprise was the unavailability of electrical outlets. For a business traveler, this is crucial. There was one and only one available plug in the lamp on the desk. I could not find any other available plug for my cellphone charge however. The bathroom has only one duplex outlet with the hairdryer occupying one plug. I ended up charging my cellphone in the bathroom. And if you want to use the iron to press your clothes, you have to unplug your laptop. 3. The third surprise was the unusually dim lighting in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 even at the desk. I understand the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to going green (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even a glass and can recycling bin in the room); and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m all for going green with CFL bulbs. But the ones used here just do not give off enough light. At night, with the desk lamp on, the two bedside lamps on, and the two lamps on either side of the coach on, the room was still too dim. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar issue in the bathroom. The light fixture over the sink has four lamps in it, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still dimmer than I expected, particularly for a bathroom. The bathtub/shower is on the other side of the bathroom where there is no lighting at all. The sink light fixture is not strong enough to cast light over onto the other side of the bathroom. 4. The fourth and final surprise was parking. Your only choice at the hotel is mandatory valet parking at a total of $41.50 per day including taxes. There is a parking garage across the street from the hotel and their total daily fee is three dollars less. Yes, I know this is Seattle and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to be a walking town, but since I had to drive there from a town that was four hours away, I had no choice but to bring my car. This was a beautiful hotel, and I would definitely look into staying at other hotels in the Kimpton hotel family.

Louis and Ally are amazing concierges! Even if you don't need their help with anything, it is a joy to talk to them. They make you feel incredibly welcome and they leave you smiling from ear to ear. The hotel itself did not disappoint. Immaculate, like all of the Kimptons I have visited and the room was wonderful (we got a great king corner upgrade). The only 2 minor issues: the bathroom is quite small (you need to close the door to even access the shower) and quite old (old tiles, old fixtures, just a new piece of granite on the sink). This is where it is obvious that this was a very old property that was renovated. It seems like they splashed out on renovations for the whole room but ran out of money or interest by the time it came around to the bathroom. Anyway, a minor complaint - nothing that would prevent me from staying here again. As others have said, the lobby is TINY! Wine hour becomes a very intimate affair as you are sitting shoulder to shoulder with other guests. We encountered some great people but it was a little tight. The location is perfect.

After assuring me that the room (1001) was still quite even though it was next to the elevator, I took it. The front desk was correct. I NEVER heard the elevators at all throughout my stay. The room was a standard King and was quite spacious. Besides the bed, there was a comfy chair, a little side table, and a desk and chair. For some, the TV might be a little far from the bed to see, but for me the size of the TV was not a problem. The entire room was clean, and I loved that they have a separate recycling container for paper and bottles/cans. I hate throwing away recyclables when I am on vacation. The exercise room is very small, but met my needs. There is a single treadmill, a single bike, and a single elliptical machine. Each machine, however, has an individual TV. The room also has natural light, a water cooler, weights, and some stretching equipment. I used the room in the middle of the day, but I could see it being crowded in the morning or evening. If you are a runner, though, there are great places to run, especially along the waterfront. I had coupons for continental breakfast in the restaurant Tulio, but I never made it in there for a variety of reasons. I did stop in for a beer after going to a Mariners game at Safeco (about a 30 minute walk), but they did not have a TV in the bar so I took my beer back to my room. Overall, the property is great.

But this last visit (August 2011) our loyality had cracks appear. First at check in we arrive at 1:30 PM, early we knew so we went out to have lunch. Returning back at 3:15 PM they told us the staff were behind in room cleaning. So we waited another hour. 4:15, still no rooms ready for us. Completely different than any visit here in the past, it wasn't until 5:15 PM that our room was ready! Once settled in the room, things seemed back on track until 2:15 AM! When other guests on our floor came back to their rooms, talking loud, slamming doors, I would have never thought I was in the Vintage Park Hotel, maybe a Holiday Inn, but not the VIntage Park. The last somewhat disappointment was the bath towel size, they seem to have gotten smaller, maybe its just me, but they really seemed tiny! So, was it the full moon? Was it one of those things? Was it the wave of the future? Who knows, leaving the hotel, I knew I could not return the hotels to a 4 star class and was not even sure we would return for another stay, BUT.... My faith was restored in the Vintage Park when I received a call the next morning, from the hotels Manager. I did not prompt this call. As near as I can figure out the front desk people knew we were unhappy, and took thier own initiative to mention it to the Managers. The Manager apologized for our bad experience (even though it may have not been their fault) and asked us to give them one more chance! Wow! A very good outcome to something going down hill fast!

It is usually common courtesy to allow early check-in when a room becomes available, so I was surprised by this tactless and unnecessary comment. The room was average sized - nothing remarkable. Our view was of the adjacent building and parking lot. My husbands' parents requested a 5:00 a.m. wake up call the next morning - which did not happen. Luckily, my father-in-law woke up on his own at 5:45, and they were able to rush off to the airport in time to catch their flight. When my mother-in-law called the receptionist, she informed her that the wake-up call accidentally had not been \"logged\".

We got a good price for this hotel when we bid on Priceline. The first day our room was the size of a postage stamp. It had two windows that looked at a concrete wall with a mural on it. We called downstairs and the lady at the front desk was super nice and they moved us to the 6th floor and to a beautiful room (a suite) with lots of windows and a better view. At least now we can see Seattle from the window. That was very nice of her since we bought our room through Priceline you would think we would get zero service but we really appreciated it. If we would have had to stay int he other room it would have ruined our stay here. You could not even tell what the weather was like outside and there was also like a pile of old tires on the ground next to the wall...that can change the way you feel about the hotel if you were stuck in that room the whole time. We stay in real nice hotels so we are real picky. This place is spotless and the decor is nice. They have a real small cozy lobby w/ a fireplace where people gather from 5-6pm for a glass of wine from local vineyards. It seems to be real popular, my husband and I are not big wine drinkers so we never stopped for a glass but lots of other guests took advantage of it. They serve coffee in the mornings until 9AM and then they take it away. Problem is that we are on vacation and dont want to get up some mornings by 9AM so we missed coffee most days. Wish they also had coffee makers in the room. Location is a short walk to all the shopping, Pike's Market, etc. Everything is probably 5-8 minutes in every direction depending on how fast you walk. The rooms have a very nice flat/big screen T-V which my husband enjoys non-stop when we are in a room. The beds are super comfortable with down pillows..heavenly. I guess the only down side is that a few sides of the hotel are right next to some real busy streets and there is traffic noise. I can sleep through anything but sometimes there were ambulances or loud vehicles. I never ate at the restaraunt but my brother called when I was here and found out where we were staying. He said he has ate at Tulio's like 30 times over the years and he says it is the best Italian food he has ever ate. So I guess we missed out since we are leaving today for the airport.

My room was immaculate on arrival and was kept to a high standard of cleanliness by the housekeepers throughout my stay. It was large, light and airy with a comfortable sitting area which included a sofa, armchair and coffee table. There was a large closet with plenty of space to hang clothes and store luggage. The en-suite bathroom was spacious with complimentary toiletries. The furnishings in both my room and the communal areas were elegant with a stylish, rich colour scheme. My room was ideal for a peaceful night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bed was extremely comfortable and there was virtually no noise from the other guests or the busy street below. During check-in, I was told by the receptionist that, due to the high number of bookings for that night, my request for a room on a high floor was unable to be granted. He went on to say that I had been allocated a room on a low floor which was immediately above the restaurant which meant I might hear some noise. However, he told me that, if I did experience such a problem, I should report it to reception immediately and they would do their best to find an alternative room for me. Thankfully, it was not problematic: whenever I was in the bathroom during the evening I could hear diners chatting, but as soon as I returned to the sleeping and sitting areas, and closed the bathroom door, there was complete silence. There was a well-stocked minibar in my room which contained a wide selection of alcoholic and soft drinks, and snacks. The refrigerator came in handy to keep my own refreshments cool during the warm weather. In addition, complimentary homemade lemonade was available in the lounge during the afternoon which was very refreshing after sightseeing in the summer sunshine. The hotel is located in downtown Seattle and, as the city centre is so easy to get around on foot, it is ideally situated with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Because I was sightseeing for most of the time, I only ate three times in the hotel. I had a tasty breakfast of bacon, poached eggs, fried potatoes, strawberries, toast and freshly squeezed orange juice delivered to my room on my first morning which perked me up whilst suffering from jetlag! I also enjoyed two evening meals of roast chicken with lemon risotto in Tulio, and a pork shank with mashed potatoes via room service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both were delicious!

The good things first - the location is perfect. The hotel is charming. The corner king bedroom is spacious. Room rates are good during off season (winter). However, on my last visit, a few things have finally caused me to decide that the next time I'll try the Fairmont, even though it is a bit more expensive. Staff - front desk is friendly, but the valet/bell guys, food servers and people pouring the wine during wine hour did not seem to enjoy their jobs (or the guests), which leads me to wonder how the hotel management treats its staff. The wine hour at 5:00 pm - 6:00 pm is a nice idea but it is too crowded for such a small lobby. When we got there at 5:30 pm, the person pouring the wine was running out of glasses, seemed frustrated, and didn't tell us a word about the wine, just asked us if we wanted \"red or white\" and offered us a tiny pour - no more than I would get if I were tasting wine in Napa. The next day, we got there at 5:25 pm and again there were no glasses with no indication they were going to get more. We took a pass on the free wine hour and just went over to Purple Cafe and Wine Bar for a delightful flight of wines. Even though we had to pay for the flight of wine, it was less hassle and much more relaxing than the free wine hour at the Vintage Park. The temperature control in our room was not working the first night. At first we thought it was just stuck on 70 degrees. It was not until the middle of the night with a stuffy sleep that we realized the AC wasn't working at all. We called the front desk the next day and they did send someone up to fix it, but we still thought the temp control was very difficult to operate (and we aren't idiots). The bed, for the first time, felt like it was slightly sagging. It is time for VP to replace some beds. The comforter is very lightweight and kind of flimsy and feels like a sheet. I like a little more weight when I sleep - and extra blanket would be nice, but they do not provide any in the closet. The bathrooms are exceptionally tiny. Two people cannot be there at the same time. This has always been the case and yes, I knew this and even came back several times a year. This time, combined with all the other issues, made me say, enough is enough. The drawer space is miniscule. There are not enough hangers in the closet. For two people, there just isn't enough, and you end up having to keep many items in your luggage. Again, this has always been the case, but enough is enough. Here is another issue that I have noticed before, and I don't know why a high end hotel can't fix this. This issue however, has gotten worse, in my opinion. Vintage Park provides a coffee service early in the morning. That is very good and we like it. However, I prefer my drink coffee with half n half and the pitcher of half n half is ALWAYS empty by 7:00 am or so. No effort is ever made to refill it, even when asked. I asked for it to be refilled on my last stay and my request was ignored. The overnight parking fee is high - currently $34. Factor that into your room rate. The Fairmont charges a lower fee. This has been a great hotel, but I really think some things about it have fallen off. There is less effort now than a few years ago to really cater to the guests.

Most things are in pretty easy walking distance, though be aware (as I was not) that Seattle is very HILLY walking from west to east. The Vintage Park is on 5th Avenue, which is pretty much the eastern edge of downtown, so most places you go are downhill on the way there and uphill on the way back. North-South streets are mostly flat or have more gentle slopes. Rooms here are distinctive with their jewel-tone color scheme. Spring for the few extra bucks and go for the King Premier rooms over the standard Kings. For not much more a night, you get about 100 extra square feet of space plus a sofa. The bed was pretty comfortable and the bathroom was fairly large, if a little bland. The tub was kind of shallow for soaking. There was plenty of closet space, though drawer space was limited. There are all kinds of neat doo-dads in the closet, including the tiger-print robe, an umbrella, and thick socks for keeping your feet warm. The lobby is smallish, but does host a complimentary wine reception each evening at 5, featuring a local winemaker and some hors d'oeuvres. This is a nice touch, as is the pet goldfish they will provide for your stay upon request. These are signature touches of the Kimpton chain which give it a nice personal flair. Tulio Ristorante is attached to the lobby and serves fine Italian cuisine, heavy on the seafood. It's a smallish room serving all three meals, and appears to be very popular as it was packed to bursting on a Wednesday night. Definitely make reservations here. There are ice machines only on the 4th, 7th, and 10th floors of the hotel, which is a little inconvenient. There's no pool and I didn't get a chance to check out the fitness room--I got all the workout I needed from the hilly streets. Staff all appear to be eager to please and very capable. It can be a hassle to get a cab, so plan on 5-10 extra minutes for that. In the immediate area, the bar/restaurant at sister Kimpton property the Monaco is fun. And Shuckers just down the street at the Fairmont Olympic has just about the best fish and chips I've ever had. You can walk to Pike Place Market from the hotel, though it's a bit of a hike. If you do, the great lounge at the Four Seasons right outside the market is a fine place to fortify yourself for that trip back uphill. You can easily walk the six blocks to the monorail from the hotel and hop on that to get to the Space Needle. .", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPersonal, classy, classic, comfortable, and an easy walk to anywhere.\u201d", "Author": "eastcoastvet", "ReviewID": "UR84693493", "Content": "The room was nice and comfortable, and enjoyable wine tasting of local wines each night in the lobby.

If you still don't know what makes Seattle Seattle, you soon will as you are greeted in the lobby with a serious coffee bar seemingly poised to compete with a certain coffee giant. The staff is a super friendly bunch, proactively informing you of what's going on around town and willing to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The guestroom isn't the most spacious you will find, but they pack all the creature comforts within. Complimentary wifi, large flat panel tv, his and hers bathrobes, and the most generously-stocked minifridge and amenity kit I have ever seen definitely make for a comfortable evening. If you forgot to bring toiletries, the fine folks downstairs will gladly furnish you. And the best amenity ever for when visiting Seattle - an umbrella! Brilliant! This alone is worth one star.

Enough space for a small get together, with a flat screen t.v. & dual-sided fireplace that actually works! The bedroom is also nice-sized, with another t.v.,dvd player.

And the room was always so clean. We were a little apprehensive about the pet-friendly policy meaning we may have a little odor to the room, but this was definitely not the case. To think of drawbacks....well, there's not really much of a view except a slight view of the water between 2 buildings. But we knew this beforehand, so to us, that wasn't a big deal. At night a couple times we heard some sirens down below, but come on, it's the city - it didn't bother me. And we would have liked a coffemaker in the room too...thought it was unusual there wasn't one, but I'm sure if we'd called the front desk they would've gladly brought one up.

I signed up for the eStandby and the day of our trip I confirmed we would have the corner room. What a great deal it was. The room was beautiful and the views of the surrounding area were great.

If you arrive after 6:00 you can receive coupons for the wine served that day that are good in the restaurant. We took advantage of that and had the wine with dinner. The restaurant, Tulio, is a nice, smaller restaurant in the hotel. They have good food, and it was nice having it just downstairs. Check out TripAdvisor for the many good restaurants nearby the hotel. Most will require a reservation on popular evenings. The hotel has wireless access that requires an account or payment. The staff member we spoke with failed to tell us that the wireless is free if you sign up with your email to become a Kimpton InTouch member.

After flying over 18 hours from London, there is nothing better than having such a big sized room as a base and a place to relax. We stayed on the 11th floor in the corner,very quiet and super clean. The room itself has the usuals, massive bed (much bigger than your standard european bed), big flatscreen telly,couches,arm chairs and a study table. Bathroom was a standard size, clean and at a suitable standard. As it was a corner room, the views were nice, we could see Mt Rainer in the distance and also the cool library which is a unique building. The hotel comes with free wifi for those who need internet, you will need to sign up but its free! Plus many Seattle coffee shops have many free wifi so if you are on the move its helpful. I used googlemaps to find where bus stops were and what buses to take to get. They have a turn down service during the day which is a nice touch, the person cleaning our room did a great job and always put chocolates on our pillows. There are a lot of nice restaurants about and so much choice. I found Seattle to be very relaxing and over the time while we were there, it rained only once and was sunny. The weather itself wasn't even that cold, London in January/February was colder than Seattle this year. On a side note, the hotel give free newspapers, doormen that open doors for you,coffee in the morning and there is parking free. I sent a package to the hotel and arrived in good time, if you are thinking of doing that, it takes about a week, so plan early. Thanks Hotel Vintage Park for providing a great service and romantic experience to my girlfriend and I. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend anyone that stays in Seattle to stay here.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington State", "Title": "\u201cExtra attention to children much appreciated\u201d", "Author": "WA306", "ReviewID": "UR55115134", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park with our 4-year-old and 6-year-old.

Treadmill, stepping machine and another machine and some weights. Up-to-date equipment.

I booked this room on Priceline for $66--with that price I shouldn't complain at all.

The first room we were given (on what I assume was not that busy a night given that they were giving rooms away for $66) was the handicap accessible room right next to the elevator. One of my favorite things about hotels is take a long hot shower with a quality showerhead, and the accessible room has one of those floppy heads. While I'm not usually one to request a new room, I did just that, and the front desk happily obliged. The new room was smaller (not an issue for me) and well appointed. However, it smelled of cleaning products...bad. They must have just cleaned the carpet or something. We left the window open for about an hour, and it didn't do much. We eventually got used to it, but still... Given that I had already requested one move, I didn't want to do it again. My only other issue with the room was that the bathrobes (again, I enjoy my hotel bathing experiences) were very old and worn. The leopard print was faded and the cloth rough.

My mother and I went for a long weekend of shopping and dining, and just wanted a place to sleep at night, but we got so much more. Upon arrival, you see that it's a rather unassuming little place in a renovated older building, and there isn't a large grand foyer to welcome you. What you walk into is an intimate area with a warm fireplace that instantly makes you feel at home. We were checked in by Anthony, the chief concierge, and he could not have been a more pleasant and kind person. We had a great feeling about the place right away. Because of the package deal, we were given a room with one king bed, but we didn't upgrade because we wouldn't be spending that much our time there. We got a cozy and nicely decorated corner room and the bed was one of the most comfortable I' ve ever been in. The room was well appointed, with an excellent mini bar, soft robes, slipper socks for chilly feet (purchase), and quality toiletry items. Food from the late night room service menu was delicious and generously portioned, but a little slow getting to us. On Saturday and early Sunday, we walked about the city checking out the various restaurants and shopping venues, but decided late on Sunday that we would like to head 45 minutes north to the Tulalip Casino. Anthony arranged a rental car for us on very short notice, and wihin an hour we were heading for the highway. Overally I would grade the hotel an A-. The minus was for the slightly worn out chair in the room, a bath towel that had seen better days, and the rather high parking rate - $30/night.

I had high expectations of the hotel, given it's status on TripAdvisor. However, I was a little disappointed with my experience. At the recommendation of the hotel, I took the GrayLine Airporter Shuttle and Connector. It was $24 roundtrip from the airport, but don't bother paying the extra 6 bucks for the Connector service if you're willing to walk less than a block. It took about an hour to get to the hotel. I checked in around 5:30pm. The front-desk personnel were very friendly, helpful, and efficient. At the time of check-in, the afternoon wine sampling was almost concluding. There was a representative of a local winery to pass out samples of wines and sangria. I thought this was a nice touch, but found the lobby too crowded to manuever. So, I accepted a glass of sangria and headed to my room on the second floor. The room was exceptionally clean, but average on amenities. The furnishings were tasteful, and I loved the decor. However, the room was long and narrow with a wall of mirrors. The windows looked at a chain-link fence in front of a concrete wall with a vineyard mural painted on it. I found it strange that the room lacked a refrigerator, coffee maker, and chest-of-drawers when there was ample enough room for them all. I ended up stuffing my socks and undies on the shelf in the closet. From the head of the bed to the television was a distance of at least 20 feet. Though the hotel is called the \"Vintage Park\" there was little, if any, actual vintage pieces. The bed had lovely linens, but was not the most comfortable I've slept in. The location is decent, if a bit of a walk for those folks not used to hoofing it. I managed just fine, but my colleague was winded after climbing the steep hills of Seattle for sight-seeing. I had a voucher for a \"Continental Breakfast\" at Tulio restaurant each morning. Mind you, this \"continental\" breakfast amounted to a bagel with cream cheese, small plate of fruit, juice, and coffee. It was normally $11. I found it adequate, but those with heartier appetites may find themselves still hungry. Service was below normal, likely because of the many vouchers people use. I didn't have any other meal there, as prices seemed a tad high. All in all, a good experience. Not outstanding, but a good value nonetheless. If management were to add chests-of-drawers to the rooms and use real antiques as accent decor, this hotel would likely be a fabulous experience.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evanston, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cOnly Kimptons for me!\u201d", "Author": "develbow", "ReviewID": "UR31221070", "Content": "Let me preface this review by saying that I adore the Kimpton hotel chain--every hotel is different, but you know you can depend on each for excellent, friendly service, style and comfort. Most of the Kimptons are vintage hotels, as is this one, and all feature complimentary wine receptions from 5 to 6 each evening--my favorite perk! Usually these receptions offer additional free treats besides the wine; the first night they had tuna hors d'oeuvres, and the second night they were offering chair massages. In celebration of summer, they also had white wine sangria on both nights of our stay--dee-licious! Another nice touch was the free walking map the registration staff gave us when we checked in. Our room was very small (from what I could tell, almost all of them are) but comfortable. The bathroom was much larger than those I've encountered in vintage hotels, and that makes a big difference (room to spread out your toiletries on the counter, and no tripping over your traveling companion when you are getting ready to go out!) and like all Kimptons, each room is stocked with Aveda moisturizer, shampoo and conditioner. The bed was extremely comfortable as well. I don't think any of the rooms would offer a spectacular view (ours overlooked the playlot at the adjacent YWCA) so if you are looking for that you might want to look elsewhere. The room does not include a coffee maker, but in the morning there is free coffee and tea in the lobby. There is a tiny (hot, unventilated) business center on the second floor with pay internet access if you are (like me) a luddite who refuses to drag a laptop and/or blackberry on vacation, but there is free wi-fi if you do have your equipment with you. As other reviews have mentioned, the hotel is ideally situated for getting around downtown without a car. We easily walked to the piers, shopping districts, art museum, and the Pike Place market, and if you are going to the Space Needle or Seattle Center, the monorail terminal is just a five minute walk down Fifth Avenue. Pioneer Square might be a bit of a hike, but buses in the downtown area are free. If you do want to bring a car to do additional exploring, I urge you to use the Olympic Parking garage on Fifth Ave. across the street from the hotel. You'll save about $10 a night off the valet parking the hotel offers, and you won't have to wait for your car. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant, but it looked nice. I would definitely recommend Specialtys Cafe at Fifth and Union for breakfast (it's a chain, but they are so friendly it feels local) and Lowell's at Pike Place Market for dinner. The YWCA next door has a delicatessen that also offers Thai food, and they had a sign advertising massages for both men and women--might have to check that out as a budget option on my next trip. All in all, another memorable Kimpton Hotel experience!

The first room I was shown was fine apart from a slight humming noise from the fridge which could have been resolved however I asked to be shown another room 806 which was much nicer with a sofa, large screen LCD TV etc they offered it as a free upgrade from the original room so I booked it via Expedia from reception. All of the staff at the Vintage Park were friendly and helpful in particular the concierge Anthony helped with site seeing and a restaurant recommendation the Oceanaire. My intention was always to try out three hotels on this my first visit to Seattle so I would know where to stay on my next visit. As it turned out I stayed at the Vintage Park again at the end of the week as I was so pleased with the room, the feel of the place and with the friendly service I received. Breakfast in Tulio was fine if a little pricy however nowhere near the rip off at the Westin Bellevue. The restaurant also seemed popular in the evenings and looked to have a nice atmosphere with candles etc. The evening wine reception in the evenings was welcome as always with Kimpton hotels. In summary I loved my stay at the Vintage Park and will definitely return either side of my next visit to Microsoft. As background I booked my first night at another hotel, the Mayflower Park as I needed an address for the visa waiver form and it got good reviews on TA. However I had to move rooms as soon as I arrived due to noise, this was despite requesting a quiet room on the booking and again during the check in.

Firstly, if you have stayed at Kimpton, you know what to expect from amenities and bedding - all of which were excellent here as well. The room was cozy (having stayed in several downtown hotels in SEA, they are ALL cozy it seems) and comfortable. A nice touch is that the windows actually open a crack- letting in fresh air while not cooling the room at all. The climate control is excellent and quiet (we ended up turning it off), and while it may not seem like much, it is something that I notice everywhere I go. The room was exceptionally clean and fairly quiet despite being across from the elevator. If I want to quibble... as others have noted, the parking is outrageous and yes, the valets do seem to be in a hurry to get you in the door. That being said, parking anywhere in downtown is crazy expensive, so basically tack on $30 per night to the cost of your room if you are driving in. Upon checking in, we found a plate of lost grapes in our room- there were nine I think, on a bread plate that had seen better days. Turns out this was our \"welcome\" fruit thingy... one word- PRESENTATION! Storage for clothes is sorely lacking, with more room given to the fridge full of stuff that costs more than you care... and with Pikes a couple of blocks away- who needs it? Give guests the fridge and get some drawer space.... 2 people on a 7 day excursion use up the sole closet space quickly. Service and location was excellent, and there are plenty of restaurants around to walk to and enjoy (Wild Ginger remains our favorite). The hotel restaurant was busy, noisy, and service was average.

Also, the wine tastings each evening were very well conducted with a knowledgeable host and good wines. We've had other tastings in hotels that were nowhere near as professional. The only negative aspect of our stay was that the bed was soft. Another negative, though not the hotel's fault, is that even at the ninth floor, traffic noise such as firetrucks and ambulances was clearly discernable. The attached Italian restaurant, Tulios, was excellent. I highly recommend it. Not cheap but worth every dime. If you don't mind walking a bit, the location is very good and safe. It is centrally located about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the Pike's Public Market and a short walk to the Seattle Art Museum. The free downtown public buses are nearby and can save you a lot of walking if you're not in shape to handle the urban hills of Seattle.

It is very centrally located and so much of the city is a reasonable walk away. And anything that's not within walking distance is just a short car or cab ride away. Great things about the hotel: location, location, location. I also enjoyed the afternoon wine tasting. My room was tastefully furnished. The staff were all pleasant. I had requested an upper floor room and was given one, which I really liked; less noise from the street and a bit of a view. The bed was comfortable. Things that were less than great: The hotel lobby is tiny. If you're looking for a place with an impressive lobby, this isn't it. The wine tasting: I really enjoyed this but if you're looking for someone to be there to give you in-depth information about the wines, it's hit or miss. One day there was someone from the vineyard who really enjoyed talking about his wines. The next two days it was a hotel staff member who had very little information about the wines she was pouring. To her credit, whenever someone asked a question she didn't know, she'd go find the answer, frequently printing out information for us. A little bit of food is served with the wine (pizza) but if there's a crowd there for the wine tasting you probably won't get any. Parking: the hotel parking is expensive (see some of the other reviews). Bathroom: functional but small. Pet Peeve: where the heck am I supposed to put my clothes when I unpack? In the room I stayed in there were two small (and I do mean small) drawers available for folded clothes. This was in the same cabinet as the mini fridge. Since there were two of us in the room this wasn't nearly enough room (actually, it wouldn't even have been enough for one of us). So, the next thought is to put as much in the closet as possible. Except the closet is smallish and the hotel has a number of things hanging in it that are for sale! Their \"for sale\" items probably take up about 30% of the small closet. I appreciate them trying to earn an extra buck but this was just ridiculous. I appreciate that downtown hotels are tight on space but there should be somewhere to unpack. I ended up living out of my suitcase, something I didn't appreciate. The restaurant: we did eat breakfast in the restaurant and one dinner. Breakfast was nothing special, either bad or good. Service was bad one day and great the next. Dinner: the food was mediocre, there are many better places nearby. When my pasta arrived at the table I suspected that it had been kept warm for some time. Sure enough, when I put my fork in it I was able to lift almost the entire contents by just lifting up my fork. Bottom line: In spite of the lack of storage I like the hotel a lot and am glad I stayed there. However, I wouldn't stay there again unless I happened to get a great deal on the rate, there are too many other great hotels in Seattle to try that are equal in price or less expensive.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta", "Title": "\u201cWonderful location and a great place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "weddinggirlatlanta", "ReviewID": "UR18745930", "Content": "We had a great weekend.

So, if possible, try not to get a corner room if you can (rooms ending in 14 are corner rooms). The bed was comfy, the room was clean, and they have lovely L'Occitane toiletries and funny animal print velour bathrobes in the closet. Heavy drapes block out all the light that facilitates for a good nights' sleep, but not a good view--although we weren't in the rooms for very long. One thing I found frustrating was the fact that the temperature doesn't go below 64 degrees to say, 60 degrees, and I like my room cold. Oh, well, not a really big loss. The hotel does have a wine hour (we missed it the first night, but they served two Duck Pond wines the second night). They also served some pizza from the restaurant (Tulio's) in the hotel--the restaurant is Zagat rated. It was pretty funny to hear the concierge pouring the wine tell us the wine was from Washinton when we had just driven past the winery the day before in Oregon and given a couple of bottles of the same wine from our friends (oregon wine). The valet ,when we first checked in, was very, very snooty and irritated that we chose not to park with the hotel, but across the street to save a little money. The valet parking is $30/day (plus tip) and there is no self-park. If you park across the street, the cost is $26/day (no wait, no tip). The front desk staff was a bit stuffy and snooty as well (as is probably expected from a top tier hotel--I have stayed at many nicer hotels with friendlier front desk staff). The concierge was not available when we needed them for recommendations/directions/maps, but the front desk girls the second night were kind enough to look up late night movie times for us. The hotel is about 8 blocks from Pike Place Market. We even made the trip to by foot to the Space Needle (which was a bit of a hike but worth it when we had pastries to walk off). There are many stores, coffee shops, and all kinds of restaurants within a few blocks. All in all, a standard experience.

The room was nicely appointed, and we had fun with the leopard print robes. The concierge service was nice and a woman helped us get reservations to the Waterfront Grille - an EXCELLENT restaurant. But I digress.... There was NO view from our room, in fact we looked at a brick wall with a mural painted on it. Not that I need a view - I'd just assume walk around and see the city. It is moderately convenient to most of the tourist destinations. Luckily we were up for some walking. We only had the option of valet parking, so this added to our expense. There was nothing over the top about this hotel - I would not necessarily recommend this hotel. There's probably something else in Seattle that's a little nicer for the money you spend at the Hotel Vintage Park.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Cruz, California", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced, but good location\u201d", "Author": "luckygirl79", "ReviewID": "UR10604538", "Content": "Our party of six booked three rooms for two nights at the Hotel Vintage Park during a short stay in Seattle prior to departing on a cruise. The hotel itself is located downtown, right across the street from the public library, which is an impressive sight, and a 5 or 6 block walk to the waterfront, the market, restaurants and other entertainment. The lobby was nicely furnished with an area for a nightly wine reception, free for guests, and the property and each guestroom has a winery theme. We had quite a bit of luggage between the six of us and even though there were at least two bellmen standing in the lobby chatting, no one helped us with our bags or even wheeled us a luggage cart--we found one ourselves and took care of it. Not necessarily a complaint and we weren't trying to be lazy, but the place comes off as a high end establishment and you usually get help with your bags up to your rooms--particularly when the bellmen are just standing there. Check in was simple, but the clerk wasn't very warm or friendly. Parking was $28/night, valet only, which is apparently standard in the area, but still seemed high to me. The rooms were tastefully decorated and the furniture and furnishings were nice. The bathroom had marble sinks and L'Occitane products. There were robes hanging in the closet for our use, but were old, scratchy and in animal prints. A nice gesture, but I don't imagine many people make use of them. There was a basket of goodies and a fridge stocked with cold drinks and wine at a premium price. There was a hair dryer and iron, but no coffee pot, though it was free in the mornings in the lobby. Beds were very comfy. I personally made the reservations--3 rooms each with the description of a \"King Premier Room\"--so we were very surprised to learn that each of the three rooms were very different in terms of space and amenities. Our room was medium sized--the bed took up about half of the room with very little room to walk on either side of it. There was a small love seat, desk and chair and armoire all crammed together. Our bathroom was larger then the others. One set of travel companions, also supposedly in a King Premier Room, had a much larger room with what appeared to be much newer furnishings and a tiny bathroom. The final couple were placed in a room so tiny it was difficult to plop thier luggage down and had a queen bed instead of a king. They ended up having to be moved in the middle of the night because the air conditioning in their room inexplicably turned on during an all ready chilly evening and wouldn't turn off. The employee that arranged for the move made a big deal that they were moving them to an \"upgraded\" room because that was all that was available and told them they should be really grateful not having to pay extra. This made absolutely no sense, considering the room that they were moved to was smaller then the one I was staying in with no extra amenties or anything else to speak of, yet thiers was considered an upgrade while our was supposed to be standard. We booked three of the same type of rooms at the same price with the same description, yet got three completely different results. Seems they have several styles and floorplans and label the rooms whatever they want. Check out was a madhouse. There were more then a dozen people waiting for a cab, with clueless bellmen and valet drivers running around mixing people's luggage up. We paid more then $300 per night, per room and expected a little more in terms of service. We had such a great time in Seattle and I try not to think too badly of the hotel, but I will not stay there again when I return. Bottom line: a nice place with decent amenities, but the hotel tries to come off more ritzy then it actually is.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whidbey Island, WA", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the high price\u201d", "Author": "emilita28", "ReviewID": "UR10060507", "Content": "We stayed on a Saturday night in a 'Double Double Deluxe'. The base price of the room was $318, and with taxes and everything it was closer to $375. For that price, I was expecting something really nice - this wasn't it. When we checked in, the front desk person seemed really disinterested and barely spoke to me, and I was taken aback when I was handed the room keys...without a word! She never said \"you're in room such and such, the elevators are over here, our amenities are blah blah blah\". When we checked out the next day, we had a different front desk person who also said barely a word to us! It was weird, and not the kind of 'over the top' service that I'd expect from a pricey hotel. The room was somewhat shabby. The carpet was old and tacky looking, and had several stains on it. The sofa in the room was a brown velvet piece that has seen better days. The beds themselves were fine. The room advertises a dvd/cd player. When we tried to play a cd, we couldn't get it to work. We called the front desk and after several rings, they picked up and told us that maybe some cords had come undone in the back of the tv. They wanted us to muck about with the cords and figure it out - all with the tv bolted into the armoire so you can't really reach a hand back there. We also ordered from room service. Again, the phone rang several times before anyone answered. The food was pretty plain - for example a $15 panini that was mostly bread (and dry bread at that). The room comes with a goodie basket and minibar - yes, you guessed it, we had to call for the mini bar key and it took forever for anyone to answer the phone. I was disappointed that there aren't any free goodies with the room. I mean, if the Doubletree can give you a cookie for a $30 hotel, how come you have to PAY for a cookie with a $300 hotel?? In the closet are two animal print terry cloth robes that have been washed so many times that they are extremely faded, and also two pairs of socks that you are welcome to - for an additional $11 per pair!! One last gripe about the room is that the bathroom was very small. Overall, the place was okay but NOT what I was looking for with the amount of money I spent.

Other rooms (the largest and nicest) cluster around the elevators, which chime whenever the doors open. If you don't mind this noise, the hotel will be a fine place for you. (For the others, I think the hotel should have a stock of white noise machines on hand to lend to guests.) Second, if you bring your own car, be aware that some of the cars are parked in the open, apparently near a colony of large birds. My car was returned to me covered with bird droppings. This, I was told, might happen to about one-third of the parked cars on a busy night.

The bathroom was equally TINY, with a very small sink/vanity area. There was mold in the grout in the shower. See picture. The view was non-existent, as the first 5 floors of the hotel face a wall, which is about 6 or 8 feet away from the one small window. The small window and the proximity of the wall meant almost no natural light in the room. There was a crude mural of a vineyard on the wall, a poor attempt to hide the fact that the only thing you can see out the window is a wall. See picture. I complained about the size of the room and the fact that the room faced a wall. The desk clerk agreed that she knew the room was very small. She told me that on my next visit I should book a more expensive room, which is larger and does not face a wall. The room I was in was over $250 per night!

However, I prefer personable places that remember you when you come back. I had joined their club before we arrived, and though I had never been to a Kimpton hotel before, I was treated as though I was a regular. Special gifts in the room were just as I had ordered. Orgainc fruits, sparkling water, and chocolates, for my daughters as well as myself. When we showed up at the hotel, I was sick. I wasn't sleeping well and was keeping my family up at night with my coughing. When I spoke to the front desk about maybe getting another room on the same floor, I was easily accommodated, despite the fact the hotel was pretty full. They moved us to a higher floor so we could have rooms across the hall from each other. And even though the elevator was right next to my room, I never once heard any noise coming from the hall, the elevators, or the rooms next to me.

The beds were Tempurpedic, and the amenities were Aveda - why did we bother packing our travel kits!?!? The bowed shower curtains were welcomed, as was the good water pressure (sometimes, this is an issue - not here!). The hotel is pet-friendly, but we could detect no \"pet-friendly odors\" or other signs of pet trouble. There were two robes in the room - if you are a \"robe queen\", bring your own... these were wacky leopard colored (which was kinda fun), small (not as much fun), and a little scratchy (no fun at all). I must admit that we had expected a little more from the \"wine themed rooms\" claim. True, each room was named for a Washington State winery, with the vintner's name over the door (ours was Covey Run, one of the larger wineries and previously known to us). And, there was a magazine on Washington State wines in the room. And yes, there was a \"wine channel\" on the site TV. But - there wasn't a single bottle of wine in the honor bar, let alone from our sponsored winery! A minor blemish, to be sure, but we had really expected that the wine theme would extend to the Honor bar. Perhaps, they could consider that for the future, but I'm sure it's a lot of overhead, with the number of wineries that they \"theme.\" Parking is $28 a day, with in/out privileges of course. Expect the 16% state tax on your bill for the room. I had a minor billing issue (room booked for the weekday rate through the weekend), which is being resolved now. I also noted that when you book on the website, and your stay mixes weekdays and weekends, you'll be charged the (higher) weekday rate for the entire trip. Call the property direct to fix this. Overall, the hotel is pleasant, the staff goes out of their way to solve problems and make your stay great. They go out of their way to make up for the minor misgivings we had with the room. The location is good, and we would stay there again.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Wa", "Title": "\u201cAnother Great Stay-Trip # 3 for us at the VP\u201d", "Author": "DougDilvo", "ReviewID": "UR6482576", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the VP for one night.

We booked a package deal that included a bottle of wine upon check in and free parking. (parking is expensive at all Seattle DT hotels, usually $25-30 per night). We booked a King Premier room. It is a bit more expensive, but worth it to have some extra room. If you book this room, ask for a room that ends with 02 (7002, 8002, etc,)..These rooms are bit lager than the others. We stayed in room 1010 this time, and found out the hard way the 02 rooms are a bit roomier. As usual the staff was friendy and cooperative. Check in and out was extremely swift, and our car was retrieved in less than five minutes. The evening wine tasting from 5-6 is always a bonus. Good wine, nice atmosphere and very relaxing. Only complaint was some late arriving folks at around 3 am next door that were very loud in the hallway. Other than that, our stay was exactly what we were looking for. if you are looking for some personal attention, less crowds and fantastic accomodations stay the VP.

We were lucky enough to get an AAA rate of $152 per night for a standard King room. Normal rates seem to be a little higher. I signed up for Kimpton's frequent traveller program before arriving. I would highly recommend this to anyone who books through the KImpton site. The frequent traveller program notes preferences, such as bed type, smoking preference, floor preference, pillow preference, and location of the room on the floor. Prior to arriving at the property, I book a town car through the valet. Upon arriving at Sea-Tac, I was advised to call the driver on his cell phone. I arrived at the baggage claim, and called the driver. He had no idea about me, and was no where near the airport. Not a good start. We took a limo (basically the same price as a taxi) to the hotel, and in the process, saved either $5 or $10, as the hotel's car service was either $40 or $45. Upon arrival at the hotel, check in was quick. The front desk was very concerned when I mentioned that the car service was not expecting me. They grabbed the reservation book from the valet, and my information was all in there. They weren't sure where the ball was dropped, but made up for it with a credit in the hotel restaurant (other things were offered, I preferred the restaurant credit). We made it up to our room, and every one of our preferences were met. We were in room 1105. We entered our room, to our bed turned down with chocolates, sparkling water, and fresh grapes. The radio was playing classical music. We noticed that a coffee maker was missing, and called down to the front desk. The front desk promptly sent up a coffee maker with fresh ground coffee on a silver platter at no charge. I tested out the wi-fi access almost immediately. Everything worked perfectly. For other forms of electronics, the TV had almost every channel under the sun available. The mini-bar was well stocked, but prices seemed to be about $1 more per item than other hotels. Our friends were staying at the Sheraton, and this was true with their mini-bar. The bathroom was well stocked with Aveda products, two bathrobes, and cotton balls, q-tips, etc. The faucet hardware was fancy, but everything else was just your standard hotel bathroom. Also, noticed a little dirt on the floor after a couple of days (wasn't sure if it was there when we checked in). Also, housekeeping did not restock amenities. Had to ask the front desk to send up more shampoo. The restaurant at the property is nice. We only had breakfast there. Lunch and dinner look nice, but it is gourmet or fancy Italian. No pizza or spaghetti here. Personally, not my cup of tea, but that's just me. Other restaurants are around in abundance, but because the hotel sits on the border of the financial and shopping district, it is a couple of blocks walk to the nearest restaurant. As for the common areas, there aren't too many. The lobby/lounge was where the evening wine hour was, as well as where fresh coffee and tea were. The wine tasting was nice, although I was a bit surprised to see them checking names against the hotel register. All of the staff that we met with downstairs were great. The staff really are the shining stars of this property.

I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco, which is lovely! Unfortunately, they were sold out. So, knowing the Vintage is also owned by Kimpton, I thought it would be equally as good. NOT! I requested a premium room and to be away from the elevator. Their version of premium was a small, dated and uninviting room with worn out furnishings, old washed out awful bedding and a tiny tiny bathroom. The room seemed dirty and was definitely musty. Not to mention, I was right outside the elevators! I would never stay here again nor would I recommend them to anyone.

I chose the hotel for its proximity to the conference hotel and downtown, and it seemed to be a quieter option than the usual large chain hotels. We'd reserved a King room and were given a room on the second floor, one floor above the lobby facing away from the street. This was fortunate because the hotel is on a main thouroughfare and there is a busy parking garage across the street. It was far enough from the elevators, but during the evening there is a door to the restaurant kitchen that the staff leave open. You can hear the activity from the kitchen and all the chatter down the hall until the restaurant closes. The size of the room was even smaller than I'd expected for a boutique hotel. In addition to the bed and TV cabinet there was a desk and a club chair in the room - all in one corner. When one of us was using the computer at the desk it was impossible for the other to sit in the club chair. The room was decorated pleasantly enough and it appeared to be cleaned well, even the bathroom. The bathroom was small as well, especially the tub/shower. I am 6'2'' and it was difficult to maneuver around. It was made even smaller because the rack holding the towels is in the shower. The windows in the room faced an alley and it was fairly quiet except when dumpsters were being emptied. I would still ask for a higher floor the next time. The room doors are on hinges that allow them to close shut with force it they are not held. That was the biggest irritant - listening to various doors slamming shut during the evening and night. I did not hear any noise through the walls or from above. I did not have much interaction with the staff. They did come to the door a couple of times in the evening asking if we wanted to buy things or if we wanted the bed turned down. One night we left for dinner around seven, and we came back to find all the lights on and the bed turned down. We left the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door after that. The morning delivery of the New York Times was nice, and there was coffee in the lobby instead of in the room. The best thing about the room was the bed. It was very comfortable for a hotel bed and I slept well. I would have liked the option of another blanket so we could have taken off the bedspread with the attached bedskirt. Overall, the room was adequate. We were not in the room at all during the day and basically came back there to sleep. I would have found it difficult to spend more time in such a cramped space.", "Date": "October 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cFabulous little hotel for special occasions.\u201d", "Author": "ThompsonTwo", "ReviewID": "UR4016157", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at Vintage Park for her birthday and our 2nd anniversary. VP is located only about 2 blocks from I-5 but you never seem to hear or notice it. It's location is perfectly suited for quick access to Pioneer square, Pike Market or the monorail to Seattle Center. We stayed in their luxury suite (there is only 1) on the top floor and everything was incredible. The suite had a 4 poster bed with the most luxurious coverings, fireplace, jetted shower, plasma TV, sitting area and spa tub. Overall it is around 900 sq ft. The staff was extremely attentive to every detail and the room was spotless, new and richly furnished. Our only \"problem\" was that something was wrong with the chimney and a lot of smoke got into the bedroom. When we told the staff, they sent up housekeeping and maintenance immediately and they cleaned the entire fireplace and ran an ozone machine in our room to remove the smell while we were gone. When I reported the problem in my review, the hotel manager wrote me back personally and apologized, promised to have all the chimney's cleaned right away and asked to make our next reservation personally so she could accomodate our inconvenience. The hotel is a bit small (126 rms) and does not have modern conveniences like a pool or fitness room, but if you want a charming and attentive hotel for a special occasion, this is the place to stay. The evening wine reception and Aveda bath products are nice additions and the attached restaurant makes for convenient dining (our room also came with $50 per evening credit towards the restaurant).

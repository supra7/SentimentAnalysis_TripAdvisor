Their wedding could not have been more elegant, and went off without a hitch. The food was absolutely fantastic, and the decor was stunning. Out of convenience, we decided to stay at the Omni for the long weekend. While our hotel room was nice, it was insanely small for $200/night. The bathroom was literally the size of a closet. So small that only one person could even be in there at a time. The one other aspect that did not sit well with us was that they put 1 random older couple on the same floor as the wedding party (including the soon-to-be groom & his family). This older couple proceeded to call hotel security numerous times, claiming that there were multiple parties going on (completely false accusation, but I do know the noise level was not exactly what I would call quiet.) Now, I have to question the hotel staff's judgement putting a random couple in a room on the same hall as 40 wedding guests.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay Choice\u201d", "Author": "ln_spindler", "ReviewID": "UR126282377", "Content": "Stayed for an event at Lucas Oil Stadium, and was able to walk everyday.

The tickets were a Christmas gift. The hotel is difficult to find...we had directions from both Mapquest and Google Maps, and still drove around for over an hour before we found it. Had to wait for nearly 30 minutes to be valet parked! A few glitches at the front desk. The woman insisted that we booked through Expedia. We did NOT. We booked through Omni's reservation service, even speaking with one of their agents concerning specific amenities that we were looking for. We had a good rate, and our reservation promised a free breakfast buffet and valet parking at $17/night. NEITHER of these issues were honored. We left for Lucas Oil at 11:45am for a 1:00pm game. The Colts WON, and we hung around for awhile, returning to our room at 5:30pm. Our room had NOT been serviced. I called the front desk, and they promised to send housekeeping. It took another hour to get our room serviced!! The water pressure in our room was terrible. It was virtually non-existent! The bathroom was tiny and very dated in appearance.

The system is very loud when it comes on, disrupting sleep. We, too, had problems with pixelating in the in-room movie that we rented. Didn't even think to mention it to the concierge! The morning that we left, I called down to get our car brought around. The valet service never answered the phone. My partner went down to the lobby to obtain a luggage rack, and had to ask about our car then. (The hotel would not permit us to bring our own luggage down, necessitating another tip for the kid pushing the cart!) ALSO, Omni Reservations told us that there was a sky bridge from the hotel to Lucas Stadium. Of course, there is not.

The breakfast is good but standard fare, but then I'm not a big fan of breakfast anyway so the granola and yogurt suffices for me. The only drawback of this hotel is the funk that emminates from Olives, the cigar lounge/bar off the lobby. The gift shop, whose back wall is the opposite side of the bar's wall, often reeks of stale stogie. If you need anything from the gift shop (and are not a cigar fan), get in, get what you need, and get out. But then, who hangs out in hotel gift shops for long anyway. The hotel location is great, walking distance to many great restaurants and shops. It is connected to a shopping mall via a covered walkway on the mezzanine.

Lives up to the Omni name!\u201d", "Author": "RonboNJ", "ReviewID": "UR117951404", "Content": "Okay, first a few things out of the way.... I am not a hotel employee. I am a real business and pleasure traveler just like you who has had the opportunity to stay at many hotels over the course of a year. Check my other reviews on TripAdvisor. I do a rather good job of telling things as they are. When I stay at a hotel, I usually pick one that falls in the mid-price range. You know, the hotels that give you the best bang for the buck. For years my favorite hotel brand was Marriott. Can't beat their hotels. However, since doing more business conventions, I have found myself staying at Omni hotels. First, the one in Atlanta and now Indianapolis. Quite frankly, if you are not here on business, I can't for the life of me think why anyone would come to Indianapolis. It's a nice city. Very clean. Nothing to see or do except perhaps the zoo or a football game. On my free day, I walked around the entire day and found nothing overly exciting here. There are, however, very good restaurants close to the hotel. Oh, back to the hotel.... They say the first impression is a lasting one. From the moment I arrived, I felt I was being treated like a VIP. I stepped out of the town car (Carey Indiana - EXCELLENT) and there were several bellboys at the door entrance eager to assist and open the door for me. I walk in, and there is a very lovely woman bidding me \"Good Morning.\" I get to the desk, and though I am several hours early, I am quickly checked in and handed a room key. Since I was here on business, I booked three rooms for myself and my partners. They were all under my name, yet the hotel desk was very good about assigning the rooms to my partners and making certain that we were located together. My room was on the 11th floor, 1110. It was practically next to the elevator. Complaints have run amok here that the rooms in this Omni are small. I suspect so, due to the fact that this a hotel that was converted from something else. However, if you book a room with double beds (instead of a King) you are getting a larger room, essentially going from 180 to 244 square feet. So, the double bed room that I had didn't especially seem tiny at all. Perhaps the bathroom is smaller than I have seen elsewhere, but I made perfectly do with the space I had available. The room was very clean. Lots of closet space, an iron and electronic safe in the room. The television was a Panasonic flat screen HD. I don't know what signal the hotel is getting, but the picture pixelated often even though the weather was fine. They really need to do something about their TV signal. One thing everyone must do is join their rewards program. It is free by going to the Omni website. It allows you free WiFi and complimentary beverage in the morning delivered to your room. I am guessing I am at the second-tier GOLD status. I love the fact that before I go to sleep I fill out a little form requesting a carafe of coffee, juice or water to be sent to my room and when I wake up, there is a little tray outside my door along with a newspaper. All that is totally complimentary just because I am a rewards member. I think, even at the bottom rung of the program, you get all those amenities. Certainly something more than I get from something like the Marriott. Bed was very comfortable. Lots of pillows. A plug next to it to charge my iPhone. A desk with plug outlets. Very, very nice indeed. If I have ONE complaint it's the loud air-conditioning in the room. It turns on and off according to the thermostat settings. Of course, many of us like a cold room to snuggle beneath the covers with. The thermostat goes to 60 degrees. However, every time the air conditioning comes on, it makes a loud, grinding noise that makes sleeping impossible. So, I pretty much had to turn the air conditioner off at night. If hotel management is reading this (and I am certain they are), I am hoping you can fix the air conditioner noise in that room by the time I return next year. Another problem (not the fault of the hotel) is the noise from the street below. My window was facing the Claddagh Irish Pub. On the weekends, it is a noisy hotspot. Now, on the 11th floor it really didn't bother me. However, I feel sorry for those on the lower floors. There is no escaping that noise. And really, there is no escaping street noise as the hotel is surrounded by nightlife activity practically on all sides. If I can sneak one more problem in the mix it would be the elevators. There are only two that I know of off of the lobby. They are small. They are rather slow. During conventions (and remember, there are conventions here almost weekly) those elevators turn into local cars that stop at every floor and get crowded rather quickly. We were fortunate enough to snag the breakfast package for our stay. Usually breakfast costs $17 for the buffet, we got it at an extra room rate of $10 per night. Totally worth it. Nice selection of fruits, yogurts, breads, cereals, eggs, sausage and bacon, french toast or pancakes (alternates by day) and an omelet station where a cook makes them fresh for you. My favorite was the biscuits and gravy that were available every morning. If you don't get the breakfast package and want to eat cheaper, you don't have to walk far to find an eatery. Back to the hotel.... On my final morning, I had shared car service waiting with Carey Indiana. I am standing outside of the hotel with my luggage at 5:40am. The bellboy was extremely helpful in making certain that I got to my town care as generally, they can drive up to any one of two locations at the hotel. He went out of his way to look for the car and alert the driver of my presence. It was another one of those special moments where I felt like, \"Wow, they really are attentive to people's needs here.\" So, as you probably have gathered by now, I highly recommend this hotel. Yeah, I have read a few of the negative reviews posted on TripAdvisor -- and I am certain they are legitimate complaints -- but I would have to side with many more that are giving the highest accolades to this hotel and their service. From the moment you arrive, the staff goes out of their way to open doors for you and make you feel welcome. I look forward to returning next September. For dinner we thoroughly enjoyed Harry & Izzy's, a few feet from the hotel, which has an excellent variety of food at reasonable prices and casual attire. We also ate at the Brazilian Steakhouse, Fogo de Chao, which is a 5-minute walk. If you have never tried a Brazilian Steakhouse, this is the world's most renowned chain. We even enjoyed milkshakes at Steak & Shake across the street. Damn good -- eat with a spoon -- you get a very large glass topped with whip cream and a cherry for $3.95. Tremendous bargain, and really, I was surprised how good they were. The Circle Center Mall is connected by a skyway. To be honest, nothing really special about this mall. Not even an Apple store inside. The mall was mostly dead, and nothing really caught my eye about it. Of course, all the hotels in the area connect to the Indianapolis Convention Center by a sky walkway. However, taking that walkway from the Omni to the Convention Center will waste 12 minutes of your life. A horribly, long haul that takes you through the mall and beside a parking garage. However, you can get to the convention center in 4 minutes if you simply walk outside and across South Illinois and South Capitol streets.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palo Alto, CA", "Title": "\u201cA first-class hotel\u201d", "Author": "FoodWallah", "ReviewID": "UR117540944", "Content": "The hotel is obviously managed well and is spotlessly clean.

First, the location of the hotel is great. It is connected by the skywalk to Circle Centre Mall, the convention center and several other hotels.

Price is $27/day with unlimited in/out privileges. There apparently is a self parking garage nearby that costs nearly as much without in/out privileges, so we used valet. Only left via car once and car was waiting for us when we got downstairs from our room. Our check in went without problems. Front desk staff was cordial and efficient. We were in our room within 15 minutes of walking in the front door. We had a two room suite. Room was a nice size. Living room area had a sofa sleeper, chairs, desk, nice size flat screen as well as a bar and in room snacks. Bedroom was a separate room with french doors between the two rooms. This room was also a nice size with a big screen TV. Bed linens were mostly comfortable-four king sized pillows provided. (See below.) Bathroom was more along the lines of a Holiday Inn bathroom...okay but not great. There were more bath amenities than Holiday Inn, though. We had a \"romance\" package for our reservation which included sparkling wine, truffles and breakfast (included \"valentinis.\") The sparkling wine and truffles were okay, not great. Breakfast at Severin Bar was very good with an omelet bar, Belgian waffle bar and lots of other options including meats, fresh fruits and cereals. Included valentinis were quite potent....stick with the mimosa. Check out was quick and efficient; no problems at all. My only complaint regarding this hotel was a cleaning issue. Our ice bucket had water from a previous guest's melted ice. Honestly, not a big issue as plastic liner was used and a new liner was provided. Two of the pillows (4 total) had a very bad smell....dirty, oily hair smell. The pillowcases themselves looked fine, but the smell was very strong. Either the pillowcases were not changed between guests or there is a problem with the pillows themselves. We didn't discover the problem until late so didn't call downstairs. We could use the other pillows provided. Other issue I had was there was a lot of street noise. We were on the 5th floor and had no problem hearing people/cars on the street below. There is also construction right next to the hotel. We didn't have any problems with construction noise over the weekend, but with the noise from normal activities being a problem, I would be concerned about the noise from construction.

Also, if you register for a frequent guest membership (which we did), morning coffee service (delivered to your door) and Internet are complimentary. The service was great. The staff was truly friendly and very helpful. Needless to say, Father's Day went great!

They had us down for a double bed room when my reservation and profie clearly stated it was supposed to be a king bed. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk they indicated that no king room was currently availble and that the only one that woudl be available was just below the floors being renovated. There was never a note on the website about this hotel being under construction and repairs. The front desk finally said they could upgrade us for a $50 fee but quickly changed their position when I calmly suggested that was not acceptable. To their credit, even though this room was not yet ready either, they did take our bags upstairs so we could go about our day. When we finally made it to our room we were pleased about the size fo the suite. With that said, the room itself was very tired. The televisions were very old (no plasma or LCD's), the carpet was torn in the some locations, and the bathroom was very small and just odd. The room was clean and large but that's about it. The air/ heat sysetm was also very loud and did not seem to do a very good job keeping the room at a constant temp.

It is right across the street from the bar that we rang in the new year at, Ike & Jonesy's, and the property is just gorgeous. When we checked in, we heard the celebration in the ballroom of a couple having their wedding party, and then were going to be married at midnight! The Omni is definitely a beautiful place to have a wedding if you are looking for a spot in Indy. The ballroom is so elegant, and the age of the hotel gives it a very unique and royal feel. The front desk and Severin Bar & Grille staff all had wonderful personalities. My last experience with the Omni in St Louis combined with this stay at the Omni in Indy has me convinced that the Omni really makes it a point to make excellent service the top priority when looking for talent to add to their teams. Our room was absolutely wonderful. The beds were very, very comfortable and spacious (it probably also helped that I'd been drinking :) ). But in all seriousness, I almost didn't want to leave the hotel because the room was that great. We brought our Wii with us also, so we were able to play video games after our night out, and there wasn't anything that I can say needed to be improved upon with the room. Breakfast in the morning was great. I am a bit of a biscuits & gravy connoisseur, and there aren't many that I've had that I give my approval on. The Severin B's & G's passed. The omelet station had a nice variety of toppings to choose from. There was plenty of fresh fruit, plus fruit & yogurt parfaits pre-made. Coffee was strong.... Just the way I like it. Seating was comfortable and roomy. Next time, I would like to try out the pool, and take a bit more of a tour so I can get more pictures. I do know that they are getting ready to start room renovations, so I will be excited to get back to check out what else they will do to make the already beautiful hotel even better. The location is perfect for folks coming to town for conventions, sporting events, families wanting to visit Indy, as well as anyone looking to walk around downtown and do some bar hopping and dancing.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. We checked in early and wanted our two rooms to be adjoining. They weren't ready yet, so they stored our luggage and called us as soon as the rooms were available (not necessary as we were at the state fair) which was within 30 minutes. Even if we had stayed nearby, it wasn't a long wait. The valet, porter, front desk, manager, head of housekeeping, engineering, and those who answered our calls were ALL involved in our stay and each one made sure we were satisfied even if it was beyond their control. We needed a cot for the second day of the trip and even though it was mentioned casually when the head of housekeeping stopped by to see if we needed anything (our door was open) ... it was there first thing in the morning. After checking out on our final day, I realized that I left my cellphone and a nintendo ds in the room. We called and within minutes it was waiting at the front desk. Because they are within a short walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium, it wasn't a stressful wait. One elevator was out of commission during our whole stay and the wait was up to 10 minutes for each trip .... I can't tell you how many people apologized for this and at one point, the manager waited with us and the next day, she walked my daughter up the stairs because she was in a hurry to get to the room The bolt lock between rooms wouldn't budge, but staff arrived immediately to resolve the problem. It had to be replaced, but it wasn't an inconvenience because we didn't need to close the door, once opened. It was repaired by the time we got back to the hotel the next afternoon. I agree with those who said the $27 is a lot to pay, we did park the car on the street for two days (it's very well-lit and there was no problem with crime). The hotel was very convenient to Lucas Stadium, the mall, and tons of restaurants. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. During the last day of our trip, we stayed in a 3-star hotel and it looked like a 1-star when my family compared it to the experience we just had. Sorry this is long, but it was one of our most enjoyable hotel stays (and we spend a lot of time in Disney hotels).", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macomb, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous\u201d", "Author": "greenbean9265", "ReviewID": "UR75645300", "Content": "Beautiful hotel.

And if you happen to be faciing some of the bars on a lower floor, don't expect to get a good night's sleep. This was my first experience with Omni and needless to say it was not a good one. When the hotel is renovated later this year, it will very likely be 4 diamond again. But as a seasoned traveler, I can tell you that this is not up to industry standard. For example, I am currently staying in a 3 star, new, Cambria Suites motel and for $50 less a night and free parking, it is so much nicer and cleaner. Like night and day! I even lost a lot of data on my laptop because of a power surge when I plugged it in to the wall outlet in the room! This never happened to me anywhere and it caused me a lot of stress. I have to take my hard drive to a Best Buy and hope they can recover some of the data. And the Internet didn't even work once I could boot up again!

The valet attendant pulled up with my vehicle and he got out leaving my driver door open. I open the back hatch a placed my bag inside and closed the back hatch went to the driver door, got in and drove away. On my way home I had to make a stop for a restroom break and when I opened my driver door to get out of the vehicle the door made a loud popping noise. I looked and seen that my driver door was hitting the front fender each time the door was opened and chipping the paint away. When I close the door there were no noises, it is only when the door gets opened and that would explain why the attendant left my driver door open. He didn't want me to notice something is wrong. Any other valet services that I have used in the past would always close my door to build heat in the winter and cool in the summer. So after I noticed this I immediately called the hotel to spoke to Mr. Barker at the valet department and he informed me that when I got home to take pictures of the vehicle and send them to him in a e-mail. When I got home I did just that...took the photos and e-mailed them to him that evening. I waited 2 weeks for a response and heard nothing. I called Mr. Barker and he informed he didn't get the e-mail (imagine that) he advised me to send it to him again but he didn't think that any thing could be done about it. I describe the attendant to him in the e-mail and described the damage that had been done just like Mr Barker had told me to do. Now all of a sudden there is \"nothing that can be done\".

They have very good rates compared to the local competition. Hotel is clean, beds comfy. Views were not the best, but its Indy afterall... Ordered room service breakfast one time, was quite tasty. If you sign up for their frequent stay program (free) then you get free wireless and 2 free beverages every morning. The housekeeping was inconsistent. Sometimes they'd bring cream with my morning coffee, sometimes not. Sometimes the local paper as requested, sometimes not. One evening at 6:30pm I returned to find the cleaning lady using my bathroom. She had turned down the bed and then decided to drop a bomb while she was there - nasty! I was not impressed. The rest of the staff was very nice, courteous and helpful. The location is very convenient. If you haven't been to Indy in a while, the downtown is quite nice and safe. There are many restaraunts and bars nearby, shopping too. Most buildings are linked with covered walkways so exposure to the elements is minimal. Do NOT rent a car unless you plan on going outside of the downtown core. Parking is $25 each day (not included in the room charge), but this is the cheapest downtown and it gives unlimited in/out access. The valet is slammed in the morning, expect to wait 15minutes or more for your car if at peak times (7am). Bus service to/from the airport is good and cheap ($7 express 15minute travel time). Buses throughout the rest of the city are pretty good, but run infrequently past 8pm. I did rent a car and turned it in a day later after hitting the outskirts a couple times for good restaraunts. After that, stayed downtown and enjoyed the food there. Overall, a positive stay at the Omni.

When asked if they had a room with two doubles, they did. Eventually the Front Desk Manager assigned us to a room with two doubles, but all the while she made derogatory comments about Hotwire and other third party reservation agents. When she lectured, strongly suggesting that in the future that I not try to save a \u201cfew dollars\u201d, but make direct reservations that allowed the hotel to accommodate us, I spoke up. I told the Front Desk Manager that I would use her name when responding to the Hotwire survey. Her attitude was \u201csnotty\u201d and argumentative. In the end, I felt that because I did not pay full rate, that she felt I did not have enough money to stay at the Omni. This is an absolute FIRST in all the years that I\u2019ve used Hotwire.

I can't speak much to the value of the hotel because my company paid for the room, but I can tell you it was a definitely a decent hotel. I feel like the other reviews on this hotel have been a little unfair. One thing though that is very important is before your stay, go to the Omni website and sign up to be a \"select guest\". It's free, you just have to plug in your info, and what it gets you is free wireless internet (normally they charge $10 a day I think) and free drinks and newspaper each day of your stay. Also, as a select guest you get to tell them your room preferences - smoking/non-smoking (I think all hotels should be non-smoking personally), near or far away from the elevators, high floor/low floor, king sized or 2 double beds, corner room, etc. This I found to be just awesome because I selected all of my preferred criteria and I got the top floor, furtherest from elevators, king sized bed and a corner room, so 5 windows overlooking the city - it was great. I strongly suggest that if you go with this hotel you sign up as a select guest, it makes sense. I found the hotel in general to be nice, the carpets were in need of a change, but I didn't really mind that so much. I had a broken window when I checked in but the staff promptly came up and fixed it. The treadmills in the work out room squeeked very loudly, I suggest the hotel looks into fixing that. It was so loud, if someone else were there (I was alone in the room) I would have stopped immediately because they would have grabbed their ears and ran out of the room.

The lobby is a 3 star but the restaurant prices are 4 star! The room is smaller than any 4 star hotel I have seen. It is dark and crowded. There is an archaic old CTV with basic channels.

Also for a 4 star hotel there is no wireless internet. These days 2-3 star hotels offer free internet. Overall a worthless place and will never place a 4 star for Indy on Hotwire.

The hotel had a decent sized gym. There was also a pool, but it was small and the area around the pool was not particularly attractive. The hotel has an attractive location. It is directly connected to a mall, which also contains many places to eat, as well as a movie theater and an arcade. There are also many bars and restaurants in the area.

Traveling for business, I usually send my materials ahead to the hotel where I am staying so that I do not have to carry them on the plane. For this trip, it was a small-to-medium sized box with 17 presentations inside. The Omni charged $10 to receive and hold the box for my arrival.

Valet service was extremely polite and very knowledgeable. Terry is awesome and gave us the best ideas on things to do!

We ate at St. Elmo's and Le Pepe, visited Memorial Circle and the surrounding areas as well as the Capital and the Union Station hotel across the street. All of these were in walking distance to the hotel so that is a huge bonus for us. The bed is by far the softest we've ever encountered in a hotel. We were given plenty of pillows and the down comforter was so warm that even with the balcony door open on a cool night we were hot! The King Suite has a nice living room area that was laid out very well along with a neat balcony. Our last night there was before some Supercross Event at the stadium so some kids were running up & down the hallways and stairs at 11 pm. We did call the front desk who did get security involved, although she seemed a little put out by our request.

My husband and I were getting away from our kids for a little R & R. Husband picked this hotel because of other reviews on this site. We booked through the hotel web site directly and got a government rate which made this hotel affordable to us on our tight budget. With the government rate we received free valet parking and free ($5.00 worth per person, each day) of food from the Starbucks located in the hotel. Husband signed up for the select guest program before making the reservation which gave us the bonus of robes to wear, turn-down service and two complementary drinks in the morning each day with a newspaper of choice. We were also given the options of picking hotel room area because of being a select guest. We requested a higher floor and away from elevators. We were given a room on the 12th floor. We also received a corner room, so we had windows on two sides of the building. We had a fantastic view of Indianapolis. Since we had a corner room, our room was probably larger than most rooms. It was very nicely decorated and the king size bed was very comfortable, especially if you like firm mattresses. The bathroom is very small and hard to maneuver in. It has a pedestal sink, so there is no room to put any of your personal hygiene items. Two people can not get ready at the same time in the bathroom. The bathroom door opens into the bathroom, so you have to close it to be able to stand in front of the sink to use the mirror. There is no fan, and since the bathroom is so small, it gets very steamy very fast. A curved shower curtain bar would be of great help to give more room in the shower, because it's a tight fit to shower (we are tall, skinny people). When we checked in, one light bulb was out in the bathroom and I thought the staff would replace it the next day, but they didn't. Not worth complaining about. The hotel is connected to Circle City Mall, so it's very useful to be able to walk through the mall to get to other areas in the city when it's so cold outside. We were able to walk just a couple of blocks outside to get to the ISO and to visit the Soldiers & Sailor's Monument Museum and btw there is a elevator that takes you up in the monument for 1.00 (we have lived in the area for 3 years and never knew you could go up in the monument!) They have a decent exercise room, which we used one morning and it was sufficient to what we use at our YMCA. It got quite crowded around 9a.m. on Saturday morning, so we were glad to have gotten there a little before that. They have a small pool area that we did not use, everyone said the water was warm. Our stay would have been perfect, except that there was some sort of convention in the area in which many, many, many teens had taken over the hotel. (Remember we were trying to get away from our two teens and our young one). For some reason on both Friday & Saturday night, teens were running around on the 12th floor making lots of noise. On Saturday night, husband called and requested that someone take care of it. In addition, Friday night one elevator was not working in the west tower, which is where we were, and we were late getting to our activity due to the waiting of an elevator. (we were on the 12th floor). Saturday, there was an elevator out in both the east and west tower. We had rushed ourselves to get to the lobby by the 12p.m. check out time and ended up waiting quite a bit on the west side for an elevator. After 10 minutes, we walked to the east tower and waited another 10 minutes, when the elevator opened, it was full of people. 2 more elevators came to the 12th floor and they also were full. I finally called to the front desk to tell them that we had been trying to get to the lobby for 1/2 hour to check out and couldn't get an elevator. We finally got an elevator and had to squeeze on with our luggage. It turns out that people had been waiting so long to get an elevator that was going down, that they started hopping on the elevator even if it was going up because they knew at some point it would go back down again, hence the reason it kept coming up to the 12th floor and it was full. When we finally got down to the front desk to check out. The staff had no idea that there was such a problem getting an elevator. (they knew that two of their elevators were out-they just didn't know that people were getting on when it was going up just to come back down again) I was confused why they (the hotel staff) weren't \"problem solving\" and maybe calling their guests to say that there was a problem with elevators and that they had extended check out time or putting an employee in each elevator to help control the flow of traffic. The whole lobby was filled with these teens and their groups all waiting for their transportation, it was a total mess. The gal checking us out said that she would call ahead and request our car for us. It still took 45 minutes for us to finally get our car. The whole process was total chaos and then on top of it, the gal trying to get our car couldn't figure out how to unlock the car properly and so the car alarm kept going off when she tried to start it, and instead of coming to get some help right away she kept trying to figure out. Finally someone came to get my husband to tell him what was going on and so my husband had to go and get his own car! The hotel offered us a free upgrade. I thought they were offering us a free night to try the hotel again, but they were only offering us a free upgrade on a room. This was disappointing because we do live in the area and I am just not sure if I could recommend the hotel again because I am not sure if this is norm for them or it was just a fluke because they couldn't handle all these teens that were in town.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cA disappointing stay...\u201d", "Author": "prechtc", "ReviewID": "UR23976904", "Content": "We have stayed at the Omni in the past by booking directly through the hotel and what a difference it makes to the quality of service.

We were very disappointed with the overtly rude service. If they do not want to accomodate third party bookings then they should not make rooms available on third party sites such as priceline. Another inconvenience was due to the fact that 2 of the elevators were not working and we finally had to resort to walking down 8 flights of dirty stairs since we couldn't wait any longer for the one working elevator. Also, we were charged for 3 days of valet parking even though we only stayed 2 nights. We got the extra day of valet refunded and were told they had charged everyone in the hotel for an extra day of valet (on accident). Hmmm....

Although attentiveness is often the norm with this caliber of hotel, the Omni Severin was a standout for the overall sincerity of its staff. From management to front desk personnel to wait staff to the valet team, their genuine interest in feedback and the proactive way they sought it out made us feel truly welcome and valued. My wife and I felt so engaged and were given such special consideration, particularly by Massey, the Food and Beverage Manager that we can't wait to come back even if just for the good will that their evident standard of true service inspired. Of course the rooms were clean and comfortable in the four star tradition in terms of d\u00e9cor and crisp, white sheets on a king sized bed and all the toiletries in a sizeable bathroom. And my wife certainly appreciated the walk-in closet complete with robes for two, but the Severin proved to offer a lot more than simply an ideal, pristine space to sleep. When my wife and I arrived for New Year\u2019s Eve dinner in the gorgeously ornate Severin Lobby and Ballroom, we felt even more pampered than we could have anticipated after check in. Worthy of particular notice is the chef, Anthony Armstrong, for his delicious French cuisine that was spotlighted at our NYE celebration. There was a warm sense of community among all the patrons as the emceed event included a short speech by Anthony regarding his sojourn among the French countryside and palate which we all savored heartily in both liquid and solid form. My favorites were the brie pastries with jam, though the entire meal was a formidable treat. Although we all got a small bottle of champagne with the meal, one miniscule suggestion would be to have included at least one complimentary glass of red or white wine with the dinner as it was French themed in the package. We'd of course have been willing to have paid more if added to the package total up front so we wouldn't have to worry about additional transactions later, but this was such a comparatively minor issue compared to the overall experience which was nothing short of spectacular. Before and after the meal, we enjoyed music and an open bar in the ballroom which was an elegant, gorgeous venue for the traditional New Year\u2019s Eve countdown. Although the ambiance was thankfully a far cry from the cramped and noisy club and DJ scene we had already grown tired of, the Severin did add some trendy twists with a m\u00e9lange of Franco-American movies on widescreen accompanied by a musical guitar/bongo duo playing classic rock fare in offbeat lounge renditions. Occasionally, I\u2019d hear the first half of a soulful acoustic ballad only to realize later we were listening to none other than Jimi Hendrix\u2019s All Along the Watchtower so the hotel entertainment staff deserves kudos for some courageous yet original choices that probably would have struck fear in the hearts of less dynamic hotels. So we counted down to the New Year with more complimentary champagne, more music, good company, party favors, even a garter belt lottery for a free trip to Vegas and by the time 2009 was in its early stages we were ready to head back to our comfy room. The next morning, also included, was a buffet breakfast in the Hot Tuna restaurant. I suppose the Severin could have settled for a standard buffet or continental breakfast with the package, but the spread was replete with fresh fruit, unimaginably light and sweet pastries, bagels, cereal, cheeses, cold cuts, and all the hot breakfast items including personalized omelets which you must absolutely try with the spiced, ground sausage if you are so prone. After being more than sated in the belly, the checkout was so fast and effortless with the pleasant last impressions rivaled only by the first, we started asking ourselves why in the heck we were leaving anyway.

I definitely felt this impacted the stay, there should be a better rate offered for hotel guests. Honestly, I am a big fan of Kimpton Hotels, because they deliver on bang for buck.

They promised that an engineer would come and fix it, and someone did show up promptly. The bigger problem was that our room for two people was barely large enough for one. We had one queen bed which took up most of the room. We were tripping over each other just moving around in the room. You could hardly open the door unless the bathroom door was closed. You couldn't close the closet door because the hangers would stick out. The vanity was all but nonexistent with little to no room for our things. I requested a king room but because we booked with Priceline they couldn't guarantee that, and we didn't get it. The hotel is at a wonderful location, just a couple of blocks from some fabulous restaurants and it adjoins the Circle Center Mall. The Sunday Brunch, although pricy, was beautiiful and the staff there was courteous and friendly as well.

The actual conference was in the convention center. If you're booking a conference and plan on having your staff stay at the Severin, please note that it's about a 10 to 15 minute walk from the conference enter. Depending on the time of year, that could be a pretty uncomfortable journey. The hotel is located across from Union Station, right downtown, near the RCA Dome and the new Lucas Oil Stadium. The lobby is very nice, with a reasonable restaurant that serves a good variety of food at the regular high hotel prices. There is a bar located just off the lobby as well. There is also a coffee shop just off the lobby that was a nice selection of items. There is no self parking for this hotel so be prepared to pay $25/night to valet park, or park a block or two away at a public garage. The Indy downtown is great - clean - safe with lots of restaurants, bars, and a large mall. There are a number of major hotels downtown, including Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt. The room was average sized with a comfortable bed, an average bathroom, a desk area, and a couch chair. It includes a ironing board and coffee maker. It does not include a safe. The bathroom was average - not updated, but clean. Little shelf space and a toilet that required two or three flushes to \"do its job\" despite seemingly sending hundreds of gallons of water swooshing down the pipes. The shower was older, without the new curved rods that give you more head room. There was some mold in the tile. The carpet was a bit worn, had some wrinkles in it, and the chair cushion was a bit torn and faded. The alarm clock was an older model that used colored buttons to indicate buzzer or radio rather than the newer LCD radios. But it worked fine. The hotel is fairly quiet without a lot of street noise and you don't really hear people walking around much. Oddly, there was a recurring whining sound from the elevator mechanism. I say that it was odd because I was located a good 10 or 12 rooms away from the elevator. But I guess the elevator is mounted in a way that it resonates sound across many rooms. Also, the A/C unit performed well, but was very loud, and would turn on with a loud \"clunk!\". There is wireless Internet for $9.95/day - but if you join the Omni Frequent Points program, it's free - and it's a good, fast connection. The staff is helpful and friendly - no issues there. House cleaning did a good job, but they didn't usually get to the rooms until later in the day. As noted in a previous review, there are two elevators and if you try to head up or down during a busy time, prepare to wait a while for one. The 13th floor is labeled PH for Penthouse, but according to one person staying on that floor, it's no different than other floors. In general, an adequate hotel that's clean, but a bit long in the tooth. It's a solid 3 diamond hotel.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cA dream Wedding Reception & package\u201d", "Author": "NYstephB", "ReviewID": "UR14306769", "Content": "The Omni offered everything we were looking for in a wedding reception and even more.

Easy access to mall via skywalk. Friendly staff. Restaurants around town were hard to get into (1-2 hr wait for each). We ended up eating in the food court of the mall. Walls in the hotel rooms are very thin making it a restless night. I have nothing good to say about the elevators in this hotel. We waited about 10-15 minutes just for the elevator to come to our floor to open. Whenever it stopped and the doors would open, it would be full.

If the weather is good, and you are going to the RCA Dome or the Convention Center, it is much quicker to just go out the front doors and walk the block to either.

The rate was pretty good at $199 a night, however 2 days before our stay I noticed a newly available $149 rate. I called the Omni & they kindly changed my reswervation to the $149 rate! On our arrival, we were immediately impressed with the location (in the heart of downtown) & with the lobby. Lots of old world elegance! The staff immediately noticed our 2 young children & promptly brought out an Omni Sensational Kids backpack for them. It was made of cardboard so certainly not durable, but it was full of fun trinkets & the kids felt super special! A table in the lobby had a nice spread of cookies & brownies & hot cider & coffee. The room was more than we expected- pretty spacious, very clean, nicely decorated. The beds were amazingly comfortable! TV reception was not so good on a few channels & there weren't very many channels to choose from, but we wouldn't be in the room much anyway. 2 luxurious robes in the closet were a real treat after showering. Water pressure in the shower was great as was the temp. Could have used more counter space in the bathroom, but we managed. The pool is fairly small & there was no hot tub, but perhaps this is standard in an older building. We have been to too many hotels with freezing pool water & were relieved to find Omni's pool temp was perfect. The fitness facilty looked nice but we had no time to use it. Our $149 rate included coupons for a discount if we had breakfast at the hotel. The 1st morning we went to the small cafe called 40 West. Pretty disappointing...the staff was not helpful, the selections were minimal, the environment was a bit chaoitic. The next morning, we tried the Sunday buffet in the nicer lobby restaurant (don't recall the name). It was fantastic! I even recommend the buffet to our friends that live in Indy. The highlight (for me anyway!) was the turndown service. In addition to turned down beds with chocolates on the pillows, they had turned on the \"Relaxation\" channel on the TV so calming music filled the room. As if that wasn't enough, they had filled the ice bucket with ice & 2 jugs of milk and there were chocolate chip cookies too. WOW!

Foremost, the staff is very customer oriented and they go out of their way to please. The valet staff was plentiful and there was never a wait for my car to be taken or delivered. Room service was fast and efficient even after 10 pm. My room was always made up perfectly; fresh sheets on the beds without requiring a special request and evening turn down. Although the Luxe was some sort of motel in its former life, this is only evident in the hallways. The public spaces and guest rooms are very chic and decorated in soothing natural colors. Standard rooms are not huge, but the size is adequate. Rooms in the main building have balconies where you can sit outside and watch the birds in the foliage, a rarity in LA. The location is adjacent to the 405 freeway, but traffic noise is not a problem inside the rooms. The main negative was that construction was continuing on the 405 and there were detours on Sunset which were inconvenient.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Tennessee, United States", "Title": "\u201cMy Favorite Hotel in LA!\u201d", "Author": "SXSMOM", "ReviewID": "UR127321522", "Content": "Every time I travel to LA on one of my business trips, I stay at the Luxe on Sunset.

From the moment we arrived we were completely impressed by the amenities and the incredible staff. We travel a lot for business and it's always great to see an establishment that reinforces the importance of a guests' experience through the professionalism of their staff. We had a great room up on the spa level with a semi private terrace with a long range view looking south east. Beautiful linens, wonderfully comfortable bed, comfy sitting area and a fantastic well appointed bathroom with double granite sinks, bathtub and a separate large glass shower enclosure. Plush robes and towels and an abundance of high quality toiletries were placed throughout the bathroom. Other hotels in the L.A. area charge 2 to 3 times more for this level of luxury and I truly believe this gives the Luxe an edge on an extremely competitive business in this town. I was in and out all day long and never waited more than 60 seconds for my car as their valet staff is always properly staffed with more than required number to be ready for rushes that can occur at any moment especially when there is daytime event at the hotel. The bar and restaurant are also very well appointed and as usual, staffed with top notch personnel and the food was sumptuous. We didn't get a chance to enjoy the spa but the pool area was very well located with lots foliage and south of France style cabanas for when you need to get out of the sun.

It was still there even after i complained - Shortage of toilet paper, shower gel, soap etc.. - I was opting for the green option of not changing my bed sheets daily, but everytime i got into bed, i would find fallen hair of mine, cereal i had dropped etc.. they were just covering the bed and not even dusting it - i was staying in a room with a connecting door where i could hear what the couple was saying, watching, drinking (i could smell the coffee!!). After asking management to try and keep the room empty (i was suffering from a severe jetlag and desperately needed my sleep), i was surprised to find another couple being checked in there - Housekeeping talking loudly to each other at crazy early hours..i'm talking 5-6 am!! - Receiving an opened half eaten jar of mayo with my room service meal (meal was dropped from my bill) - My stuff were not being fixed or placed in their place..everything was left the way it was.

Before leaving the hotel at night request a plan for your re-entrance as the roads are all blocked with police guards who in our case, were unaware that the entrance to the hotel had been entirely blocked on Sunset Blvd. and in fact were unaware a hotel even existed in the restricted area.

We thought the location was terrible, not close to any of the usual tourist attractions or anything other than the highway, and not in an area conducive to walking. The hotel was bordered by the highway and construction, nothing else. The rooms are located on two different sites, connected by a very steep hill. The female who checked us in seemed friendly but failed to notify us that our rooms were up the steep hill and that we would have to lug our bags up and down stairs to get to our rooms. In fact, a male at the desk initially told us to lug our bags up the stair of the building were we checked in and, only when another worker we encountered informed us that we were in the wrong building were we informed that there was more than one building location. No one explained that there were shuttles between the buildings or gave us any useful information. When we finally found our rooms, we were pleasantly surprised with the size of the room with the two double beds. The room with the king was much smaller but still nice. The beds were comfortable but had minimum pillows. Robes and slippers were provided. The bathrooms were spacious but one of the rooms still had half full wine glass from the prior guest beside the jacuzzi tub so we were very concerned about the actual cleanliness of the room. We found that the only friendly and informative staff were the valet/shuttle workers and the two bartenders we met in the lobby bar. They were a joy to be around. The entire front desk staff, and particularly the males, were very snooty (the females much friendlier but failed to give complete information.) My husband requested assistance from a male at the front desk and was assured that help would be coming. No such thing. The \"business office\" was awful. The computers were slow and the printer did not initially work. It was only after requesting help several times that we were finally able to access and print our boarding passes.

The General Manager, Reginald Archambault, seen defending the hotel in numerous posts on TripAdvisor, was not at the property when I inquired. I also can echo comments made by other guests that the location is extremely convenient if your plans include visits to the Getty Center or Bel Air, Beverly Hills or Hollywood. The valet service, while expensive and your only parking option, was very efficient and courteous. The housekeeping was generally very good although they frequently left all of the lights on in the room (not our problem but not very energy conscious). In general, the staff at the front desk was well-intentioned. Having said all of the foregoing, I can think of no circumstance where I would recommend to anyone that they stay in this hotel. First off, the structure is poorly suited physically to be a luxury hotel. We were told by hotel staff that the property started life as student housing for UCLA in the 1950s. As noted by others, the rooms are contained in two unconnected, two-storey buildings separated by a steep hill others have estimated as being 200 meters. The front desk, underground parking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business center\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, restaurant and some guest rooms are located in the lower building while the balance of the guest rooms, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gym\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, pool and spa are located at the upper building. As other reviewers have noted, the walls apparently are paper thin as you can hear your neighbors talking, coughing and using their toilets. Upon checking in, we elected to avail ourselves of an upgrade to an Executive Suite for an additional $40 per night. The room was larger as was the bathroom with a double sink; however, the bed was immediately in front of the door allowing any passerby a view of the occupied bed if the door was opened which would make most women, in particular, quite uncomfortable. There was a seating area located in an alcove in the room but there was a pillar in the middle of it suggesting that perhaps the area, at one time, had been part of another room or an outside patio that had been enclosed. The bathroom lacked sufficient counter space and had only a single towel bar. There was a single rather than a double connecting door with the next room. For room security, rather than the common swinging latch seen in most hotels these days, there was an old fashioned chain lock but only a single screw held the mounting in place on the door frame. Also, in the hallway leading to our room, a service door to the outside was repeatedly left ajar further adding to one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sense of insecurity. One morning a roach appeared on the bed (fortunately, no bed bugs). After killing it, I showed it to management whose defense was that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a roach but wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sure what kind of bug it was. We were also told that when it rains, insects find their way into the rooms. My view is that this would not be the case if (a) the sliding glass doors in the rooms were properly fitted and (b) the hotel had regular service from an exterminator. There were repeated problems with hot water in the shower. On two days, only one of us could take a shower as the hot water ran out. On another occasion, the water kept getting hotter and hotter suggesting that there was no scald protection in the plumbing fixture. In addition, at all times, there was weak water pressure. On two of the four days of our stay, there was no paper delivered to the room. They \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ran out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The entrance to the hotel restaurant is a sliding glass door leading from an outside courtyard. The restaurant is effectively \u00e2\u20ac\u0153land locked\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with no interior entrance for guests (inconvenient to uncomfortable if it is raining or cold outside). The floors are uneven in both the rooms and in the restaurant. The sliding glass doors in both leaked when it rained. One restaurant patron complained his feet were getting wet because he was seated near the windows. Workers from the hotel put up a makeshift barrier outside of our room by placing a sheet of plastic film along the sliding glass doors and pinned it in place by moving the plastic patio chairs close to the doors. The carpeting in our room appeared to have been recently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153restored\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (but still stained) following likely flooding from torrential rains in Southern California the previous week. Further evidence of poor attention to detail was the fact that light fixtures, a/c vents, mirrors, etc. were rarely level or square. The workout room or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gym\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was located in a converted small guest room with limited equipment. The walk up the hill on several cool mornings was quite \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brisk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business center\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was the size of a modest, windowless closet where one of the two computers available was out of service during our entire four day stay. Finally, for breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant, I found that the milk on my cereal had soured and curdled. Because the regular coffee was awful, I ordered a latte but the milk in it had also gone sour. Both items were readily replaced by the attentive wait staff.

We also did not have time to try the restaurant but we did settle in for some cocktails one evening. The hotel staff was always very attentive and the decor was beautiful. The lushness of the landscaping was tranquil to us and we enjoyed driving in each night after working all day to this pretty place. Very relaxing and had good night's sleep. I travel with a small electric air diffuser anyway, so if there is any noice around I rarely hear it wherever I go. This place feels like a healthy place. The night we checked into the hotel , there were about 200 people in line to get their cars from valet, ended up it was a local fundraiser in the Brentwood area. A lovely group of people to see , all dressed so nicely, it was exciting for us to see this as we had been traveling airports all day. . We suppose the area residents choose this hotel for their own out of town guests. I think Valet parking was 30 dollars a day . I just kept a bunch of $5. bills handy for tips when valet brought our rental car around and to leave on the bed for housekeeping each morning.

The hotel willingly drive you to local places ie Brentwood which was a really big help because we were without a car for a day. Front desk staff are great and are extremely helpful. Restaurant is good although a little pricey. Our room was gorgeous with so much space. We had a big enough fridge in the room to put in our own snacks we had bought each day. The walls are thin and yes we could hear a child crying a 1 point but it really wasn't as bad as I was expecting and didn't disturb us. Our room was opposite the swimming pool although we couldn't see the swimming pool because of the hedges! However, we were hardly in the room in the day! Loved the fact the swimming pool was warm - BIG PLUS! I admit I can be a bit of a snob at times and my husband regularly says I have OCD! Nevertheless this would not stop me from staying here again! If there is one thing the hotel falls down on its charging for valet service EVERY day. Because of the location of the hotel, you need a car and it is a bit mean not to offer free parking or some sort of deal for those staying over 2days. However, having already read the comments on this website we were prepared for it. Its about $25 a day. A bit steep, but we didn't let it spoil our stay.

I mean everything, from them going in and out of their room, to what temperature they wanted the thermostat at, to what drink they were going to make and lastly, to their intimate night together. Needless to say, I did not get any sleep the night before the most important day of my life. As a bride, I was expecting to get a full nights rest so I could be alert and ready for my wedding. Mind you, I don't have problems sleeping. I can sleep through some noise but this was ridiculous. And when one of my bridesmaids went to complain, they tried arguing with her and making up excuses. What kind of customer service is that?! Unfortunately, the groom and I planned to stay there the night of our wedding as well. While the room was better, we could still here kids running up and down the halls early in the morning, as if there were no walls separately us.

I recently stayed there and everything was a DISASTER. Where do I start? 1) When I asked the valet for a ticket, I was told \"I gave you one yesterday\". I told the guy that was impossible since it was my first time at the hotel. I finally asked the guy if this was a joke and then he said that he had mixed me up with someone else. 2) The acutal check-in/taking of my credit card was quick. However, getting to my room was a nightmare. I was sent to a room where there was a rag and large commercial fan on the floor. I called the front desk and an employee came to the room. She stated \"not again, this happened yesterday\". She said I couldn't stay in the room because the carpet was wet. It took 20 minutes back and forth with the front desk to finally get transferred to another room. First, I was told someone was bringing me new keys. Then I was told, to go down and get the keys. Then someone called back and said they were coming up. Each time it was a different person. Talk about a lack of communication. Finally, someone came up with new keys but he was dumb enough to ask \"so what's wrong with this room. I opened the door wide open and he said \"oh\".... 3) Room service is overpriced and BLAND. Also the hotel does not list the room service charges and service charge prices. I travel for business and pleasure frequently and this is the first time I have never seen this information published. The server forgot my receipt. He said that he would be right back. Of course, he never came back. I had to call the front desk in order to get a receipt for my expenses. 4) My blow dryer was broken! 5) I went downstairs for a conference. They had switched the room location. I asked a guy if he knew where my meeting was being held and said yes and pointed me in the WRONG direction. 6) I explained all of the issues with my stay with the director of guest services. I was so frustrated that I thought someone should know. He comp'd my room charge which wasn't my intent since I was traveling on business. I simply wanted someone to know all the headaches that I had to deal with during my stay. He also granted me late checkout. Interestingly enough, he didn't communicate this to anyone or put notes in the system. First, the front desk called me and asked when I was planning to checkout of my room since no notes were in the system for late checkout. Second, when I checked out of my room, the charges were still on the bill and they had to track the director down. Third, the director kept apologizing and promised that he would send me an email detailing our conversation and providing me with his contact information in case I need anything in the future. It's been five days and no email. I'm sure though that the General Manager will see my review on tripadvsior and all of a sudden want to comment on my stay...

Two cautions. One, if you are noise sensitive request a non-adjoining room. Our room had a connecting door to the room next door and I swear we could hear literally everything going on next door. We found our neighbours amusing though so it wasn't a problem but I could see this being a massive irritant with either different neighbours or if you hate noise.

There are lots of good things to say about this hotel. When we first arrived, we were told that we'd been upgraded from a King to a \"junior executive suite\" -- which isn't really a suite (no extra additional room) but just has an extra alcove with a sitting area. At any rate, the room was huge and very tastefully decorated. We also got free parking & free breakfast passes for each day we were there. Although the breakfast passes said they were only good for the continental breakfast (which was gross), the second day we were told that we could actually just use the passes as a credit towards other stuff on the menu. So the second day we had a much better breakfast and it was free -- yay! At first blush, we were feeling pretty good about the place. We found all the people working there to be very friendly and helpful. No complaints whatsoever. Fast forward to the evening. First of all, the mattress is SUPER firm. So every time my husband would move, even the teeniest bit, the whole bed would shake. That would have woken me up numerous times, had I been asleep... but the walls are so freaking thin that sleep was not happening for us. (our daughter was trying to sleep on the rollaway bed they brought in). The people next door played their TV for what seemed like all night. I don't think they even had the volume on all that loud, but it kept us up. And of course the idiotic drunken revellers stumbling down the hall at god knows what time ... very loud, too. One other thing to note is that if you are staying in the upper building, where the pool, spa, etc. are -- there is no walkway or stairs between the upper building and the lower building (where the restaurant is). You have to walk down a steep street that has about a foot-wide \"pedestrian lane\" but it's a blind curve and there are crazy cab drivers careening around the corner. We didn't feel safe walking this path with our six-year-old, so we had to rely on the shuttle which was kind of annoying since it's actually not all that far; it seemed to silly to have to get a ride to and from the main building but that was the only safe way to do it.

Miriam at housekeeping (yes I wrote down her name, she was that good) knew exactly what I was talking about when I called and said \"the battery in my safe has died\" and I got speedy battery replacement that AM and again in the PM when the new battery seemed not to be working so well.

Front desk staff are friendly and helpful in sending faxes and printing things. The restaurant and lounge downstairs seem nice but I haven't really used them, nor have I visit the spa. There are spas at 50 meter intervals in most of West LA, I see no particular reason to use Luxe's spa and pay more for what are very basic services - a manicure, for example. Things that might disappoint the business traveler: The business center is a hot, stuffy closet with a few computers in it. You cannot print there, but you must send your docs to reception or take them over on a USB to print. Not too inconvenient, if you are staying in the same building. If you are in the upper part of the hotel, this might be annoying. The one time I emailed docs to the front desk, they printed them and ran them up and slid them under my door! This hotel is valet parking only, at around $27/day. The hotel is not in walking distance of anything, so if you do not feel like driving or cabbing it after a long day at work, your eating options would be the restaurant downstairs or room service. Both have nice menus, but I haven't tried the food. Oh and ladies, don't come here thinking you don't need to bring bath products.

The breakfast menu is wonderful and it was too tempting to add side orders to our standard continental. We also ate several times at the bar and restaurant and the food is of a high standard, we especially enjoyed the Dine LA special menu with duck. The outdoor pool was very well heated and since temperatures reached 80\u00c2\u00b0F during our stay we profited from it and spent several hours lounging around in pure bliss. Remember that this was in January! The hotel is split into two levels, we were in the upper part. The hill is steep, like some people have already pointed out, but if you can't walk for 2 minutes then you can use the hotel transport, so it's not an issue.

As we frequently travel with our small dog on business we were pleased at their \"open dog\" policy and had no complaints about how we were treated. We booked a Junior Suite (a large room with a seating area - no doors in between). The room was comfortable and had an open sliding door to a grassy area outside - perfect for walking the dog and relaxing outdoors. Rooms and grounds appear well maintained. Service was enthusiastic and very polite, but somewhat spotty - our bags took about an hour to arrive from the main lobby. Wireless internet - there is no wired internet - is spotty and cannot totally be relied upon. There are two main problems with the hotel. The first is that it is located up a steep hill right off of Sunset Blvd. This means that joggers and dog-walkers will have a hard time. We drove about a half mile to a less trafficked area for exercise. The second problem is that the hotel is on two separate levels, separated by quite a bit of steep hill. The main lobby and some rooms are located in the lower level. Another set of rooms, including ours, and the spa are located at an upper level. The only connection between levels is walking up and down the hill on a road, waiting for a sporadic hotel shuttle ride or driving up and down and having the valets handle your car. As we had a lot of business to do at the lower level - we were interviewing prospective staff in the hotel bar and restaurant areas - we found this very inconvenient. On the positive side, location is excellent for driving. The hotel is one minute from the 405 freeway and quite near some excellent parks - including the little known but lovely Will Rogers State Park.

My wife and I were in town last weekend to attend the Genesis concert at the Hollywood Bowl with clients, so I was looking for something close to the Wilshire Park N' Ride for concert purposes, and also near the Getty Center, where we had lunch the next day. The Luxe (and the Angelino next door) fit the bill, but having had a so-so experience at the latter, I decided to give the Luxe a shot. I will say that things started out a little rocky. We had a \"car/room package\" and I had trouble getting the hotel reservations department to respond to my inquiries for confirmation and pickup of the car. After too much effort on my part, things were finally sorted out the day prior to my arrival. (General Manager-this is the one department that needs to get it's act together!) Arriving on Sunset Boulevard, a tiny sign--easily missed--in front of an equally well-concealed driveway, leads uphill to an pull-through entry court for valet parking. Clearly, this is NOT \"The Peninsula,\" however, they have done a decent job updating an old but spacious facility. Like other reviewers, I do think they could use a bit more \"polish on the apple\"--this was an \"IKEA quality\" re-do, not \"Roche-Bobois;\" although that is clearly the look they are going for. The lobby and entry areas look very promising, with nice decor and lighting. Very chic. But how about replacing the old steel room doors, mouldings, and bathroom fixtures? These have a \"patina\" of use that draws attention to what hasn't been updated. The long and overly dark hallways to the rooms are trying for a \"cool attitude,\" but really come off as long and overly dark. That is a shame because all of these things consprire to cheapen an otherwise stylish decor. The biggest issue I have with this hotel is in the details; for example: it's nice idea to have HD flat screens mounted on the walls...but there isn't an HD signal coming to them so every channel looks distorted due to the expanded aspect ratio of the flat screens...springing for HD service would solve that. Our room had an ill-fitted front door that would not close tightly, letting in lots of noise from the hallways. Walls, as others have mentioned, are a bit thin but noise from adjacent rooms is not that obtrusive. That being said, all the basic ingredients for success are present: the rooms have lovely new carpeting, nice decor, good bedding, decent baths, and are huge! The grounds and common areas, especially the outdoor seating areas for the lounge and restaurant, are lovely. One would not realize the 405 is 200 feet away unless on the fringes of the property. The valet parking was very responsive and at $22 is well below the rate for most hotels in L.A. (As for those who've quibbled about tipping the valets repeatedly...go stay at a Motel 6, for god's sake!) This is is L.A. get over it. I practically had to stuff money in their hands as it was; they all seemed reluctant to accept a tip. The restaurant is small but well-appointed. We had good service and a leisurely breakfast there, although the kitchen did not seem to know what eggs \"over easy\" are supposed to look like. Prices are reasonable for Los Angeles. The true highlight here is the staff, which from the front to the back of the house, were absolutely warm, gracious, and helpful. No L.A. attitude here. We arrived a bit early and were offered a complimentary glass of wine while waiting for our room to be checked by the housekeeping supervisor. No less than 3 people called or came by the room to be sure everything was in order. A welcome bag of dried fruit and nuts in the room from the marketing director was a nice touch...it will score her some future business for sure! I really do intend this as a very positive review. For the location, price, and quality, you'd be hard pressed to touch this elsewhere in L.A. Unfortunately, it's easy to nit-pick the Luxe, because SO much is right that you know a little more money and work invested in the facilities would make this place even finer. Sure, it's not a 5 star, but you're treated like a 5 star guest. The low-key, elegant surroundings have such a private, \"clubby\" feel, that you forget the bargain rates and come to expect everything to actually BE 5 star quality. That's how good it is. In the $200-$350 price range in Los Angeles, the location and overall experience simply cannot be beaten.

As per the previous review we thought $22 parking was enough and didn't tip and we were never treated rudely, the valet were alwasy friendly and we never waited long for the car. Although the room service menu isn't huge the food is nice and reasonably priced. They have a room service menu, and in restaurant menu and a poolside menu - loved getting food and drinks by the pool. The pool area was just really nice and relaxing, never too busy we always got a bed. They refresh the towels several times during the day. The pool is heated so is a nice temperature no matter what time of day and have nice music playing up there (not loud). There is a steep walk to get to the pool from the front of the hotel but they have a golf cart giving rides to and from the pool for those who don't want to walk. They also have a tennis court and provide rackets and balls. Our room was just the basic room and was very big and roomy. The beds were extremely comfortable and had plenty of pillows. The rooms are just decorated really nicely nad browns and beiges and nice pictures of shells. There is a flat screen TV with cable. They also provide free wifi throughout the hotel, as well as having and \"business centre\" where you can use computers and printers free of charge. The bathroom was very nice and also roomy. The rooms are kept extremely clean and housekeeping came through everyday. Our room on our first stay was located above the valter parking area but never had a problem with noise of cars or people. The hotel is located on Sunset Blvd, on the border of Brentwood which is an extremely upscale neighbourhood (mostly gated streets). The neighbourhood is extremely safe to walk through and we regularly took walks to the local shops (called Brent-Air) for milk and such. One time Jennifer Garner was there while we were getting some dinner! (Also, staying at the hotel was Sopranos and Bad Boys actor Joe Pantoliano). The hotel is located directly off the 405 freeway and although it is very close, we could never hear any traffic noise at all. Being close to the 405 means is it very easy access to where you want to go. The hotel is located about a 10 minute drive to Beverly Hills to the east and about 10 minutes west to Pacific Coast Hwy in Santa Monica. It is in a excellent, safe location and would definately stay here on our next trip to LA (if only we could afford to live in Brentwood we would!). We cannot say enough positive things about the Luxe. On average the hotel was about $200US per night and was well worth the money for the area.

I was told I would be driven up, as I was very tired, but when I went to go get the \"shuttle,\" I was told I would have to drive myself up. (My husband and I arrived separately). On the upper level, there was only valet parking, which was fine, but I should have been told that. Also, the parking level was on the third floor, and my room, on the fourth floor . There was no elevator. (I was not told this either). I had to carry my computer and a heavy bag upstairs myself. I had asked for a room with queen beds, and was told there were not any, which I believe was not true. The next day I left in the early morning and returned in a couple of hours. (I had requested and had been given late check-out). I went to sleep. Twice, hotel employees attempted to enter my room, although there was a Privacy hanger placed on the door. Both times, my room door was opened, but the person could not enter since the door was chained. The staff did not respect the sign and the hotel had failed to advise staff members of the late check-out. After complaining, more than once, the hotel made a partial adjustment on the bill. The hotel is beautiful and new, but we were very disappointed with the poor service and bad treatment on the part of the staff.

Our stay at the Luxe Bel-Air made our trip very relaxing and comforting. We had a king room overlooking the front drive, in the lower building. Furniture and decor was very \"West Elm\" or \"Bo Concept\" style. Giant, comfy bed, about a dozen pillows, white-chocolate brown-chrome color scheme, sleek \"iPod dock style\" alarm clock, flat screen TV. Did not hear street noise. I'm very familiar with LA, and even though I don't like Bev Hills or Bel Air at all, this was a great location - Spitting distance to the freeway. Hotel is right next to UCLA-Westwood and halfway between Beaches and Melrose-WeHo-Farmer's Market-Museum areas. Also, reasonable drive to the Valley. Service was always kind and responsive. Front desk staff was always friendly, if not incredibly knowledgeable about local dining recos. (They all seemed new or not from area.) We always got our car from the valet within 5 minutes. No one had their \"hand out\". The hotel is on a hill, so one building is up a steep hill. We always found valets to take us up to pool area at upper building via golf cart if we didn't feel like walking it. One afternoon, 7 of my local relatives came over (4 little kids, 3 adults) so the kids could swim and eat lunch, and the hotel staff were very gracious. No one questioned whether the kids were guests, etc. One valet even gave the kids a zig-zag \"Disney tram ride\" on the golf cart to and from pool. Prompt response to request for extra towels. Service in restaurant was friendly but slow, esp when you have four hungry, wet kids with you who just want chocolate milk, hot dogs, fries and burgers! (Otherwise service for breakfast was very prompt, esp one morning we told them we were in a hurry.) We booked through Expedia, and did not get the breakfast-included plan, so we did not pay \"top dollar\", but it was still above our usual lodging budget. Plus, they charge you $22-night mandatory valet parking! Yikes, But, considering the circumstances, I do not regret our decision. Our only complaints were the mandatory parking charges, the bathroom needed more towel hooks (a common deficiency in hotels all over, I notice), and a teeny-tiny closet. P.S.

Lots of doors slamming, loud voices etc. While the room was clean, comfortable and well decorated. Finding things as simple as a light swtich was a chore, the maid had turned down the bed and turned on a number lights none of which worked with a wall switch. Lack of convenient plugs to charge a cell phone or laptop shows the age of the original construction. The attention to detail to such things as no shampoo or lotion in the bathroom, a remote control that was inoperative, all of which can be rectified with a quick phone call to housekeepking but really shouldn't be nescessary at this level of a facility. The bathroom lighting was not well suited for a bathroom difficult to see to shave, and would have been awful for applying make up if I had my wife with me. Nice marble in the shower but a motel 6 shower head that was not high enough for a 6' tall person. They do have excellent wireless internet, which was free (as it should be). Surprised to not find a daily newspaper at my door although they claim to offer it on their website (again attention to detail).

It was amazing. We tried pushing our flight ahead just to stay longer. From the second you pull up and they open your car door, till you check out and they close your car door, the experience is perfect. We booked a suite, and it turned out to be pretty sweet. The room was equipped with a well stocked mini-bar, baskets of snacks, wines, an i-pod docking station that also recharges your i-pod, a flat screen tv with many new movies to choose from, and a 2 silky robes. Also, we had a nice living area to sit in, along with an enormous bathroom, containing a jacuzzi tub, all glass shower, two sinks, and a phone next to the toilet (which was nice to use while trying to push the flight later). The bed were extremely comfortable, and the ac made little or no noise throughout the night. The only noise, however, came from two rude guests along with there 2 rude children who found it funny to be yelling in the hallway at 12 o'clock am about nonsense. But that's not the hotels fault now is it. The pool area was amazing, which towels rolled up on each sun chair, and the water being crystal clear. We ordered some lunch by the pool, including crab cakes and salads which was perfect. I also ended up ordering a steak burger that came out great. The food arrived to the pool in under 15 minutes. Now our room was room 136, which was four rooms away from the front desk. The pool area, which is surrounded by more rooms, is located about 500 feet away on top of a hill. You can either walk, run it, or they'll be more than happy to shuttle you up in a limo golf cart. I would recommend a room down below in the first building, were we stayed, since everything was right there. Its about 500 feet of the highway, so quick access on and off. Also it's minutes from Beverly Hills and Hollywood. We also enjoyed facials at the \"Zen styled\" spa up on the hill by the room. They ran $135.00 per facial, which lasted one hour. Honestly, was it worth $135.00 you may ask? No. But I am a guy, and i think women have more of a love for those types of things. My better half booked it. It was relaxing tho. Overall, the stay was amazing, and I plan on returning very soon. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to really relax and enjoy themselves, and of course be well taken care of.

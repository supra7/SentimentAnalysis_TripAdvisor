Had no reservation and just turned up and asked for a room. They had no smoking rooms ( its my one vice :) ! ) so they put me in a room at the end of the ground floor corridor near the exit so I could nip out if I wanted. Very helpful staff giving me directions to Beale St and the best way out of town in the morning. Rooms were what you would expect. Normal by US standards but huge by UK standards. A single for the Americans is a double bed. A twin is 2 double beds. I asked for a single! Free internet. NIce sized rooms. Reception knocked $10 off as I was apparently next to a air conditioning unit outside but I heard nothing. Deli, liquor store and super market within 30 second walk for stocking up the following morning for a 10 hour drive to Oklahoma. Breakfast was in a large room and seemed fine but I just grabbed a coffee. The hotel was spotless throughout however Good comfy hotel that is central for the walking nighhtlife of Memphis", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cJust say \"no\" to this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "maggie108", "ReviewID": "UR17901422", "Content": "The fiasco started when I booked via 1clickpethotels.com, who quoted me one pet rate and the hotel quoted me another.

The manager of this hotel is a total mysogynist; if you are a woman, don't even think about staying here because no matter what the issue, you are always wrong. He is mean, nasty, tempermental, and unprofessional. While my room was decent, albeit overpriced, the hotel experience was traumatic and unnerving. My wifi wouldn't work and he was no help--it was MY FAULT that it was broken!!!! The people next door had a barking bassett that was still barking constantly when I went to bed both nights sometime after 10:00.

This was not really the case!! As we had no car we had to take an hour long bus ride to reach the city centre, and then it was another bus trip to get to Graceland. Although the buses are fully airconditioned and fairly cheap the length of the journey did tarnish things slightly. So if you are staying here it is advisable to have a car!! The hotel itself was of a good standard. Two Queensize beds, a shower/bathroom and a TV with a good range of channels available. Fantastic air-conditioning (if a little noisy) which was very much needed as temperatures when we were there reached record levels. A good continental breakfast was included in the price we paid and was available on a self service basis from 6-9am. They also had a small outdoor pool which was a fantastic way to cool down after a long day walking around in the heat. The hotel staff were very good, they had no problems phoning taxis to take us places that the buses wouldn't be convenient for. It is not a good idea to walk around after dark in this area, this was reinforced by several locals that we met but Memphis as a whole seems to be like this and as long as common sense is exercised there shouldn't be a problem. Although the hotel was good, when I return to Memphis I plan to stay much closer to the centre.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh", "Title": "\u201cExpensive\u201d", "Author": "tep777", "ReviewID": "UR7478941", "Content": "Could not drive further on 40 so pulled off at Sycamore View exit and stopped by this hotel. The staff, upon my requesting a rate, quoted me high and a room on the second floor (which I did not want). So, I was walking out the door and the attendant beckoned me back and offered me a slightly better rate on the first floor and allowed my German shepherd for a fee. Apparently there was a football bowl game that weekend and I had the unfortunate opportunity to pay a premium for my room as a result. The room had recently been renovated and it was comfortable, clean, and quiet. I slept like a brick but more likely due to exhaustion than anything else. The shower/water pressure was not poor but also not remarkable. The included breakfast was completely unsatisfactory. Mostly cold fair and toast for something warm. Though the room was nice, it was overpriced around $100 with pet fee of $10'ish.

I don't work for this motel or receive any commission for giving them good reviews but I really don't understand why all of the bad reviews of this place. As motels go I think it is really good and I am quite picky. The motel was quite busy this time. The parking lot was full as was the motel but it was not noisy at night. We didn't bother to reserve this time because we were on a driving holiday and weren't sure exactly when we'd get to SD. We basically rolled in after dark and got the last room available, ground floor right in front of the pool. Our coffee pot was broken and the fridge didn't work when we arrived. I went to the evening desk clerk and told him. He gave me a new coffee pot right then and there and someone came and fixed the fridge promptly the next morning. The microwave worked fine... we warmed up our continental breakfast from the lobby in it. The orange juice and apple juice are a nice additional thing that this place give with their 'lobby' breakfast. Many places just have pan dulce or bagel and coffee. The room was clean again, linens in good condition and clean and the room had no bugs. I've stayed in four different king size bed rooms here now and they have all been the same, spacious with a love seat and coffee table at the entrance, bed beyond and a large closet. The motel for sure isn't downtown but if you have a vehicle old town, Coronado (my favorite beach) and other SD attractions are all within easy driving range. It is also convenient for entering or arriving from Mexico whether through one of the southern California border crossings or if using I-8 to or from Arizona.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guanajuato, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cThis was the third visit to this Days Inn, I'll stay there again...\u201d", "Author": "Nan N", "ReviewID": "UR116233917", "Content": "We've stayed here three times now, November 2010, April 2011 and June 2011.

We needed one near to Imperial Beach, and the one we had stayed at before was no longer there. After this was mentioned to me I checked, as always, on Trip Advisor and I was not happy. But, to be fair, the place isn't as bad as some of these reviews make it sound. It was clean, and quiet, and the breakfast wasn't great but was certainly more than some slices of stale bread or whatever a previous review said...it was comparable to other continental affairs in chain motels - hot and cold cereals, toast, English muffins, Danish pastry, juices and tea and coffee, maybe fruit (I don't recall as I don't take the fruit). Although it was too chilly to use the pool it looked well-kept and clean. The landscaping, what there is of it, was neat, trim and attractive - flowers, palms, manicured lawn. The negatives can be summed up as such: - Neighbourhood isn't great. Not really down, but a little dicey looking here and there. It wasn't enough to scare me, however...I didn't intend to go wandering. -Service is spotty. I needed a phone book for a local number and there was no book in the room, so I went downstairs and asked. I was told the book might be by the t.v., not the phone; the desk clerk told me he didn't have one (as he flipped through something that looked an awful lot like one to prove that to me). Why he didn't just offer to look the number up for me (online or whatever he does) was beyond me. When I returned later and told him no, there was no phone book by the t.v. or anywhere, he offered to have a book sent up to the room. I told him I was going out then and needed the number before I left, so there was no use in sending a book up. If there were books available, why didn't he just give me one the first time? I ended up looking up the number in a weatherworn book hanging from one of the last remaining pay phones on the planet in front of a 7-11 on Palm Avenue...the next day, however, when I went down in need of something, it was the owner at the desk. What a difference. He was almost military in his yes-ma'am-immediately! demeanor. If he'd been on when I needed the phone number, I wouldn't have been squinting and fighting the sea breeze with the book. - Weird Microwave Setup. The room had a fridge and microwave, both very clean. However, the microwave was not plugged in and in no way would reach the outlet from its perch on the t.v. We had to actually move the microwave at least five feet and crawl to get the thing plugged in. There was some graffiti on the bathroom wall which it was obvious they had tried to remove and traces of it remained. Otherwise the room was quite clean. For the price paid, this was not a bad deal. I give the negatives in detail so that you can see they aren't that bad.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "traveler2009067", "ReviewID": "UR23455672", "Content": "Room was dirty, day shift clerk was uninterested, then there was only one towel (the clerk said they keep them in the office because people steal them), breakfast was a few pieces of bread laid out next to a toaster and some coffee warmed up from the night before.

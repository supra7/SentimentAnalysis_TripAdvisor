I later found out it is a franchised location so you'll never get the same Hilton level of service. It stands to reason if it is smelly, nasty with bedbugs and in \"the hood\", management would strong arm you into keeping a reservation with them. My story, I flew in this week from CA, instead of the using red eye on Sunday I chose to fly in all day on Monday and arrived a 1:30AM. It had snowed; there was only one lane which hadn't quite iced over (passable). No salt trucks out just sparced traffic, slow white knuckling 30 + miles to the North End. I got lost, yes even with GPS (those of us who have worked in INDY know that it not quite right). I stopped on 82nd St. and Shadeland near the Hilton I'd stayed at the week before, behold a Hampton Inn near across the street. At the front desk called this location to get help with directions. The person at the front desk admitted she was not good with directions. I ask her to change my reservation to the location I was currently calling from and she said she could not because they are not affiliated. By this time it is 2:17AM. She said if I didn't come check in she would leave a note for the gen\u2019l manager but there was no guarantee she would not charge me for the room anyway. I explained to her I was lost, the streets are bad, GPS is off. She seemed unyielding so since this is corp. travel I cannot have anything like this on my expense report. (fees and the likes) I will try again. I left location at 82nd and Shadeland got back on 465 tried again. After another 45mins I called this location again from a very bad neighborhood (gas station) people hangin out...scary for a female at this time of the AM. I told employee (who never give their names, call now you'll see what I mean), I told her I tried, please do leave the note for your GM \"Christy\", I am afraid and I trust she will understand, if not I will have to deal with it later but, I have got to get back to safety. I went back to the other location on 82nd and finally checked in at 3:23AM so I did give it the old college try. Well, I got charged for the room anyway. I have called \u201cChristy\u201d every other day since and she has yet to return my call. Today, I finally turned it over to the credit card company to handle since she does not know the difference between a no show and a life threatening situation or inclement weather conditions which both impeded my ability to check into their lovely establishment. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! Never again. From now on I will drive the area the week prior, if it is seedy no way\u2026 but who can predict bed bugs and nasty customer service? I'm telling you don't trust your corporate website alone. Take a look at reviews first, drive the location, and then decide. I work for a major corp. and travel weekly. I have never experienced anything like this before and I will certainly let corp. business affairs know they should consider removing this location from the contract negotiated/preferred hotel list. Negotiating a lower rate is one thing, placing employees in harms way of getting killed in a drug infested area is quite another.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "rochester, ny", "Title": "\u201cMight have been good once\u201d", "Author": "brufound", "ReviewID": "UR125176996", "Content": "The good news is that this Hampton is out of the frenzy of Indianapolis and the staff is very accommodating.

The room was a bit smaller than what I remember Hampton Inn's to offer, but it was very nice and clean. The flat screen was nice, but it appears the cable service is stadard definition negating the use of a widescreen. Free internet service is expected nowadays and appreciated. The breakfast was service was what I would expect. Nothing like you get at an Embassy Suites or Hilton Garden, but it was a nice light breakfast. The breakfast attendant was very polite and attentative to the food and guests. My only complaint would be the total lack of seating. There are about 5 or 6 tables (only one of which is a larger table for a large family). There were people who came for breakfast with no place to sit. The larger table is not suitable for kids because it is very high. Overall a fine hotel.

My destination was Richmond, IN, but the hotels in Richmond are considerably more expensive than Indianapolis. I also chose the east side of Indianapolis so I could avoid morning traffic when I left. There are lots of hotel choices around the I-70/I-465 interchange, and normally I would have shopped for the lowest rate, except this time I needed to stay at a Hilton property to maintain some rewards program privileges. Of the Hilton brands in the area, the Hampton East was the least expensive, although after all taxes, the stay was close to $100. All that said, I enjoyed my stay. The hotel looks to be fairly new. Everything looked great. The lobby is inviting. The desk staff was very helpful and friendly. My room was on the second floor. It had a king bed, couch (probably a sleeper, but I didn't check), TV, desk, refrigerator and microwave. The hotel provides free Internet access (wired and wireless), which also worked very well. The bathroom was clean and in fine shape. There was plenty of room to move around. Rooms face a main road (overlooking a Bob Evans restaurant) or a large parking area. The area was quiet at night. There are also several restaurants in the area ranging from fast food to family restaurants. The hotel includes breakfast with the room. There were cereals, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, mini cheese omelets, potatoes, juice and coffee. The breakfast area was clean and well stocked. There is also an indoor pool, which looked inviting, but I did not swim. Overall, the Hampton East was a pleasant stay. It's not the cheapest in the area, but it is still a good value. I would stay here again. (CS) BTW, there is a GFS Marketplace across the street. This is a restaurant supply company that maintains retail outlets that are open to the public. It's worth looking around if you need kitchen supplies or some interesting food items.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cGo somewhere else.\u201d", "Author": "flyline", "ReviewID": "UR81912632", "Content": "This hotel is run very poorly.

It's only 6.5 miles to downtown Indy, so it's a quick, easy drive to the zoo, museum, canal walk, etc., even if there's some traffic. This is an updated Hampton, clean and well-maintained. Our kids (2 and 4) got a kick out of all the different little pictures on the room number signs. Elevators are sloooow, though! Room: Bed was OK, a little concave in the middle though. There is room for a Pack N'Play against the wall in the two-bed room. You can set up a second Pack N'Play in the room if you have to, but it will block walking access to the desk. You can't move the desk, it's part of the wall. There is an armchair that can be moved. Room has both a fridge and microwave. They wash the duvets for each guest, supposedly, which makes me feel better about the kids crawling around on the beds. Bathroom: Redone and much better-looking than many, but be aware all the storage is open shelving, leaving your toiletries visible to all. It can be a puzzle to find child-safe spots to stow medicines and so on. Top shelf of the closet is the best place we found. Breakfast: Your basic hotel breakfast, which seems to have been hit by the recession as there aren't many options. No waffles or pancakes (even the toaster sort), just pastries, bagels and toast, plus yogurt, juice, milk, OK-ish coffee, a small variety of cold cereal, bananas and apples. They do have honey, cream cheese and peanut butter to put on your toast or bagels. There are also some hot items, which vary. We didn't try them. Pool: smallish and very chlorine-y, but clean, has a hot tub and was a fun place to swim. Business center: Didn't use it, but peeked in. If you do have to use this, hope no one else needs to. It's so small only one person would fit in there at a time. The hotel is not in a posh area - it's pretty industrial. However, we were surprised and pleased to find that it was surrounded by all the amenities a young family traveling on a budget needs. Directly in front of the hotel is a Bob Evans. Turn left out of the parking lot (on the main road) and under the highway for Starbucks and McDonald's, both about half a mile away. Another mile or so down the road is a Kroger, so you can stock your room fridge and picnic cooler, as well as some chain stores and restaurants like Toys R Us and Red Lobster. About four miles away is Ellenberger Park, a local park with two playgrounds, sports fields, and some walking paths. We grabbed some coffee and snacks, and drove there to let the kids just run around and play. More nearby, free stuff to do with kids: You can ride the monorail (People Mover) downtown if you have a train-loving child; it's very short (1.4 miles of track connecting the downtown medical campuses) is free and open to the public, and runs every 5 minutes during the day.The canal walk is also wonderful, and free kid-oriented concerts run during the summer at the outdoor amphitheater where the canal runs into the river. Our kids loved just watching the waterfall at the very end of the canal. In all, a fun, cheap family getaway. We used HHonors points for part of the stay, and got a nice reasonable rate for the other days.

Our girls are from Indianapolis and surrounding cities and we needed them to be in one place and also be close to the venue where they were performing. 7 days after making my reservations (and a week before our event) the assistant manager, Dawn, left me a voicemail to call her. When I returned her call, she informed me that they were cancelling my reservations as they were a \"business\" hotel and that they have a policy that they do not rent to people with an Indianapolis address. I informed her of our event and that we had several girls coming in for this. She only kept emphasizing \"the policy\" and told me that I shouldn't have a problem finding other accommodations elsewhere! I asked for the District Manager's name and number. I then contacted Jeff Brown at the Hampton's corporate office. I told him of my experience and he also referred to this \"policy\". (If anyone can find it on their website, please let me know!) He told me that people usually call the hotel to make reservations and if I were like everyone else, I would have done the same and would have then been told of this \"policy\"! (Uh, then why do you have online reservations?) Jeff also informed me that most of the hotels on the East side have the same policy. (I checked, none of them do AND they were shocked when I told them why I was asking) I asked him what I was suppose to do with 16 people and no accommodations. He said that he could see if another Hilton property could take us 20 MILES AWAY! So, I contacted the Marriot East and they HAPPILY took my reservation, GAVE ME A DISCOUNT AND FREE BREAKFAST FOR MY GROUP! The manager there really felt bad for us and the Marriot isn't even a Hilton property! Needless to say, I will spread the word and will NEVER frequent them again.

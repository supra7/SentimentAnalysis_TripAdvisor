Now, for my detailed review: Having never been to Miami before, I was a little nervous of what to expect -- especially with some of the reviews that I have seen. But, I can assure everyone that there was nothing negative about this property, and, in my opinion, this is a truly wonderful hotel that should not be missed when traveling to Miami! The Hyatt Regency Miami is extremely easy to find; simply Exit off of I-95 South at Exit 2A, follow the long exit ramp which will end at a traffic light, and the hotel is directly on your right. Extremely easy in/out, with excellent valet staff. As for parking, this property is a typical \"downtown\" property, which means that parking is at a premium and is not cheap. However, when compared to some of the extremely high city parking prices that I have seen, parking here was most reasonable -- Self Parking at $19/night or Valet at $30/night. I highly recommend the Valet Parking Option, as it is reasonably priced, it allows for in/out privileges should you need to drive to other locations in the city, and the valet staff is truly quick and efficient. Upon arrival, I was greeted by an extremely helpful Valet, who took my car and assisted with my bags, escorting me to the Front Desk and waiting patiently for me as I checked in. The Check-in process was extremely quick and efficient for a Sunday evening, and I was greeted by name by the Front Desk Agent. The Front Desk Agent profusely thanked me for my loyalty as a Hyatt Diamond Level Gold Passport Member, and he quickly offered me my choice of Diamond Welcome Amenity -- I chose a nice bottle of the Canvas Merlot along with the \"Free Drink\" option. He explained the property and its features to me, and also informed me that as a Diamond Guest, I would have access to the Regency Club on the 23rd Floor. After a few short minutes, the Valet escorted me to my room. All-in-all, a very pleasant check-in experience. Upon arrival at my room, Room 838, I was very pleasantly surprised. It seems that as a Diamond Guest, I had been given an extremely nice Suite at the tip of the hotel. The room was in a large triangular shape, with a separate sitting area and bedroom section. It was a VERY nice room for a \"downtown\" Hyatt location, and I do not feel that it felt dated at all. As soon as you walk in, to your left is a typical Hyatt bathroom, with all of the standard Portico Bath Amenities. To the right is a comfortable sitting area, with a plush couch, a comfortable chair, and a decent sized table for room service dining. Further in to the right, there is a decent sized work-desk, along with a comfortable computer desk chair. Directly in front of you as you enter is what amazed me the most about my room -- the long side of the triangle was complete floor-to-cieling windows, overlooking the Miami River. It was a truly beautiful view of the Miami River, allowing me great views of the shipping in and out of the city. And, you have an excellent view of a large draw bridge in operation, as well. Then, to the left as you continue into the room you find the bedroom area, complete with an extremely comfortable King Size Hyatt Grand Bed. Finally, in the center of the room is a very nice HD flat-screen television that is on a swivel mount so that it can be easily viewed from both the parlor and the bedroom area. All-in-all, a truly wonderful and comfortable room that I was VERY happy with. I would highly recommend this property based on my room experience! As for the Regency Club, it is located on the 23rd Floor, offering a wonderful view of the Miami River -- a very similar view to that I experienced in my room. Each morning, wonderful continental breakfast options and strong coffee and juices were available. Then, throughout the day snacks and very yummy cookies were available. And, at night, a selection of hot and cold appetizers were available. I found that the hot and cold food options were honestly enough for a quick dinner. Also, alcoholic drinks were available for a very moderate fee. As for the other dining options on the property, I did not have time to experience them, as I ate at my conference each day, but the restaurants and bars on property looked wonderful, and the food always smelled excellent as I passed. In addition to those dining options, I did try the in-room dining, which I found to be extremely good -- I highly recommend the Cuban! This hotel did also appear to have an excellent pool for a downtown location; however, due to rainy weather all week, I did not get an opportunity to truly enjoy it. In addition to the excellent room, dining, and Regency Club, the staff at this property was wonderful! I experienced nothing but pure excellence in service, and I have not a single complaint about my stay. All-in-all, this is a truly wonderful location to stay in Downtown Miami and I would highly recommend it.

This time the hotel seemed a bit dated. The hotel lobby was in a different location from our last stay (I think there is some construction going on this time around in the lobby area). In the past we had a king room on a higher floor. This time we had a king room on the 3rd floor; and, that may explain why the room looked a bit dated compared to our prior stays. The rooms are very spacious; and, the Hyatt bed is always very comfortable. This was the first time we had a room facing the canal We watched a few ships manouver through the canal system (which is a pretty cool thing to see). This hotel is great because it is located within walking distance of many attractions in downtown Miami. Bayside, the American Airlines arena are all within walking distance. There is a Hertz car rental location nearby as well if you want to rent a car. Also, the port of Miami is about 8 miles away. We took a shuttle to the port this time; and, we overpaid for that shuttle (I think a taxi would have been cheaper then the $20 we paid); but, the shuttle was quick and very convenient; so, no complaints from that perspective. I suspect the shuttle was paid by the hotel; and, working for tips only; as, each traveler was being charged a different amount; so, be careful to establish the amount before you get into the shuttle (something we should have done but did not do and it may have worked out, anyway). I think people in the area are really stuggling to make ends meet; so, you can negotiate a good rate; but, you can also be taken advantage of if you are not careful. We always book this hotel through priceline for around $80-$85 depending on the time of the year. I think we once got it for around $50; but, I would not expect that to happen very often.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cFantastic customer service\u201d", "Author": "poppyz", "ReviewID": "UR122355390", "Content": "We were treated above and beyond what i was expecting.

The MetroMover took us one stop down, dropped right into Bayside Market area. A cab from hotel to cruise port was less than ten dollars. Check in was easy, polite efficient clerks, there is some construction going on at the main entrance so you had to go through an alternate entrance about 50 feet to the right. Lobby was clean, huge, well decorated and had LOTS of seating areas. The restaurant and bar area were nicely done. Lots of seating in there as well. Breakfast buffet foods were hot and well presented, if a little un-inspired in the selection. Typical eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, bagels, benedicts, several cereals, pastries, juices, fruits. We were far from starved though and ate there both mornings. Elevators were quick and all functional. The room was regular room, SUPER SUPER comfy king bed with higher end linens. Everything worked in the room except the toilet did keep running every now and then, so we closed the door and no more bother.

Really now, how could one of the top 10 largest cities in the USA NOT have traffic noise at a downtown hotel? It was no bother at all.

Well, the carpets, linens, furniture were all beige or browns, solids and some tame stripes, the wall art was typical inoffensive tropical plant images, bathroom had a toilet, sink, good countertop space. Closet was very large and the safe worked easily. Maybe if you are an interior designer you might be offended by the lack of imagination, but I cannot see how anyone could truly take offense at a very bland, ordinary and neutral decor scheme. The TV was not (Gasp!) a flat screen, but it worked perfectly fine, there was a functioning remote, and it had any channel I could care to watch plus movies for PPV. Everything was clean, there was no stains or dirt or bugs or anything out of the ordinary. Didn't use the pool or the gym, but saw those areas and they looked fine.

Upon arrival, there was a sign saying that valet parking was full, so we went straight to the parking gagage. Big mistake. Very long walk in a building across the road. At checkin, they explained we should read the fine print, because they always reserve space for hotel guests. When we went to get our car the next morning, the car next to us had a smashed in window and glass was everywhere. Use valet, always. That is pointer number 1. We got a $99.00 rate including breakfast and upgraded for $35.00 to a \"Miami suite\". They use the term suite very liberally. The room is bigger, it had a great view of the Miami river, and a hot shower. Now the bad side. It was one larger room with a flat screen TV on a credenza in the middle. The TV swivled 180 degrees. King bed on one side, queen sofa bed on the other. Did I mention that the back of the credenza had fallen off, so we got to look at the inside of the cabinet. Lots of general damage to the furniture. Kept the AC at 63 degrees, because it could not keep the room comfortable, otherwise. Sink is behind a head high wall saparate from the toilet and shower. At $99.00, we got what we paid for. The $35.00 upgrade, not at all. It was a worthy of $35.00 and should not be called a suite, in my opinion. That is point #2. Now for the buffett breakfast. Because it was included, we were very satisfied. Nice fresh fruit and a good selection , but often the serving bowls were empty. Staff needed to keep up with demand. If we had been asked to pay the $18.00 breakfast buffet, I would have refused, because it was no where near that value. I did have to go table to table to find creamer and went into the service area to get coffee, because staff was overwhelmed. Point 3 is don't buy breakfast there if you have to pay for it. All in all, for $99.00 in downtown Miami, it is good value, but this is not up to the Hyatt standard. It is a very dated and tired hotel. Great location and views.

The good: The restaurant had really good food for a hotel bar/restaurant. The salads in particular were yummy. I went a couple times and the server and bartender remembered me, which was a really nice touch. The conference I was at catered from the hotel, and all that food was really good too. The common areas are nice - modern, sleek, and relaxing. If only the rooms were like that... The location is really good - close to a ton of restaurants and nightlife. The bad: The rooms are small, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me in Miami, where space is not as much at a premium. They're also really really strangely configured, particularly the bathroom nook (carpeted - ew) and the walk-in closet, which I found to be totally unnecessary in a hotel room, particularly one lacking in usable square footage. The rooms seem very old, and the one I was in did not appear to have been updated in at least 15 years. That led to an air of shabbiness. I'm fine with staying in an out-of-date hotel, but not when it's branded as a Hyatt Regency, and not at the price point of this hotel.

Easy access to MetroMover!\u201d", "Author": "rrdist", "ReviewID": "UR118832047", "Content": "If you need to stay in Downtown Miami, this is a great location. We stayed 2 nights while in town handling a legal matter. We were pleasantly surprised considering this was the same hotel where my high school senior prom was held back in 1983. (I was told the hotel opened in 1982) We booked our room through Priceline at a great price over regular online rates. Jessica was very helpful at check in. Our room (1816) was nice, it was nicely appointed and we had a view of the Brickell Bridge / Miami River. Like some other reviews have mentioned, the carpet looked a little worn. We parked our car with valet, and while it is $30/day - this is comparable to other hotels in downtown. Also the $30/day allows you in & out privileges. You can Self Park for I think $18/day, but you have to pay that each time you come into the garage. Take the car out once and come back you've already spent more than $30. The bellmen were helpful in getting our luggage to our room promptly. Afterwards we stopped by the concierge desk to see what things we might be able to do. They suggested taking the Metro Mover - which is FREE ( http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/mover_stations.asp ) to Bayside - a shopping area. It was very convenient to catch the Metro Mover from the hotel - it is a short walk through the hotel to the Knight Center Station where you pick up the tram. It was a short ride to College/Bayside station where you get off & then a 2 block walk to Bayside. We felt safe travelling with our 3 year old son and enjoyed walking around Bayside before heading back to the hotel for the evening. While reviewing the Metro Mover map we noticed that there was a stop near the courthouse where we needed to be the next day. The concierge was able to confirm for us that we could take the Metro Mover right there - the station was across the street from the courthouse. How more convenient could that be? The second day when we returned back from our meeting @ the courthouse we decided to get our car from Valet and take our son to the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Museum a short drive away. It was maybe a 10 minute drive. Before we arrived at the Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Museum we noticed several black ants in the door wells and our son in his car seat was complaining they were crawling on him. The ants were not biting, but sure enough when we took him out of the car seat you could see the ants on him. They were also in the door wells and a few in the trunk. Anyone with kids knows there is bound to be food crumbs, etc from where the kid has dropped something so at first we thought this was the issue. We searched the car to see if we could find what might be attracting them and really could not find anything that they seemed to be feeding on. We went inside to the museum and hoped maybe the heat would cause the ants to relocate, but no such luck. As a result we cut short the remainder of our afternoon to go back to the hotel to show Valet. When we returned to the hotel, Jose talked to us - we showed him and he was concerned with the issue. It was raining the evening we arrived. We asked if maybe the car had been parked under a tree or near a bush that the ants might have swarmed and found our car as new refuge - he did not know. He promptly said he would take care of it for us and they took the car to be vacuumed. A little later Jessica from the front desk saw us in the lobby and asked how our stay was going - we informed her of the ant situation and she apologize and said she would follow up with Jose, which she did. They offered to pay for a cab to take us somewhere if we wanted. We decided to stay in for the remainder of the evening. We saw Jessica later that evening and she had confirmed with Jose they were working on it. They mentioned they were going to spray the car, but decided not because of our son - which we appreciated. That told us they were being considerate. When we left the next morning, the inside of the car had been completely cleaned out - it looked great. We took off for our 6 hours drive back home. Unfortunately when we stopped along the way - we were surprised to find ants crawling in the door wells. While not as many, it appeared they were coming along with us for the trip. We could not say 100% that the ants came from the hotel, but considering we had not been anywhere else we could not think where else they might have come from. The hotel only charged us 1 day valet and cleaned the inside of the vehicle for us. We feel they did as much as they could to resolve the matter. We are only mentioning this in the event someone else has/had a similar situation. Maybe with some detective work they could find out how this is happening on the property. Our last evening there we decided to eat at the Riverwalk Cafe. The restaurant staff was excellent! We both had the Latin steak, sorry can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall the name of it and it was great! Kids under a certain age (cant recall 12 or 16) eat free with paying adult so we could not go wrong. When my partner had to take our son to the restroom the person who I presume was the Food & Beverage Manager offered to put their food under the warmer to keep it warm until they returned. Steak dinner for 2 and free children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menu came to $60 - we feel a reasonable amount for the location; we know you can easily spend more if you want. We did use the pool once. It was adequate for our needs; I would not expect a hotel in this location to have some huge water fall pool, etc. It was clean & towels were provided for guests. Yes this property is older compared to the newer ones that surround it. Other comments on this site from hotel management indicate it was refurbished in 2008 and apparently they will start bathroom remodeling of the rooms this fall, this will boost the overall property even more. We have already recommended this property to others as a result of our stay.

With that being said, I firmly believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important to provide feedback in situations of extremes weather praise or constructive feedback. I must admit I am partial to Hyatt because they consistently have provided excellent service and maintain high standards across all their brands. I had booked my reservation a few hours before I was set to arrive and they were almost sold out. I was traveling with another guest and needed a room with two queen beds. At the time of the reservation they only had king rooms left so I called the hotel directly to arrange for a roll away bed. When I checked in the staff was extremely courteous and I mean EXTREEMLY courteous. Fortunately, they were able to switch me to a room with two queen beds. I understand hotels cannot \u00e2\u20ac\u0153make\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a room but it is so easy to be courteous. Unfortunately at a lot of places courteous service seems to be a thing of the past it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so refreshing when you receive good service nowadays. My room was extremely clean, updated with new bedding, iPhone alarm clock and LCD TV. The bathroom was on the larger side, also as clean as the room. The WiFi signal was very strong and easy to log into. I did notice at some point the rooms all had access to your own small balcony what I liked even more was they were now sealed with windows that were sound proof \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially to me as I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep well and have sleep apnea. The hotel parking garage is operated by the city of Miami and the first day I was slightly overcharged by the garage. When I inquired about this at the front desk the individual was extremely apologetic for the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistake and was insistent they reimburse me. Check out was effortless and all charges were correct and on my departure was greeted by name a wishing me safe travels In summary, great hotel, great location and great service!

Well, after an hour of staring at our empty drinks, we went up to the front desk. At the desk the lady did a little fumbling around, typing into a computer, and then says \"so, your rooms will not be available, what we have to offer you are some roll away beds, a sofa couch, and a murphy bed.\" Obviously we were upset, we had made these reservations over three months ago and had confirmations, but the hotel was booked and had nothing else to offer us, so up to the weird club floor non-real bedrooms we went. So those weird murphy bed rooms? Stains on the floor, burnt out lights, large grease stains on the sofa, no comforter, only a sheet, no shampoo, no lotion, nadda. So we called down to ask for pillows, a comforter, etc. at 9:00 p.m. Exhausted and frustrated with this place we went out to dinner. We returned at 12:30 p.m. to, yup, no bedding. I called again, finally someone brought a scratchy thin blanket and one pillow. Are you kidding me? Also, these walls are PAPER thin, not more than 30 minutes of sleep were achieved that night. The next day we got real rooms with real beds. Turns out all of the rooms are dark and riddled with stains. Stains on the floor (was it blood? I don't want to know), stains on the chairs, stains on the sheets. Even worse, there is absolutely no ventilation in these rooms, there are balconies, but a window that is completely sealed off in front of them, rendering them useless. Oh, but what was funny/gross, was the greasy faceprint and set of hands on that window (someone must have really wanted out). The lack of ventilation made the rooms feel damp and smell bad, and on that note, we learned very quickly that if one is to go #2, one goes to the lobby bathroom - no fans in the bathroom.

It was like being in a fairy-tale where everything goes right (just about!). It was our 29th wedding anniversary and we had bought tickets for a concert at a venue near the Hyatt. We had flown 7 hours to have a long weekend in Miami and see the concert so we were disappointed that our king room wasn't ready. We waited an hour and a half and I was cranky. When I went back to the desk to find out what happened to our room, Kaitlin at the front desk immediately upgraded us to a suite, which was ready and waiting. We also realized that the Hyatt is attached to the James L. Knight Center where our concert was. We only had to walk through the hotel to get to it. On the night of the concert we were having some drinks at Pure Verde bar in the hotel and mentioned to one of the staff (Andres Gonzalez-Iski) we were there for our 29th anniversary and were going to the Ruben Blades y Gilberto Santarosa concert. He gave us champagne and desert and chatted with us about the concert. The next night we saw Andres again and he gave us two more glasses of champagne. Lyn was our server and she was great.

I am a Platinum member, and so I stayed using my Hyatt Points. Check in was flawless and quick. I received an early check in (9am) which I purchased prior to arrival, and then also received a room upgrade to a nice suite. The lobby area was very nice, and the bartenders very friendly. The pool is next to the river, and there is a LOT of city noise and boat traffic/clanging bells for the nearby drawbridge, etc. If you're going for poolside, bring your ipod to drown it out (I didn't hear much from inside my room though). The pool area was clean and well-maintained. Waited a long time for the food/beverage folks to bring me ice water. 25 minutes the first time, 35 minutes (and then a reminder call) the second time. A bartender brought out a sample frozen drink for folks to try one time - that was nice and it was delicious! OK, back to the room. I was SURPRISED to see one of the pillow cases on the bed with at least 7 or 8 VISIBLE holes in it. I cannot believe their housekeeping staff could have missed this! One of the bed throw pillows also had a hole in it (cigarette burn?). Bathroom had four dark hairs visible - one still stuck to the side of the bathtub, two on the floor, and one large and long one on the bathroom counter. Yuck. Attention to detail is clearly not their forte. Bathroom door needed to be painted, baseboards as well, and bathroom door could not reliably be opened from the inside (nothing like getting locked in your bathroom with no phone to call out!). Such a pity, as a quick paint brush and a maintenance guy would have fixed these obvious/glaring ugly spots and mechanical issues. Again, attention to detail lacking. Bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. There was a clock radio next to it with an iPod docking station. Nice. Never could get TV remote to work accurately...trying to check out impossible via TV for this reason. Room temp hard to cool down. Had on 66 and there is no way it got much lower than 70/71. Friend came to visit, and parked his car in front of the hotel via the valet. Six hours later when he left it was a $60 parking bill. Seriously? $60? Capitol Grille is across the street - walking distance. We could have driven there and valet parked for FREE with restaurant validating. Gift shop had limited selection of items. Fitness center VERY small. Basic equipment. Front desk staff were extremely pleasant - always greeted me by name - very friendly. Very professional and beautiful African American woman checked me in. She was very classy. Did not get her name, but she was fabulous. Double billed on my room upgrade...had to call and get this corrected - which they did with no big problem. Overall it was ok, but not what I expected from a Hyatt in one of their best rooms at what they charge. Probably would stay there again but it wouldn't be my first choice for the money? To note: Hyatt to Miami Airport in a taxi is approximately $24 plus tip (about 15 - 20 minutes away if you are not in rush hour). It's not far from the cruise port (about 2 miles) but in the rush hour traffic a taxi cost about $15). This hotel is connected directly to the convention center. I could see a sliver of the Bay from my room. Beach is a long way away. There is an Avis rental car shop not far from the hotel. WIFI is $9.99 for a 24 hour period. Seriously?

I was told 'there was a glitch in the system'. I was told by many of my colleagues that their rooms were not cleaned, and bugs were found.

Our room was a bit oddly shaped (triangular), but had an expansive wall of floor-to-ceiling windows. We faced the intracoastal waterway and had a nice view of boats going up and down the river. Also a good amount of sunlight in the morning. The room's decor was intriguing...mostly modern funishings (bed, desk, pullout couch, flat screen swivel TV), but a few reminders from the 90s remained (armchair, pillar in middle of room encased in --was that formica??). Wifi was available, but unfortunately, only for a fee. The bathroom, along with the room, was clean and well-maintained. For dinner, we walked across the street to dine at Zuma, a Japanese restaurant at the Epic hotel. Although pricey, it was no more than a 5 minute walk and absolutely worth it. Checkout was also extremely easy, and the hotel manager was friendly and courteous. We inquired about the nearest Bank of America ATM, and he directed us to take the tunnel to the Bank of America tower. Unfortunately, the ATM there is no longer affiliated with BofA, so we traipsed a few blocks around downtown Miami before heading back to the hotel.

The room was just as big as one bed room apartment. The king size bed, the flat screen TV on it huge console/dresser combo. The couch and chair with coffee table. There is the office desk and couple of chairs. Separate closet and bathroom area with all fine amenities. The room was exceeded the expectation and the price that was bids on priceline website. Totally, unexpected. We loved our room with the balcony ( unaccessible ) probably due to safety issues. They have a restaurant there but we didn't get to utilize it because, we were out of the hotel most of the time while we were there. The parking cost 12.50 each time you are in and out. I did a lot of research prior to this trip so, we didn't rent a car while we were there. Except the next day while we rented a car from Miami Airport and used it for a few hour and returned the same day. Taxi cost $21 plus we gave the driver a tip (too much tip for the attitudes that he has) so make sure you stack up some of $1 dollar bills because, we didn't have it so we ended up gave him $5. We were supposed to be on NCL Sky the next day after we returned the vehicle we took the taxi back to the hotel somewhat it cost more. I guess because, starting point was from MIA for the final cost was $29 with his tips. The next day Taxi to the Port of Miami cost us about $15. What we did while we were there? We walked about 20 minutes from our hotel to the Bayside Market. It was really not that bad to walk at all. Nice working out.. We enjoyed spent sometime at the Bayside. More like tourist trap but I loved shopping so I won't mind. When we finish we were walking back and taking some short cut downtown miami. It is not a good option and we didn't know this until we did. The off streets are not \"SAFE\" .. Don't walk there alone!!!! or evening when it is getting dark. The homeless, drug dealers, etc are hanging out. We saw some street working girl there, too! We walked as fast as we could. We don't look at anything or stop anywhere just continued to walks. Hope this help anyone who is planning to visit Miami or taking a cruise and staying any of the downtown hotel location. Forgot to mention that they do have the transit you can use.

The hotel itself is in a boring location. There's nothing to do or see after 6 pm.... Everything is closed and if you're traveling with small children, you will really be bored here! Now, one a more SERIOUS note... We stayed at the Regency floor and (we didn't know this nor we told upon check-in) we were allowed to eat breakfast ONLY at the regency floor. We went the first morning downstairs (regency floor breakfast ends at 9:30; downstairs breakfast is until 11) and had our breakfast only to be served a bill which we were told \"Will be taken care of by the reception upon check-out...If you are on a bed&breakfast rate (as we were) this charge will be deducted from your total\" So we believed. The next morning we again went downstairs for breakfast and again were served the bill which we were FORCED to sign because nobody leaves that restaurant without signing their bill! I asked at the reception why did we need to sign a bill for a charge we had prepaid initially... We paid a substantial amount of money beforehand for bed and breakfast and were curious why we needed to authorize a charge for eating breakfast only to be \"deducted from our total upon checkout.\" The reception tried to convince us that we were informed of the rules upon check in (which we were not...they rushed to check us in, as were checking in a whole group of convention-attendees and didn't have time to speak to us for longer than 2 minutes)... He also said we were allowed to have breakfast only at the regency floor but when I explained that were were honestly not aware of this, the reception guy told us he would annul the charge and we would not be charge for these two breakfast days! We checked out the day after, paid for our parking ($30 a day for a total of 90) and were given a copy that all is paid for (only the $90) and we were ready to leave. When I arrived home I checked our credit card statement to find: a. Charge of $90 on 10/07 (we checked out on 9/07) b. Charge of $65 on 12/07 (WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?!) My only explanation is that the breakfast room doesn't coordinate ANYTHING with the reception so they make their own charges....or reception is ignorant enough and the people working there don't share with each other their decisions... All in all, I have written a complaint to Hyatt. I am very disappointed by the misuse of my credit card and most importantly by splitting the charges in 2 separate payments on 2 separate days thinking we would not notice them and would let them pass...

The Pros: - Staff is WONDERFUL. They provided assistance with FedEx, with courier services, were friendly, and really went out of their way to make us feel at home, even giving us a free evening in the Regency Club when our travel plans got thrown astray by an interesting ruling by the judge. - Spacious rooms. I could set up my laptop, my materials, and other things at the desk in the room and felt like I had plenty of room to work. - Cleanliness. Excellent job by housekeeping. - Gym and pool. Nice gym. Just a few machines, but good machines. Also, a friendly tip - avoid the $3/bottle of water charge, bring your own Nalgene bottle, and hit the water dispenser in the gym for a fill up. Didn't get a chance to go to the pool but it looked like it was very well-used. - Proximity. $5-$8 taxi fare to downtown, to the restaurants and shops at Bayside and Mary Brickell Village. Actually makes it cheaper to take a taxi than to rent a car. - Restaurant. Reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant with above average food. The bar also had some good Happy Hour specials for a quick after work drink. - Lobby. Spacious lobby with waterfalls and just enough ambient noise that you could do work in the lobby for a change of scenery without being distracted. - The beds. Very, very, very comfortable. - In-room coffee. A single-cup coffee maker standard in business hotels, but the blend of coffee provided was terrific! - Wireless Internet. $10/24 hours. Not an unreasonable price for business travelers. Plus you can pay for your entire stay at once. You don't need to buy every day. Things to avoid: - Business center. $10 or $15 just to log onto a computer and get 15 minutes of time. $1/page for black and white printing. Nearly $3/page for faxes. It's worth your money and time to grab a cab to the FedEx Kinkos nearby and get done what you need to. And the business center wasn't always staffed when they said it would be staffed. - Handicapped accessible rooms. I had one for the first portion of my stay. It was not very conveniently laid out, lacked the chair and ottoman that other rooms had, and just wasn't as comfortable. Of course, they're there if you need them. - Rooms near the elevator. They are noisy and face the brick wall of the adjoining convention center. All told, we got a reasonable rate, felt very comfortable and really had a pleasant experience with the staff.

All the staff (housekeeping, front desk, bell clerks, valets, restaurant) were so helpful and courteous. I traveled for years on business to many 5 star hotels and the service at this hotel was best by far. I have paid over $300/nt for a hotel at this caliber level in other metropolitan cities. The Hyatt should be very proud of their employees at this location; that is who makes this a wonderful spot to stay. This location is close to the Miami Aquarium, Biscayne Bay, Children's Museum, Coconut Grove, I-95, Everglades, etc. Oh, and you would never guess that it is connected to the Miami Convention Center! It is nestled between all Miami's high rise office buildings in the center of the fiancial center. It is like your own private Oasis in the middle of Miami.

Background - we stayed the night after a cruise - before flying home the next day. We stayed at the Marriott Biscayne Bay for two nights before the cruise and also liked it. Disclaimer that I got this hotel through Priceline for less than half of the asking rate so I'm not sure I would have been so happy if I'd paid regular rates... We checked in quite early (around 9:30) after getting off our cuise. I believe Marla (or Maria? I didn't get a good look at her signed name on our room key folder) helped us and she was as nice as could be - very friendly and helpful. (The cab ride from the port was about $9 before tip but you have to pay $2 to get out of the cruise terminal in a cab!) They had only a double room available but we didn't have to wait so we took it. The lobby was very nice and there was a cafe there and a lounge/restaurant that overlooked the Miami river. There were stairs that went down to the river area and we walked along there. At times if felt a bit seedy but it wasn't bad. (I wouldn't walk there alone as a woman but we did pass a few women walking alone or with a dog so it must have been OK.) The room is a bit odd in that it has a 3/4 height wall that separates the bathroom and closet (walk in with a safe - it was quite nice!) and the rest of the room. The sink was outside the shower/toilet room, which is how most hotels are. The surfaces were all nice granite and the bathroom was clean and seemed new. (Surfaces in the bedroom were also granite - desk, nightstand, dresser.) Toiletries were nice (don't recall the brand) with soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and there was a travel-size toothpaste at the sink. There was no full-length mirror in the room, just as we'd found at the Marriott - I don't get that!!! There was also no fridge in the room. The TV was very nice - big LCD that swiveled. Desk area was nice. Nice floor-to-celing windows that looked out on what used to be a tiny balcony but was no longer accessible. The view was not nice at all - not sure if any area of the hotel has a decent view. There was internet available through the TV but you couldn't tell what the price was. My husband called the front desk but I think they misunderstood him and quoted him the wireless rate for 24 hours ($9.95) rather than the TV-internet rate. Or maybe that was correct - but we didn't use it. The free metromover was as close as could be (we could see it out our window) so you can get a lot of places for free. We did use this when we stayed at the Marriott Biscayne Bay and had some trouble getting back but I would try it again. We went back to Bayside Marketplace again on this day (we went the day before our cruise, too) because it was relaxed, easy to get to and had a nice selection of restaurants and shops. It was very easy to walk there so no need for the metromover. You also pass a CVS on the way to Bayfront park/Bayside Marketplace so if you need anything it's very close to the hotel. There was no map for the place which I thought was weird considering it's attached to the convention center! There were big maps in the lobby but only as they pertained to the convention center and not the hotel itself. If you want to go to the pool or fitness center, the \"pool\" button brings you there. Glad we noticed it because we couldn't figure out how to get to them! The fitness center looked very small but we didn't go in. The pool was pretty small and there weren't a ton of chairs, however the day we were there (a Sunday with so-so weather - warm enough but cloudy and windy) there was plenty of room for those using the pool/loungers/tables. There were lots of towels and there were menus hanging from several chairs but we never saw anyone come around to take orders. We had an appetizer in the restaurant and the service was good. Our server was very friendly and she was so personable and likeable that she really made our dinner! (Plus, she's worked for a (different) cruise line for four years and we'd just gotten off a Carnival cruise with dining room service so poor that we never returned after the second night (and we are NOT picky!) so she was a breath of fresh air with her great service and wonderful personality!) Check out was easy and it was easy to get a cab even at 5:15 in the morning (looking out our window at 4:45 I could see three waiting in the lobby area). They have a computer to print your boarding pass right in the lobby next to the front desk but it was pretty slow. Still worth it, though, because our airline gave a discount for paying for bags before getting to the airport! I believe the cab was around $25 to the airport but I don't recall exactly (somewhere between $25 and $35 for sure, including tip.)", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cMost under-rated restaurant in Miami\u201d", "Author": "loge54", "ReviewID": "UR58906482", "Content": "I'm a big fan of this hotel which is always very clean and well-staffed with trained personnel.

Rooms - the rooms vary, in our party we had 3 different types of rooms ranging from the basic room to the suite as some people were upgraded. The suites are much nicer so be sure to ask for an upgrade. The rooms are quite nice, although they do not have a minibar, which is a bit annoying. Bathroom etc is basic. For some reason, there is no balcony, there used to be, but the appear to have sealed all the access doors. Lobby - The lobby is nice, but when we were there it was always too busy and noisy due to the Miami convention centre being next door, first there was a graduation ceremony, and then there was a concert... Nearby - There are some great breakfast places nearby, ask the concierge, theres no point paying $24 for the hotel breakfast. There is the bayfront mall nearby, lots of shops and restaurants. South Beach is only 15mins or less away by car, so its definitely not too far. Parking - Parking at the hotel is expensive, $39 i think it was per day, but its valet and you can get your car out as many times as you want. If you're just parking it there for the whole day, then its worth parking across the street for $16, however, you get charged each time you take your car out. All in all, a decent place, much cheaper and nicer rooms than on south beach, but not exactly 4-5 star, more like 3.5.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco,ca", "Title": "\u201cConvenience\u201d", "Author": "travelmonsters4", "ReviewID": "UR52341952", "Content": "The hotel is walking distance to Bayside (live music every nights and lots of shops and restaurant.) right by the water.

The next morning upon checkout, my vehicle came and the back window was smashed and all my wife's luggage was stolen! They did not call me earlier in the morning to notify me and seemed just too busy to even care and seemed surprised at the discovery though they say they do have security. I lost $1500 worth of stuff and was given $200 in emergency money and it took 4 hours to fix my broken window and ruined my planned trip down to Key West as I also had to spend four hours buying all new clothes and such. I learned from valet that parking is three/four blocks away from hotel in a city operated garage and three other cars that night also were broken into. Apparently, the hotel has little security and no cameras in the valet garage so this is a regular event as they acted like it happens a lot. I fault the hotel with lack of security, no notification of the event, and a very slow almost forced response to deal with the problem as at times I felt forgotten and unimportant as they were too busy making money to care or deal with their problem. It seemed like they just wanted me to go away, broken car and all. The regency club is average at best, with a fair breakfast but very limited refreshments during the day, and no desserts and a poor/abstract evening selection (where were the desserts and fresh fruit??). The hotel is surrounded by buildings so even a view from the 24th floor just shows views of other buildings and it is very bright at night (where was the bay view as described on the website??). The blinds in my room were broken upon checkin and were very cheap plastic ones. The regency room was spacious but very plain, and the bathroom area is very poorly designed. We ordered two food selections from the restaurant and were very underwhelmed as my cuban sandwich was dry, cold, and made very cheaply for $12 (very salty and very processed meat). My wife had chicken quesadillas and they were very small and not very good for $12 and seemed to be a half portion. Other Hyatts' serve bigger portions of this same dish and are much better and have better quality. This hotel is designed to serve convention guests so if you are not staying there free or at a reduced rate on business for a convention and have to endure this corporate hotel, just pass and run away as fast as you can. I know this hotel has a lot of guests for conventions and cruises however, it is very impersonal and very corporate and the emphasis is on numbers rather than quality and service. I am still waiting to be contacted on any type of settlement for my loss and I will bet I have already been forgotten as they barely had time for me in the moment to deal with this problem. I have stayed at about 10 other Hyatts' and this one was well below average. The general manager is new and the previous GM ran the property poorly and was very negative on the staff as told to me by the valet manager. Unless you are forced to stay here, I would stay elsewhere. The closest nice Hyatt is in Coral Gables about 10 minutes away and is 100 times better!! I was robbed. Don't be!!

He was there for a conference at the hotel and I was a trailing spouse. I concur with most of what I've read about the rooms. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was so so, with a separate sink area, excellent water pressure, and a good sized closet with an ironing board. (No complimentary shower cap which I found strange for this type of hotel). The room climate controls were good, but the hall could get noisy, partly the housekeeping staff and partly teenagers staying there for an international tennis competition. We were on the fifth floor, facing the draw bridge which results in clanging bells with each opening. There was also some noise from the room next door on one side that had a door connecting to our room (locked during our stay). Nothing was intolerable, especially since we always travel with our white noise machine. The lobby was large, soaring and bustling at times. When we checked in, there was no line, but at other times, the reception desk seemed quite busy. The concierge desk staff was very helpful and the staff in general were quite pleasant. They had obviously had some training in customer service. I don't get the description of the hotel as \"art deco\". It seemed more like basic 1980's conference hotel architecture, to me). For Art Deco---visit South Beach. There was a smallish pool and a quite small gym for a hotel of this size. If we weren't in Miami for a specific conference at the hotel, we probably would not have chosen to stay in this location. Downtown Miami is sort of like Dallas---they roll up the streets at night. They are still building condos, but it really felt like a ghost town---even during a work- day, sort of. Our original plan was to rent a car since we also planned to see our son at the Univ of Miami in Coral Gables and to visit South Beach, but as we were standing waiting for the rental car shuttle at the airport, we had second thoughts and I'm glad we did. It was much more convenient and overall probably cheaper (or the same price) with less hassle, to use cabs (or the Metro for the University). Without much traffic (i.e. on Saturday), it was only about a 15 minute cab ride to the airport and to and from South Beach. Cabs were readily available at the hotel. As is reported by others, this hotel is a busy place---conferences, cruise patrons, air crews, social events, etc. The hotel is attached to the Miami Convention Center. The first day, we walked south over the draw bridge and thought we were literally in the middle of nowhere, but there are places to visit if you ask around. In terms of places to eat, the hotel seemed only to have a coffee bar, regular bar and a restaurant. We ate at the restaurant one night after a late conference session. It was pricey---a la carte for everything and entrees $20-to over $40. The food was good, but I wouldn't consider it a destination had we not been staying at the hotel which made it very convenient. By asking at the concierge desk, I found out that I could get to an Au Bon Pan and Starbucks for breakfast by walking through corridors and tunnels connecting the hotel to the Bank of America Building, across the street. (These are both closed on the weekend.) The Starbucks did not have internet access (?), but the hotel had wifi for $10 per day through T-Mobile. It mostly worked ok, but was occasionally intermittent. The hotel is also walking distance from decent restaurants with an outside dining at a mall on the waterfront (the name of which escapes me at the moment) from which one can also book boat tours of Biscayne. We also walked to Mary Brickell Village. The shopping part seemed like it was still trying to fill up with stores, but we had a very nice outside lunch at a French Bistro there and there seemed to be other good choices. The hotel is also walking distance from the free downtown People Mover which connects to the elevated Metro. Miami is not known for its public transportation, but the Metro does go to Coral Gables, where the Univ. of Miami is located) and a bit south of there. The fare is $2.00. But, if you wanted to visit the Miracle Mile shopping district in Coral Gables, you would need to take a cab from the Metro stop. (By the way, even if your kid is not attending the University of Miami, the Lowe Museum there is not overwhelming in size, but has a good, eclectic collection.) I believe you could also use the Metro to get to the Vizcaya estate which is also worth a visit. This is not a hotel where you would stay if you wanted to hang out on beaches, but we found a nice walk in a park around the perimeter of Brickell \"Village?\", a nearby island of condos. You walk across a bay bridge to get there---after also crossing the draw bridge immediately south of the hotel. (It had an opening while we were walking back, natch). The draw bridge is also a place for possible manatee sightings. (The walk to and around the island takes about an hour and a half---without dawdling, but not running, either).

The d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the guestroom had been replaced fairly recently and it was appealing in earthtone colors. However, the cleanliness of the room was terrible. Little white specks of tissue (or something) were across the entire room, indicating they did not vacuum. The room had been irresponsibly painted and paint smears ran from the wall onto the carpet in several areas. Both beds were comfortable; however, when I took down the duvet to get into bed, little tiny black hairs were all over the pillowcases and sheets. (When the housekeeping manager came back with a maid, they both were changing the sheets and she started to leave the same pillowcases on the pillow. He quietly told her to remove them as well.) The bathroom was moderately clean, but the caulk along the entire wall and bathtub was pitch black with mold. The ceiling had mold spores that covered at least a 2 ft. by 1 ft. patch. Apparently, they had tried to paint over it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. The square light in the ceiling was rusted and orange along the edges, along with black mold spores. Chunks of the ceiling were missing around the entire light fixture and were edged in black mold. Went to make coffee the following morning and there was a long blond hair and dust inside the coffee maker water well. The hall that led out to the pool was very small and dirty. The pool area was extremely small as was the pool. The fitness area was rather nice, with modern equipment. Several times as we would walk down the halls, the housekeeping staff would be walking in rooms and guests were complaining about their rooms. A few talks in the elevator proved the lack of cleanliness was rampant throughout the hotel and not just in our room. Parking was terrible, with a 15 minute walk through the garage, the Bank of America building, through the Convention Center, up escalators and into the hotel. $12.00 per night. Valet is $23.00 per night. The Metromover was convenient to travel around the downtown area and it was free, but required the same type of walk as the parking garage.

The oversized closet area allowed us to have a room free of luggage, shoes and the usual things you leave outside a typical dark, dinky hotel closet. The bed was extremely comfortable with a superb mattress and 6 regular pillows, 2 square pillows and a bolster, affording comfort whether we were sleeping, reading, or watching the flat-screen TV. The water pressure and temperature in the shower were exactly what you hope for and seldom find in a large hotel - perfect! The lavender-citrus shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap are of superb quality and smell wonderful. They are available at a very reasonable price throught the \"Hyatt at Home\" catalogue in the room. The desk in the room is oversized with a marble-like top, so we didn't feel uncomfortable eating there. In addition, there was a 6-outlet power strip, convenient for charging the cell phones, the laptop and the battery of the digital camera. The light is also good for working or reading. The staff, especially our housekeeper and the staff at the concierge desk, went out of their way to be helpful - including making a couple of phone calls to see if a friend were registered at a nearby hotel. Each staff member I encountered made a point to give a gracious greeting - even on Sunday when about 80% of the hotel was checking out. There is no restaurant, but the coffee shop had lovely breakfast foods, fruit, yogurt , salads and sandwiches available from breakfast time until late at night. There were several restaurants a short walk away for guests wanting to eat outside the hotel. We didn't use the pool, but its location and that of the fitness center were well marked. There is very convenient self-parking next door, and valet parking as well. There is also a tram stop right next to the property. We were particularly entertained watching the drawbridge going up and down to let large vessels go through the canal. The meeting rooms are well lighted, nicely decorated, and kept at a very comfortable temperature (they were a little chilly when we weren't dancing, but very comfortable once we started, and that isn't easy to accomplish).

The bad thing about downtown Miami (which isn't specific to this hotel) is there is really no where to go by foot. We took taxis at night when we wanted to eat in restaurant outside of hotel. That got a bit expensive after a while. Downtown Miami is ghosttown after 5pm and would not recommend walking around (not many people on street and even in daylight the streets are full of bums). The metromover is connected to the hotel by walkway which was nice for sightseeing in daytime to Vizcaya (hop on the rail line from metromover) or taking mover to the bus stop in Omni for bus over to South beach (pay $3 round trip for bus to Southbeach vs. $40-$50 roundtrip for taxis). You can take the C,H,K, or S buses over to southbeach and the buses run pretty frequently. I wouldn't recommend doing this at night. The hotel restaurant was OK but were typically overpriced and you could easily get bored with the menu after 2 days. The breakfast buffet was actually good ($20 but alot of choices on things). The room was nice (up on the 20th floor) but was annoyed that the balconies were still closed. You can't go out there still. The room itself was nice and spacious. The king bed was very comfortable and gave you alot of pillows. Maid service was fine as well. You also get a free safe in the room to stash belongings like laptops. Would I stay at this hotel? Only if I had to stay here for convention or trade show and it was <$200/night. Otherwise I would stay over in south beach where you can walk around easier and more to see.

Never happened 4) Room service ran out of certain food items fairly early in the evening 5) Room had no luggage stand - I think this is the first hotel or motel I've ever stayed in where there is no luggage stand or anything besides the office chair to put your luggage on?!! 6) Hotel drapes are poorly constructed - they don't go all the way down to the floor so that in the morning bright swath of light enters the room since there is about a 2 inch gap 7) Room itself is way outdated and old - they have 1980's style faucet fixtures and were missing the H and C symbols. 8) Toilet seat was broken 9) \"closet\" if you can call it that - doesn't have a door - it has a crazy swinging pleated door thing - I don't even know how to describe it - but it really made it feel iike i was in a motel 6. 10) Internet service is SLOW - felt like I was on dialup - it was THAT slow Good news: 1) Fairly quiet - can't hear neighbors BEWARE 1) Hotel is used for cruises lots of elderly people around OR 2) Rowdy, hormonal teenagers waiting to go on a cruise - first floor they tried to put me on, about 10 kids were running around banging on each other's doors giggling like - well you know - kids!

There was a little card in my room that maintenance had visited, but I think the room smelled worse after they visited. The odor was pervasive throughout the hotel though, not just in the room. There was construction/renovation underway, but the odor was not one attributable to construction (though two of the days my floor also had pervasive solvent odors). In addition, these were some of the worst conference rooms I have experienced - poor lighting, bad sound systems. And for the rooms that had dividers the sound leakage from adjacent meeting rooms was so invasive that it was nearly impossible to concentrate, or hear, what was being presented in the session I was attending. I have stayed in many Hyatts over many, many years of business travel, and this was by far the worst one I have encountered. I seriously considered checking out and finding any hotel I could within the vicinity, but that was a challenge of its own. The Hyatt is completely surrounded by half-completed (and apparently halted) high-rise construction, freeways, and incredibly busy roads. It was virtually impossible to figure out how to walk anywhere from the concrete locked space. That all being said about the facility, I certainly found the staff to responsive, attentive and extremely helpful, up to the standards I would have expected and have experienced in a Hyatt. My experiences were ultimately limited to the front desk and the restaurant and the personnel was great - I commend them. Management on the other hand needs to think seriously about this property. I hope they are making it something worthy of there own staff and that the renovations will cure these ills. Check it out carefully before staying there.

When I checked into the room we had reserved the next day, I was immediately struck by the smell of ... was it mold? It smelled of moisture. I called down to the front desk and asked if they had another room to show me. For the sake of comparison I stopped the housekeeping staff from delivering a mini-fridge before we settled on the room. Trust me, I checked out rooms on the same floor, back and forth, and chose the city view room that did not smell. I was glad, too, because as the days went on, I met people who were complaining of allergies. I asked one colleague who was really suffering, if he had a city view or water view. He had a water view room. I urged him to ask for another room on the city view side before he got sicker. But I wasn't immune on this trip; perhaps I travel with Calamity Jane. The first night, she got into bed before me and started to have an allergic reaction to the sheets. She had to take a Benadryl, but also take food soon afterwards. Long story short, there was no food because everything in the hotel was closed by then, and the hotel manager had to dig up crackers and water before she nearly passed out in the elevator. Once sheets and bedding changed, drugs properly taken, everything was back to normal and hunky-dory. Second night, same room-mate had turned in for the night (and I was out) and water started to cascade down from the overhead bathroom vanity light fixtures. While scrambling to move everything off the counter, my roommate managed to call the front desk to report this disaster.

We checked in on a Saturday, so construction noise was not a problem. There are renovations going on in the hotel, but the areas being renovated were blocked off at the elevators and there was no renovation noise while we were there. The room was spacious with a balcony and the balcony door actually opened. However, neither of us stood too long on it - it was a bit scary so high and being so small. The room had a king size bed with very comfortable bedding. There was enough drawer space, a t.v., desk, closet area and bathroom area behind a wall behind the bed. The room was quiet - we heard no hallway noise at night nor any noise from our neighbors. The bathroom was small and did not have an exhaust fan, which was fine because the sink and mirror were outside the room. There was a coffee maker that made single cups of coffee. The room was bathroom (and room itself) was very clean. The only signs of wear I saw were in the bathroom - the door moulding looked like it was rusted on top of the door. Other than that, the room was just fine. There are no refrigerators in the rooms but one can be rented for $40. One of the people in our group was diabetic and had insulin that needed to be refrigerated. Marie provided a refrigerator in his room as no cost, since it was needed for medical reasons. We had a car rental and parked it at the hotel for $25 for the day. There was a Riverwalk Cafe in the hotel that served sandwiches, muffins, coffee, soda, etc. and a restaurant next to that. The restaurant was a bit expensive, so we bought delicious sandwiches at the cafe and took them to our room. We also had a nice breakfast from the Cafe the next morning. All staff we encountered were very professional and helpful. The hotel is conneected to the Miami Convention Center and there is a sundries store in that are as well as an Enterprise car rental storefront, which is closed in the early afternoon Saturday and on Sundays (a waste in my opinion - we had originally booked an Enterprise rent a car so we could leave it at the hotel when we left and take a cab to the pier. Instead, we changed our car to a Dollar rental and got a free shuttle to the cruise ship pier.) The hotel lobby are was just beautiful and there is also a small pool. Our room overlooked the river . We had read reports here of noise - the only noise we heard from our room was very fast trucks going over the drawbridge of the river and when we listened for it, we could hear the buzzer when the drawbridge went up.

I have stayed here on a number of occasions - not through choice, I emphasise! - because of work. The construction work which other reviewers mention has been going on for at least two years - though in all that time, very little seems to actually have been constructed! There is a lot of noise in the hotel, from the traffic, (busy highways surround the hotel), other guests, (typical thin hotel walls!), and the construction work which is going on on every side of the place. Arriving yesterday, my key card didn't work. I rang down to the front desk and was told to come and get a new one as there was nobody at the bellstand and I would be waiting a long time. OK, fine, but hardly a response representative of a 4* establishment. The smoke detector in the room was hanging off the wall with exposed wiring, which necessitated a change of room. The 'replacement' was OK, though the carpets were still damp from what I presume was a shampooing, as the room was rather over-frangranced! Cleaning leaves rather a lot to be desired; it all feels rather perfunctory, with quite a lot of dust etc. and a used bar of soap still sitting in the shower. Breakfast is good and fairly reasonable price-wise, with a good selection and a pleasant, efficient staff team. Take advantage of this and fill up for the day! Smokers - which I am not! - take note: smoking is only permitted in rooms on the 15th floor so if this is important to you, confim and confirm again a room allocation. Because although there are balconies from each room, they are now merely decorative and a rather misleading feature of publicity shots! The hotel is now sealing all balcony doors so you have no access to them, in an attempt to minimise construction noise and reduce in-room humidity. However, this is a shame, as it is nice to be able to pop out for a few minutes or have a drink on the balcony etc. especially in mild temperatures. I see they make no mention of the balconies as a room feature on the website. All I'm saying is, don't let the pictures fool you! The rooms themselves are rather strange. Personally I'm not keen on the 3/4 'partition' which seems to create a cross between a dressing room and a bathroom. The sink etc. are separated from the actual bathroom - containing bath and toilet. Odd louvre door acts as both dressing-room door and closet door, depending on where you close it. I'd rather they have made the whole bathroom self-contained and separated from the rest of the room!

Where shall I start to enumerate our disappointments? Although we were aware of some construction in the vecinity, we were unprepared for the difficulty in navigating in the area. If you miss the entrance (which we did), you have to go through what seemed like hoops and jumps to find it again. Parking: The only way to reach the hotel is by car, but the hotel does not offer parking. You can pay $15 for a one-time shot at a self-parking building around the bend from the hotel. We drove to it, and returned scared to leave our car there and even more to walk back from the parking garage. Granted, it was after 10:00pm, but this was r-e-a-l-l-y spooky! We opted for the other choice, paying $27 for one night's valet parking. The lobby looked elegant and the receptionist was polite. We got a room on the 12th floor. The elevator is activated by the room key - good security. The room itself was large, with two double beds (our party consisted of my husband, my 18-yr-old daughter and myself) that had good mattresses. There was a large dressing room separated from the rest of the room by a 3/4 wall - that also was nice. The room had been vacuumed but it had not been dusted for a while (you could blow the fuzz and dust off the lamps), everything that could turn to rust, had. The louvered door to the dressing room was filthy. The shower head was excellent, easy to adjust the pressure to your liking, and the water pressure itself was awesome. The toilet did not flush well and the sink drained very slowly. The towels were clean but it seemes the housekeepper had long hair, which I found on one towel, on the bath mat, on the sink, and on the top sheet of the bed. We had three bath towels, two hand and two face towels - we asked for an additional face towel and were told they keep track of their inventory and would charge our card if they found anything missing, but they did send someone with a whole set of towels. Thank you. The coffee pot was missing the carafe, so we could not make coffee in our room. Then the noise. It was horrible!!! The noise from the cars passing on I-95 was very loud and kept waking us up. They gave us coupons for the buffet breakfast. The employees at the restaurant were very nice, friendly and professional.

We arrived from the airport at about 10:30 on a friday night and the line for check in was stretched across the loby. It took 45min to check in, because as it turned out the reservations people made online and recieved confirmations for were never actually reserved. Several groups in line before us checking in were told they had no room available and had to go to other hotels. We on the otherhand did get a room, however all that was available were smoking rooms. We did get a discount for the error but only after some complaining. I cant imagine being one of the people in line whose reservation was completely disregarded. I dont understand how a major hotel can have basic issues about knowing whether rooms with requested features (ie non-smoking and 2 doubles) are available at the time of booking, and actually RESERVING that room for YOU. The room was also very loud. I couldnt believe how much of the street noise we could here from the 15th floor in a \"bayview room\". If you do stay here request to stay on the side of the hotel away from the bridge. It is a metal drawbridge and you hear every single car drive over the grated metal surface. Additionally construction starts even on a Sat. morning very early and you hear all the trucks going in and out of the construction zone that you overlook. Out of the 4 adults who stayed in the room only one slept through most of the noise... the cars going over the bridge kept the other 3 of us awake most of the night. My parents also stayed here before our cruise and stayed on the other side of the building and had no issues.... so again TRY to request the other side of the building, although who knows if they will actually honor that request since they have trouble honoring general room reservations. Other features of the hotel were fine, nothing too special or too awful, although the bathroom was actually quite dismal, dim lighting, bare lightbulb, and tiny.... but I was otherwise ok with the status of the room.

(Don't get me wrong, Motel 6 is great but doesn't cost $179/night at the corporate rate -- and there are hotels in the same price bracket as the Hyatt that are much better.) My main complaint was service. For example: My flight, already scheduled to arrive late in the evening, was delayed, so I arrived at the hotel at 11:45 p.m. after not having had anything to eat since breakfast. The woman at registration checked me in efficiently, but was clearly unenthused about doing so (not a single smile or pleasant tone of voice). When I asked if I could get any food, she told me room service was open until midnight but I'd better order at the bar. The bartender growled at me that the kitchen was closed; when I pointed out that I'd been informed it was open for another 15 minutes, only then did she get me a menu and let me order. Again, no smiles, clearly no joy in her job. (It's not the best job in the world, likely, but still, they are paid to be service-oriented.) Every time I dealt with anyone in the hotel over the next three days, they were borderline surly -- not a single smile ever, even when smiled at. When I got to my room, housekeeping had left the balcony door open and the lights on, so the room was humid and crawling with bugs. There was only one toiletry in the room: lotion. No soap, shampoo or conditioner. I called the desk and asked for some; an hour later none had arrived. I called again -- at 1:15 a.m. -- and only then did they bother to inform me they had none at the desk, housekeeping was closed, and they couldn't send anything up. (An hour+ of sleep lost.) The bed in the room was decent -- clearly upgraded recently to compete with other chains -- and the decor was fine, not exceptional but not offensive. On the other hand, the bathroom grout was full of mildew and the whole bathroom smelled of mold. Another plus: The fitness room was good -- not a ton of machines (basically two of everything), but what they had was new, with TV screens built in. The bar was pretty depressing -- low rent 80s decor with the clientele to match. It's named \"Currents\" -- which of course means it's the least current place you can imagine.

One quickly realizes that the only people staying there are stuck there because they're attending a convention (the Miami Convention Center is attached) or going on a cruise.

Again, I imagine that due to their clientele, they aren't often asked whether there are any restaurants within walking distance. Nevertheless, we were told flatly no, save one (Capital Grill). We decided that was impossible and set out on foot anyway to discover dozens of places. We had several good meals in vibrant litte blocks of nightlife. I think Miami Ave and 10th-14th streets, and some others the other direction as well. How could they not know this? (by the way, Duo was delish though pricey, and Indochine was loud and fun and quite good, too. We walked past several restaurants en route to these, that were all packed: French, Italian, Mediterranean, bars, etc.) We asked again the next morning if there was a place we could walk to have breakfast and they said no. We said then we'll head to Key Biscayne and eat there...was there something there? Only the Ritz Carlton. Hard to believe, and again, turned out to be totally untrue. We walked out the front of the hotel and could SEE a bakery from there. Walked over and had a delicious (though casual) breakfast with mostly locals. South American sweet breads, omelettes, proper espresso. Maybe the hotel thinks their clientele only likes IHOP. Don Pan was the name of it, and it fit the bill. We wandered another block to buy water and found a street with a half dozen casual restaurants, including Quizno's and an independent Chinese and Japanese place, and a Starbucks. The concierge didn't know any of this?? Furthermore, Key Biscayne is a town, not a resort only island. Therefore, there were DOZENS of restaurants of every caliber. Cafes, Starbucks, diners, restaurants. Baffling. Anyway, despite the look of the place, the seemingly bad location with no sidewalks and construction and makeshift roads everywhere, we (two women, who never felt threatened), found great places despite the hotel staff's determination to keep us away from them.", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Jolla", "Title": "\u201cNot As Bad as Previous Reviews\u201d", "Author": "travelmavenLaJolla", "ReviewID": "UR6635097", "Content": "This Hyatt Regency is located in downtown Miami.

Check-in staff was very friendly and was able to get us checked in early. We had a 2 double room non-smoking facing the Miami River. First thing we noticed - one of the beds had sand on the bedspread from someone maybe putting a shoe on it. We didn't need the bedspread anyhow so off it went. The hotel was full so we just shrugged it off as an oversight on the cleaning staff. We tried to use the Concierge services to do early check-in for our airflights and the 2 working there looked confused and then pointed us to business services. There is a charge to use the internet $30 an hr. using their laptops and 25 cents for printouts. I thought this was extreme so we asked someone at the front desk to assist. Joseph helped us out and within a few min's we were checked in for the flights. That afternoon we checked out the bathroom area in our room. DISGUSTING. Mold everywhere. I took pictures to send to Hyatt. The floor wasn't vaccumed either and we found food between the nightstand and bed, mold on the wall and a few dead bugs (at least they weren't alive). It's such a shame as this is a beautiful hotel with nice dining and sports bar.

After a long and frustrating 2 and a 1/2 hour flight delay, we arrived at the Hyatt at approx. 9:30 p.m. Check-in was a breeze at this hour and the lobby was fairly quiet. The staff was very friendly and accomodating and before we knew it, we were headed up to our room on the 12th floor. Our room, which was classified as a petite suite, was exactly what we were hoping for. The room was a good size and had two balconies; one in the bedroom area and one in a separate sitting area. We found the entire room to be clean and comfortable. As most of the other reviewers noted, there was some noise from the downtown traffic and drawbridge, but it was by no means, bothersome. It was also nice being able to view the cruise ships right from our balcony. With regards to the surrounding area, if you are interested in shopping, Bayside Marketplace is within walking distance. Other than that, there is not too much as far as \"tourist\" attractions. If you do not mind hopping on the public bus, there is a bus every 20 minutes or so that runs from Bayside to South Beach for only $1.50 per person. We found this to be very convenient and money-saving. All-in-all, the Hyatt Regency Miami is a great choice for a short stay. Given the hotel's location, however, I would not recommend for anything longer than a few nights, as you may get bored or spend every dollar you have taking taxis to the \"hot spots.\"", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falkirk, Scotland", "Title": "\u201creally quite liked this hotel\u201d", "Author": "cwagsg", "ReviewID": "UR4240026", "Content": "As with others, I was very apprehensive about staying at this hotel.

The room was really well appointed, very clean and we had no other noise issues. the pool area is pleasant although not the most peaceful owing to the bridge and traffic, but again I wasn't hampered.

I was prepared to take a look and then move to the Marriott if the Hyatt looked bad. Not only was there no need for that, I had a great stay. Every point made in the other reviews was certaintly not evident during my stay. The Hyatt was very clean and very quiet. I had a room with a city view on the 20th floor. I did hear the bridge once, but it didn't disturb me at all. There is construction near the Hyatt but it seems that the whole of Miami is under construction. If you go you should just be aware of this as it would be unavoidable wherever you stay. Having said that, the Hyatt is very quiet- no evidence of the paper walls previously mentioned. I particularily enjoyed the way the the room was divided which prevented any light from coming in under the door. Another unexpected feature was the large walk-in closet. The staff of the hotel were also great. After five days, I had a good chance to see the staff in action. Everyone from the maids to the bellmen to the front desk staff were prompt, friendly, and helpful. As far as nearby attractions, the Bayside Marketplace is a short walk from the hotel. As far as the hotel being in a bad area- Miami is a big city like any other. If you use common sense precautions such as walking during the day and taking a cab after dark you will be just fine. The Riverwalk Deli in the Lobby has good sandwiches and they make a mean Starbucks latte, which I enjoyed while listening to the player piano.

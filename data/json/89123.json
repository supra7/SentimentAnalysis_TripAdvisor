{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lower End Hotel With Good and Bad Points Midtown hotel is located less than two miles north of the Superdome on Tulane Ave in an area of town that has several vacant lots, several vacant and perhaps abandoned buildings, and a couple of very low rent bars. The hotel has a parking lot in the rear which was adequately lighted at night, but unguarded and lacking a security gate. The entrances to the hotel bypassing the lobby have been blocked by iron gates. The general premises were, while not immaculate, reasonably clean and orderly given the class of hotel. My assessment was that it was by far the nicest hotel in this area of town, there being 4 or five hotels between the Superdome and I-10 on Tulane Ave. The staff was very polite, courteous and helpful. They cheerfully and promptly provided an iron and an ironing board to my room on request. I was allowed to check in early at 9AM without a problem. My room rate was very reasonable for New Orleans at $72 including tax (in May of 2008). I requested a wakeup call for 5AM when checking in. I later noticed that my room had no phone (no problem since I had a cell phone), and when returning in the evening (the front desk seems to be staffed 24 hours), I verified that I could get a wake up call. I discovered that the clerk had forgotten to make note of my request. I did subsequently get a wake up knock on the door at 5AM, which was appreciated. I suggest you have your own alarm clock. I also suggest you do not let the desk clerk make a copy of your driver\u9225\u6a9a license when checking in, as this represents a potential identity theft problem especially if you are paying with a credit card. My room had clean sheets and linens, no unpleasant aromas, and dim lighting. The ceiling appeared to have some minor sagging due possibly to water damage. While the bathroom looked generally clean, there was a cigarette butt (staining the bowl water brown) and some empty sugar packets in the toilet. Three small soaps, shampoo envelopes, and two clean towels and wash clothes were provided. There were no face towels. No bath mat or drinking cup or facial tissues were provided (the latter being no problem as there were several extra rolls of toilet paper). I did not check to see if the well-used coffee maker worked. No coffee, cups, creamer, etc. were provided. What do you expect for $72?The hotel has a club on the first floor which was very lively at 11PM when I got back to the hotel, although I did not check out the club. Despite the club noise, my room overlooking the clean courtyard pool was very quiet. Two men seemed to be having an argument in front of my door about 1:30 AM, but I turned on the TV and went back to sleep. If you are used to staying in the Radisson, then Midtown Hotel New Orleans is probably not for you. If you are looking for an OK inexpensive hotel and you can tolerate one that is not in the nicest neighborhood, then you probably will like Midtown. I would probably stay there again.", "Date": "May 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR133792775", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "lepanto_lee"}, {"Content": "Midtown Hotel is a NO NO This place is what is called a seedy motel. I do not classify it as a hotel because people can enter from off the street without using the front doors. There are steps on both ends without the benefit of doors, that lead to the street. Drug addicts and ladies of the night frequent this establishment I was told.I read the review before booking but because the two most recent spoke of new management I make reservations to stay there. The female owner was very pleasant over the phone and I was under the impression I would have a nice stay...not.Upon arrival to New Orleans I was in a hurry to get to my destination so I sent my male friend who picked me up from the airport to check me in and drop off my luggage after he took me to my immediate destination. I did not speak with him prior to being dropped off later that evening.From the moment I stepped out the car I knew this was not going to be a good experience. There were two person hanging outside the facility that had the appearance of being homeless. There was debris around the grounds. Upon opening the door the smell was very musty, the title was filthy and the carpet was stained. I was greeted by the most pleasant person. She IS THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS HOTEL. She greeted me by my name and told me she had given me her best suite. She escorted me to my room. The elevator was slow and appeared to have not been cleaned in a few months. When we arrived at my room, I was in total shock! This is the best...Lord I never want to see the worst. The musty odor was very dominate in the room, the carpet was stained galore and the tile needed to be mopped twenty times or more. Here I was in New Orleans without transportation, in need of rest and in a filthy hotel. I wanted to take a shower, so I took one of the two towels and placed in tub and took a shower, I dried off with the other and then used it to step on and then immediately put on my shoes. I pulled back the bedspread and found it to be stained as well. I had a blanket from my flight so I used it to laid down to sleep. But I couldn't sleep because of the noise in the hall, off the street and on the floor above me. But I also couldn't sleep because the bed was hurting my back and reeked of urine. I could not wait until morning to get the heck out of there. My ride was to pick me up at 10:30, when he arrived I was there with all my luggage ready to go. Since I had paid for three night, I needed a credit placed back on my credit card. The female owner was very apologetic and called for her husband to issue my credit. He was apprehensive and said that he could reimburse me because the man had paid for my room. I assured him I had paid for the room, the man had just brought my things over from the airport per my request. Then he wanted to charge me a $10 per night cancellation fee. He didn't and I am glad because I didn't want to have to go there with him.My male friend tells me, he know this place was unsavory when he got there, even the man owner caution him about not letting the lady (me I guess) take him for his money. What does that sound like to you.I hate giving this review because the Mrs is so sweet, but I would not want another person especially woman to book this place from their hometown and wind up going through anything like what I did. I was so tired I just didn't have the strength to pack up and call a cab that night to go eslewhere.Other noteworthy particulars are, the TV was a 15 inch, the room had no telephone in the room and the room had a window to the hallway. Nice features were a refrigerator and a microwave and both were clean.I ended up going to the Okeefe Plaza Hotel which was very nice for the exact rate, the only difference they were not as friendly or nice.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR599953152", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SleeplessInNawlins"}, {"Content": "Loved the room I stayed in the best room.

But it really wasn't that bad. Here is a list of things I noticed:1) The shuttle that is advertised as a running downtown or to the French Quarter, only runs from 7am to 12pm, then from 5pm to 9pm. Therefore, if you want to go down there in the afternoon, you have to take a cab, which costs around $12. 2) The parking area for guests is in the back of the hotel and they lock it at 10pm. The upside to this is that there is a bar in the hotel, and they are generally open until 11pm.3) The resturant in the place wasn't too bad.

Front desk help was unhelpful. Room was filthy and carpet was so dirty that after showering, I put my socks on so my feet would not touch the floor. Socks were black on bottom from filth. Walls in bath area dirty. Room not supplied. (Had to go to front desk for cups, soap, coffee, etc.) Both nights, of a two-night stay, noise began about 12:30 a.m. with constant (I mean constant) foot traffic back and forth across room floor above us. Floor joists squeaked all night and we got virtually no sleep. (Squeek, squeek, squeek) I inquired at the front desk the next a.m. if there was another guest room above us or a gym and told the desk clerk about the noise. Again, no concern what-so-ever.

It's located in a not-too-good-looking neighborhood, and there isn't much around it in walking distance (restuarants, etc.). Rooms are dark, some don't even have windows. I'm fairly easy to please when it comes to hotels, especially if the price is reasonable. When I checked in, the surly and disinterested desk clerk first gave me a room which had not been cleaned. Then, when I went back to the desk to get another room, he booked me into and gave me a key for another room, which WAS ALREADY OCCUPIED! The person in the room was not too happy when I opened the door on him. The final room was musty smelling, with a badly chipped tub and mold in the tub and on the bathroom floor. I didn't have enough energy at that point to request another room.The location is fairly close to the City Park, so if you are headed to JazzFest it might not be a bad location. They do have a shuttle service to the French Quarter, which is pretty far away (10 minute drive). I didn't need the shuttle, but I imagine it's handy. But, I think it stops running around 10:00 p.m., just when many people are getting to the Quarter. It's also pretty far from the airport (10-15 minutes, with no shuttle).In short, if you have a car, stay elsewhere.

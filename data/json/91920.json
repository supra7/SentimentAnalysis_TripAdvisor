The breakfast was typical Residence Inn fare but the layout of the breakfast room caused traffic jams as only 1 person at a time could comfortably get to the coffee as there was limited counter space & the milk/juice dispensers are in the same corner. People waiting for the waffle makers would be in the way of guests trying to walk through to the coffee or get food from the other side of the buffet. My room had 2 queen beds & the smallest kitchenette i've seen in a Residence Inn. The pub style table was so small that I couldn't imagine 2 people actually eating at it. The higher-style chairs would not be comfortable for senior citizens. There was an old style clock radio that was unreliable so I just used my cellphone. (No MP3 connectivity like in other RIs. Only 1 light between the beds so any reading would disturb the other occupant. Desk was on top of bed, which was on top of outdated dresser to which the flatscreen Tv wad bolted. TV was really only positioned for viewing on couch or chair, I dragged the dresser away from the wall as much as the cords would allow so that I could swivel it order to view it from the bed. No inroom safe in closet as most RIs have. Furniture seemed worn & mismatched.

My son got married at the Wynn so the location for this place was just minutes away. First the good: Staff was very nice and helpful. Location was real good. Breakfast was real good and plenty of it. Pool was nice. Parking was fine. Rooms had 2 bathrooms. Now the not so great: Rooms while decently clean but were dated and worn. Very Drab.

The rooms are standard Residence Inn suites (nice and familiar to me). However, the hotel is much taller than most Residence Inn hotels and thus you are likely to have a good view from your room. I had a great view of the mountain ranges in the distance - beautiful. The breakfast was the standard Residence Inn breakfast, with waffles, eggs, biscuits and gravy, sausage, yogurt, cereals, toast, coffee, juices, etc... My only complaint is that they keep leaving you messages asking you to join the Holiday Club, which I presume is a timeshare or something. I wouldn't expect to be bothered like that at a Residence Inn. I may have given 5 stars were it not for this. One other thing, there is covered garage parking, which protects from the fierce desert sun (I visited in December so covered parking wasn't really a necessity.) If I were visiting Vegas on vacation, there is no way I'd stay here, but for work it's perfectly suitable. It's too far from the strip that you need a car or need to cab it. Fortunately, there are plenty of cabs waiting right in front of the hotel at all hours ready to take you places.

Two minor complaints that prevented me from giving an Excellent rating: 1) Soaps are wrapped in a new type of wax paper that is extremely hard to open. We had to use a knife to slit the package. 2) Upon receipt of our credit card statement, there were two separate $3 charges. I called the hotel to inquire and was told they were for bottled water. We did not use any of the bottled water, as we had brought our own supply for use in our car on the long daily drives. The gentleman on the phone was friendly and apologetic and said he would credit them back to our credit card. So be sure and watch your statements.

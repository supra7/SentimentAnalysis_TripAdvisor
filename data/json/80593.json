I had a king bed with a microwave, fridge, coffeepot and hairdryer in the room. The color TV had a special \"flat\" remote control that was easy for the staff to disinfect. This suite also had a separate little room with a twin bed off the main room. I could not hear anything from the rooms next to me. The heater worked well, as it was a bit chilly in the early morning. It was impecably clean and well stocked with towels. The free breakfast was more than expected, consisting of oj, coffee/tea/cocoa, a selection of muffins, HB eggs, oatmeal/cold cereal and fruit. There is a bit of traffic noise along with the airplane and train sounds but that didn't affect my sleep or daytime reading. The most important thing I can mention about this hotel is the amazing staff, Arti and Chirag. They always had a smile and offered their assistance. I didn't have a cell phone and they let me use the hotel phone free for all the cab calls and airline reservations I had to make. They would look up the numbers for me and were always available and offered helpful information with directions.

Stayed in the kid's suite (room 109) so each person could have their own bed. The soda/vending/ice machines were right next door so each time someone went in to get an item, they slammed the heavy iron metal door which scared everyone in the room. I could not figure out which was louder: the planes landing, the trains blowing their whistles, the gridlock (car horns) from the busy intersection right out front, or the metal door being slammed every so often. We asked housekeeping to not clean our rooms and even put up the do not disturb sign. Lo and behold when we came back later that day, they not only did clean our room, but they took a personal item of mine and also replaced the towels that we had on the racks with new ones (the sign says they would only replace them if they were thrown on the floor), I at least got a sorry but that was it. They replaced the towels that were on the rack, but did not leave enough towels for everyone in the room and no washcloths were replaced. NOT happy about that at all. As others state the breakfast room is the front desk area so no more than 3 people could be in there at the same time and there is no place to sit down and eat. They had cereal, muffins and eggs. We tried the eggs the first day but they smelled and tasted sour so we spit them out and had muffins the rest of the stay. Other posts about parking are correct, we stayed Mon and checked out Thurs, Mon and Tues nights were fine but by Wed night the parking lot was full so we snuck in next door at another inn.

If you are sensitive to noise, bring earplugs for when you sleep. We grew up in the city so we are used to background noise and we slept like babies...without earplugs!)

We were three adults and a small child, so I booked a room with two queen beds, and it worked very well. Yes, it was on the first floor, so you can hear all different kind of sounds and noises from outside, but, really, if you are just looking for a place to spend a night, it is fine. Booking tip: I went on the hotel's website to better understand the room types, and saw a \"register as a vip guest\" tab, promising better rates, etc, so, I registered. I got an email confirmaton immediately, but nothing else, really. So I thought, oh well, I'll just book tomorrow at whatever regular rates there are on the website. At that time, I was looking at $99 for the double queen beds room ($89 for the room + $10 for an extra adult). That evening, however, I got a phone call from a sales person from the hotel asking if I still wanted to book - as a VIP guest now - so I did - at the rate of $59 total for the same room! Not too bad at all!! Last, I should mention the complimentary breakfast. Honestly, it's not too bad either. It is served in the smallest-ever \"lobby\", but its plentifulness will surprise you. There was hot (instant) and cold cereal, hard boiled eggs, muffins, oranges, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and orange juice (maybe I'm forgetting something) that one can take without any limit. So, really, nothing fancy, but fills you up quite OK.

I've had the \"tucked away\" room in other hotels and have found that they do not always represent what other rooms are like, they are more like an afterthought or an attempt to get one more unit out of a former storage room. This room was decidely better than that. Room 207 is a King bed, \"smoking\" room. I say \"smoking\" in parentheses, because it is actually labled as a non-smoking room and had no ashtrays when we checked in. When we questioned it, we were told that it really was a smoking room and we were given ashtrays. I've had that happen a lot at other hotels so I mention it as a caveat to travelers who insist on a completely non-smoking room. The room was smallish, but very clean and appointed with a sizeable TV, end tables and a table and two chairs. The view was of the wall of the property next door, but I think that was a benefit to reduce the noise of the nearby train tracks. We are not really all that sensitive to noise and found no problem with the train or airport noise. Parking is kind of limited so I wouldn't want to check in too late on a busy weekend. The hotel will suggest off-site parking, but I think it's safer to park at the hotel. The only thing that I questioned was a little note in the bathroom that advised guests to use the red washcloth to remove makeup \"to avoid additional charges\". Apparently they are concerned about stained white wash cloths. I've never seen anything like this in any hotel and thought it was kind of strange. I use white wash cloths at home and find that any detergent works well to remove makeup stains on towels. The motel also assesses a $50 security charge which they refund when you check out. Not sure what that's for - perhaps it has something to do with the notice in the room advising that customers will be charged for anything that turns up missing. The notice actually lists the prices for what they will charge. I initially thought that was a little odd and sort of unfriendly, but I guess it can be a major problem if you're running a little motel. No harm, no foul really. The location is really the best asset of this property. It's an easy walk to the restaurants and attractions of Little Italy and also the Trolley station. If you are staying over the weekend, do not miss the Saturday farmers market on Date Street in Littly Italy. Amazing!

Having two queen beds and a separate bunk bed was great for our sleeping comfort! The hotel location was just right close to all the public transportation (trolley, Amtrak) and one block from the Comic Con bus route, which saves us rental car and parking money. You can hear the trains at times, especially when Amtrak honks its horn. However, we see it as a trade off of convenience and we would rather have the convenience. So overall, it was not a problem for us. I read the reviews by other customers beforehand and remembered John was mentioned as the most friendly staff member. Indeed, he was the one greeted us when we check-in and every morning. He made us feel right at home. The continental breakfast was sufficient for us to do a \"brunch\", there were muffins, coffee, OJ, milk, cereal etc., the best was the hard boiled egg. It was served at their very compacted lobby area, but everything was clean and well-presented. Probably the only thing I would comment is the newly painted kid's suite still has the paint smell, and it could become bothersome if you have the window closed. If you do not open all windows (3) in the room, sometimes the ventillation gets bad.

Having never stayed there, and only having the information provided on Expedia, we made an excellent choice.

John, the manager, tried everything to accomodate us; the room on the first floor was the same as on the 2nd floor, except with a refrigerator, so we decided to keep the upstairs room originally assigned to us. (We had to carry our bikes upstairs--our fault). The bed and pillows were most comfortable--and from a woman's point of view, I loved the mint green sheets! The room was small but that was not a deterent. Cleanliness was obviously high on their priority. Everything was immaculate, from the room, bathroom to the parking lot. It would be great IF they put refrigerators in all the rooms. On the down-side: 1)the location of the bathroom door to the toilet was an issue 2) the shower head was way too low down...I'm 5'6\" and had to shrink down to get my hair wet, 3) the room is not equipped with sufficient electrical outlets4) the Disabled parking slot is not readily accessible 5) the landscaping blocks the southern staircase to the rooms with southern exposure. All that being said, we have to commend John, the Manager, for his professionalism and astute awareness as to what was appropriate. There was a terrible automobile accident at the intersection of Grape and Ash..right in front of the hotel, on Saturday afternoon; John intuitively knew what to do.

The Marina Inn and Suites definately raises the bar and steps it up a notch. With lots of competition in the area, Marina Inns and Suites definately holds a bar even though it's a fairly small hotel, it still gives you the experience of a major corporate chain. I feel that on a scale between 1 to 5 stars this should be a 4.5 star hotel.

Lots of good television stations and the shower and hot water situation was great. (The bathroom in my room was huge! Very nice.) However, it is a noisy location. I was concerned about the airport noise, but that wasn't a problem. The hotel is near the landing path, so the throttles are low and not noisy. The noise problem was with the traffic on Pacific Highway and adjacent streets. The train tracks are also right behind the properyt, but they didn't seem to run the noisy trains after about 10:00 p.m. I brought ear plugs, and those, with the room fan on high, drowned out the noise so that I got a good night's sleep. No complaints about that, but beware! The other thing to note is that they 'nickel and dime' you to death. Don't use the phone (all calls are charged, even credit card calls and 1-800 calls). Make sure you don't drink the bottled water, it's like $2.50 a bottle. Don't use the safe in the room, there is a charge for that!!! Luckily, there is no charge for watching TV or using the shower.

This complaint involves both motels (See Vagabond Inn Mission Valley San Diego listing). On 10/22/07 Ms. Patel charged $159 a night for the Marina Inn even though the rack rate was $94.95 for these dates for a king bed and the internet rate, $64.95. The Motel is within 50 feet of a railroad crossing on a hilly main intersection within the flight path of the airport. Horns, train whistles, engines reving up the hill and airplanes landing weren't even the worst of it. The toilet was stopped up with feces. Maintenance came three times to no avail. The lights did not work. We moved to another room and unpacked but found water damage under a major part of the carpet. Vicky Patel told us that she would let us move to the Vagabond Inn, Mission Valley for the same price. Upon entering we were told the rack rate was $129 a night & with an AAA discount it would be $99. The internet displayed the AAA rate as $80.10. But Ms. Patel insisted that for us it would be $159 a night. I informed her that gouging is illegal (penal code 396(d)) & that I am an AAA member. She agreed to $99. We checked out of the Vagabond Inn on 10/25 @ 10 am. The Motel refused to give us a bill saying it can only be gotten from the Marina Inn. We went back to the Marina Inn. They also refused to give us bill. Hotel.com said they cannot help. AAA can't help since it was booked @ hotel.com. We stayed one night at the Marina Inn and 2 nights at the Vagabond Inn yet according to my credit card company we were overcharged and pre-charged $725. We are contesting.

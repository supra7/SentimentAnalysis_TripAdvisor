We arrived at the hotel and we had to pay 20 dollars to park in their parking lot, I am told this is normal in big cities.

We looked at the thermostat and it said 80 degrees, it was clearly not that. We decided to go to dinner at the chinese restaurant in the hotel and we told the woman at the desk about the heat, she said the thermostat was backwards, so we went back to the room and turned all the way to the opposite side. We had dinner and went back to the room and it was still cold. We told the woman at the desk again and she offered us another room, but asked if our room was clean. We had unpacked, used the bathroom and changed my son's diaper,so we did not move. They made no attempt to check the heat at all. We went to breakfast at the chinese restaurant in the morning and encountered a very rude waitress and cold, greasy food that was not included, are you kidding me. We made two or three calls when we were there to the MBTA lost and found, a local call, no where did it say the phone was not free for local calls. When we went to check out we were told we owed $2.50 for phone calls. So $138 dollars for a run down, cold room with horrible service.

After the game, no worries. A few steps and everyone was back at the hotel, tucked into the comfy beds with visions of Red Sox players dancing in their heads. Anyone who is a Red Sox fan needs to try the Howard Johnsons. As my husband says, \"Location, location, location!!\" You can't get any closer to Fenway. Although the hotel may appear a bit dated, the rooms are clean, everyone is very helpful, and the beds are comfy. There is also a pool and an attached Chinese restaurant. And, if you have ever been to Boston, you know parking is a concern. The hotel provides safe parking for only $20. per night!!

No traffic headaches, no hailing cabs, no subways to deal with. Check in/checkout were fast and the staff were most helpful, particularly the parking attendant. Speaking of parking, the HoJo's daily rate for parking is $20, which is about half of what it costs at other hotels in the area. Parking lot is well lit and secure. Don't judge a book by its cover. Although the decor did appear dated, the beds were clean and comfortable. Bathroom was clean, shower was always hot, with excellent water pressure. The room overall was clean, well maintained, and had all the amenities one would expect like A/C, hairdryer, coffee maker, room safe, etc. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. Are there fancier hotels in the area? Yes, at double the cost and not as close to Fenway. Are there cheaper hotels? Yes, but they are nowhere near Fenway, so make sure you have lots of time before and after the game to deal with traffic or make transit connections.

To be honest, it is the only hotel we need to stay in. This past trip was perfect. We went to a Red Sox game on Sunday night and then went to a Bruins playoff game on Monday night. It couldn't have worked out any better since both teams won. Both venues were very easy to get to with the hotel being next door to Fenway Park & the TD Garden being just a short subway ride away. The staff is always kind, courteous & very helpful. I have become such a loyal & returning custumer that the front desk staff even recognizes me at check in. That is a good feeling. A special thanks to Franny, Beverly, Kevin, Rich & Lisa for there continued excellent front desk service. Also to Mr. Doucette ( the hotel manager) for always going out of his way to make sure me and my family are well taken care of. Although it is an older building, it is a more than adequate place to stay with fair prices. It is not the Ritz, so don't expect the Ritz! There are plenty of other hotels in the area that charge $500 a night if that is what you are looking for. Although the rooms are not flashy & won't knock your socks off, they are always clean & the bathrooms have everything you need. Housekeeping does a very good job and work hard to keep the rooms & the building clean. I think they deserve credit for the job that they do. I will admit one thing though, do not eat at the Chinese Restaurant on the first floor. The food and the service is terrible. You will not find a better location in Boston for a hotel than this one. It is literally next door to Fenway Park. What more can you ask for? Even if you are not a baseball fan, the location is still amazing as it is right in the heart of Boston's beautiful Back Bay area. There is plenty of nice restaurants, shopping, drugstores, liquor store, Dominos Pizza all within walking distance. Also, downtown Boston is just a 5 minute subway ride away. You are in close proximity to everything you need while at the Howard Johnson's Fenway.

There is also the always convenient garage a block away. I had my car repared there last year and I was glad it was so close. There is also 2 drugstores and a bar with a terrace right next to the hotel. If you want to go and visit TD garden, you are only 60 minutes away by foot. The nearby subway station is also within walking distance of the hotel. The staff is always ready to help. Last time I was there (the famous bruins lightning game 7), we arrived early and they gladly gave us our room right away. There is also a parking that is available for 20 dollars a night. The Chinese restaurant next door also offers a great breakfast. The rooms are clean and of good size too. The bedrooms are convenient and clean as well. It is usually quiet whatever room you have. Of course, there may be occasions where some neighbours are noisier than usual but it can happen at any other hotel. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Boston whether for the Bosox or simply to enjoy a great walk in downtown Boston. You are 10 minutes away from Boylston and Newbury street as well. So overall, this Howard Johnson hotel is a great location to stay at and is worth going to.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cRude staff, terrible rooms, and a parking fee.

We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to drive back to the Cape, or, if it rains, we go back to HO JO and then can watch the rest of the game on TV. Oh, by the way, you can watch what ever you want until you hear the crowd, turn back to the TV to see what happened. You see it happen because there is an 8-10 second delay in the broadcast. More fun is to arrive earlier in the day or the night before and get out before the game when the players arrive at the park. You see them arrive, see amazing wheels that they drive, and they wave and chat with the small crowd there long before the game crowd arrives. Boston Back Bay museums, stores on Newbury Street, Prudential Towers, Copley Square all are within short walking distance from this inexpensive motel in one of the most charming cities in the US.

I booked this hotel because of the great price & reviews I'd read here on Trip Advisor. Most people attending the convention chose to book the hotels closer to the Hynes Convention Center, but a walk has never bothered us, and the price spoke for itself. When we arrived Thursday night, we found a parking spot (which is $20 a day, a good rate for Boston) and checked out our room before strolling about town. Before you even get to the room, the hallway is pretty narrow & just dirty looking. Not like you're gonna step in a puddle or something, but it looks OLD & worn. The room .. *shrug* None of the decor matched, there were old stains/bleach marks on the bedspread ... and a very questionable stain dribbling down the curtain which wasn't noticed til later ... but I digress. We came back to our room for a good night's sleep before the convention and kind of got one. The walls were extremely thin, and being that the hotel is on a busy intersection, lots of revelers were outside and even someone just walking down the hall could be heard. There was no way to turn on a fan or some kind of noise making device to drown this out. The beds were okay. It definitely felt good to get into my own bed when we got home, though. When any of us tried to take a shower, the bathroom didn't have a fan either ... it just had this red light contraption that is supposed to dry out the room, but it really just made it feel like I was in a lizard tank. The bathroom was fine though, no other complaints. The location was very good, literally right in front of Fenway Park. We were about a 15 minute walk from Hynes Convention Center, which was the perfect amount of time to enjoy a good view of Boston and find some great restaurants, which are either direction you leave the hotel. The people at the front desk were very helpful in restaurant guiding, and also supplied me with two band-aids. Checkout time was noon, which is always nice to have a later checkout. We really had no real problems at the hotel, just a general feeling of cheapness. But we got a great deal, and Boston is a beautiful city.

The second surgery was the first full week of 2010 which led to a 4 night stay at the Fenway H.J.The hotel had all the things that I could ask for under these circumstances. The price was reasonable for a big city. In January, the off season for New England, was even $20 cheaper per night. As a senior citizen, unfamiliar with the transportation system and the streets of Boston, the shuttle that Howard Johnson provided was a big relief to me and my hospitalized husband. We had enough concerns and worries without worrying about me walking to a hotel alone after dark. After our first stay and a scheduled surgery in January, I planned ahead and brought a few food items for snacks, soda, fruit,etc, When I came back to the hotel I brought back breakfast items that could be stored in the refrigerator and warmed in the microwave. Instead of spending nearly $20 per day for 3 meals, I spent less than $10 using the H.J. facilities. I found the staff to be sympathic to my situation and great listeners. The shuttle was easy to use and always available within the the reasonable and lengthy travel hours which were clearly noted.

I booked the HoJo because of the decent rate and the proximity to Fenway which would be convenient after night games. Based on the reviews here, I thought it would be a decent stay. We arrived around 7pm on June 6th after a long flight from Calgary AB with a stop in Toronto. We were given a room on the first floor at the back of the hotel. When I asked if a second floor room was available, I was told that that this was the last room. Although we were staying through June 10th, no suggestion was made that we could change rooms the next day. The windows in all the rooms are single pane. Any outside noise is barely muffled. When on the first floor, people having a discussion outside their car in the parking lot at 3am might as well have had it in your room. The bed in our room on June 6th must have bee 20 years old. After lying on the one side for 20 minutes, when I got up, there was a crater where I had been lying. It would disappear in about an hour. The bed was so uncomfortable and the noise from Fenway unmuffled by the single paned windows that I barely slept that night. My back is still recovering and I've been in constant pain for two weeks. My wife finally suggested that we sleep across the bed instead which provided marginal improvement. The next morning, we asked to change rooms to one with preferably a firmer mattress and the desk staff got into a long discussion before putting us into the \"best room in the hotel\". I almost changed hotels and, in hindsight, wish I had. Supposedly, these were newly renovated but I suggest they have only been repainted. The decor, furniture and bedding were exactly the same. The bed was slightly better, at least allowing for an OK sleep. The hot water took so long to come to the room that I called the front desk. Turns out you need to let the water run for 10 full minutes before any hot water will arrive. This is very \"un-green\". Whenever I dealt with the front desk staff, they always left me with the impression that they dislike their job and I was bothering them. They were polite and provided assistance but the occasional smile couldn't hurt. Conversely, all dealings with the housekeeping staff were very pleasant and helpful. Every night after games at Fenway, there is alot of noise from the cleanup crews. I do understand that this is out of the hotel's control but a whole new set of windows (to upgrade the single panes) would minimize the noise from this. What was unacceptable was having to sign a document that I could be evicted from my room without refund if I was disturbing the peace but then having to endure an entire night (I think it stopped around 4:30am) on June 9th of screaming, yelling and door slamming from my neighbours. I guess I should have called the front desk but we felt it would be safer to remain quiet. These rooms are right by the staircase by the front lobby desk. There is no way the front desk could not have heard the constant disturbance. If you are going to have guests sign a form like that, then enforce the stipulation for the benefit of all your guests. When I checked out the next day, the rate for the 1st night was correct but nights 2-4 were 25% higher. The staff were quick to correct the error. Other comments: - They might as well fill the pool with dirt. The algae on the sides gave you the distinct impression that your health would be compromised by swimming in it. - The restaurant was OK at breakfast - nothing to complain about but nothing to recommend either.

But it's old, and smells like smoke in the room and halls and the outdoor pool is green and the room doors all slam, and since it's right at the park everyone was partying in the halls until the wee hours.

The hotel's location can't be beat for games or events at Fenway Park. You literally walk out of the hotel, walk half a block, turn the corner, walk another half block, and there's the Gate B entrance to Fenway Park. It's also convenient for meeting up with a particular trolley tour that I took that stops in front of Fenway Park and lets you board at any stop. My hotel room on the second floor (top floor) had a peek-a-boo view of Fenway Park and faced out onto the hotel courtyard where there was an outdoor swimming pool. Pro#2: Great service. First example- I had a package delivered to the hotel. I thought it was going to be delivered during my stay at the hotel, but the package arrived a few days prior to my arrival. I called the hotel and was delighted when the lady at the desk said they would hold it until I arrived, no problem. Sure enough, when I checked in, they had it ready for me. Second example- I checked out early in the morning and was waiting in the lobby for an airport shuttle. When I had been waiting a while, the two men on duty offered to call the shuttle for me. When they couldn't get ahold of the shuttle, they offered to call me a taxi. The taxi pulled up a minute later. Third example- The cleaning service restocked the toiletries. (I stayed multiple nights.) It's something I took for granted until I stayed in a hotel that didn't! Con#1: No breakfast offered in the hotel. In the Fenway Park neighborhood, there are lots of bars and lunch/dinner restaurants but no coffee shops or other places that serve breakfast (that I could find). I would've even paid for breakfast if the hotel had offered it. (The restaurant inside the hotel is Hong Kong Cafe, a Chinese restaurant that is open for lunch and dinner.) It looked like there used to be a McDonalds across the street from the hotel but it was no longer in business. Con#2: Older hotel Because this is an older hotel, there were a few problems. I couldn't adjust the temperature in my room. It was freezing cold inside the room the first two nights when it was cold outside, and stuffy when it was warmer outside on my last night. Along with that, there was no way to turn the fan on in the bathroom. Also, the room smelled faintly of cigarette smoke. The hotel is now 100% non-smoking, but until they replace the carpets, freshen up the paint inside the room, etc, it will always smell. To be fair, they are in the process of refurbishing the hotel. They were painting the halls when I was there. I didn't have any trouble sleeping because of noise. Sure, I could hear people in the hall, faucets, the soundcheck at the concert across the street at Fenway Park. But maybe I am more used to noise than others since I live in an apartment building. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hotel with great service very close to Fenway Park.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cIt was OK.\u201d", "Author": "NomadForLife", "ReviewID": "UR30564817", "Content": "I'm not sure if I just got a crap room or what, but some of the reviews describe a much nicer hotel than what I stayed in.

There is a restaurant attached that serves breakfast, lunch, dinner and it is reasonably priced. The bad: I realize this is not the hotel's fault, but our room was on the second floor facing the park. I requested a \"room with a view\" and while the view of Fenway was fantastic, it was NOISY. Each night after the game around midnight the cleaning crew and their equipment could be heard as well as early AM deliveries. It made sleeping difficult. The inside of the hotel is a bit noisy as well, you can hear toilet's flush, doors open, etc. Then there were \"little things\" like, the WI-FI working one day but not the next (they do have a 24 hr service number to call and they were very nice and helpful). And NESN? We were told they didn't get it, so I'm curious as to how the other customers got it on their TVs. The parking situation concerns me, I wish they had better supervision. There is no security and I looked out the window one night to find a man on a bicycle riding around the lot looking into people's cars. There is also no elevator. Let me say, I am 28 but I was traveling with my two senior parents. I booked the hotel at the \"Senior Rate\", which is deeply discounted, so I'm wondering if they assign less desirable rooms to those rates.

We got the tickets early in ther season and planned to make a weekend out of. With a little research we found Howard Johnson Inn at Fenway Park and it didn't disappoint. It 's reasonably priced and is right behind Fenway, (just a 5 minute walk to Fenway). Even though normal check-in isn't until 2 PM we got there an hour and a half early (just to park in there lot), we were able to check-in. We stayed in room 222, which if you looked out the window you could see Fenway Park. Actually any even numbered room will have a great view of Fenway Park. (Rooms 218, 220, 222 have probably the best view of the players parking garage area on Van Ness St). The front desk staff was great, they had a lot of local knowledge and gave us some suggestions on things to do. It was too cold to go swimming but, they do have an outdoor pool. It's close to many restuarants and bars such as Boston Beer works, Cask and Flagon, etc. It's also next to many T-stations including Kenmore Square (about 15 minute walk). Its not the most luxurious hotel in Boston however it was a great stay and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic for Fenway!\u201d", "Author": "babybou", "ReviewID": "UR20939361", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on a night of a Red Sox Game.

The life guard at the pool is great, the maids that clean the room are great, all the way to the staff at the restaraunt downstairs.

The hotel is close to Kenmore Square, with Kenmore MBTA station, Dunkin Donuts, Popeye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, McDonalds, ect. (5-10 minutes walk) There is a McDonalds and several drug stores located next to the hotel with a Burger King and Shaw\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grocery store to the west of the hotel. There is a great night life on Lansdowne Street, a few minutes from the hotel. This hotel needs major renovations (we've seen stains in 2003 that are still present) or need to be rebuilt (which may be in the plans)! If the price was on par with the quality one might not real to bad about staying here but there are other hotel options in BackBay/Downtown for a similar price and high quality.

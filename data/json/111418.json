We had lost luggage, and informed every staff member we could find, and insisted it be added onto our notes. When it still had not turned up the next day, we asked that they call us when it did, and get a receipt for insurance. The staff were certainly unable to do this, and didn't even know the luggage had arrived when we enquired upon our return at the end of the day. With all the insurance calls required, and follow up to airlines and delivery services, I was disgusted to discover this hotel has removed all their public phones. All the Manager Polita had to say is that we had phones in the rooms - at a cost of $2.00 for a free call!! Disgraceful. Not everyone has cells that work in the US, and are willing to pay such ridiculous prices for free calls. PS people the Radisson 2 blocks away is the closest payphone, which staff were unable to tell me. Apart from our luggage experience I can say: If you need nothing from the staff, or don't need a public phone, the rooms are adequate, the beds are so comfortable, the location is fantastic, and may be worth the money. On the bright side, as the hotel is so old (Historical landmark) it has its own generator, so we were unaffected during the Boston blackout.

I have stayed at the Boston Park Plaza several times in the last several years, as recently as February. I felt it would be useful to highlight a couple of things for those interested in traveling and hopefully having a similar experience to the one I had. -HOTEL- The hotel was built many years ago. It is clearly historic and maintains an old fashioned grandeur that cannot be matched in the city of Boston. That said, it is not a modern or retro hotel. It is not supposed to be a modern or retro hotel. The Park Plaza offers a classic feel for those who enjoy it. -ROOMS-This hotel has many guest rooms, so to over generalize and say \"one room is small\" or \"one room is run down\" is to make a presumption about 1,000 guest rooms, which is just silly.If you were to over generalize, it would be more than fair to say most rooms are very nice. Every room is different, from large with 2 bathrooms to petite with one bathroom. Some rooms have views and some do not. ALL ROOMS, so far as I have stayed (and I have stayed many, many times) are spotlessly clean, have all of the amenities you could ask for, flat screen televisions and good lighting. This is not a 100 room, coolie cutter botique hotel, it is a 1,000 room historic property; every room is unique, and to fault the hotel for this is simply unfair. -SERVICE- The service at the Park Plaza has always stood out to me., The staff is attentive, proud of the character of the hotel and willing to do anything needed to make the stay better. The few issues I have had while staying were taken care of quickly and with kindness and class. If your room is too small, they will change it as best they can. If your room lacks something you wanted or had hoped for, they will attempt to get it done. Doormen are friendly and overly willing to assist, concierge is an endless resource for city facts and bellman are timely and efficient with luggage. Housekeeping friendly, always smiling, and hard working. -LOCATION- The location CANNOT, I repeat CANNOT be beaten. Steps away from everything in Boston: The Public Gardens, Newbury St., Boylston St., Copley Plaza, Beacon Hill, the Theatre District, and more-all within WALKING DISTANCE. The hotel has something to the effect of 3 restaurants within the hotel and dozens more directly outside its doors on all sides. -INTERNET- At the risk of starting to sound defensive, come on people! 12.50 for wireless internet! EVERY HOTEL, from luxury to mid range to low range, charges for the internet, most of them far more pricey than this. Those posting the hotel needs to \"get into the 21st century\" are unfair- IN THE 21ST CENTURY, ALL HOTELS CHARGE FOR WIRELESS INTERNET. Those who want what is usually a very reasonable room rate should not attack the hotel for instituting a fee for in room internet usage. I will continue to stay at this hotel for the foreseeable future. The location, the overall quality of the rooms, the staff, and the reasonable rates have me sold and unable to agree with most of the other negative comments here on this page.

Having friends who have stayed here before, I knew that the rooms wouldn't be the most modern...having said that, if that is what you are looking for, don't stay here. If in fact you are looking for a historic grand hotel with tons of character and charm, then definitely give this hotel some consideration! The room was decent-sized and well-appointed. We upgraded to a room with a king bed (In the towers, I believe). There was a large flat-screen TV which was a nice surprise. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the bathroom was smaller than expected. Again, if you are looking for sleek and modern, then look elsewhere- if you are looking for classic, clean and well maintained, look no further. (I did however find myself wondering why there was a bottle opener built into the back of the bathroom door!) The bed was very comfortable, and we had a nice view with a window that opened to let in some fresh air. One small gripe- when we called to order room service breakfast, I was told to look at the menu \"in the brown book on the desk\". Which we did, and upon making our selections from that menu, were told that that was an old menu. Not a huge deal, just a minor inconvenience. We enjoyed a nice room service breakfast on Saturday morning; I highly recommend the eggs benedict! We spent a leisurely couple of hours in the hotel bar early Saturday evening- lively yet not rowdy crowd, appeared to be a lot of conference attendees... our waiter was very friendly and attentive.

The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was impressive and I had high hopes of an exceptional stay. It did not take long for that go downhill almost immediately. When I first got in line to check in, I was told there was another line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although there were no signs to indicate as such, nor any clear delineation on how to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153register\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the registration desk being so long. Seems like a small irritant, so at the time I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think much of it. I registered and got my keys. I went up in the elevator and was excited to see my room; if the entrance was that plush, I was sure my room was going to be exceptional. Oh how I was so wrong. Oh how I was so disappointed. As I walked in, I was surprised at how small the room was. I thought to myself, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for almost $300/night, I would have thought I would have had a lounge chair or a small couch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some room to do some business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As I walked in the room, I noted the wobbly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sewing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chair for a desk chair, an unremarkable desk (stained I might add) with a partially functional light, and a wall that had cracked paint, chips, and even a long hole around the perimeter. As I was on business travel, the first thing I did was plug in my computer and access my webmail. Surprisingly, this hotel charges \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd internet (such as that which would utilize VPN). Again, as I was on business and needed VPN, I signed up for the more costly connection. If it is faster than the other one, I suspect the other one is using a 19.2k dial-up modem. I ran a speed test on the internet connection and it was rated BELOW 56k in speed. It was not even equivalent to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dial-up standards! Disgusted, I needed to use the wash room. Not even a light switch in the washroom; the light switch was on the outside. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was circa 1950 and it was the smallest restroom I have been in in probably 20 years. Returning, I tried to call down to the front desk to see if there was something wrong with the internet connection \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but my phone did NOT work. Of course. So on my way out to my convention, I let the front desk know that both my internet and phone was not operational. I was told it would be taken care of before I returned. Upon my return, I checked the phone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ahhh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a dial tone. But when I tried to use any of the quick programmed buttons (i.e., \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Concierge, Guest Services, etc.) they were non-operational, so I was forced to dial 0 and be connected. I then tried to access the internet and was again disappointed to see a ridiculously slow connectivity. I had better speed on the Airtran flight that I took out here. Wanting to unwind, I tried to order a movie. The service was not operational. I once again called down and was told it was out of order and would not be available until sometime tomorrow.

I purchased two one-night vouchers from a group buying site, at $139 each. When you subtract the $46 for the included valet parking, that comes out to $93 per night, which sounded great because it was labeled as \"53% discount\". But when I went to the hotel's site to book our room, I could have gotten the same room for $89, not including parking. Shame on me for not checking first. The buying site attributes full responsibility for the content on the \"deal\" to the establishment; this was, at best, blatantly misleading. I could not get any hotel person to tell me what rate the $93 was 53% lower than. Buyer beware and check out all the pricing options. Even $93 is a great price for the location. When we arrived to check in around 4 pm, the line for the front desk stretched all the way across the lobby, but it moved fairly quickly. Most people seemed to be speaking another language-- I heard Italian, German and French, so with the grandeur of the lobby you almost feel as though you are in a European hotel. From our experience plus the other reviews, I can only surmise that the experience at this hotel varies widely based on the room you get and who is staying nearby. We were in a King Standard room which was just fine-- a little cramped, but we were prepared for the tiny bathroom and pleasantly surprised by the shelving that had been installed above the pedestal sink and the toilet. Water pressure and temperature were fine, even on a high floor. The bed was quite comfortable, each of us having a regular pillow plus a body pillow, and the window opens! We were lucky not to have too much street noise, because the heating system is oblivious to the \"set\" temperature. We turned it down as low as it would go (64 degrees), but with the window shut the temperature just kept going higher. You can turn off the system completely, but then it gets stuffy. The solution was to leave the heat running and crack the window open (the ice tongs were great for this). We wanted to catch the update on Red Sox spring training, but NESN was not available. In fact, the channel lineup included in the hotel information binder was complete fiction; the \"real\" channel list is the one you get on-screen from the TV itself. My husband used the Wifi and didn't have any trouble getting and staying connected. We were on the side of the building facing the Expressway. While the fitness center is being renovated, the equipment has been moved to a large space off the lobby that clearly used to be a store. Lots of treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, a bench, balance balls, and free weights. Workouts were very pleasant. All in all, I would stay here again but would probably ask for the same room again so as not to take unnecessary chances.

As a result, I've stayed here several times a year for over 15 years. So I think I'm more than qualified to review this hotel. As much as I like older hotels, I really can't stand this place. Yes it's got a great location but aside from that there are so many negatives, that I never get a good nights sleep here. In fact, the only thing stopping me from giving this hotel the lowest possible rating is that I think you wouldn't believe me. So without dragging out the handwringing about writing a very negative review, let's get right to it: Pro: - Great location, just across the street from Boston Commons - Many wonderful restaurants nearby - New HD Flat Screen TV's Con: - It stinks. Literally, this place always smells. The lobby smells like a mixture of an old library and bus depot. Really. The hallways always smell musty and the heating and cooling units in these rooms don't bring in any outside air at all. The rooms smell of old carpeting which brings me to my next point... - It's old, and the rooms haven't been refurbished in over 15 years! The carpets are dirty, the walls are dinged up and need to be repainted, the furniture is old, broken and scratched, the windows won't open unless you happen to have a crowbar with you and the tiles in the bathrooms are cracked. In fact, I'd wager the bathroom floor tiles are the same ones installed in 1927 when the hotel was built! - The walls are paper thin. Noise is always an issue here. During my last stay, two women in the room next to mine were loud all night despite repeated reminders from security to keep the noise down. - Since it is a very old hotel, the roomsare an eclectic mixture of too little or too much room. Most rooms are so small you'd have to go outside to change your mind. Some rooms are large because they've taken 2 or 3 rooms and knocked the walls out to create a bigger space. - Heating and air conditioning is nearly uncontrollable. The rooms are always too hot, even in the winter. Several decades ago most hotels discovered individual in-room self-contained heating and A/C. Not here, the Park Plaza is still on the old central steam heating in the winter or cool water in the summer. The result is you're never comfortable. Let's say you have a early spring heat wave. Room too hot? Too bad. The hotel will still be on central steam heating and so no A/C. Opening the room window will do nothing other than to let in lots of noise courtesy of a nearby fire department that is always responding to emergencies with sirens blaring 24/7. On this stay, sure enough the room was too hot. First I couldn't get the window open. I finally was able to force it open just enough to let in the outside 15 F degree air, but it was so noisy outside, I was forced to get up and down all night opening and closing the window to moderate both the temperature and the noise. Hey, Park Plaza it's 2012! Time to get rid of your 18th century heating system! Don't even get me started about how hot the rooms are in the summer time. Since the water pipes just circulate cold water and a very week fan just blows across the pipes in your room, you'll never get the room cold enough to sleep comfortably. A very few rooms do have self-contained Heating and A/C units, but good luck trying to get them. Either they are always taken or the front desk staff doesn't understand what you're talking about. I've tried repeatedly to communicate to the front desk that I want a room with a independent AC unit, and each time I get the same old steam pipe rooms. - Because the location of the Park Plaza is so great, this place is always crowded with reunions, frat parties, conventions etc. As a result, there are always people noisily walking through the hall late at night into the early morning. And, because of the afore-mentioned paper thin walls and lousy doors, you're going to hear all of the sounds in the hall way. Combine that with a noisy neighbor and you've got a din of noise presented in full stereo. A couple of years ago, I was treated to a 4:30 am fire alarm evacuation. That was not fun. - Front desk staff is quite aloof and not very compassionate about your discomfort. This is a poor hotel, with poorly trained staff in a very old hotel trying to pass itself off as a upscale hotel. It is not. If the hotels location weren't so great, this hotel would have been shuttered long ago. It's living on past glories and an enviable real estate location. I really hate writing a review like this. But I'm not kidding when I say I find it difficult to find anything I like here. I have a love-hate relationship with Boston: I love Boston. I've had some wonderful times there. But, my visits are always tempered by my dislike for this hotel. I stay in a hotel over 200 nights a year. Many of them are terrific, the Boston Park Plaza is not one of them. If I were you, I'd go somewhere else. But, until I can convince my company not to put us up here anymore, I'll be trying to avoid coming to Boston and spending more restless nights in the Park Plaza.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood option in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Lifes_Too_Good", "ReviewID": "UR123422853", "Content": "Pros Good location Attached restaurants bars options Good dessert place open till late Cons Rooms could have bigger for the price Neutral Hotel seemed dated", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cComfortable older hotel\u201d", "Author": "christensen", "ReviewID": "UR123398921", "Content": "We lived in Boston for a long time and when we go back to visit we always stay at the Park Plaza.

The foyer is stunningly gorgeous with massive chandeliers. It is an old grand, historic hotel with an old fashioned d\u00c3\u00a9cor. It is not shabby in any way but well-kept indeed. We stayed in the queen room which was spacious enough, had the comfy bed and a nice view, and although the bathroom was small, it was adequate and looked like it had been recently remodeled. The location of this hotel is perfect. It is almost next to Public Garden/ Boston Common and 10 min. stroll either to Beacon Hill or Prudential Center. If you are not keen on walking there is a subway station (Arlington) approximately 150 feet away from the hotel. If I were to visit Boston again I would definitely stay in this hotel once more.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wyoming, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in the middle of everything\u201d", "Author": "Amy737", "ReviewID": "UR122623354", "Content": "Me and My boyfriend stayed at the Park Plaza for 2 nights.

It takes a lot for me to sit down and spend time writing reviews, but this hotel was so horrendous that I actually took three hours out of my schedule to write this and create an account here so that I could hopefully save one person from booking a room at this joke of an historical hotel. My boyfriend had a meeting he had to attend in Boston, and had never stayed at this establishment. Not thinking to read the reviews, he booked the hotel for 5 nights. A little background about us: I am what I would consider an unconventional student. I attend a very prestigious school, and during my time off, I like to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcroad trip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 around the country, and do some storm chasing, which, more often than not, leads me into having to stay at roadside hotels and motels, from chains big and small. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in every type of establishment imaginable, from small mom and pop motels and Motel 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, to midgrade Hilton Garden Inns and Hampton Inns, all the way to five star hotels such as select Hyatt and Hilton-branded properties. My boyfriend is long finished with his education, and has traveled all over the world and also has quite a bit of experience with hotels. I think that we can both honestly say that this was, hands down, one of the worst, most tacky hotels we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever encountered, and definitely a poor value for the price. This hotel is sold as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic, 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and so of course, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting the charm of the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s days of excess combined with modern amenities. That is not the case. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if this hotel strives to save as much money as possible while charging as much as possible to its customers. More on this below. My boyfriend and I arrived and checked into our room. It was a standard double room, with two beds (probably tmi but he moves around too much while he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asleep, so we often end up sleeping in separate beds). The first thing we noticed is that the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era door to the room would not close all of the way, and he literally had to run into it to get it to close. The next thing we noticed was the bathrooms. The toilets and tile appear to be original (there is no toilet tank, just a handle and a seat). The bathtubs are original but have had a recast put over them, so that the hotel could forego the cost of replacement, giving the bathrooms that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmobile home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-esque quality that we all seek in these fine establishments. The next thing we noticed was that the wallpaper was peeling off next to the tub, and that the border tile was coming off as well. Next to the tub was an old radiator, and the dial had been replaced with a more modern thermostat. The wire leading from the thermostat to the radiator had been partially caulked into the edge between the shower tile and the thermostat, leaving about six inches of it exposed. Right on the edge of the bathtub. Let me explain two reasons why this is wrong. Depending on how the thermostat works, the wire either carries an electrical current, or is used more or less as a mobile \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpull\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to adjust the temperature settings in the radiator (i.e., turning the dial one way or another tightens or loosens the wire, thereby changing the temperature of the radiator). So if this wire actually carries an electrical current, and is right on the edge of a bathtub\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 obvious electrocution hazard. If this wire is used simply as a mechanical feature, well, half of it was caulked into the edge, leaving it immobilized and unable to properly function. Please correct me if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wrong with these assumptions. Moving on, I filled the tub, and apparently the secondary drain wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, which led to the entire floor in the bathroom flooding with about a quarter inch of water. Nice for me, because my bag of clothing was on that floor, so now I would have to launder every piece of clothing I had. The bathroom sinks are pedestal sinks (as was common in the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), but were not original. There was virtually no counter space to set your toiletries, aside from a small area underneath the mirror. The toiletries provided by this hotel are from a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconcept brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (i.e., more or less an off- brand in its marketing test phase) and really are not any good. For the price we were paying for the room, we were expecting to have somewhat recognizable brands; however, I brought my own toiletries so this was not a huge issue. The next thing we noticed was the furniture. Again, one of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selling points is that it is an historical, 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era hotel. I understand that the furniture would probably not be original, but I was hoping at least that it would be somewhat of an imitation of 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s styled furniture. It was not. All of the furniture is this somewhat hideous, somewhat mismatched particle board disasterpiece, and none of it even closely resembles pre-depression styles. The overall layout of the room was unique, but it had its own problems as well. Trim and crown molding was coming off of the wall (and in some places, was entirely absent), and there were large chunks of paint cracking and peeling off of the wall\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Everywhere. The ceiling was also cracking. The walls were paper-thin (room service was ordered in the room next door, and we both kept checking our door because we thought we had heard a knock on ours), so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep well at all. The wall art consisted of framed photographs (something I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the decorating norm for the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), probably because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheaper to reproduce and frame photographs than to commission an artist to produce reproductions and place them in the rooms. Housekeeping wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcterrible\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really fairly judge the housekeeping when the hotel room you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying a premium for in Boston would be better situated in a slum in Beirut. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of like finding the decomposing corpse of a prostitute in the forest, and complaining about how its eyeshadow looked. Honestly can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of a better analogy. We found a pretzel underneath the set of dressers upon which the television was situated. There was hair in the bathtub and the shower. And the fees with this hotel, dear God the fees. They will charge you for ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Want a minifridge? Expect to pay $25 for this, and expect it to not be delivered for over an hour, and expect the deliveryman to BEAT DOWN YOUR DOOR to get you to take it (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry though, the minifridge had plenty of its own beatings from the looks of it). Want internet service? $12.50 per device, per day. Have a computer and a phone you want to use wifi on? Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. $12.50 each. As an aside, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think about using your cell phone here, either- you will NOT get service, and you will have to use the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone to make calls. Want to make a call? That will be $2.00 for each call, even toll-free calls, plus a premium for any minutes over 60 minutes. Want to print something downstairs in their complimentary business center? That will be an additional charge. Want to bring home a gift to the wife? How about a gift set consisting of a full-size bottle each of our off-brand shampoo and conditioner for $30 (they *actually* advertise this in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 t.a.c.k.y.)? I appreciate how this hotel tries to bill itself as a high-class establishment, but then has the audacity to attempt to sell you full-size bottles of its off-brand shampoo and conditioner for $30.00. Want to relax while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here and catch up on some TV? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to have many of the advertised premium channels. No channels after 39, even though they advertise somewhere around 50. Want to actually be productive while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I guess this hotel figures that since they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have internet and fully functioning phone service in the 1920\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to offer it now. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about the only thing this hotel keeps as a tribute to that era \u00e2\u20ac\u201c obsolete technology. The internet costs extra and was of poor quality. If you want to make calls, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be an additional charge, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect the phones to work either. The cordless phone was absolutely nonfunctioning, and the corded phone had a somewhat busted earpiece, so that I had to continuously ask the other party to repeat themselves. Overall, this establishment is pretty run-down, and will probably never realize its potential. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the appearance of the lobby mislead you- the rooms are disastrous and in need of true rehabilitation. I felt embarrassed for the original proprietors of this hotel after I stayed here. I would be willing to stay again, only if the hotel was sold to new owners and actually, legitimately restored. Otherwise, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here if I was paid to. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give this hotel negative stars, but you have to give at least one.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, in the right place at the right price!\u201d", "Author": "TaurusSaurus", "ReviewID": "UR122547541", "Content": "We stayed here for one night on Jan 2, 2012. I booked the hotel after much debate after reading mixed reviews on TripAdvisor, Google, and other travel sites. However, for a price of $102 for a Deluxe King Room, I couldn't argue. Our room was on a corner of the building and was sizeable. The linens were fresh, the bed seemed fairly new, the carpet was plush and everything was really clean. They even had a sizable LCD TV, with actual HDTV. Most places you go have the LCD TVs, but regular standard def. Anyway, the room was perfect for what we needed, a place to relax in the evening and get a nice night of sleep. I didn't encounter any issues with the thermostat, I simply lowered the temperature to 68 and it was perfect. I could even cut off the heating/cooling unit, had we gotten too hot or cold, so those complaints from other reviewers are unfounded. Complaints about the bathroom are valid, it was pretty small. Barely enough room for the shower, toilet and sink. However, being a guy I don't have an issue with it, as I shower, or use the sink and toilet and get out, and don't plan on spending hours at a time in front of a mirror. For that, it was adequate. Also you should remember that this hotel was built in the 1920s, so its historic and things may be small. In the end, this hotel is a great spot to spend a few nights. Its got a great location, its relatively cheap, and its easily a 4 star hotel. Is it 5 star? Definitely not on account of the bathroom. I feel like some people may be a bit picky on this site and expect a Ritz Carlton. The fact is, the price is much lower than many other hotels in the area, so any 'issues' you may run across are compensated for. Also, the complaints about $12.50/day for wifi are valid, BUT you have to remember EVERY other hotel in Boston, as well as most chains - Marriott, Hilton, Ritz Carlton, charge that amount or more for wi-fi. Its a way for hotels to make money. Back in the 80s-90s they made it off of phone calls, but now with cell phones they have to make up for it somewhere.

I will first say that we have stayed at other historical hotels in both Boston and Providence and have never had an experience like this. I will start with the Pros. Pros: The location. Cons: Everything Else. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The bedding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was a flat sheet, tucked around the mattress, disguised as a fitted sheet. Then another flat sheet. Then, a duvet with no duvet cover and another flat sheet laid on top of it. When you peel the bedding back, you essentially end up sleeping on an exposed duvet, thinking, who else has slept against this? \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The historical charm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while beautiful in the lobby, is disgusting in the room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maintenance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is considered piling layers of thick paint upon each other that chips, peels and ultimately looks like the paint job of a slum lord. The tiles in the bathroom are missing, and then the holes filled with gunk (which is a construction material filler). The crown moulding was butchered. They had chopped it in a variety of places and then either not seamed it together, or done it unevenly. Next time you do a historical restoration, hire a contractor who does historical restorations. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The HVAC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. Not much else to say. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s either off or on, but not really doing anything either way. It was comfortable during the day and sweltering hot at night. And you again begin thinking about that duvet as you sweat through the night. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The security \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is overbearing. It was New Years Eve. Room service closes at 11 PM. So we ordered a pizza after coming home from the fireworks. We were home before the bars closed and were comfortably changed into pajamas, makeup removed. Security refused to let the Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pizza man come up to the room. I had to go down to the lobby (which was insanely busy at 1:30 AM) in sweats, with no makeup and face the world, because\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guy might have ulterior motives? He was in a full uniform, with pizza in hand. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There are only basic cable channels, which is fine, but no NESN, so no Bruins. And if was Sox season, no Sox. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Boston, we like sports. And no pay channel to get a movie. Plus, we only had about 6 channels when we checked in and had to have someone come reset the TV. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Room Service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c All room service is overpriced, we all know this. But this hotel actually thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ok to charge a separate admin fee and a separate service charge on top of that, without telling you, so that when you sign in haste at the door, the employee gets 40% for taking 40 minutes to bring you a few beers on ice. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Pairings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The restaurant downstairs. We went for breakfast the last morning we were there. It was about half full give or take. We decided not to do the buffet, because why spend the extra money when we just want one plate of food. It took 40 minutes for each of us to get eggs. Which then came cold. And our server ignored us the whole time we were waiting. Luckily we had the coffee right behind us so we could self serve, but I was about to help myself to the buffet anyway after waiting so long. We spent $50 on a crappy breakfast. We stayed here because it was cheaper than anywhere else. I am someone who likes to get a deal and was excited at the idea of staying in a nice hotel for a good price.

We didn't have a chance to say no, don't come in, and I believe that is too early for them to be coming in to clean the rooms. - I disputed a additional surcharge for parking on my bill that was to be included in my package based on what was told to me by the staff who booked my reservation initially. The manager who I was disputing with would not acknowledge the logic of what I was saying, namely, that there was no way for me to know that I would be charged for this, since it wasn't mentioned to me by the phone rep, nor was it included in my email confirmation. Additionally, he said that I was told by the parking attendant about this charge when I was never told about this charge at all. They need to get their employees in-sync (phone reps, parking, and front desk staff) and their patrons need to be aware of charges that would be charged.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, very good hotel\u201d", "Author": "veffekt", "ReviewID": "UR122104239", "Content": "Don't expect to check in early, but if you ask they will call your cell phone the minute the room is done so you can walk around the area.

As others have reported, the main lobby space is grand, although I wish it had more seating surfaces for waiting (just a few wing chairs scattered about in a large space). Check in and check out were fast and efficient, and staff was friendly. Overall it was an OK hotel, but nothing to get excited about (except for the location). I stayed in two different king-bed rooms, both of which were quite roomy and had good-sized bathrooms. However, I believe both rooms were handicap-accessible rooms, which may have had something to do with the size. Both were interior-view rooms, with only a view of the other side of the hotel. The rooms were decently appointed, although nothing special. I've had just as nice rooms in a Comfort Inn (maybe even nicer). The king-size bed was comfortable, though. The reason I switched rooms was because of the heating issue... despite turning the thermostat way down it was still almost 80 degrees in my first room. The second room wasn't much better, and I resorted to opening the windows to try and cool things down a bit (but which let in a lot of city noise). Because it's an old hotel the HVAC is either on cool or on heat, and once they turn it to one or the other depending on the season that's all you get in each room. I don't expect to have AC in December in Boston, but I do expect to be able to cool my room down from 78 degrees in order to sleep. I was disappointed by the inability of the front desk to answer their phones, too. Twice I called to try and get the heating system worked out, and both times I was dumped into voice mail while calling \"Guest Services\" from my room phone. In both instances I had to physically go down to the desk, only to see several staff standing there with no guests in line. I've never had such a problem reaching a live front-desk person. Finally, their conference service was OK, but not the on-the-ball, \"how can I help\" sort of service that I've experienced at other venues. The meeting room was not freshened-up all day, and empty water pitchers sat on all tables without being refilled (despite me asking a staff person to fill them up during a break). Wireless Internet was hit-or-miss and expensive in the rooms and meeting rooms.

Here's the caution - they were the tiniest bathrooms I've ever seen. On one side were the toilet and bathtub and no space in between. The sink was at the end of the bathtub. There is minimal counter space and most of it was taken up by the rack holding shampoo, soap, etc, plus a tissue box and cups. So just beware -- not all the bathrooms in this hotel are the same. Bed was very comfortable and there was a flat-screen tv in the room. The view was non-existent - both windows looked out on an air shaft and another building. There was no closet - only a free-standing wardrobe about 20\" wide. (The bottom of this was very dusty, as I found out when a pair of dark slacks fell off a hanger.) One inexcusable oversight - I got out the extra blanket that had been neatly stored in a zippered bag in the wardrobe - hence the fallen pants - and when I opened it, discovered that it had multiple holes cut out of it. It looked like someone had tried to remove burn spots but only made it worse. I dropped it on the floor and it was left there the entire time of our visit.

All of the furnishings were somewhat dated, but we could have hosted a cocktail party with all the space. The bed comfort was fantastic. The fold out couch, not so much. TVs are old school console models. Parking is not provided by the hotel and is a to-be-expected high city rate ($35/day, no in and out). To be expected. We didn't dine at the hotel. Taxis are lined up outside and the T is nearby. So much is available within walking distance. Having seen two rooms, I was startled by the contrast. I would definitely stay there again but I would insist on a room on a higher floor that has a view. The small room would have been fine if it had the terrific view that the suite had and if we didn't need space for an extra person.

But, the peeling ceiling in the corner, the water that was warm/never hot, the non-functioning AC and the double charge for the Internet made it less than a perfect experience - quaint or not. I was a tad surprised at the cost for such an experience and will not to stay here again. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal taste. Squeezing in between bathroom door and sink with huge expanse of entrance floor space behind me I realized I just prefer to live in the 21st Century and this was too much 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

I called reception and they were very helpful and asked me to call back down for new key card for a twin room. The first room was an 'interior' room and was very modern and seemed to have been refurbished. (What I mean by interior is that the hotel is designed in a triangle shape so the window of this room faced into the windows of the other sides of the hotel). I would suggest this as a solution to the 'noise' factor mentioned in other reviews as I imagine that this room would be much quieter than a street facing room. The decor in the second room was more dated but it was spotless and other than a crack in the sink it was absolutely fine. The room was on floor 12 and we had a view of the city. Yes there was city noise at night but again I think this would be fairly normal to expect as it is located a busy intersection in the middle of a bustling city.

Expect that the hotel still strives to create the original hotel's elegance of days gone by. Beautiful chandeliers in the lobby tower over the carpets which need to be updated or cleaned. It's location far outweighs any issues of age or needing a facelift. Everything was very very clean. The hotel staff was very helpful. My housekeeper was great and did a great job. Although the room was small, the hotel was built at a time when this was the way things were done. In fact, each room having a bathroom was invented here. It was the most modern hotel around when it was built.The room I had was on the 14th floor with a nice city view. The heat was on and was stifling, but the window opens some. The maintainence personnel came in and took care of the issue right away. They still focus on service. The family next to me found the room too small with their baby and they were moved. Replacing them were some drunk tourists from another country who arrived back at 1am vomiting and talking loudly despite my yelling at them a couple of times. You can hear through the doors in the wall too clearly! So at 1:30am, I called the front desk so I could sleep. I was put on hold and once the history of the hotel started playing...I got out to the lobby in my pajamas to tell them I needed them to take care of the neighbors! The security personnel were immediately dispatched and since you could also hear them in the hallway, he was able to confirm my report. He took care of the situation and they quieted down. I did not eat any meals at the hotel. They have Keurig coffee machines in the room which was great. The flat screen tv should be mounted on the wall in front of the bed. Putting it to the right of the bed makes tv watching awkward. I wish my bed was a bit more comfortable. Perhaps the mattress needs to be replaced? While the bathroom is small, it is clean, the water is hot and most people don't spend the day in the room. The internet in your room is extra unless your wireless laptop is able to tap into another local signal. You can use the internet free in the lobby. I loved being one block from the Boston Common, the Theatre District, the T. This level of convenience far outweighed any of what I would consider small things that are reflective of a hotel 100 years ago. I was paying an off season rate. I might have been more fussy, if I was paying $400 a night. But for the $125 rate, I was really happy with my accommodations. There are also numerous restaurants in the area. Shopping on Newbury St. is a stone's throw away. If you are traveling with children, you may want to ask for a larger room. Since I travel alone often, I am basing my review on frequent travel experience. This hotel is a beautiful historic place and is across from the subway. If you are a tourist, you can get around very easily. I could hear traffic noise overnight even on the 14th floor. If you are concerned about noise, bring earplugs just in case. The baby next door did not bother my rest. Grown adults being idiots the next night did. The sirens of the apparently nearby fire station disturbed my sleep, the people leaving in the morning did not. These things can happen in any old hotel so I recommend that you give this hotel a try. Enjoy the history, location, and values available at certain times of year. I am not sure if dogs are allowed. I DID hear a dog barking down the hall near the elevators.

Given the generally high cost of accommodations in Boston, the Park Plaza is usually priced towards the mid-tier properties. The location is mostly unbeatable. There is a McCormick & Schmick's attached to the property, in the lobby basically. You're a quick walk to the commons, and a short cab ride away from downtown Boston proper. The rooms, at least the selection I wound up with, were quite small. My room had a double bed, small desk/credenza with a 37\" LCD, and a small armoire. There was room to maneuver around the bed and walk towards the bathroom. For the price, it seemed tiny. I also wound up with a view of the building across the street, so be friendly and be dressed! The bed was comfortable, and the room, in spite of being downtown, was quiet. The bathroom also lacked soap. I had to call down and wait almost 20 minutes for soap to be delivered, which made an already tight schedule even tighter. Thought the lack of soap was odd. Other than being older, the fixtures were functional, clean, and the property was being kept up. Parking is only available via Valet, $44 plus gratuity. The staff was ambivalent to us, and apparently only responded with a smile and friendliness if you greeted them with a tip. Poor taste IMHO.

You would think a hotel that purports to be higher quality would at the very least offer a complimentary shuttle service to and from the airport for guests. Not so here. Instead, they charge $17/person. Is this hotel so hard on times that the $400-500 it charges guests per night does cover such costs? Also, no complimentary wireless internet service. I've had better at lesser quality hotels. I realize there are some things the hotel can change and cannot. For instance, the hotel rooms were small to say the least. Ok, it's historic. But as long as you keep the rooms this size, at least install thicker walls. I heard every bodily noise/function of the guests next door. The guests on the other side were up partying till 3am. I think someone complained about the noise, and we even saw a hotel agent walk around our floor. Despite the noise, the agent declared \"all clear\". And the fitness facility was closed due to remodeling. Guess where the temporary facility was. A conference room of the hotel that was the size of a guest room. Imagine 2 treadmills, 2 eliptical machines and an exercise bike crammed into a small room with no ventilation. Thanks, but no thanks. Overall, the location was great, but for such a price, I was very very disappointed.

I had hoped to get a quick hot shower after a long day at work followed by a long flight, but the hot water was only slightly warmer than the cold. I did not call the front desk about that, since something like that must impact the entire hotel and not just my room, and there must be many complaints already, and so I waited until morning when yes, the water was hot again. Various items... The internet was via ethernet cable, 10mb speed, at $10.45 per day. Big flat screen TV but with no in-room movies and limited channels. The large room safe was free and big enough for my big laptop. Nice single-cup Keurig coffee maker (could use real creamer, not the powdered stuff). The bed was great, but the room had a slight insecticide odor. The bathroom had hairs all over the sink, and there was a sound of water dripping above the bathroom ceiling. Nice twin Speakman shower heads with great water pressure. Curved shower rod was not installed correctly, was loose and sagged. The room air conditioner must be as old as the hotel itself, some kind of high pressure \"induction air\" unit that literally howls when the air valve opens every time the thermostat kicks on, and continues to roar like a jet engine all night long. Finally, this morning, up at 4am to catch the early flight home, and... you guessed it... no hot water again. No time to waste with a call to the front desk, there would be nothing they could do anyway, so a cold shower, cold shave, and off to the airport. If they would raise the rent another $5 they would still be half of what the Marriott Copley rents for, but would that help pay for fixing their hot water heater and upgrading the a/c ?... or is this some kind of planet-saving energy conservation strategy by management?

We chose the Towers level in order to take advantage of the continental breakfast offerings and evening hor d'oeuvres and FREE wifi. Plus, on the 15th floor, we knew we should have a decent view. Check in was easy and uncomplicated. When we got to the room, evening hor d'oeuvres were being offered, but as we arrived late, the selection was severely limited to just a few pieces remaining. In my experience, the food is replenished frequently to allow all guests this service. They told us they would do the breakfast in the club lounge on the weekends and gave us passes to use in the restaurant, Pairings, on the ground level. That was acceptable. But, then we found out they didn't offer hor d'oeuvres on Saturdays and Sundays, and our stay was Friday evening through Monday morning! They didn't mention this on the website!! Our trip also fell over Labor Day, we were only given breakfast passes for Sat/Sun and Monday morning when we went to the lounge for breakfast it was CLOSED! REALLY?! So, we paid extra for the concierge level and only got 3 cookies and two breakfasts over a period when we expecting this service a total of 6 times!! THEN, when we arrived on Friday, I went to log onto the internet and it made me pay $10.45 per 24 hour period. The hotel service book in the room, stated that wifi in the Towers level was COMPLIMENTARY! I called guest services and their answer was, \"well, internet used to be complimentary, but it isn't anymore.\" What the heck?! So, basically, we paid a ton of extra money for a room with a view of south Boston, nothing special and barely any other extras. If you are staying over a weekend, I WOULD NOT stay in the Towers, it's a huge waste of money! Also, the walls are pretty thin in this historic hotel.

A little later my nephew, the groom, called to let me know that we were given his suite by mistake. The hotel gave us a room in the Tower floor to make up for the problem. The Tower room had more light and a far better view then the suite. And, unlike the suite, it had a refrigerator. The Tower floor has a small lounge where you could get a light (no hot food) free breakfast and Internet access on the one computer. The lounge is only open for a few hours in the morning and again in the evening. To use the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business center for Internet access costs $7 for 15 minutes or $28 an hour.

For those visiting Boston for the first time we I would recommend the weekly ticket on the T which cost us $15. We only stayed 4 days but still got our moneys worth with the added convenience of not needing to buy a ticket every trip. On our first night we wandered down Charles St. which was almost diagonally opposite us just between the Common and the Gardens. What a street- filled with lovely neighbourhood restaurants which we frequented on our trip. I particularly recommend the Paramount for breakfast. The hotel was spotlessly clean and had great character. The rooms were not generic and ours was a bit bigger than our friends but both were more than adequate for our needs. Free Internet access was available in the lobby. We asked for a fridge for our room and were told that they were only for those needing to store medication but they'd see what they could do.

If it were not for the discounted conference room rate, I would not have chosen to stay here, due to the mostly negative reviews. And unfortunately, most complaints against this hotel are valid. This hotel has only 1 thing going for it...it is smack in the middle of Boston, maybe 30 paces from Arlington underground station. Other than that...it was a let down. The hotel was massive. I would guess that my room at the \"back\" of the hotel was probably 500metres from the lift lobby...the room was EXTREMELY small, and did not even have a wardrobe, nor hangars. The bath was OK sized, but you could tell it was aged. Overall, the room was clean. Here is a video i took of the room http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ZNr_FhruE However, the biggest problems with this hotel have to be with the front/back office. I don't know why, but for some reason, upon arrival, they charge the entire cost of stay PLUS a deposit of US$100 per night, which given 6 nights was a huge sum of money. They claimed that this would be \"released\" upon departure, and the final bill settled...well, I have to check carefully when my credit card bill comes. However, i don't like this practice. I never see it done anywhere else... Also, they got my bookings wrong, and thought i was going to check out after 2 nights. After a lot of time spent hassling with the front office, they managed to sort it out BUT ONLY after they had charged me for 2 nights at the non-conference (higher) rates. Well, guess what? They couldn't refund that amound immediately, and would have to let accounting refund that amound LATER. Again, I have to check my credit card bill to see if that is eventually done... The front office staff, while trying to be nice, are essentially clueless. Assuming there wasn't a conference discounted rate for the room, i cannot imagine anyone wanting to pay the published rate and to get such small rooms and bad service.

Rooms: the sleeping space was fine. No one likes a box TV these days but honestly it functioned just fine. My window overlooked an inner alley. Eh. My bathroom was TINY.

I got a call in my room and went downstairs. When I got there, the valet was pissed off at me and blaming ME for the damage to the other car. He even said that it had damaged a NEW car in a tone that was like they're better than you. My car had some damage as well even if it isn't new. I can understand being told you should have mentionned it or something but not taking the blame for the whole thing. Being a student in this domain and working in the F and B department of a hotel that has valet parking, I felt like the incident should have been handled with more professionalism instead of pointing fingers at me. Even, the supervisor said, at one time, that it was my fault in front of the person who's car they it. At least they didn't charge me for the parking.

This is the first hotel that I will not recommend. I try to keep in mind the star level and amentities expected at each level when reviewing. Given the quality of the hotel and that Priceline called this a 3.5 out of 4 star hotel, I cannot recommend it. I would have been furious had we paid the full asking price for a night at this hotel. Thankfully, we did stay here for $160 a night, which is good considering the location. Negatives - This hotel uses it's history to highlight their style of decor and room size, but in my opinion, this place is not showing it's age well. It is simply out-dated and not up to the standards that it should be considering what their full price cost is per night. We arrived to our room, which was very small, and we quickly noticed that the bathroom was the worst part. The tile grout was moldy and dirty. The bathroom door could not be shut without trying four times to hook the latch fully. The toilet was dirty (not from lacking cleaning but with stains that were clearly from age) and it was commercial style - the flushing lever was like one that you'd see in a movie theater. Not acceptable for \"fine\" hotel decor. The sink had a very awkward ledge right where the water came out, leaving you hardly able to put your hands under the water. The televsion was an old tube TV, and again, as I mentioned previously, for what this hotel charges, there is no excuse for not having flat screen TVs in all of their rooms. Additionally, we could hear the people in the room next to us having casual conversation. Not yelling or speaking loudly over the TV, just simply talking. The walls are paper thin. There is also no free high speed internet. Again, related to the old tube TVs, this is 2011 - unacceptable for such a \"high class\" place. Positives - Our king size bed was comfortable, as was the bedding. There is an Au Bon Pain almost right next door to the hotel and this was convenient for us in the morning to eat breakfast. The hotel is very centrally located to anything in Boston and is also convenient to the T. The staff was pleasant and all were very friendly to us. These were all helpful. Given our overall experience, I would not use Priceline again in this area of Boston and risk being given this hotel.

It's not an issue that the TV was not a flatscreen, but the giant box TV took up such a large portion of the room. It truly was cumbersome. 5. There was no \"express\" checkout. You had to go to the front desk and physically check out. Kind of obnoxious to wait in line when there was nothing I needed to change on my bill.... 6. Lastly, there was a very large prom or graduation group at the hotel on a Thursday night. From about 5PM-3AM, there was no relaxation or convenience for \"normal\" guests...just tons of teenagers running wild. Beer cans, drink cups all over...partygoers passed out in the elevators and stairwells, screaming & yelling in the hallways, elevators packed to the brim with kids going up & down to their rooms. I didn't call to complain, as I'm sure many other guests did. I was told the next day by my colleagues that the hotel front desk even stopped answering the phone. However, in writing this, I hope that those who read my review will ask ahead of time when making their reservation if there are any large groups staying at the hotel. If there is, expect all peace & quiet to cease to be.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cHoliday Inn would have been the same but cheaper.\u201d", "Author": "niesz", "ReviewID": "UR108403036", "Content": "My husband and I had dreamed of staying there someday, and we finally had the time and some extra money.

We mentioned that it was for our 10th anniversary and were treated like it was our 50th. Upon checking in, which was seamless, we received a room upgrade and privileges on the Towers floor ,15. This meant we got access to the lounge, where they have a continental breakfast buffet and appetizers in the evening (along with a cash bar). We felt very welcomed right from the start. Minutes after we checked into our room, there was a knock on the door. We were delivered a bottle of champagne on ice, two flutes and four chocolate-covered strawberries, and a note in the room also welcomed our stay. We enjoyed the drink and treat very much, but the thought that they put into the gesture meant even more. The hotel is about a 30-second walk from the Arlington \"T\" stop, in a very nice area of town. (Hermes is the first store you see when you surface from the subway.) :) Tons of restaurants are nearby (several attached to the hotel) and it's an easy T ride to a ton more. Newbury Street (the high-end shopping destination) is about a two-minute walk away as well. In addition, Fenway Park is two stops away on the T, so it was very convenient for these baseball fans. As for the rooms themselves, I would say they were very clean (and I'm a germaphobe/neat freak). You have your typical hotel scuffs on chair legs but everything else was very clean and tidy. The rooms have neat historical features like crown moulding and the bathrooms are still very historic feeling. They are definitely small but totally adequate. I liked the blue tile and felt like we were staying a bit back in time. It was fun to imagine the hotel back in its first few years. Some reviewers have complained about street noise but we had a corner room and weren't bothered by any of it. Others complained about the TVs being tube CRT (not flat panel) but we really didn't care about that. There's definitely wall space for when the hotel upgrades all the rooms to flat panel TVs, but the TV they had worked just fine. We also liked the Keurig coffee maker! All in all, if you want a nice room, in a nice area of town, with hotel employees who treat you very well and go the extra mile, I'd recommend the Boston Park Plaza.

That's certainly the case with The Boston Park Plaza Hotel. While this hotel has a great location and is just a block away from many good restaurants, its owners have not kept the old hotel current and it really shows its age. My room was a standard double with two twin beds, a desk, old style picture tube tv and very small bathroom. The beds were comfortable with nice linens and slept well. The desk had wired high speed internet and the TV had a decent selection of stations but was small and old. The room itself was clean but felt old and I noticed paint pealing off the ceiling in several places. The bathroom is where the room really felt outdated. It was very tight. The sky blue tile was probably original and had badly yellow stained grout. The tub/shower had been recently renovated cheaply with one of those tub inserts that covers the old tub and tile with a new one. When you stepped in the tub, you could hear the insert crunch and pop under your feet because it didn't fit the old tub properly. It was an extremely cheap makeover. While I'd rate the room as average, the bathroom was definitely worse and not appropriate for this grade of hotel. The public spaces of the hotel were fine but honestly, nothing to write home about. The hotel was very ordinary in that sense. Service was average too. No one greeted me at the curb when my cab pulled up and the front desk staff was polite but didn't try to be friendlier than was required to move things along. Finally, while this is a Starwood MANAGED property, it is not a Starwood PREFERRED GUEST property. Didn't know there was a difference? Neither did I. When I saw the Starwood logo on the hotel's web page, I just assumed it was like every other Startwood property and I'd earn points and stay credit. If you dig around on the hotel's page and find their FAQ, they explain that they don't participate in the SPG program but it's hardly obvious unless you hunt for that info. In fact, the hotel collected my SPG number when I booked the room and the stay showed up in the SPG iPhone app as an upcoming stay. Whoever owns this place is obviously extremely cheap. Not participating in the program is crazy especially when other Starwood properties are close by.

Even though it's the closest hotel to my Boston office, I will avoid staying there again at all costs. I stayed for 3 nights. My first night, the room next door seemed to be used as a baby-sitting room for a bunch of kids. It sounded like 20 of them shouting in my ears until well after midnight (even with ear plugs in). Not the hotel's fault (except for the thin walls) and I knew I could call down and change rooms, but I was just too tired to get dressed, repack, etc. The street noise was also really loud, despite being on the 12th floor. And the ice machine on that floor didn't work. I called the next morning and they put in another room on the 14th floor facing the back (not the street). In this room, the outside noise was minimal/not an issue. But the radiator sounded like Niagara Falls when I turned up the heat. I had the choice of freezing or sleeping. The first night I went with sleeping and woke up bitter cold. The next night I went with being warm. I did not call to complain because I didn't want to change rooms a third time and one of my travel companions had the same complaint so I figured it was a crap shoot to try to get yet another room. On checkout, I was not asked \"how was your stay\" - so I wasn't given the opportunity to give feedback. Other negatives were that in the 1st room, some TV channels had so much audio buzz I couldn't watch them, in the the 2nd room the TV image was yellowed. Also - one of my pet peeves - the ice bucket wasn't emptied of melted ice/water after my 2nd night even though I left the lid off, and when I came back it was on (so the cleaning crew definitely saw it was used). Other negatives - no bill under your door so you had to check out in person, and no in-room wi-fi which meant working at a desk instead of in the comfort of bed.

We were on the 5th floor just above the \"Whisky Bar\" - aka the nightclub of the hotel. Would not have been that bad if it weren't for the feeling of sitting at a concert, but wanting some peace and quiet. After 30 minutes we knew we couldn't last another 2 hours til the club closed. We called the front desk and they moved us. We didn't know they were moving us from a king room to a queen room. Ok, whatever, i was tired and we were on the 11th floor on the other side of the hotel - quiet?? Noooo. Fell asleep and was awoken at 2pm by a group of drunken people - in rooms on each side of us and it felt as though they were in our room. PAPER THIN WALLS.

However, after 5 minutes, the guy to one side began throwing up like crazy!!! I will never forget that sound - I hope he was in the bathroon!! Sounded like he was in our room!!! My husband and I had to laugh. So needless to say, we got NO sleep that night. Next morning, we ate breakfast at Pairings and it wasHORRIBLE - the buffet was the smallest thing I've ever seen.

First the pros : - great service, staff was extremely professional and made our stay great. For example, they switched us to a suite when our neighbor smoked against hotel policy and the smell got to our room, they tried to locate my son's nightlight that we forgot in the first room, and when it did not turn up, sent us a teddy bear to the room for him! I usually stay at 4 stars hotel, was at the Taj on our last Boston stay, and service is as good at Park Plaza as any 4 or 5 stars; - bed was extremely comfortable, with duvet pillows and all white sheets; - suite was quite big, and decoration on par with other hotels, I've been to a few 4 stars hotels in Boston, and I always got pretty small rooms so that was a nice change; - free wi-fi in the lobby and in the suite; - location close to shopping Newbury street, Boston common, as well as Arlington subway station, with young children it is one of the best located hotels in Boston in my view ; - historical feel of the hotel, you can feel the Statler 1920's ambiance, from the piano bar to the elevators style, to the doors shape, we loved it; Cons : the only real con is the size of the bathroom, yes they are small, although in a suite you get 2 small bathroom so at least you don't have to share with husband! As for the size of the room, the first room we got was a king size bed and very nice size (for our son's crib), they showed us a smaller room when we were switched (was small but same size as room at the omni), and we ended up in a big suite. I believe we've seen almost all sizes available and even the smallest was similar to what you would get in another Boston hotel.

Looking on here for advise i was a little worried because of the mixed reviews. However, i was really, really happy with our stay. We stayed here for two nights. We checked in at 1pm, even though check in says 3, and the guy at the desk was very friendly and helpful. I told him we were going to a celtics game that night and asked him if he knew how to get there. He pulled out a very helpful map and circled the stop to get off on the T subway, he also told us the stop to get off for Quincy market as well. Checkin was very smooth and fast, no problems at all. So when we arrived to the room, i have to admit they were a little small and outdated, for example no flat screen, and the batchroom was small and needed to be \"refreshed\" with a newer sink and toilet. Not that they were gross, they were just very out of date. The bed was very comfy. Another problem with the room was the temperature. It was so hot at night we had to open the window. The temperature does not go below 65 degrees. The hotel was very clean, has a lot of nice places to eat and the T subway is a block away. The Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant, was very nice, a little expensive, but something different. Overall, i dont understand all the complaints about the rooms. To me when your on vacation, the majority of your time is gonna be walking around the city, having a good time, the only time your really in the room is too sleep. So my belief is if the room is clean, and comfy its fine to me, and these rooms were both. If i was to rate this hotel on a scale of 1-100, i'd give it a solid 90. If the bathrooms and rooms were a little more up to date i would not hesitate to give it a 100.

It has been snowing this weekend, and though both of my windows are securely closed, I am feeling a strong freezing breeze blowing on me. The closed shades are actually blowing away from the window. The wall in front of me has poorly painted-over patches, the ceiling dips down, again poorly painted in order to cover the cracks. This is far below what one would expect from the hotel rating and price. This is a Starwood hotel, and as a Starwood Meeting Planner member, I am quite surprised at the state of this room. After reading numerous reviews, and also knowing a couple who held their wedding at the hotel (and who felt that the hotel serviced their event wonderfully), it seems that there is a vast difference between the quality of many of their rooms. Aside from the front desk and wait staff, I found the majority of the hotel employees to be rather cold and put out if asked for assistance. I am a very pleasant, patient, and cordial person when interacting with staff, and was surprised by poor customer relations I was met with. Absolutely no complementary breakfast (and I'm only talking about coffee and toast) is provided, and I must admit that the $10 price tag for a bowl of cereal actually made me laugh, shake my head, and walk away. If you are a business traveler with an expense account, and manage to land a good room, then this hotel could be okay. Otherwise, I would avoid it completely. I would also avoid the $46 a day valet parking, and simply drive around the corner to the parking garage (the same one that valet parks your car in) and pay the $30 a day general rate. When we pulled up and asked the doorman where we could park, he really pushed valet. When we stated that we would prefer to park ourselves, he completely dismissed us, turned and walked away. Wired Internet access is available in rooms for $11 a day (slow connection) and $13 a day (advertised as faster), and wireless is only accessible in the restaurant. (bring a long extension cord because of the few outlets available for power, only one socket is located anywhere near to a table. This can also apply to the hotel room, as sockets are limited there as well.) Lastly, in the evening (9pm) it took several minutes for the water temperature to come up to a luke warm level which was still too uncomfortablly cold to shower in.

Don't let the lobby fool you- the rooms are old and falling apart, the beds are very uncomfortable, our tv cut out every 15 mins or so, there was a radiator that would not turn off so the room was boiling and when we told reception we were simply informed \"some of the rooms have that problem\" and they suggested that we put the air conditioning on. The AC is preset to have a minimum of 67 so that didn't work. Overall it was a very uncomfortable night but what topped it off was when getting our bags the man didn't speak but scowled at us and then held out his hand for money. As we walked outside to get a taxi to the airport the doorman was tried to shove us in one of the unmarked shuttle buses that was parked outside- they quoted us $30 a head (a taxi costs less than that for all of us) and then the doorman tried to bully us into taking it.

As others have mentioned, there is no free wifi in the room which is a mild inconvenience. One of the hotel restaurants did offer complimentary internet access, however.

The front desk was amazing. We had a fracas with the taxi system in Boston and ended up on the wrong part of town, but seeing my sweaty exasperated face...the front desk immediately upgraded us to the Towers. Now taking this into consideration, this may be different than a regular room. It also included a concierge and free happy hour and breakfast! :) Still, the fact is that this hotel is an older hotel. I'm from Vancouver and the reason why people stay at Hotel Vancouver is for the nostalgia. If you want modernity - go to the W. If you want a great location with fantastic restaurants close by, fantastic staff, comfy bed, clean and functional shower & bath area (yes it is small, but based on how the hotel was built, there is no way to fix this unless you completely demolish it and rebuild it!). We actually thought this was better than our hotel in New York which got a higher trip advisor rating (mind you our expectations were higher) and more comfortable (huge room and bed) than our hotel in Chicago (Affinia). Again, like anyone who reads Trip Advisor, if you are researching your hotels, you know what you are paying for.

If you are looking for a cheap and casual but good place for breakfast or lunch go across the street to the Park Square Building and eat at the Park Square Cafe (next door to Subway). My husband and I both ate breakfast for $12 total.

This is despite receiving a free upgrade to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tower room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which basically means you had free wifi (all hotels of this price-point should by rights have free wifi, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pet whinge of mine), access to the breakfast room (we did not use this though) and your own floor concierge (again, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avail them of their service). The floor also has its own elevator (there are six elevators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of them services exclusively this floor) The question you will ask yourself when booking is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is the upgrade worth it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My answer here is no. But with caveats. I use wifi a lot, but if you get an ordinary room, its expensive here. Across the road is a Starbucks. Not only do you get a better coffee, you get to use their free wifi. I also do not generally suffer through bland hotel breakfasts so this was lost on me. Concierges are contentious subjects. In this internet day and information age, some local knowledge is no doubt extremely useful. Its just that not all concierges are created equal. I did not use these guys so will not offer an opinion. Dedicated lift banks are nice but really, will this mean I rate this hotel higher? Probably not. The upgraded room itself was modernish, is of good size, linens were fresh and clean, the in room dining options looked extensive and the beds were, in my opinion, a tad on the soft side. Flast screen TV with plenty of viewing options were available too, as shld be the case with a hotel at this price point. It had an in room safe and the bathroom was of a good size (and notably clean) Worth highlighting that I did NOT see one of the regular rooms, so can not offer a fair comparison (the points above are the exceptions) Location? Back Bay is my preferred area of Boston, and the wedding was around the corner so that was perfect. You are about a 10 minute walk to the Prudential Building/Look out and the assorted shops. There is Champions Sports Bar in the Marriot there which I can recommend for atmosphere and food. The Phillies were playing the Red Sox when we were staying, so to point out the obvious.. easy access to Fenway Park. Overall? Nice.

The tiles were old light blue tiles and the bottom portion of it were white tiles that come to find out since one of the showers was SO small and bumped my elbow on it, weren't even real tiles. It's this plastic cover that moves in when you touch it and the mosaic floor, disgusting!!!!! Dirty grout, tiles broken, faucets don't even match on the sink and the sink is so old and small. The handle to the shower says hot on one side and cold on the other, but when you actually move it, it's the opposite! And the sinks are pedestal, so you cannot put anything on it comfortably. Then I requested turn down service, which they told me that it's not available on my floor, B-U-T, I had asked the front desk after I made my reservationsand she didn't even bother to ask me my reservation #, or anything and so she told me all about it and I was so excited. Time comes, I asked for it and housekeeping or room service said we don't offer that on your floor, but she would do it as a courtesy. Wow, great! Guess what?? never got it! Then since this was a Birthday special stay (meaning, you pay full price $ 335.00 first night and 2nd and 3rd night you pay the year that you're born), which is a great deal if this was a great hotel, so anyway, they offer champagne and chocolate covered strawberries 4), the champagne tasted like beer, disgusting and cheap.

I thought that they were in the hallway the entire time, but actually they were in both the hallway and room right next to us and you heard them like they right outside your door, that's how thin the walls are. I had to call the fornt desk twice.

The bathroom was large in size with a full bath and seat in there, so perhaps it was a disabled access room (explains the size?). My only complaint about the room was the noise associated with the old heat/cool system, so loud. The room was next to the ice machine too, so some noise. The breakfast was sufficient (fruit plate, berries, muffins and coffee with juice) and there were no complaints with service otherwise. There was a candy/drink machine in the iceroom which was convenient also. But they didn't accept many coins or notes (evens ones listed, just shoots them back.. randomly), so I think they need updating or calibrating.

The hotel is very old and only some of the rooms are renovated. The first day I checked in, they put me in the tiniest hotel room I have EVER seen. It barely fit a queen bed, one nightstand, and a small dresser with TV on top. And the bathroom was so small that I could sit on the toilet and wash my hands in the sink and my feet in the shower. And the bathroom was old and dirty (hairs on the floor) and the bedroom carpet was awful. Not to mention the fact that my headboard shared a wall with the elevator shaft! I tried to get them to move me, but they said they were oversold that night but could try to move me the next day. They also said the elevators would shut off at 9 pm so it shouldn't be as noisy. 9 pm came and went and the elevators still went. All through the night they went on and off and I barely slept a wink. So at 6 am, I decided to get up and go to the front desk. That guy was actually very nice and tried to be accommodating by offering me breakfast which I already had with my group. I asked for a renovated room and he was able to get me into a handicapped king which had been renovated and was MUCH nicer than the room I had been in. It was a normal size, had nicer bedding and bathroom, and was just in general much more pleasant. If I had gotten that room to begin with, I may have given it a slightly higher rating although the walls were still quite thin! I was frustrated that I lost a night of sleep though since the room was already available at 6 am when I complained!

My recommendation is to pick another hotel such as the Fairmont Copley, Four Seasons, Taj, Back Bay Hotel, Marriot Copley, or Westin Copley for comporable prices. Pros The Park Plaza is a fantastic location, situated in the Back Bay, very close to the Public Gardens and Boston Common, a short walk to Newbury Street shopping and Copley Square. It is not surprising that it is just steps from both the Four Seasons and Taj (formerly Ritz Carlton) hotels. In addition, the staff is very friendly and courteous. Cons I understand that rooms in downtown hotels are often small, however, these are postage stamp size. I could live with that if it was the only flaw. Also, the furniture is sparse and low quality. The bed was uncomfortable. The TV was an old style with low quality resolution (not a flat screen). The only chair in the room was a rickety desk chair, so no place to sit and watch the TV, unless you want to lie on the bed. Calling out the quality of the toilet paper may seem petty, but it is indicative of a hotel that just isn't keeping up with its competition. The Park Plaza has apparently found that one way to save money is to buy cheap toilet paper. I don't expect to always get the highest quality, but this stuff is the type that you would expect to find in a McDonalds off the highway. Finally, I had a very bad experience worth noting with my electronic key. When I checked in I was given a room number on the 6th floor (a good ways from the elevator). After walking to the room, I found that the key card wouldn't work, so I went all the way back to the lobby. The same guy who just checked me in (and was friendly) told me that he had mistakenly written the wrong room number (story sounds suspect, but I can't prove it). So, he gives me a new key with a room 3 doors from the original room. After 5 tries with the key card, I get in to find my previously noted postage stamp room. A couple of minutes later, I decided to walk down the hall near the elevators to get some ice. When I returned I tried to re-open my door and couldn't. (I expect that most readers would think that I am deficient with a key card, except that I actually had a maid cleaning another room come over and re-try the card for me and she couldn't get it done and said I needed to go back down to the lobby). So, I see the same guy again and he gives me 2 key cards to try. Thankfully, one of them worked and more importantly, that I didn't need to leave the room again, because I had no trust I would be able to get back in. Overall While the Park Plaza is nicely located and clean with friendly personnel, it is in a very competitive area with comparably priced hotels that beat it in every way. It does not seem that the management is even trying to put up a fight to be competitive. I highly doubt that they have many repeat customers.

We had lovely time in Boston - the weather was gorgeous, and we walked all over town - from the MFA to the waterfront. It's also a good thing that the weather was so perfect, because we would have been miserable if we'd been stuck inside. Our room was tiny - so small that we were constantly in each other's way. We had a view of a construction site. The bed was very comfy, but there are not many amenities in the rooms (TV and reception poor, no conditioner, one bar of soap for the sink and the shower, no way to heat water for coffee/tea). The high speed internet, for which we paid $10.45/day, was not wireless, so you were tethered to the desk. No, these are not a big deal, but in a luxury hotel one has certain expectations! The bathroom was also very small, and not particularly nice - perfectly acceptable, but not luxury hotel quality. Also, we could hear everything that happened in the adjoining bath - so were awakened several times to hear the vomiting of the person next door who drank too much on Saturday night - which we could hear in bed, on the other side of a wall and a door. Not very restful, and just plain gross. All in all, this hotel did not ruin our weekend or anything, but if we'd been paying full price for the room we would have been extremely disappointed. It needs to be remodeled, and perhaps better insulated between baths. In the end, this hotel's pretensions of grandeur (and the lobby is lovely) are not matched by what you find in the rooms - not even close.

I took mass transit into the city to my hotel. It was easy, cheap, pleasant, and calming. I remember that the last time in Boston I was stuck in a tunnel in traffic and the cab ride was costly. This is what you do: when you arrive (I arrived in terminal B), I went to the Information Concierge in the baggage area. A wonderfully coiffed, smiling lady told me what to do: walk to the machine with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153T\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd near the Information Desk, purchase my weekly pass (or day pass or single fare ticket). I used my credit card and chose the 7 day unlimited pass for bus and metro for $15 (I was staying four days). She told me to step outside and stand by blue posts and board the #55 bus to the Airport Station. The bus arrived within minutes. It was quiet and clean. We stopped twice to drop off or collect passengers at other terminals. At no time was the bus crowded, loud or uncomfortable. We arrive at the station in minutes. I used my weekly pass to access the Blue line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inbound.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I needed to get to the Arlington station on the Green line. The station is a block from the Park Plaza. I change at Government Station. The Airport Station was clean, well marked, and had operating escalators and an elevator. The metro was clean, organized, and each stop was announced. The connection from the Blue to the Green lines was simple. This is when I realized I had arrived at a highly civil city. Not one piece of paper anywhere in sight, no noise, no graffiti - absolute civility. When I arrived at the Arlington station there was a large map of the neighborhood. A policeman was standing in front of the map and when I said I needed to find the Park Plaza he directed me to the right exit and told me what to do adding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you blink, you will miss it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He was right. I arrived at the hotel with my roll-on carry-on and laptop. It took me less than 35 minutes (from the airport), including transfers, and the one block walk to the hotel. And it was sort-of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since I had purchased the one-week metro/bus pass. I knew that the return to the airport from the Park Plaza would be equally simple. The Park Plaza lobby is old-school elegance. Not as grand as others but it is elegant, clean, and welcoming. I waited a few minutes for a Front Desk attendant. The Front Desk attendant was excellent. He was pleasant and professional but not overly friendly. I think he was amused when I told him I had used mass transit to get from the airport to the hotel. I urged he recommend this option to other hotel guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fast, extremely pleasant, easy, and cheap. My room was not ready but for the first time ever, he asked for my mobile number and said someone would call me when my room was ready. I was amazed. In all my hotel stays in all my years of travel throughout the world this was the first time anyone offered this service. He suggested I leave my roll-on and laptop with the bellman and enjoy the city or relax in the comfortable lobby. I chose to leave my luggage. It was handled quickly and efficiently. I did not have change with me and asked the bellman if he would be around in a few hours when I returned. He smiled and said he would. It was nice not to feel pressured to leave a tip immediately. I walked outside and realized what other readers said is true. What a superb location and after all, it is all about location, location, location. I walked to Newberry Street to find a wonderful m\u00c3\u00a9lange of high-end stores, boutiques, spectacular galleries (with museum-quality art). I enjoyed visiting some of the galleries and seeing art which I would not otherwise see as it would likely go into private collections. I walk along Newberry until I stumbled onto Bostone Pizza (which has also been covered by readers). Well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true. Delicious dough (not chewy), wonderful flavors, and reasonably priced. It was a walk-down small location with a few booths and some counter seats. It was perfect for a quick bite. When I returned to the hotel my room was ready. It was a deluxe King. Yes, it had two small, but very clean and functional bathrooms. And one large room with a wonderful king size bed. The TV was just fine. Not flat screen but it had a clear picture and functioned properly. The furniture was fine, nothing extravagant. It was clean, not broken, functional, and comfortable. The bathroom and room had an ample supply of wrapped plastic cups which were just fine. The toiletries were also fine, nothing extravagant but just fine. The corridors were very clean and pleasant looking. I loved the old-world elevators which functioned very well and required your room key to access the floors (added security which is nice). Honestly, I had no complaints. I am amazed by some of the reviews. I could not find anything wrong with this very nice hotel. It was just fine for the price. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll return to the Park Plaza on my next trip to Boston if the price remains competitive.

Now, together, these two, teeny, tiny, tired bathrooms would have made one normal sized bathroom - why the hotel has not bothered to combine them is a huge mystery to me. First, they were still tiled in 50's light blue tile - a clue as to the last time they were renovated? The sink also looked distressingly original, with a rubber stopper instead of a more modern levered stopper. However, the bathroom was so small and the bathtub stuck out so far into the tiny room that I banged my knee on it every time I approached the sink. Also, the bathroom door didn't quite open all the way, since there was a towel rack behind it, and when opened, the door came about 2 inches from the sink (did I mention the bathroom was small?) As a result, between the bathtub and the bathroom door, you had to angle your way through an opening of about 12 inches to work your way to the sink. It was awful.

Further, the other folks at the front desk seemed courteous and helpful when approached by hotel guests. A few comments about the Deluxe room we stayed in...The room was well-maintained (not 4-star quality, but I wasn't expecting this). Bathrooms, as others have noted, are tiny, and the tile floors could use a little refurbushing. When I asked about why the rest of the hotel was updated but not the bathroom floors, one of the employees indicated that the tiles were untouched to retain hotel's \"charm.\" For me, the small bathroom size was not a big deal, but I can see how it might alter the experience for some. Regarding amenities, we weren't a frequent consumer of the hotel's ancillary offerings. We didn't use the business center (not free), breakfast (expensive), gym (I'm building a tire, if you know what I mean). So, buyer beware. The hotel's lobby is fantastic. Christmas decorations were already up, and there is plenty of seating - several guests were reading newpapers or enjoying take-out dessert. Very spacious and luxurious setting, all in all.

Last but not least, the location is perfect. The Arlington station (green line) is less than a block away. Boston Common/Public Garden is a block or two away. Chinatown is a 10-minute walk (with kids).

I've always heard the name and thought it would be the epitome of comfort and elegance. I was wrong. The Best Western I stayed at in a small town in California had more luxury than this supposedly 4 star hotel. When you walk in, the lobby is grand and it's right near Boston Commons and the subway station so you can't beat the location. However, the facade hides what's lurking in the hotel rooms. It's fine if you are just looking for a place to sleep for a few hours and then you are out of there. However, I'm one who likes to revel in the comfort and coziness of a hotel room after a long day or night out sightseeing and this didn't do it for me. First of all, the room keys are a joke. This is an older hotel built in 1927 so they added card keys instead of regular keys but every guest I talked to had problems getting their doors open. You could stand there for five minutes and the darned thing won't open. When we finally did get it open, the disappointment was palpable. The rooms are some of the smallest I've ever stayed in. Comparable to those little European hotel rooms. We had two bags and could barely fit them in the door. We looked for a closet - but there wasn't any! There was a tiny wardrobe that my husband and I had to try to fit our clothes for a week in. The bathroom was small and outdated, and I don't mean charmingly outdated. Just old. No storage for anything here either. There is a place in a small TV cabinet where a small refrigerator could go but there was no refrigerator in the room which is standard in most cheap motels, much less one that's supposed to be superior. If you are coming at all on business and you need wireless, don't come here. They only have phone lines for it and the line is so short that you have to sit at the desk. It would be nice if it would have at least stretched onto the bed. O.K. I struck out on the room so I thought I'd go out and explore. I called the concierge for a simple question but since they only have one concierge for hundreds of rooms, I waited 20 minutes before I hung up. I went down and there was a line to speak to her. There were other people working behind the desk but they weren't concierges so I guess they never thought of coming over and helping to get rid of the lines by at least answering simple questions. By the way, this wasn't a one time thing. Unless you go at 10 or 11pm, there's always people waiting. They are getting enough money for their rooms that they could at least half two people working there to help out. I tried to go on the TV and check their hotel channel to see what the local happenings were but guess what? The area video and information channel didn't work. I guess you've guessed that I won't be staying here again. To me it looked like a hotel on the brink of a changeover.

Upon arrival no one greeted us, took our bags or even opened a door for us. We had paid for the \"tower level\" service and it was nice to be able to go straight to the 15th floor for our check-in but the greeting we received was hardly welcoming. Our room was so small. A couple times I was whacked by the bathroom door by my spouse because it was so tight in there. There was only one robe is the closets (and no promised slippers) bringing me to the conclusion that generally the room was used for one person not two. A few things in the bathroom had been updated (they advertised new marble bathrooms in the tower rooms) but the bathtub bottom buckled and creeked under our feet (I'm only 125 pounds). The room was in OK repair but slapping a coat of paint (paint spray was on door locks and furniture told the story) right over dents and dings doesn't mean an upgrade. We requested, and never received, turn down service. The concierge was never at the desk to help us out with problems or answer questions. The room was very noisy. Not that people were being loud and disturbing us but city noise came in loudly through the window and any little sound out in the hall was heard loudly in our room. The tower lounge was nicely appointed but the food & beverages were only available for a very short time each day. Breakfast had minimal offerings and was just average. The \"happy hour\" offerings were no better than a local bar, hardly what I was expecting from a luxury hotel. The staff in the lounge was more annoying than helpful. Save your money, this upgrade is not worth it! This hotel also claims a fitness facility but it was a small, poorly maintained room with a couple pieces of equipment.

There are so many restaurants within 5 minutes of walking. We checked in at exactly 3PM. We had two rooms. One room wasn't ready but the other one was. On our way up to one of the rooms, we were called to say the other room was ready, so we only had to wait an extra 5 minutes. The rooms were small but it was only two of us in a room so we didn't need much space. The bathrooms however are tiny and do not have fans or any ventilation beside leaving the door open. The shower was extremely quiet. I had read reviews about thin walls but we didn't hear anything beyond the occasional door shutting in the hallway. The shades were hard to open and close and need to be updated but they did a good job of blocking most of the light from the outside. The fire alarms went off at 2:30AM on Saturday night/Sunday morning and the spoken instructions weren't clear on whether or not we were supposed to evacuate. Lots of heads were poking out of rooms because nobody knew what to do. We knew where to go to evacuate, but we didn't know if we were supposed to or not. I opened the door to the stairwell and the alarm stopped. It wasn't very comforting on the 12th floor at 2:30AM not knowing if you need to leave or not. Their evacuation and emergency alarm procedures need to be updated to be more specific and clear. We were never given an explanation about what the cause for the alarm was.

I can honestly say every member of the hotel staff that I encountered (with the exception of the bellhops/doormen who were wonderful) was rude, uninterested and oozed a sense of superiority. From check-in to purchasing breakfast items, everyone made me feel as though I was a bother, rather than a professional attending a conference. My favorite incident was the service at a formal luncheon. A colleague and I arrived 10 minutes late for lunch because we were entertaining questions after giving a presentation (in a conference room that had a bathroom with a very loud flushing toilet, btw!). Soup had already been served, and the staff was rushing around the ballroom collecting soup plates, even though the other members of my party who WERE on time were not even 1/2 finished. When my fellow latecomer asked if her soup could be warmed, she was YELLED at. The quote was, \"Well, if you arrived on time, you wouldn't have to worry about cold soup. Next time be on time - we don't have a way to warm your soup. There's no nearby microwave.\" CLASSIC. Managers were equally uninterested and rude when expressing these described problems. Our room was consistently dirty. Moreover, one morning when I called for an iron (the one in the room was broken), I was told that we couldn't have one for over an hour because \"all the housekeeping staff is in a meeting until 9am\". I questioned how it is possible that they do not have any housekeeping service between the hour of 8-9am, and no one could provide me with an answer. After 3 more polite, but persistent calls I received an iron. Another evening, we called and asked for an extra blanket because we had a cot and it only came with sheets and a blanket that was so over-used it was see through and about as thick as a 2-ply tissue. We were brought extra sheets and told there were no extra blankets - there is only 1 comforter per bed and comforters cannot be removed from unused rooms. No exceptions or additional accommodates are ever made for blankets. It was 12am, so we gave up after 2 phone calls and 1 visit. This is supposed to be one of the better hotels in Boston?

I booked through Expedia and got a rate that was much cheaper than what was advertised on the hotel website. Unfortunately, even for about $100 off the regular room rate, I still feel like I got ripped off. First of all, the room was tiny and dingy. We were on the 5th floor, but when I looked out of our window, I saw only a rooftop right at our level, and several other hotel rooms directly across the way. We got absolutely no direct (or indirect) sunlight and couldn't even keep the shades open because anyone across the way could see right in. That alone wouldn't rate such a negative review. But after dinner and drinks, we came back to our room with hopes of watching some TV. But the TV channels were all so fuzzy that we could barely make out the picture. They had cable, so I'm not sure why the channels looked so terrible, but we couldn't watch TV at all. Overnight, the air conditioner in the room clanged and clattered, keeping us up all night. The next morning, when we went to take showers, there was no hot water. After about 15 minutes, the water still wasn't warm enough to actually shower in, so we just decided to shower at our hotel in Maine that afternoon. Also, there was no actual shower stall, just a curtain that separated the shower head and drain from the rest of the floor. So after running the water for a while, the entire bathroom was soaking wet. As we were getting dressed for breakfast, housekeeping burst into the room, even though the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was clearly displayed on our doorknob. We went out to breakfast and then came back to check out. I complained about the TV, AC and lack of hot water as we checked out and the desk agent asked me if I called anyone to come repair it. I told her that we obviously didn't, as we didn't find out about the TV until almost midnight, and we didn't find out about the lack of hto water until that morning. She said that she couldn't do anything for us because we prepaid for the room. She offered us a free breakfast in the hotel restaurant but I told her that we'd already eaten and asked her if she could comp us our valet parking ($40). She refused.

The hotel is VERY regal, full of history, as can be seen in the chandeliers and mouldings, and original tile in the bathroom. The room we booked was, understandably, very small, but completely sufficient. It needs a little updating, but it was more than sufficient for our needs. We didn't utilize the restaurants, shops, or room service, so I can't speak to those aspects of the hotel. Check in was easy, no problem. We found our room with little difficulty. Bed was VERY comfortable, and there was a plethora of pillow choices. Cable was great, nice deep tub in the bathroom, everyone was pretty friendly. The one main downside of this hotel was that the walls were VERY thin. We could hear arguments going on down the hall, and we could hear EVERY word. I've never come upon this problem before, and was a bit confused as to what to do. Eventually it just stopped and everyone, presumably, went back to sleep. Other guests were stomping their feet on the floor and banging on the walls to get them to stop, but they were obviously intoxicated and oblivious. It was 2 AM. We could also hear other guests down the hall having a completely different and seemingly more pleasant interaction. Very clearly. I'm not sure if it was the clientelle was that there that weekend of if the walls are particularly thing, or a combination. I like to go away and be alone, but this aspect made it difficult to feel like you're alone. You were aware of everyone all of the time.

I did eat a couple of meals in hotel restaurants and food and service were both very good. The rooms at the hotel are another story, however. Small, ordinary, and--at least where I was--very very noisy. I could hear the phone ring in the next door room as well as any coughing etc. Doors along the hallways in desperate need of oiling instead of the squealing noise that each of them seemed to make. And the heating system was so loud, I turned it off and had a cold room instead. And there was no way to lessen the incessant street noise outside. I seldom have trouble sleeping when I travel, but this was not a good experience. One positive: the shower in the bathroom is really good--two power heads, as others have noted. But the bathroom was tiny--closet sized (and it must said that the closet in the bedroom was less than closet sized--also tiny) and dated. I liked the original tile floor but toilet/basin/faucets needed upgrading. The shower curtain had a number of small, but nasty stains. Both the bedroom and the bathroom desperately deserved a fresh coat of paint--I've seen dorm rooms in better condition. Overall the room seemed out of step with the public areas of the hotel and the hotel's image of itself.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "brandon manitoba", "Title": "\u201cfenway park\u201d", "Author": "dreams4u1961", "ReviewID": "UR21232219", "Content": "Our first trip to Boston and we can't wait to return. My husband's dream was to see NY Yankees play at Fenway Park. The dream became a reality. We stayed at the Boston Park Plaza which we found to be a great central place to stay. It was located within walking distance to a wide assortment of things to see and do. Boston Common Park, Cheers bar!, Gray Line bus depot, Fanueil Market, Fenway Park, Commonwealth area and Copley Place to name a few. Everyone at Park Plaza were friendly and helpful. The room was great with the exception of the small counter space surrounding the bathroom sink. A little over priced at $399.00 a night. and food a bit pricey so we ate elsewhere. We felt safe at any time of the day as we were walking, walking, walking. Details: we booked Wrentham Village Outlets which had great shopping bargains. Yes ladies......5 hrs. of solid shopping! With the location of the hotel we only had to walk 1 1/2 blocks to the bus depot. This depot is also where you can book and catch the trolley tours, duck tour, etc.. Fenway is a brisk 40 min. walk from the hotel. Cheers is located on the other side of the park (couple of blocks from the hotel) which is an approximate 10 min. stroll. This takes you into the Commonwealth residential area which is a great reminder of our Europe vacation. Narrow cobblestone streets with flower boxes and wrought iron railings. Beautiful. The hotel is also adjacent to Newbury and Robson Streets which are popular with pubs, restaurants, shops, etc.. Charley's on Newbury is a must for some great food after a day of sightseeing. Lots of Au Bon Pain eateries for some on the go healthier eating alternatives. Tips on purchasing reasonably priced ball tickets would be appreciated. I ended up purchasing tickets online so we had guaranteed seats for our trip. The price was ridiculously inflated @ 4 tickets for just under $1200.. The price printed on the tickets when I rec'd them was $45.00 each. With the weather not being a guarantee one of the games ended up getting rained out. Great disappointment after paying that steep of a price for tickets. Guess one out of two isn't bad. Could have been worse if both games were rained out. We will return to venture the trolley tour as well as Cape Cod and whatever else our hearts desire.

When we checked in, the hotel offered a complimentary upgrade to a \"towers level\" room, which provided a complimentary continental breakfast, evening hors d'oeuvres, complimentary local and long distance phone calls, complimentary bottles of water in the room, bathrobe and slippers, upgraded marble bathroom, and nightly turndown service. Of course we opted for the upgrade and after taking the dedicated elevator that ran only from the lobby to the 15th floor towers level, found the room to well exceed our expectations. The room was small, after all it is an old hotel, and the bathroom was fantastic. The window opened, albeit a total of about 3 inches, but enough to let a cool Boston breeze enter the room. The towers level lounge was nice and the complimentary breakfast and hors d'oeuvres were tasty (although the same breakfast was served every day). Our only problems with the hotel involve several \"clerical errors\" that resulted in large pending charges to our credit card. We checked in on a Saturday and Monday we discovered a $1500 hold on our card. My husband went to the front desk and explained the situation and was told that there had been a clerical error and our room charges (which had been prepaid in March) were charged to our card instead of to hotels.com. The staff promptly cleared the hold and instead placed a $400 hold for any incidental charges ($50 a night for the 8 nights we were staying). We had no other problems until we were returning home the following Sunday and discovered a $757 hold on our card. This was after checking out and being told that we had no charges. My husband called the hotel and they explained that there was another \"clerical error\" and that the charge would not be processed. Today is Tuesday and the charge is still pending but has not cleared. I will watch it closely. While we were pleased with the hotel accommodations, we have been very displeased with the \"clerical errors\" affecting our credit card. I definitely would expect more from a 3.5 star hotel. Perhaps they were just hoping to make an extra buck - who knows.

To be clear, the review below is for the non-Towers side. I stayed in a Single King Size room, approx. 300 sq. ft. based on the Expedia description. The review for this size room/hotel is as follows: Location: the hotel location is great - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right near the Public Gardens, Copley Square, Newbury Street, easily walkable to the Freedom Trail and Beacon Hill. A CVS is within walking distance up Boylston Street in case you fly and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pack toiletries. I took Amtrak. The hotel is within easy walking distance from the Back Bay Station. Additionally, plenty of eateries nearby - chain, non-chain, fast food, etc. Lots of people out and activity in the area, so safe to walk around. Service: adequate. Staff ok, not overly friendly. Received wake-up call at the wrong time. Room: bed - comfortable. Space: fine - not overly large, but served its purpose. The rest of the room: thoroughly lacking - nail polish splatter on night stand, paint chips on the walls (one rather large chip), lampshade peeling, TV remote did not work, bobby pin, and other stuff on the floor. Bathroom: old but fine. Bottom line: I booked this room through Expedia and got a good rate for the room - I had called another hotel (4 Star) and their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153petite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd economy room was 155 sq. ft and $10 - $20 more for the days that I stayed in Boston. Other Back Bay hotels were much more expensive. Despite the favorable location, I would think very hard about staying here again - it would probably depend on area hotel rates. Out of curiosity, I did a search on Boston hotel rates in June, and the room I stayed in was showing up almost $100 more. At the $159 rate I paid, I was still disappointed (although, I realize everything else in the area was much more expensive). However, once you hit $200+, given the condition of the room, I think that would be too much, and I would go across the river and stay in Cambridge where hotels seemed less expensive.

Yes this is an older hotel, which we knew going in, I think some people just expect too much. the room on the 15th floor was very nice, yes the bath was small, but so what it was very clean which is the most important thing. nice vview, great bedding..we got to hotel at around 12:30 in the afternoon, front desk was very nice, got right into room....had a drink in bar then took cab to the Garden...less than $10.00...cant beat that.. after game (which was incrediable by the way), back to hotel, went to the Conceirge who got us last minute dinner reservations at Mcormicks and Schmidts...very nice.. the hotel is very beautiful, staff very nice, and th best location, and great price, not sure what all the complaints are all about. If you realize from the get go that this is an older hotel with great character flaws you will love it..I would definatley go back again...perfect for couples and families....", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "GMill", "ReviewID": "UR16043983", "Content": "Reading all of the reviews prior to going to Boston, I feared our stay at the Park Plaza.

Internet access cost $10 and our room's cable was broken, so we were unable to access the internet (and it took several calls/discussions to get the internet charge removed from our bill, I'm still not certain that we were successful). Despite directions, housekeeping took old towels and replaced them with new ones (but not enough, so each day we were required to hunt down housekeeping and get an additional towel). The hot and cold water in the shower was poorly regulated and went from cold to hot at random. Also, when booking the room, we asked to have a cot placed in the room.

It's been pointed out that the place is a bit frayed around the edges, and I'd agree with that. For the most part, though, the place is nice, if dated. The problem is that the walls are paper thin and it seems like they're catering to rowdy, loud clientele. Around midnight the floor we were on, which was the eight floor, apparently turned into the party floor, with kids (late teens, early twenties) running around, yelling down the hallways, loud music, etc. It was like being in a college dorm We called the front desk and after some discussion were moved elsewhere. That seemed to solve the problem until around 3:00 in the morning, when something similar happened in the new room. I went downstairs to talk to the front desk in person, and was told that the noise was probably because the bars had just closed and that everyone was coming home. From what I could tell, a fight between drunken idiots had broken out diown the hall, and this guy was giving the \"aw shucks, just people heading home after a night of fun\" routine. He did point out that it could be worse with a \"you should see the eight floor\", which, of course, was where I started. Ultimately, a manager appeared and was at least apologetic about the whole thing. They also refunded the charge for the room, which I do give them credit for. I think the problem is that the weekend rates are pretty low, which attracts guests who wouldn't otherwise stay at a \"luxury\" hotel, the walls are too thin, and they don't really have adequate. I appreciated the manager taking care of the bill for the room, and he did seem like a good guy who was trying but just a bit overwhelmed, but all the same, we weren't looking for a free room, we were looking for someplace nice where we could enjoy our special occaion and that was totally ruined.

The hotel room was not large, but it was large enough with a wonderful sturdy king bed with all the frills (pillows, quilts, etc.) you could ask for. Pleny of drawer and closet space. A nice 25\" TV. The bathroom was small, but the shower--with two shower heads--was as good a shower as I have ever had at any hotel. The staff was very personable. The business center charged $10 for 30 minutes on the internet and I had no problem with that at all.

I am a 44 year old professional woman more accustomed to being addressed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Doctor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but Ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122am, Miss or even Lady would be preferable to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Honey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 2) On our last night at the hotel, we had the unpleasant experience of encountering an extremely strong and pervasive odor of marijuana when we returned to our floor for the evening. 3) Adding to the overall experience of our last night in the hotel, I was awoken at 3:30 in the morning by a security guard slipping a piece of paper, with our checkout charges, under my door. Consequently, it took me quite a while to go back to sleep and I was exhausted in the morning for our trip home. 4) When I brought the issue of being rudely awoken to the attention of the front desk manager, I was told, \"Oh, that was security how funny.\" 5) When we checked out, I brought this issue up again and asked if it would be possible to avoid having the charges slipped under my door, if we came back. The young woman who waited on us responded with a very hesitant \"I guess\" and then proceeded to argue the point of whether I had in reality been woken up in the first place. To say that her attitude was argumentative is to fall short of giving her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shpiel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd justice. It is a rare experience in my life to have another person accuse me of lying, and, while the young woman's statements fell short of that particular accusation, it wasn't by much. 6) Despite being addressed in unfortunately familiar terms, surrounded by illicit drugs, woken up in the middle of the night, and accused of lying by the staff, we decided, as a matter of convenience, to make our reservations at checkout for our next trip in December. At this point, the same young woman in question informed us that there were no available rooms. In fact, according to her, the hotel was overbooked.

I've had a couple of forgettable stays here, as well as a couple of satisfied experiences. They have many room configurations here, but the lowest-end rooms are really low-end. And the problem is, there are many of those and you could get stuck in one if you're unlucky. The lowest-end room that I'm talking about is really tiny. I'm talking probably less than 200sq feet, with a tiny bathroom. And both times I got stuck with those, my rooms were facing a small coutryard (if you can call it that) fully enclosed with other wings of the hotel. So you're pretty much looking right into other hotel room windows directly across. It's not a pretty sight, and privacy is an issue unless you keep the curtain closed. The other times, I actually stayed in a decent-sized room facing out to the street. These rooms were still small, but they were more like 250sq feet or so. I would say these rooms were a legitimate 3-star experience. Regardless of which room type you get, my experience has been that the rooms are pretty clean with nice bed linens and such. I still think this place needs to do some major renovations to modernize some aspects of the guest rooms. But the showers always worked well and the carpet was always clean, as I can best remember. I do remember that the walls were not the thickest... sometimes you could really hear the noise from next door. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It's one block from Boston Commons and the happening Boylston St, 2 blocks from Newbury St which is Boston's chic vibrant shopping street. Chinatown and the Theater District are also nearby. The hotel is 1/2 block away from the nearest subway stop (Arlingston St). In spite of all the negatives about this hotel, more often than not this is the ONLY decent hotel in this area that's affordable. For those of you who say the location is the most important thing, it's hard to beat this hotel. As far as eating inside the hotel, I've only eaten at McCormick & Schmick's. I used to love this restaurant and I've gone there about 10 times (both as a hotel guest and otherwise). For some reason, I feel like the quality there has plummeted the last couple of years. On the other hand, there are many decent restaurants nearby that I like better. Like Fire&Ice, PF Chang, Rustic Kitchen, Legal Seafood (mind you, some people still prefer McCormick & Schmick's to Legal). In summary, this is a hotel I'd probably rather not stay at.

As I was on my way out to meet a group of people for dinner, I stopped at the front desk quickly to inquire about this situation. I said that I booked this room quite a ways in advance and could not live out of a suticase for 4 days and that I wanted a better room than the one I was given. I was told to stop by the next morning as they were fully booked that night. Due to convention schedules, I was able to stop by the front desk in the early afternoon, at which time I was given a room on the 12th floor at a rate of $20 cheaper per night. This was a little bigger and better, at least it had a closet and a bureau. But the bathroom looked as if it was simply thrown together in a mishmash-old fixtures and shower that you could not even turn around in. But hey, I settled for a place to put my clothes.

It was actually luck of the draw that I ended up here as I used hotwire to book my room. As you may know, Hotwire won't tell you the name of the hotel until you have accepted the price on your credit card...a risk that paid off in this case. Our flight from Atlanta was actually an hour EARLY believe it or not so we got to the hotel much earlier than expected. We were relieved to find that our room was already available, so we got an hour head-start on our activities. The room itself was very nice; it's obviously renovated as the building itself is old. Back in those days, I guess you didn't need a lot of space, so that still holds true. I definitely wouldn't try to fit a family of 4 in a room; but for a couple, it's perfect. The beds were comfortable, the view was good (I was looking South, so there wasn't much to look at), and the service was fantastic. My only complaints I guess were that the A/C didn't get very cold and that Internet access wasn't free. I find it funny that your cheap hotels provide free internet access, but your money-making hotels have to charge $12 a day. Kinda lame in my opinion. But all in all, I was very happy and would recommend the hotel. It's right on the T-line (green) at Arlington, so it's very convenient. It's also right across the street from the Boston Public Gardens and Commons. Its location, coupled with the unlimited \"T\" pass allowed me to see EVERYTHING I wanted to see in Boston in 3 short days...including the Sox!

The smallness I don't mind, but the stickiness I don't need. The decor was intended to signify high class, but the quality of finish (chipped and dirty paint and tile, 50-year old hardware, woodwork, and even a vintage 1950s HVAC system!) destroyed that vain attempt. The bathroom was too small to swing a kitten, which again is no problem unless you lay the thing out without any concern for the idea that people will need to use it. Sinks of miniscule depth located directly under shelves are fine if you want to splash like a dolphin or crack your head open on a daily basis. Did I mention the outlets? Don't plan on using more than 2 electrical devices in your room. Clearly more than 2 surface-mounted retrofitted outlets was going to bust the rennovation budget on this place, as was any kind of decent internet access. The modem was screwed into the bottom of one of the desk drawers (I found out because it was broken and a tech had to come and replace it), presumably because otherwise the clientele would steal it? So I ended up ruining two pairs of trousers on the screwheads that protruded underneath the desk, while trying to work there. That leaves a nice impression too. The crowning glory was a 1:30am fire alarm that sounded without cessation for 10-15 minutes, which although apparently a false alarm (sadly the building was not afforded the opportunity for a proper gut-job rehab) caused all (500+?) guests to evacuate the hotel into the lobby or the street, in complete confusion with no more than 5 hotel staff in evidence. I hate to think what would have happened if there had been a real fire. Conclusion? Don't stay here. It's not nice, it's not classy, and it's not efficient or even clean and modern in any way.

There really is so much to do and see in this great city and I would definately stay at the Park Plaza again. My only complaint is that they do charge you for local calls.

We arrived at app. 12:30 p.m. and were able to check into the room immediately. The desk staff was very friendly. I had booked through priceline and had heard that this particular hotel gave priceline customers the worst rooms. The woman at the desk asked if we minded having a king bed instead of two doubles (the default request from priceline). I indicated we would prefer the king bed and she said that the king bed room was much nicer than the two double beds room. Only at the end of the transaction did she notice that we had booked through priceline, so I do not know if that made a difference... As everyone has mentioned, the lobby is lovely and twice during the week we stayed there, I saw myself the huge fresh flower arrangements being changed. I held my breath upon opening the door to our room, nervous as to what we'd find. I was thrilled to discover our room was really quite lovely. It was a very large corner room with the king-sized bed and a sofa, desk, dresser, etc. My immediate impression was that it was very clean. The rug had no stains that I could see. The sofa had some light stains, but nothing more than I have seen at other hotels. I checked the bed for signs of bed bugs and was relieved to see nothing indicating their presence. The bed linens are all very white and surprisingly clean. I didn't even see any light staining anywhere. As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the beds are very pretty, with many pillows, etc. Being in a corner room, we had a very large, walk-in closet with lots of hangers. The bathroom was definitely just fine, although small in comparison to other hotels. Everything was clean, although you can see discolored grout, etc. We were lucky to have what appeared to be a very new bathtub. Getting ready in the bathroom is not particularly enjoyable. The sink is so small (and low?) that when trying to splash water on your face, the back of your head would actually hit a shelf above the sink. The lighting was not flattering. The toilet was about one inch away from the bathtub. The bathtub was VERY narrow. I am average size and could barely shampoo my hair without both elbows hitting the wall and shower curtain. The bathrooms might benefit from the curved shower rods being used elsewhere, except I think the toilet might be too close to use the curved rods. There was a full-length mirror, but it was deteriorating (i.e. many spots due to the \"mirror\" flaking off). All in all, everything was clean, but not especially easy to get ready. We stayed at the Park Plaza for eight nights and personally had an excellent visit. As others have mentioned, the location cannot be beat and we got an excellent price on priceline. HOWEVER, I do think it would be very possible to have a very unpleasant stay here, mostly depending on your luck in getting a room: 1. The elevators are definitely a huge problem. There are only six elevators for the many, many rooms in this hotel. It seemed like the weekdays were fine (very slow, but at least not packed with people), but the weekends (esp. evenings) were truly a nightmare. On the Saturday evening of our stay, there were approximately 45-50 people waiting for the elevators at one point. My husband and I walked up to the twelfth floor rather than wait. We planned on walking everyday, but discovered that the doorway from the staircase into the lobby is only unlocked for certain hours each day. In essence, you're forced to take the elevators, even if you're willing to take the stairs. (Maybe someone knows a way around this? We were afraid to set off the door alarms...) 2. We were lucky to have very quiet neighbors, but you can definitely hear EVERYTHING going on in all the rooms (and bathrooms) around you. You can hear people coming and going as loudly as if they are entering your own room. You can hear muffled conversations when people are speaking in normal tones of voice. You can hear toilets flushing and shower srunning. You'd really be in trouble if you had loud neighbors! 3. We were in a non-smoking room, but there were several times throughout the week that I could smell smoke very strongly in my room. Luckily, the windows opened. 4. There were 3-4 times over the course of the week that there was the definite smell of sewer gases coming from our bathroom, generally in the early afternoon. It would go away within an hour or so, but that was also a very strong smell. In summary, in comparison to a brand new state-of-the-art hotel, the Park Plaza is definitely not luxurious by any means. However, everything was clean (I cannot believe there would really be rats...) and, in comparison to some newer hotels I have stayed in in the heart of NYC (another big old city), the Park Plaza was really a FANTASTIC old hotel. If I had paid $250-300, I would probably be disappointed simply because it was not a refreshing, luxurious hotel.

Evidently, this is a historical location in the center of Boston. The hotel had some positives. It was a great location, and I was able to walk to many tourist-y attractions from the hotel. The freedom walk is close, as is Boston's central park, and the high-end shopping area is just a couple of streets over. There are a lot of chain restaurants within a block or two of the hotel, such as Au Bon Pain, Legal Seafoods, P.F. Chang's, California Pizza Kitchen, and others (Italian, Irish, etc.). The subway, or \"T\", is also a couple of blocks away and gave me easy access to other parts of the city. The lobby is really nice, and there are a couple of restaurants and a bar (which I did not try). The front desk employees were attentive, quick, and pleasant, and the concierge was really helpful in providing maps and information about the historical sights in the area. However, overall the hotel was average to below average. The rooms were really, really small, including the bathrooms. The bathrooms had a full sized shower and bath with a curved shower rod to maximize space and a pedestal sink. The water pressure was low, and the water in the toilet and the bottom of the shower often would become covered in sediment from the pipes/water. It was one of those bathrooms where you had to shut the door to really use it, since it was so small. The towels were old and really thin, not the plush, large towels you like to see at this price-range of a hotel. The tile floor was dingy, and was either stained or flat-out dirty. The bedroom was ok, just small and a bit dingy. The furniture was a bit beat up, and I had to reconnect the cable to the TV myself to get it to work. Internet access (not wireless) was available, but it was about $12 a day. There was a desk and chair to work at. The king sized bed was pretty comfortable, and the linens are all washable (I hate it when they have the gross, never-washed comforters, so this was a plus for me). The room was clean as well. The walls, however, were really thin, and I could hear every conversation the man in the room next to me had (including rather unpleasant screaming matches laced with obscenities with his wife/girlfriend). The room services was AWFUL. I tried it a couple of times, and it really was bad. The breakfast was barely warm, and the quality was poor. The belgian waffle (!) was so bad, I couldn't even eat it. The spaghetti was unpalatable. I haven't had room service this bad in a long time. And, it took upwards of 45-1 hour to receive food, and it was really expensive, with service, some sort of room service tax in addition to regular taxes, and a hotel surcharge or something included. The room service delivery employees were also not very pleasant and seemed really annoyed when you didn't give them a tip above the 20% tip already included. One even took the bill from me, and, after noticing I had forgotten to put the hotel pen back in the fold, said contemptuously: \"uh, are you going to give me my pen?\" When I gave it to her, she grabbed it, spun around without saying a word, and slammed the door. If you forgot to put a \"privacy please\" hanger on your door, housekeeping was knocking (and quickly entering) by 8:30 am. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this hotel. It was just average, but it was represented as a really high-quality, landmark hotel. I wouldn't stay here again. Note: We were told it was a Starwood property, but that is a misnomer.

Moreover, I have stayed in several New York and Boston hotels where the sheer cost leaves me to feel shortchanged. Yet, the Boston Park Plaza was one of the worst values and the biggest disappointments so far Across the street from the Four Seasons and near the Boston Commons, this hotel is in great location. Combined with a stately fa\u00c3\u00a7ade and posh lobby, my initial impression was very favorable. In fact, there was a Lamborghini parked in front of the Whiskey, which is in the same building. Sadly, my initial high expectations led to a huge disappointment when I ultimately saw the room. Even before reaching my floor, I was getting the impression the hotel was not operating anywhere near that of a five star property. The first red flag was the rather heated discussion I had with the front desk associate who tried to put me in a smoking room. At first, he claimed my corporate travel agent had requested a smoking room. When I produced a printout of my reservations that clearly said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nonsmoking requested\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he indicated that it was only a request. Okay then, so I specifically did NOT request a smoking room. In the end, I was given a nonsmoking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room, which was far worse than those in most mid-tier suburban motels. The first thirty second experience upon entering the room gave me the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you have got to be kidding me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feeling. The furniture was rickety and circa 1970. There were many visible gouges and scratches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c almost as if it appeared that much it was acquired at a thrift shop. But what irritated me most was that the desk was so small and the chair so uncomfortable. It was extremely difficult to work. Instead of having a nicely padded chair to use while working, the hotel provides its customer with what appears to be thirty-year-old dining room chairs that have been garbage picked. While I was most concerned about my productivity, it was quite a shock to see the condition of the aesthetic elements of the room. There were visible stains all over the carpet and scratches on the walls. Giving the hotel the benefit of doubt, these items could be ascribed to wear and tear and poor planning of capital investments. But wait for the real shocker \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the bathrooms (oddly, my room had two tiny bathrooms). When first glancing around diminutive bathrooms with their old fixtures and tiles, disappointment quickly sets in. This disappointment turns to shock when opening the shower curtain. What could be so obviously horrible about a shower even before it is turned on? The size. They were not large enough for an average-sized adult. The stalls were a bizarre irregular shape that was about two feet wide and two and a half feet long. The showerheads were angled into the perpendicular wall, making it very difficult to shower more than a small part of the body at a time. This is absolutely crazy. Many of the aforementioned problems were mere irritations that made the stay unpleasant. However, other problems severely impacted my sleep. While the mattress was mediocre, the pillows were absolute junk. They were the cheapest, overstuffed polyfill products imaginable. The whole night while rolling around, I was debating whether to sleep with them, bunch up a towel, or use nothing at all.

The TV is perpendicular to the bed and there was only one chair which was upholstered, but a bit heavy for moving from desk to corner for TV viewing. The bed was a bit soft, but the sheets and pilows nice. The windows all faced out onto city streets (though many of the hotels rooms faced interior.) There were 2 blinds to pull down--one which filtered light, and a heavier one which blocked light, though not along the sides of the window (there were no curtains.) The food was good (room service) though pricey. I parked in the motormart garage and walked across the street and half a block down to the hotel. For this I paid $28 per 24 hours.

The second night, the 4 college-aged girls in the next room woke me when they returned loud and drunk at around 2 am. After no let up for 10 minutes, I complained to the front desk and they stopped about 10 minutes later. The third night I was awaken at 5:30 by a screaming (not crying, but screaming) baby which sounded upstairs from me. The walls and ceilings/floors in this old hotel are paper-thin. I have stayed in many large convention/meeting hotels. They are usually much quieter than this.

The reason for our stay was that one of my daughters was modelling in the American Girl Fashion Show and Tea, which was being held in the Park Plaza's Imperial ballroom. Even though we are from Boston, we thought it would be fun to stay overnight in town, especially since she had five shows over two days. I booked the room on-line via the hotel's website, which was straightforward and easy to use. The room rate seemed reasonable. The location is great and it's a beautiful, grand old hotel. The problems started at check-in. My husband attempted to check us in at check-in time (3:00pm) but the room wasn't ready. Not a huge deal, but mildly annoying. It was ready within the hour. The room, itself, was disappointing. It is outdated, the television was old and didn't work properly, the phone didn't work properly, and there was this old exercise bike next to the bed. Next, my husband and daughter took showers and the tub leaked, flooding the bathroom. My husband immediately called guest services, explained what happened, and was told that someone would be up to take care of it. This was about 5:30pm. He and my daughter and son left the room to go to our 6pm dinner reservation. My other daughter and I returned to the room from the fashion show, not knowing any of this, to find the flooded bathroom. We could not even use the toilet because of all the water. I noticed the message light flashing on the phone. The message was from an engineer who had been up to inspect the problem (pretty quick response considering only about a half hour had passed). He reported that the tub needs a new liner, but, for now, he had poked a hole in it to allow the water to escape. He also said that housekeeping would be up momentarily to clean up the bathroom. That was a little before 6pm. When we returned from dinner, after 8:30pm, the bathroom was as the engineer had left it -- a watery mess. I called guest services to complain. They sent housekeeping up -- it took about a half hour. And they never replenished the towels that had been used to mop up the floor. The took the wet towels and left us with the one that hadn't been used! My husband, irate at this point, called the front desk to complain. They passed him along from person to person. He was able to vent, but got no satisfaction -- no apology for the inconvenience, no offer to move to another room, nothing. So, for about $250.00 we got a room at the Park Plaza for about 18 hours, five of which included the flood bathroom.

We flew in Saturday morning, explored the city and checked in at the hotel around 4 p.m. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The reservations desk had everything ready for us and we headed to our room.

Then we walked through French doors, into the bedroom. We had a king size bed, with at least 9 pillows. As I walked past the bed to the closet, I found another bathroom.

This time, we walked about 4 blocks to a breakfast place that was recommended to us, only to find the line was out the door. We found a little pastry shop down the street and had a danish, coffee and biscotti. Then we were off! The second negative, was that we had very poor reception on some tv channels, which ultimately caused us to order a PPV movie, so our daughter would have something to watch in the evening. It just so happened, that the fuzzy channels were the kid friendly ones, like Nick and Cartoon Network. The movie was fine, so it was no big deal.

I fully appreciate that we did not spend a great deal of money on the room. However, even Comfort Inn (no disrespect intended) can offer working showers and clean towels. Finding a cleaners surgical glove on the bedside table was truely an unexpected delight. We notified the front desk of the problems, and an engineer was promtly dispatched to take a look at the shower. The hotel's opertunity to redeem itself disapeared with the engineers inability to resolve the problem. For the sake of paying a little more attention to detail, the Park Plaza could be a really good hotel.

The service is so poor that it overshadows anything nice about this hotel. My husband and I booked a Junior Suite through Orbitz. Traveling from Chicago, our flight was delayed due to weather so I called early in the afternoon to advise the hotel we would be arriving close to midnight. The woman I spoke with said she would add a note to the reservation. We did arrive shortly before midnight, and upon walking up to the check-in desk were greeted cooly and told that there were no more rooms available. I asked if a copy of my confirmation would help find the room and was snapped at-after a few moments of silence and the woman checking in her computer, a Junior Suite was \"found\" for us. The room (636) smelled like smoke (it was a non-smoking room). I called down to the front desk and after about 10 rings I hung up and dialed the front desk again. Someone picked up and put me on hold. After 4 minutes, I hung up-because it was so late, we decided to just stay in the room. The heater made a little noise and we could hear the traffic (this didn't really bother us since we have radiator heat at home and have lived on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago so the traffic didn't bother us). There was a bathroom and a 1/2 a desk and couch. The room was average size, very tiny bathroom, outdated. I would say for what we paid ($200/night) it was not worth it. One night I pressed the wake up call button on the phone and it just rang, I hung up and dialed zero and did reach someone. I only used the concierge twice, the first time the woman at the desk was very nice. The second time, I was ignored so I just left. There is a big Starbuck's sign in the hotel so one morning I walked down for a Late to bring back to my room-it took about 15 minutes to get the Late. The valet and baggage handlers were very nice and our room was cleaned every day. My fault for not checking Trip Advisor before I booked (Fromers has this hotel recommended in their 2007 Boston book so that is why I chose it).

Had booked a double room online with a friend, $101 + taxes for the both of us (so around $50 each), and they had initially given us a room with a queen size bed. I asked if they had any rooms with double beds, and they said no, but that they did have a \"half suite\" with two sofa beds at no extra cost. We opted for that room, and it was HUGE. The room was obviously meant for business meetings, as there was a conference table at one end. Despite the fact that the sofa bed mattresses aren't comfortable and my friend and I just opted to sleep on the couches themselves (with the bedsheets covering them), I still loved staying at the BPP! The bathroom was on the smaller side, but how much time do you spend in the bathroom, really? It had a great, deep soaking tub and two showerheads, was clean and better than expected (there is even a radiator inside so you can adjust the heat). If you are staying at the hotel during a Sunday, definitely try their Afternoon Tea! My friends and I had originally wanted to do afternoon tea at the Four Seasons, but they obviously deemed us not worthy enough to have tea at their Bristol Lounge (they lied to us and said reservations were full, when the Four Seasons concierge and all websites say explicitly that they don't accept reservations for tea). So rather than be disappointed at dropping $40/person at the Four Seasons, we went back to the Park Plaza and found out that their tea service starts at the same time, came with the same amount of food, and was almost half the price ($23.50/person). It was an incredible experience and the food was incredible (this is essentially a late lunch, and there is A LOT of food and unlimited amount of tea! The exclusive blends were wonderful!). Service was great throughout. Room service arrives awfully early (around 8 AM), but you just let them know you're still in the room, and they just come back later. Or just put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door until you leave. Reception and concierge employees were all wonderful. The lobby and mezzanine levels (where the ballrooms and reception halls are) are absolutely gorgeous, and there are beautiful fresh flowers everywhere. Last but not least...the LOCATION of the hotel was absolutely PERFECT. Within very comfortable walking distance of the Public Gardens & Boston Common, a huge Loew's movie theatre, Chinatown, Newbury Street shopping, Downtown Crossing, a whole bunch of great restaurants (both connected to the hotel and within walking distance) and the Arlington T-stop is just steps away from the hotel if you don't want to walk! If I ever travel back to Boston with a friend, I will definitely be looking for another online deal at this hotel. The standard price is a bit high, but if you an get an online deal at under $150 per room per night, then it is definitely worth it.

Let me shed some light... Frankly, If I didn't get into this room through a deal from Hotwire, I'd be disappointed too. Paying over $150, even for being in the theatre district would not have been worth it at this hotel. It has a GRAND feel to it, kind of a throwback to the 1920s. Feels a bit like you're on the Titanic (a sort of opulance and class in a style that you don't see in modern hotels). The hotel has a lot of history and the staff DO try to stick to their traditions... The issue is ... the rooms are showing their age. So until the multi-million dollar renovations occurs, I'd say try it if you'd like to stay at a place where you can kind of 'feel the history,' but do not build it up too much beyond that. My biggest turn-off was that the bathroom floor had mini square tiles that really needed a good scrubbing. If I hadn't noticed that, I would have rated it higher. Let's face it, this hotel is trying to appeal to more demanding market segment, so they need to go over their rooms a bit in more detail. Aside from that, I enjoyed seeing the shoe shine man with the old fashioned platform chairs, the many fine restaurants, a decent gym, and a piano bar in the lobby. It was a short walk to the park.

I had read the other reviews and they were mixed, but we decided to take a chance because of the price and we were happy we did! Location - The Good (actually The Great): This hotel is pretty much central to everything, but handiest for Newbury Street, Boston Common, the Trolley Tours office, Chinatown and Charles Street. If you like walking, you can actually walk everywhere without needing to pay for the expensive Trolley Tour or taking the metro... go for the Duck Tour if you must, but it looks kinda goofy and again, you can definitely walk it all: Boston Common = 1 min, Newbury Street = 5 mins, Chinatown = 10 minutes, Charles Street, 10 minutes, Faneuil Hall / Quincy Market = 25 mins, Aquarium and waterfront = 25 minutes, Boston South End's trendy new restaurants and bars on Washington = 15 minutes, Copley Square and the Prudential Building = 20 minutes. Fenway and Cambridge would be the only sites I would have taken a cab or the metro to get to. Location - The Bad: Parking is difficult wherever you are in Boston, there is no on-site parking but there are a couple of lots nearby. It's also quite touristy (on account of being so central), so staying in a smaller B&B or executive apartment rental right in the Newbury area is another option. Accommodations - The Good: The Deluxe Room (we paid $179 CDN plus tax per night) was perfect for us (2 adults, 1 toddler). The king bed was super comfortable and had a duvet (I hate scratchy army wool blankets), more than enough pillows and an extra blanket. There was a pull-out couch but we didn't use it. It had plenty of room to hang out and for our daughter to play. Decent sized closet with ironing board and iron. The room was clean, and quiet aside from some rowdy guests coming in after a night out (it was Labour Day Long Weekend tho). Also, there is a gym and there is a night club attached to the hotel, in fact, it is quite astounding, the number of restaurants attached to the hotel. Accommodations - The Bad: It's obviously a grand old hotel that has seen more glamourous days, the lobby really sets you up to think you've lucked out, but it's the nicest part of the hotel. It's a little cheese with the player piano in the bar. The carpets in the room were a bit worn and stained in some places. My only real complaint about the room was that near the window, it smelled mildewy or something but our view was of the roof so I didn't stand by the window very much anyways. The furniture is clearly not high-end since it's already been scratched even though it looks quite new. The bathroom is very very small and badly in need of a facelift, the radiator in the bathroom was really old and looked like it had been painted over 200 times, making it hard to clean well. The tiles on the floor and wall are at least 40 years old. However the tub and shower have been updated with those one-piece jobs you see in newer hotels. No marble or jacuzzi but functional. I felt the bathroom was decently clean, it just doesn't have that shiney new look. Also, be sure to make sure your room as an actual tub, and that it's not just a stand-up shower, the 360 virtual tour on their website shows a Standard Room that looks to only have a stand-up shower. There are no safes nor fridges in the rooms which we thought was weird. Another weird thing was that you call and leave a voicemail for the quick-check-out vs. using the tv. Service - The Good: The front-desk people were extremely nice and happy to be helpful. We wanted to make sure we got a renovated room (given the mixed reviews on TripAdvisor and some scarey pictures), and as it turns out, they say all rooms have been renovated. We left notes at the front desk for our friends, they gave my daughter an apple while we were waiting, they were polite and professional. Our room was cleaned well and on time. Service - The Bad: Nothing negative to say about their service. If location is your top priority but you still want a decent room, this is a great option. If you are still concerned about the bathrooms, ask about the Tower Rooms, they look much nicer and advertise beautiful bathrooms, the concierge said those were the rooms that were completely renovated.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFor the reduced price, it was worth it\u201d", "Author": "dldkag", "ReviewID": "UR5813048", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for two nights after booking through Priceline.

We came in on a Thursday night/Friday monring red-eye and discovered that our \"Priceline\" room was for a smoking room when we requested non-smoking (requests are not guaranteed via Priceline). However, since our smoking room was available at that moment so that we could recover from the flight and since the front desk lady told us we could probably switch to a non-smoking (NS) room the next day, we took it. When we got to the smoking room, the room was very clean, and there was very little smell of smoke in the room (especially in the linen and towels). There was a 2-head shower (1 for the head; 1 for the body) that was quite nice, and the queen bed was very comfortable with a down comforter. Our Saturday sightseeing was a bit delayed because we needed to check with the front desk at 11:30 a.m. and then again at 12:30 p.m., but we did get a NS room on the NS wing on the same floor as our smoking room (resulting in us needing to bear the smokey smell going to/from the elevators). Our NS room was just as good as the smoking room. This NS room had a single, high, and powerful showerhead, the TV was off to the side of the bed, and the morning sun made the room a little warm when first entering. The room was always cleaned well, and we never saw insects or rodents mentioned in previous reviews. We did hear traffic from the 6th floor, and on the 1st night there was actually a false fire alarm (with a subsequent announcement that we didn't need to evacuate). The location of the hotel is excellent: across the street from the T; a block away from 2 trolley stops that go around Boston; and around the corner (or \"cahnah\" in Boston) from \"Shear Madness,\" a wonderful who-dunnit improv comedy show that's been playing in Boston for a long time. Make sure you go to Finale, a restaurant on the floor of the hotel (access from the outside) that mainly serves desserts and after dinner drinks.

However, we decided to give Starwood hotels another try. So, we stayed at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers from July 14th to July 17th. It was a truly disappointing stay. Everything went wrong from check-in to check-out. When we checked in, we were given a room with a king bed. Since I was staying at the hotel with my elderly mother, sleeping in the same bed would not have been very appropriate. So we went down to the reception, to request a room change. The front desk agent wrote down something, and went to speak with someone. I thought this to be very rude. If you are going to involve more people, have them speak to us face to face. After a few minutes he came back. There was no room available. Very hard to believe, since the hotel has 920 rooms. Also, the room availability is shown on the computer, it is not necessary to speak with anyone. So we got a rollaway bed. After the bed was placed, there was no space left in the tiny room. Then the real trouble started. The air-conditioning unit in the room was broken. You could not control the temperature or stop it from working. Once again, we descended to the reception desk. When we came back to the hotel in the evening, we were truly disappointed. Instead of fixing the unit, they shut it down completely. The room went from being permanently freezing to being permanently hot. When I was brushing my teeth, I heard the women in the next room talking about the size of her butt cheeks. I almost vomited into the sink. When I just gotten into bed, I heard an employee in the hall, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going down to no basement, what the hell do you want with me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were his words. In other words, we did not feel safe in the hotel on many occasions. At eight in the morning, the maid woke us up, then again at 8:30 and finally at 9:45. WOW!! When I finally got out of bed infuriated, I noticed that the room did not have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign. Even Motel 6 has them. That evening we took a peace of paper and made a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ourselves. Thank God that the maid did not try to barge in again. When we went down to breakfast that morning, we noticed that our homemade sign was replaced with a real one. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs also hung on about 85% of the rooms in our hallway. Clearly our mistreatment was not an isolated incident. I would also like to comment on several smaller things which prove the low quality on the Boston Park Plaza hotel. When checking in, there were at least three bellman standing around doing nothing. They did not offer us they services, but watched the guests in the lobby for entertainment. The doorman never greeted us and certainly never opened the door for us. Every time that we called the elevator, we had no wait at least 10min. and ended up being crammed in with at least 8 other guests. All of these contributed to a repulsive stay. Overall, the Boston Park Plaza Hotel & Towers has the worst staff in Boston.

We did get the upgraded room, with no further issues at all at the front desk upon check-in. The room, while not being absolutely new, was what I would consider pretty decent. We had two bathrooms, admittedly quite small as the other reviewers say, but adequate for me at least. Housekeeping was always polite and friendly. The bed was a king, and it was comfortable. We didn't have much of a view, but at $85 a night, it was really hard to feel that we should be unhappy about such things.

I know the argument could be made that I was staying downtown in a sort of big city, but the room at the Sheraton across town which I stayed at over the 4th of July was the same size and not labelled deluxe.

After having used a luggage cart, all by myself, several times to transport materials here and there, I went to get one only to be told by a rude bellman that \"Guests are NOT allowed to take these, those are the rules.\" That's fine if that's the policy, but it's not really enforced but by this one man. This one person was apparently supervising the Luggage Room, as he would not bring the cart and come with me to empty a car of suitcases. Therefore, I needed to wander around the lobby until a bellman became available, only to have him go get the same cart, assist me in emptying the car and then leaving me alone with this obviously priceless cart in the lobby. Also, while I checked in seamlessly, with several people at the desk, at other, busier times in the weekend I observed that one person would be at the desk handling a line of 10-15 people trying to check in. Check out was when I experienced the thrill of waiting in line. There were 3 people working check out, plus 2 at the concierge and 1 at the \"Airline Cashier.\" There of course was a line to check out but as I was at the front of the line the most amazing thing happened. As those three people finished helping whoever they were helping, they would, one by one, go into the back. So now, there are 2 people at the Concierge, 1 at the Airline Cashier (with no one in front of her, happily tapping on the keyboard) and 0 people to help me and the 5 people behind me. After a couple of minutes, one person returned to help us. It was very kind of them. So, there you go, that's the review. I don't think I'd stay at this hotel again unless it was for a conference and I didn't have to pay for it (like this time) but if you don't mind having a mediocre experience for a high price, then I'd say the Park Plaza is the place for you.", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cYuck!\u201d", "Author": "Krucek", "ReviewID": "UR5618370", "Content": "This hotel was awful!

It's 3 blocks from Emerson College, in the theatre district, and is 1/2 block from the Arlington Street stop on the T (to get to Boston University, Boston College, and of course Fenway Park). We travel widely, so we expect rates for a standard room in a 4/5 star hotel in most cities will top $400+ a night. I was pleasantly surprised to be quoted $200 a night for a Jr. Suite during the busy tourist season of spring break. I was a little worried about what to expect ; but the hotel rating of 3 stars was on target. The room was not fancy or lavish, but it was comfortable and a good value for the space we shared. We had a king bed, a tiny dressing area, large closet, an \"old-style\" small bathroom, plus a stting area with a couch that pulled out to a queen bed, which was perfect for our 6-foot, 2\" tall son. (This was a much better value than the Marriott or Hilton hotels at Copley Square -- where we've stayed in the past -- b/c their rooms are so tiny we needed 2 of them. We were quoted rates of $300 and $425 a night per room, respectively. I hate to pay that much when we plan to be out all day touring anyway!) Another plus are the 20+ restaurants nearby, including: * \"Au Bon Pain\" for breakfast, lunch, snacks - in the building; * \"McCormick & Schmicks\" for seafood - in the building; * Irish Pub - in the building * A short-order, no-frills place for diner-style breakfasti - across the street on the ground floor of the Park Sq Building (a great value!). * \"P.F. Chang\" for contemporary Asian - 1 block away. Also within walking distance are lots of things to do in Boston: * Shopping at Hermes, Vuitton, etc - 1 block * Stroll the Public Garden and ride the Swan Boats - 2 blocks * Cocktails at Ritz Hotel Bar - 2 blocks * Boutiques and Galleries on Newbury Street - 2 blocks * Beacon Hill and Charles Street - across the Public Garden * Trinity Church and Copley Square - 4 blocks * Shopping at Copley Place Mall - 5 blocks Boston is a walking city so being centrally located is important! For sights outside the city, you can pick up a car at the Budget Rental Car location at the Motor Mart Garage, 24 Park Plaza -- only 1 block away. This made it easy to drive to/from the more suburban campuses. In sum, we'd rather spend our money on fine dining and shopping than on expensive-but-tiny hotel rooms.

We were last week booked into the Boston Park Plaza with a number of others for a conference. On first sight the rooms actually looked fairly nice and probably photograph quite well. There did not seem to be any bedbugs around, and the room was pretty clean, somehow the general upkeep didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet the expectations of anything for which you would generally pay over $100 a night. The real issue, apart from the noisy air con, (which had no controls), were the beds. The hotel should really be ashamed of itself on this point. There seemed to be nothing but rooms with 2 queen beds available for anyone that we talked to who stayed there. The beds themselves were cheap and uncomfortable, as well as being old with quite dusty, grubby looking mattresses when you pulled up the sheets. They were much more in keeping with something that you would find in a $60 motel room, and way worse than anything you will find at your average Best Western. The bedding itself was also woeful! On each bed an undersized and very cheap mattress pad was put between the single, slightly threadbare, rough and cheap feeling sheet. You could clearly see the pattern of the mattress through the sheet when you pulled back the covers. On top of this there was another sheet between you and the comforter. The comforter itself was a cheap synthetic and the comforter cover was thick nylon of the worst kind. You basically had a choice between freezing with a single sheet on top of you, or sweating profusely under this nylon monstrosity. (These are the words of someone else who was booked in for the conference, there was a fair bit of upset over the quality of the hotel). The pillows were similarly synthetic, old and small. The pillowcases were too big for the pillows and had to be tucked back into the opening to fit. The beds themselves were so uncomfortable that it was difficult for two people to sleep on a queen. (My friends in another room gave up, they had their two children with them and ended up sleeping with an adult and a child in each bed), The staff were, as a rule, fairly rude and unhelpful. (With the exception of one or two who were very pleasant,). The maids don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to know how to knock. They once caught me naked when they just barged into my room, and then just left without apologizing. Housekeeping made the most minimal effort imaginable. And I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they seem to want to spring for the cost of fabric conditioner in the laundry, the sheets and towels were incredibly rough. Valet parking took at least 15- 20 minutes to get your car, and if you wanted to get something out of it, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to bring the car round, rather they would send you off up the road in 95 degree heat with a valet in tow to collect your stuff from your car which is at the top of a parking lot a block away. I was astonished. (Especially as I was clearly in my pajamas and had popped down to get something I needed out of the car.) The whole point of valet parking is so that they go get you your car when you ask for it within a reasonable amount of time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.I have never had a hotel expect you to go to your car if a valet has parked it for you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth mentioning that there is no pool or spa services, which you would expect for the kind of prices they charge. To sum up. This hotel is probably okay if you get a REALLY great deal on hotwire or something. But despite the nice lobby, it has pretty sub standard, elderly, motel quality furnishings in the rooms and minimal facilities. The staff are still pretty rude, although possibly not as bad as they once were. I would have been very annoyed if I had actually had to pay my own money for this room, and anything over $110 is definitely not worth it. Especially if you want to get a good nights sleep on an acceptably clean and comfortable bed. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be conned by the nice looking lobby.

The hotel lobby was very impressive and the staff on reception were friendly. We then asked about the best place to go for the music and fireworks the following day (4th of July) and the concierge (Dottie) came over really keen, telling us that she had a few last minute cancellations of VIP tickets for a boat on the river with dinner, the perfect place to spend the evening and see the fireworks. She wrote everything down for us on a map and we were happy with that and settled in for the evening. At around 6:45 the next morning, the fire alarm went off. We had to quickly get dressed whilst they were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvalidating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the alarm, then walk down nine floors and stand outside the hotel. Fortunately it was a false alarm and they let us back in within ten minutes. We were really exhausted and managed to get another few hours sleep. We checked out of the Park Plaza and walked across to the Radisson. Later that afternoon we went to the boathouse by the river, to what we thought would be a boat/restaurant as suggested by the concierge at the Park Plaza. It turned out that it was simply to sit on the docks in the yard (the Community Boat House) on folding chairs. The dinner was to be BBQ - burgers, hotdogs and watermelon. It was certainly not what we were sold, so after sitting there for a short while I called the concierge back at the Park Plaza to complain. Dottie was not working so another guy said that he would call her and get back to me. When he called back it turned out that Dottie denied telling us about the VIP boat/Dinner and said that she sold us tickets to sit at the boat house, even though we had it written down in her own handwriting! We went back to the Park Plaza and got our money back, then made our own arrangements for the evening. Dottie might had made a genuine mistake, but it ruined our first and last 4th of July in Boston! So check anything you get from the concierge very carefully whilst you are still at the desk... As for the hotel itself, the rooms are clean but the bathroom is small.

When I discovered I could sucessfully get this hotel on Priceline for $90/night (even during holidays), I realized it was great value for money. The hotel is fairly standard. I have heard that the rooms can be on the small side. Having gone through Priceline, I never expect to have a view or much space. But this last time, we had a brilliant view from the 12th floor. We had a queen-sized bed, which was fine for us, but we have had a king through Priceline before. The bathroom is small, but the double-headed shower is welcoming. My only complaints are the pillows being hard, and my room service fries turning up cold. (But my burger was delicious!) Other hotel amenities include a four-computer business \"center\" for internet, faxing and printing. There is fee-based internet access in the rooms, but we managed to pick up a random wireless signal. There is a modest gym, but no pool. There are on-site restaurants and many restaurants in the immediate area. (Smith & Wollensky's, the castle across the street, is particularly nice.) The Theatre District is around the corner, and there are many chain restaurants down the street. (CPK, Rock Bottom Brewery, etc) Perhaps the #1 reason to stay here is location. As mentioned before, it is a stone's throw from Boston Common, Newbury Street and the Arlington T stop. The bottom line is that if you can get this hotel for a good rate, it's worth it.

Stay some where else. This hotel has three different size rooms. First your Standard queen/king room These rooms are very small. Two people max. Second, their is your Deluxe King. This is the one I stayed in and it was perfect. Nice and spacious. For $20.00 more, it worth it. and third you have you mini suite. All of the bathrooms are small, but the showers have dual showerheads, which is great. Parking is a problem anywhere in bostom, So you have two choices. Their is a parking garage across and down the street if you are on a budget, but it sucks if you have carried your luggage back and forth. The hotel has valet parking for $38.00 a day, which I know its expensive, but it well worth it. All in all, this was a very nice hotel, The way I look at this, is that.

My review should be read in the context of being overtaxed by marathoners and their families, but also note that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain much about things. In fact, this is my first review, since I was so dissatisfied with our accommodations in an expensive hotel. When I read what is below, I figured I was some whining snob, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply not my bag, baby. Give me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean, safe, and (relatively) quiet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a hotel, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gripe much. These were not descriptors I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d use for this particular stay. To begin with, parking was atrocious. The valet parking was poorly labeled, and we circled the building three times until my wife finally dropped me off to go inside and ask. The problem was that the valets all wear the same outfit for every establishment in that area, so it's impossible to discern for whom they work until you see their sign. The Park Plaza's sign is poorly visible. If you're wondering, you need to pull up in front of McCormick & Schmicks. What appears upon casual observation to be the valet parking for that restaurant is actually for the hotel. When asking for assistance, with my wife parked on the street waiting for me to return, I was funneled through the busy lobby and forced to wend my way through the interior of the building via repeated requests of help from folks in order to find the parking center, which was unfortunately on the opposite side of the building. Once I got there and tried to clarify that this was the correct place, the valet captain was rude and dismissive. His staff, though, was very cordial and responsive once we pulled up in the correct place. Once inside, the desk staff was pleasant and helpful, though were not well-informed. Despite our having confirmed everything repeatedly prior to arrival, and having electronic confirmation, they were not quite sure what to do with us when we arrived. We eventually (after about 20 minutes of computer acrobatics by the desk staff) got the room we had confirmed rather than one half its size. Throughout this 20 minute wait, our bags were taken by the Bell captain to his desk, where he left it unattended for almost the entire time in the midst of a busy lobby. He was offended when I walked over by it, and said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to keep an eye on our luggage since my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laptop was in the computer bag on the trolley, reassuring me that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take care of it for me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though as soon as I walked away, he became engaged in another conversation and walked away from it. The room was not a bad size; with a breathtaking view of \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the building next door. Literally, the building obstructing our view was about 30 feet from us, so it felt almost cozy to open the shades and see what the neighbors were wearing and what they were watching on television. Indeed, if our windows had opened, we could have just listened to their TV and not had to turn ours on at all. The room was not particularly clean either, with sizeable stains on the sofa (neither my wife nor I planned on drinking enough alcohol at any point during our trip to adventure sitting on whatever that once was) and on the carpet. The bathrooms were small and dingy, but the showers, hallelujah! Well, my wife said her\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (yes, we had two bathrooms for some reason) was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153average\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but mine was a revelation. Two showerheads with impressive water pressure and sensitive controls made this a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destination shower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in my mind. Not worth the $284 a night we spent to be there, but almost. If my goal had been to stay in the shower the entire visit, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be recommending this hotel to you without reservations. Take that for what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth in your hierarchy of needs. The elevators were inconsistent and felt borderline unsafe at times, though to be fair we never actually hurtled to our deaths. They were just slow and jerky, but not likely fatal. Of course, after the marathon, there were lines snaking around the hotel lobby waiting for the elevators, so we took the stairs to the eighth floor, which most of the marathoners were understandably less willing to do than my wife and I, who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run a combined total of 26.2 miles during our cumulative lifetimes. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lazy on a day-to-day, but not a minute-to-minute basis, it would seem. Food service was hilariously overpriced ($90 for a case of Budweiser \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink anything, I was just stunned by the price as I was looking through the menu), with no minibar option to at least put the egregiously priced food in your room so that you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait 45-60 minutes to pay too much for hotel food. Additionally, the room service staff taking our order was impressively rude and dismissive when told of a serious food allergy. However, the person delivering our order was exceedingly pleasant and courteous. So, too, was the housekeeping staff. When checking out, you are instructed to contact the Valet service 30 minutes in advance to have your car waiting for you upon departure. We did so, and it was still not ready nearly 45 minutes after our call. That, though, was not the insult. Upon our arrival home, my wife noted several ink marks on the dash, where clearly the Valet service had been holding a pen in his hand and written on the dash in several spots. Perfect! Not only did it cost $38 a night to have our car there, but they also wrote all over the dash. Aces!

Despite the fact I could tell they had tried to make it contemporary with their decorating, it was smaller than your average marriott room, the condition of the furniture was not-so-great, and the bed was oddly low to the ground (as if it was missing the spring mattress). 2) When I peeled back the top cover on the bed (as I always do as soon as I get into a hotel room), I saw a dark curly hair! The kind you DON'T want to see! Eeewww!!! I peeled the sheet further back -- another dark curly hair, and then another, and then another. Five in total, which I picked up with kleenex. I am almost 100% positive they never changed the sheets after the last guest. 3) The linens were old, they were not high quality, and you could see small tears in the pillows and bedsheets. 4) The pillows were hard foam. hardly the type of pillow I would expect at this kind of hotel. Heck, I can even get feather down pillows at a Marriott Courtyard. 5) Room service attendant made no attempt to show me my food under the silver covers or uncover them or anything. She just plopped them down on the desk, watched the TV I had on, and waited for me to sign the bill. 6) The WORST part of the entire stay came when I got into bed, shut my TV off, and realized I could hear EVERYTHING going on in my neighbors room. I could hear word-for-word what was on their TV, I could hear them go to the bathroom, I could hear them get in & out of bed, I could hear them cough/ sneeze, etc. I am not kidding you. It was awful. I was up forever -- I turned up my heat to something awfully hot just so the loud drone of the heat would cover up the noises from the next room. I don't think I have EVER stayed in a hotel w/ walls this thin. I'm not exaggerating. My neighbor woke up around 3 am in a coughing fit, and it was like they were in bed next to me. It woke me up! And then when morning came I could hear the wake-up calls & alarm for both rooms on either side of me. One at 5 am, another at 6 am. 7) The bathroom was so small that I didn't even have a place to hang my towel or put my toiletry bag down (I had to put it on the side of the tub). NEVER AGAIN will I stay here. I will say, though, that not all the rooms are as small as mine... I saw one of my co-workers rooms there and it seemed almost normal.

I asked that feather bedding or pillows be removed from the room because of allergies. The concierge said that was not a problem and advised us, upon arrival, to go directly to the 15th floor for check in. Check in was elegant, and the conciege confirmed no feathers. Our room was lovely -- high ceiling, large window, marble bathroom with deep tub for soaking. Yes, the bathroom is small but more than adequate. The bed linen and bath towels were quality. The service was wonderful. Example -- I left my gloves in the car when we dropped it with the valet. Within 15 minutes someone had retrieved and delivered them to our room. At 5pm, guests on the 15th floor are provided with an outstanding variety of canapes, cheeses, and hot tidbits in chafing dishes in the private lounge. Full bar service is available. This is where the complimentary continental breakfast is served until 10 in the morning. On Saturday morning, the presentation included pastries, muffins, strawberries, black and red raspberries, melon,yougart parfaits,scrambled eggs,toast,juice,coffee,and tea. I should add that room service is prompt and professional.

One is the gym---it has a lot of treadmills, but not much else in terms of work-out equipment. The other was the breakfast buffet, which while decent, could use a little more variety. The hor'dourves items varied, but not the breakfast ones. Overall, this is decent place to stay.

I also added it was my birthday. Checking in was easy, but finding a place to pull the car up was difficult, at best. Again, I was very nice to the front desk clerk, and again asked him to 'work his magic' so we could have 2 dbl beds. The room, to my relief, was fine. Not great, not large, but having 2 beds made a difference. There was hair on the toilet seat, but I was so ecstatic not to be in an economy room, I didn't care. There was a coffee maker in the room and a hair dryer. No counter space in the bathroom to speak of. We slept like rocks, but also brought a small portable fan for 'white' noise because I had read how thin the walls are-- which is true. The hotel has the original Legal Seafoods across the street, and a McCormick and Schmick and Au Bon Pain right in it. Location was fine. We enjoyed the fancy lobby, but obviously the hotel is old. One night, was fine; however, I would'nt want to stay any longer. In sum, it's 3 star, but I think you could do better with a newer 3 star hotel.

One problem occurred when we checked in: having made reservations for a non-smoking room and 2 double beds, we were told there were no non-smoking rooms available. We were offered an upgrade - yes, at our cost - to a non-smoking king on the 15th concierge floor. It was well worth the cost since the rate included continental breakfasts each of our 5 days, as well as snacks during the day and evening hours, free bottled water, and the services of extremely helpful concierge staff. The other problem was that we, being from hot and humid Texas, could not seem to get the room cool enough. The engineer was dispatched immediately after we called to work on the A/C unit. However, we found that by simply opening the windows at night - actually a treat, since we have very little opportunity to do so at home, we were even more comfortable.

I'd thought your hotel was an upscale hotel, and one that my wife, 5 yr old daughter and myself would enjoy on our weekend in Boston August 19th & 20th. Clearly it seemed a more upscale hotel than others, and in a good location. The problem began shortly after our arrival at 2pm when, after having booked a Junior Suite with a pullout sofa (for my daughter to sleep on), we checked into our room (with Bellman in tow) only to find that it didn't have a sofa, nor was it a suite. I went back down to the front desk. The Bellman seemed to be getting annoyed - for having to follow us, for some reason. The gentleman at the front desk said it showed as such on the computer, but would put us into another room. We went back up to the new room on the 11th floor only to find that this also did not have a sofa, nor was it a suite. We all had to go back down again. Now the Bellman was so annoyed he was saying nothing to us at all. So, back down to the front desk again, and assigned yet another room on the 6th or 7th floor. This one also did not have a sofa, and had 2 very small strange bathrooms (also still not a suite) I informed the Bellman that we had to go back down once more. He just dumped our luggage & belongings in a pile in the room and left without a word!! I left my wife & daughter in the room with our stuff & headed back down once again. This time I spoke with the desk manager. After a lengthy time checking and double-checking, she was able to find us a regular (non-suite) room with a pull-out sofa. In addition she provided a discount on the room. We of course now insisted on having a different Bellman help us this time. To note - we arrived at the hotel at 2 pm - it was 5:30 pm by the time we got checked into our last room! A paramount and unnecessary waste of time! Discounts aside, we were quite taken aback by the lack of helpfulness from your front desk staff (with the exception of the desk manager). Moreover, your Bellman was downright rude, and made my wife and daughter feel rather uncomfortable. Overall, I would characterize the staff as being \"less than willing to help\". We found this to be the case with the restaurant staff (which we chose to use for breakfasts only), the room service staff, etc... We were seated for breakfast and told our server we'd be having the buffet. Upon arriving back from the buffet, we found that someone else had been seated at our assigned table! Neither the maitre'd or the server seemed equipped to make a decision & resolve their mistake - rather, leaving it to us to sort out using another vacant table. We were always made to feel as though these inconveniences laid upon us were \"our problem\".

I have to say that after reading the reviews I was so skeptical and a little afraid about what we might find there that I really wanted to move the hotel. Since we were part of a convention we didn't have that option and still have the room be paid for. I am glad we stayed put and kept and open mind. We traveled with two kids 11 and 13 years old. A pool would have been great but the park doesn't have one. we simply found some other things to keep us busy. As far as Location the Park has it. It is located a few steps/yards from the Arlington T stop (subway). Is very close to the Boston Garden and Commons. For that matter most things are a short walk from the hotel. The Downtown Crossings (filenes basement, marshalls, tj maxx). The fashionable and oh so expensive Newbury street and the shops at the Pru(dential) and copley are all close by. Boston is a very walkable city you really don't need the subway but it is there anyway and is cheap (1.25 adult fare child to 11 1/2 fare) babies free. You can get anywhere using it. We only used it one time to get to the Science center for the duck tour as the ones leaving from the pru were full. If you choose to do this tour book online before you leave for the specific time. They sell out usually before noon. The freedom trail starts in the boston common so from this hotel you have perfect spot to explore. The overnight parking is $36 a night. We could have gotten it cheaper but it would not have been as safe in my opinion or convienient. We got our car within 10 min of asking for it although they told us to allow a half hour. a TIP if you are a AAA or CAA member you can get free parking if you used the AAA rate for the room. If you get a cut rate room from priceline or one of the other dot com places then don't complain about the parking price. If you have the AAA tour book for the new england area there is an ad for the hotel that has the blurb at the bottom regarding the free parking. The employees were friendly. When you check in stop at the concierge desk and ask for a free boston card. In it are discounts for area things. One of them is the duck tour. I think it is the only discount around. (they have a child and student fare too). The grand entrance is grand. I remember being a college student and walking by this place wishing someday I could afford to stay there. After reading the reviews I was dreading it but you can be assured you will like it there. There is an exercise room in the basement. They don't call it the basement but there isn't a better term for it. the steps to get to it are over by the gift shop. The fitness room is really nice. better than most. I was looking for info prior to going but didn't find it so I will put it here hoping some other folks that like to exercise during vacation or work will appreciate it. They have about 3 treadmills and 3 elipitical trainers as well as a lifecycle and a few recumbent bikes. There are also free weights and a weight bench. It has 2 tvs and free water from a water cooler with cups. It of course has AC. There is also a stair climber. Our room was on the 5th floor. We had a room with two double beds. That were tastefully made with a comfortor with a duvet cover. We had two windows that had a shade and another room darkening shade. The AC worked but wasn't freezing. We were comfortable. The bathroom was small but what can you possibly expect from an old historic hotel when folks were lucky to have a private bath in the room. It was well stocked with towels and tissues and extra t.p. There was a shelf above the sink that had enough space for 4 peoples major need items like toothpaste, shave stuff and contact lens needs. There was a stain on one of the shades and the carpet was worn pretty well but it was not discusting. There was a desk with ample light to work and connection to the internet which is a fee per day if you use it. We did not and it was pretty nice not to have to. There was a tv with extended cable and we didn't watch much of that either. They provided a hair dryer. The closet was small but had plenty of hangers. There was a chest of drawers that had enough space for 4 people to unpack and place clothing in the drawers provided. There were plenty of places to eat in the hotel. My husband had the breakfast buffet and it set him back $20! I didn't eat there with our kids. outside the hotel there is a au boin pain where you can get a reasonably priced breakfast and eat it there at an inside table or outside table or just take it with you. If you are into starbucks coffee you can find one almost anywhere because I think I saw more starbucks than mcdonalds. There is a ben and jerrys just outside the hotel. If you do the duck tour save the book they give you because there is a coupon inside for a buy one get one free item at ben and jerrys. There is also a cold stone creamery about a block away over by legal seafood. There are so many places to eat I don't think you would need to eat at the hotel at all. The Hard Rock cafe is just a few blocks down near the john hancock building and a cheesecake factory is in the prudential center shops just by the T stop. The flagship Legal Seafood is just a block away from the hotel. We ate there and the cheesecake factory and it was great at both places. We also went over to cheers which was just okay. We ate a few places at Quincey market and that was good fast and cheap. Plus you could sit outside and people watch.

The Park Plaza was the convention hotel and therefore I went ahead and booked at $160 a night plus 12% tax. The plaza is a historical hotel and I knew it would have some quirks, but the hotel and staff did not live up to their 3 1/2 star rating. Check-in at the Park Plaza was the worst. Yes, we were there early for convention check-in, however, staff was rude and unconcerned that we had to be checked in changed for an evening dinner cruise. Check-in was supposed to be at 3 p.m. however, we did not receive our room keys until 4:45 p.m while we were sitting on the bus to go to our dinner cruise. (We checked at 11:30a, 1:15p, 3:15p, 4p prior to getting a room.) AT least my check-in experience went better than the business traveler ahead of me whose company had made reservations but due to computer problems the hotel did not have the gentlemans reservation so he didn't have a room. Parking had been quoted as a convention rate of $24 self-park or $27 valet-parking. Upon arrival we found valet-parking to be $36 per night. Front desk was rude at attempted check-in and at check-out they were just happy to be getting rid of the convention guests. The manager who brought us our room keys gave us a $50 gift certificate for all the trouble. However, this gift was a coupon that all the people at convention received and it was $50 off of a purchase of $60 or more. Once we got into the room which was one of the smaller rooms I have ever stayed in and definately the most expensive for the size. We found that the doors to the rooms were very difficult to open and usally required at least 3 attempts to open the door. Due to the age of the hotel and having stayed in another historic hotel in LA I was expecting a small room, closet and bathroom however, the Park Plaza doesn't overcome the feeling of being a small room. The air conditioning was not working well anywhere in the hotel except on the 4th floor were a majority of the business offices were located and we had a workshop in this area. The hotel did provide fans for several guests who complained and continued to complain until something was done. It didn't help to even open the windows since Boston was in the high 80's to low 90's with 92-95 % humidity. The room supplies such as towels, washcloths, handtowels, soap, shampoo, and coffee making supplies were not always restocked everyday. We had to call 4 times before finally giving up on the coffee the one day. The hotel room was clean and smelled nice thankgoodness we didn't have a problem there. In the banquet room however, there was a mouse trap in the balcony area near a window that was set and ready to go. We checked it every time we were up there to make sure we didn't have any extra friends for meal functions. (Both myself and another gentleman took pictures.) Concierge was helpful at giving directions to nearby attractions and was able to sell us tickets for the trolley tour. The hotel is nearby Public Gardens, Boston Commons, Beacon Hill, Cheers Bar and about a 10-15 minute walk from Prudential Center.

He opened the door but it did take him a decent amount of force. I asked him if anything could be done about my door and he said he would put in a maintenance request. I checked in on a Saturday so I guessed it would probably be Monday before I saw maintenance. I put my bags in the room and rested for a minute. I tried to open the door now that someone else had opened it but to no avail I couldn't get the door open. I then went down to the desk and asked for the manager. I told him the story and that I still could not open the door. I asked for a new room and he was very nice and gave me not only a new room but an upgrade. The photo attached to this review was the view from my window over the common. The concierge staff was not that great and usually swamped. The hotel lobby was very pretty and there were a few good places to eat on the exterior of the hotel. Location wise it was a block from a T station and a block from the common. It was also very close to the theater district and Chinatown. The phone charges are also outrageous as well as the charge for internet access.

This would be a good room for a couple to stay in. Second, the TV worked well, and had about 30-40 cable channels. There were two upholstered chairs for sitting with a small end table between them. There was also a desk with a straight chair. There was ample lighting in the room (inadequate hotel room lighting is one of my pet peeves). There wasn't really a view out the window.

Can't say enough about the location, we walked all over Boston, ate in China Town and walked back to the hotel. So really fear not. This is a nice hotel. We did not stay in a suite, but we weren't in Boston to stay in the hotel, we wanted to explore. The only suggestion I have (other than not spending your vacation looking for loose tiles)...is to try to not book your room directly facing Arlington, there is a fire station somewhere near there and quite a few sirens.

My husband and I stayed at the Boston Park Plaza from September 11th-September 17th. I must admit that after I booked the vacation package through hotwire and read the negative reviews about this hotel, I was very concerned. I expected the worst. What I did to ease my fears was to email the hotel and I explained how I read negative comments about this establishment and I even copied and pasted some of the reviews. Someone did get back to me and assured me that I wouldn't have a problem and that she would accomodate my needs. I was very pleased with what I got. I got a non-smoking room with a king sized bed. Usually with hotwire, you're guaranteed a double bed. I checked in on September 11th and an employee by the name of Naomi (who happened to be in training) assisted me. She was very polite and engaged in conversation. She was very customer friendly. I had no problems with the check in process. It was smooth. When I went to my room, I did a complete inspection. Everything was clean, towels and bed linens changed. The carpet definitely needs to be replaced. It is worn, looks dirty and I saw a few holes. The bathroom is very small and the counter space is very narrow. There is hardly no space to put your toiletries. The bathroom was clean. The tiles were new. The bathtub is small and narrow. I'm not kidding when I say that I couldn't stand under the shower with my feet together because of the size of the bathtub. The room itself was a good size. There was plenty of space to walk around. The closet is a decent size but just in case take a couple of hangers. There was some but not enough for both of us. I brought a few hangers from home which helped alot. There is a coffee maker which is definitely a plus if you're a coffeeholic like my husband. The only problem I had with the coffee service is that they were not leaving the coffee filters everday. We stayed 6 nights and 3 of them we didn't get any. The first time I went to the concierge to complain and in about 20 minutes someone showed up with the coffee. The other problem is that they only leave 2 coffee filters and 2 packets that contain a napkin, 2 packs of 2 sugar, 1 packet of non-dairy creamer and a napkin. Everybody knows that you need at least 4-6 packs of sugar to sweeten American coffee. My suggestion is when you go to a restaurant, take a few of their sugar packets. That's what we did. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay at the Boston Park Plaza. The employees that I dealt with were really friendly. The location is awesome. The nearest train station is half a block away. The Boston Common and Boston Public Garden is 1 block away. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. About 2-3 blocks away, there's a Burger King and a Wendy's right next to each other for those who are fast food junkies. Really, everything is nearby.

Firstly, I had to change my room as soon as I arrived: it was small, dark, cramped and, worst of all, filthy. I changed rooms pretty quickly. The next room was bigger and more airy, unfortunately it was still pretty filthy: paint chipping off the wall and collecting on the floor, stains around the sink etc. It wasn't until the music from downstairs kept me awake till 12:30 that I decided I should move rooms again. The person I spoke to on the phone was lovely and said I could change rooms in the morning. I packed all my things again in the morning and went downstairs, only to be greeted by one of the rudest people I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. He was totally unhelpful, seeming to think I wanted a free upgrade rather than a quieter room. He offered me a much smaller room, and when I said I wouldn't be happy with that he said he wasn't prepared to offer me anything else. He refused any further assistance so I was left with the only option of accepting that smaller room. When I finally agreed I was told that I'd have to take everything back to my original room as the room wasn't ready yet - he didn't bother to offer to store it. I only found out when I returned that he hadn't bothered to reserve me this room, but luckily another person on the front desk said it was no problem and actually managed to find me a similar sized room with ease (thank you to them). When I finally got in the room it was fine: old fashioned, dark, small - but quiet. This must be the worst hotel in Boston.

One of the bathrooms had mice droppings on the counters along with dead spiders on the walls. The showers had mildew all piled up on the walls. Then to top it off a cockroach came running across the room. I thought was going to vomit. I have never stayed in such a filthy place. I will never stay there again.

I read the reviews prior to my visit on Aug 11, 2003. I doubted if it were all true. But to my dismay it was right on target. Apparently the money spent on renovations was spent on the lobby. When the elevator doors opened to the floor to where my guest room was located, it was liked I stepped into the \"Twilent Zone\". It was a bezare feeling because it was such a sharp contrast from the lobby. The hallways was in need of new paint. The guest rooms were small because its an old hotel. But it is still not an excuse for dirty walls and sparce decorating. There is insufficient storage for clothing and toiletries. The bathroom was antiquated and hair found on the bath towels. The air conditioning was very inadiquate.and did cool the room. In fact it was leaking water that made the carpet wet all the way to the bed. As a result, it caused a musty order in the room. The only positive experience was that the housekeeper called the problem in, and to our surprise the front desk called with another room assignment. Of course, the bellhop never showed up as promised to help us to the new room. We moved ourselves. Beside this, my husband was annoyed about the $34.00 fee per day to park our car at the hotel.

We simply had to comment on how terribly disappointed we were in our choice of hotel - the Boston Park Plaza. Mind you, we booked through Expedia and relied on the photos on the website. We reserved a 'Deluxe' room specifically because we understood that it would have a king-sized bed. Once we got to our room we were shocked to find a dingy, dirty room with a queen-sized bed. The carpets were filthy, the bedspreads stained, the walls marred and scuffed, and the bathrooms antiquated. We went to the desk and complained which resulted in our being moved to a room with a king-sized bed - a SMOKING room. The room reeked of cigarette smoke. The rugs had innumerable cigarette burns and was in the same sorry state. In addition, the liner of the bathtub was peeling up from the tub, the air-conditioning didn't work and did I mention that the halls were filthy? Going back to the front desk we were told that we'd be re-accomodated in a non-smoking room the next day. Resigned to our fate, and tired of moving, we bought a scented candle and tried to make the best of it. However, I felt compelled to make a statement here in the hopes that it would save someone the trouble of booking at this hotel. For the money (approx. $150/night after tax) it was very much not worth it. I stayed at the Best Western at Longwood Medical Center a few months back and the rooms were spacious and immaculate - for $100/night. Save your money - avoid the Park Plaza - shop around.

This was at 6pm on the Saturday night of Labour Day. They had given all of the double rooms to people staying just for the weekend - it seems that staying for a week meant nothing to them! Went to reception to be told that we would have to stay there until Monday when more rooms became available, even though people were still checking in and getting double rooms!

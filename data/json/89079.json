Located dowtown on Poydras Avenue, the Hyatt is a very large, atrium style property accomodating many business people in town for conferences. That being said, many leisure travelers will benefit from the various amenities such as a trolley style shuttle to Bourbon Street, a rooftop pool overlooking the skyline, as well as on-site restaurants and an adjacent shopping mall (average but covenient in a pinch). Another selling point is that the New Orleans Superdome is right next door.I stayed for four nights during a public health conference and had absolutely no complaints with the cleanliness of the rooms or the professionalism of the staff. However, this hotel, along with two other Hyatts where I have stayed, needs an interior facelift in that it has a bit of a 1980's feel to it (particularly Hi-Tops, the sports bar). All in all, this is an above average hotel where you can stay at a great price if booked online.

The reviews are right -- if you paid more than $90 for this hotel, and you spent your entire vacation at the hotel instead of out and about eating and experiencing New Orleans, you may feel ripped off. My husband and I bought our room from hotwire and believe, because we only used the hotel for sleeping and showering, we received a good value for our three-night stay at $85 per night. Our room was clean but nothing about it that made it feel like New Orleans or any different than any other run-of-the-mill convention-center hotel in any other city in the U.S. Of course, you must add money to the cost of the hotel for cab fare anywhere. The hotel is definitely not close enough to the Quarter for a quick walk and back. A cab ride, however, is only about $6, and the shuttle from the hotel is very prompt and easy to use. If your only plans are to hang out in the city, we highly recommend not renting a car. A cab ride from the airport is only $28, but parking is about $20 a night at the hotel and you'll never find a place to park if you try to drive to the Quarter.We learned our lesson here -- on vacations where we plan to stay in, we like staying in exclusive little hotels with charm.

The hotel restaurant and sports bar are typical hotel fare -- other than convenience there is no reason to eat or drink here. There is an attached mall which has a Macy's, Dunkin Donuts, and a convenience store which sells cold beer and liquor. Again, nothing fancy. The location is not ideal unless you are attending a superdome event but is within walking distance to the French Quarter and waterfront if you like walking. For the savings, we were happy to walk and take cabs back at night. I did not use the hotel shuttle but apparently there is one to certain tourist destinations. The valet parking is $30 a day.

There was also a big temperature problem in the building. Because of the traditional Hyatt open atrium design and the incorporation of the mall space which was on minimum climate control, the place was freezing inside, a fact of which the desk staff was WELL aware.

And the place was like a ghost town with very few guests coming and going, which only added to the perception I had of a dying strip mall. Also, the parking situation is sub-optimal shall we say. When I got there, I found out the only two parking options were to use the Valet Parking service (at what seemed like a million dollars an hour) or park in the attached Parking garage (for only a half a million a day). The saving grace for me was discovering that the ticket booth where you pay your fee as you exit the parking garage is not manned on Sundays. When I was leaving, the little gate arm was raised up and the booth was locked and empty....so I just drove right on out! Additionally, the single restaurant there in the hotel wasn't very good.

Registration and restaurant staff were a tad slow, but also very friendly. I was also glad to be staying outside of the French Quarter.

And if we hadn't quite made it back to the designated stop, we just waved the shuttle driver down and he or she always stopped for us. Dennis, one of the drivers, is one of the most hilarious people I have ever met in my life. He always had an entertaining story to tell on the way down. You'll love his voice too:-) We also took cabs because on the first few nights the shuttle stopped at 1045, which was a bummer.

Nice and spacious and comfortable and clean. Our room was cleaned promptly. I never heard the AC. After spending the day out, especially in the FQ, you come back so tired, you'll knock out very easily. My husband did not like the pillows on our bed. I don't care about pillows much. The bed wasn't as comfortable as I expected, but that was me comparing it to other places we've stayed fairly recently (Sandals, Vegas, eg). Again, it wasn't horrible; it was fine. Now the bathroom is where I have to agree with other comments. First off, I was very tired when I got there, because we missed our flight and had to fly standby and make a transfer. I really wanted to lie down in a tub, but our tub was a touch dingy. It was probably a long time since a major overhaul. We also did not get our shampoo and soap replaced. There was also no shower cap or a few other amenities that should have been standard. (Okay, I admit, I collect hotel soap, shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash, etc. But never a towel, I swear). The water pressure in the shower and the sink was excellent, but toilet flushing was a bit more of a challenge. That was pretty annoying. We were on the 15th floor. I think we were on the 20-something floor in Vegas the last time, and we never had such a problem.We also took a dip in the pool and the hot tub. The pool was heated and so comfortable, I could have stayed there all night. It was never crowded, so it was nice to have our own corner. Overall, I would the hotel a B. My only major complaint was the bathroom being in need of a little renovation.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR809543744", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Falls short of expectations   showReview(1527341, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 23, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR467759590", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Best deal in town   showReview(1495825, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 21, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR729542065", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "arstrobelt"}, {"Content": "Stay in the Hyatt   showReview(1386085, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 13, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR159239426", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not worth it!   showReview(1354510, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 23, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR732462271", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "I was NOT impressed...at all   showReview(1342598, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 16, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR707949896", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel, not great service   showReview(1231071, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 18, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR983496898", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good value for the price - for business, that is. . .   showReview(1109602, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 26, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR404797469", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kalexia123"}, {"Content": "Definitly, a bad experience!   showReview(1029152, 'full');", "Date": "May 26, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR963570263", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not worth the cost   showReview(985953, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 30, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR921173212", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Getting old   showReview(861478, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 26, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR959999547", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u00b0\u5017\u9287\uff43\u4efa\u7035\u5098\u5022\u9287\ufe3a\u4e9c\u9287\u4ff1\u4eda...   showReview(21747294, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 13, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR101881948", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d89079-r19384511-Hyatt_Regency_New_Orleans-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "89079", "Price": "$214"}}

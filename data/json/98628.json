First off it is located in a bad neighborhood. Dallas police had a reader board warning of bait cars in the area. We arrived to the sound of a car alarm.

This one was under construction in the lobby, which is OK in itself, because the staff was courteous and got the job done. However, I am a Marriott rewards customer and my basic requests are recorded in the system. I always request a room on higher floors and away from outside doors and elevators, always request extra pillows and towels. None of those requests were met. we were put on a corner spot on the lowest level. The bed was extremely uncomfortable, and there's a \"Gentleman's Club\" directly behind the hotel that plays VERY loud music until all hours of the night, and you can also hear people yelling and making a lot of noise. It's right next door to a liquor store and is not in a very good part of town. The breakfast wasn't anything but bagels, muffins and cold cereal, usually they have hot breakfasts. Even though we paid in advance, we almost surrendered the room on the 2nd night and stayed with relatives.

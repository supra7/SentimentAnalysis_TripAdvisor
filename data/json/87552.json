We traveled from Wisconsin for an annual football game trip that we do every year in Novemember. We were arriving late and called ahead of time of this late arrival with approval. We arrived at 1045 pm, got checked in and started unpacking van and taking things into rooms. We had a group of 10 women. We all had our own bags and 2 coolers and other food to take into our rooms to stay the weekend for a football game. There was no elevator or luggage rack, so of course some noise was made to get everything to our rooms for the about 10-15 minutes because of this. One of employees was a woman and was very nice and courteous to us by holding the door open for us so we could bring everything inside a little easier. I was the driver of the van and was the last one in. I did notice a male employee at that time that seemed a little annoyed by us. I was told by others in my group that this male employee was making some inappropriate comments about a group and had made a lot of assumptions about us at this point. We all settled in our rooms and then gathered in one room to talk about the long drive, unwind, have some alcoholic drinks, and discussed the plan for the next day before going to bed. We were a little loud at first, but calmed down about 10-15 minutes after getting all situated with our rooms and belongings. But then we talked amongst ourselves for about an hour or so and people started going back to their rooms to go to sleep for the night. One of the women is a smoker and had stepped outside and she told us that on her way back up the stairs the male employee and made some more snide comments and may had said something to keep it down. But we were all just talking amongst each other. I decided to go back to my room between 1-130 am to go to bed. I did not hear any loud noise from the ladies in the room next door that were still up talking. I was quietly getting ready for bed and was about ready to lay down when I heard a light knock at the door. It was the male employee, named Jeff at the door stating that the room next door needed to keep it down because he is getting complaints. I stated that I was going to bed here soon and I believe the others are going to go to bed shortly as well. The other 2 women staying in my room came in about 20 minutes later and got ready for bed to turn in for the night. They stated everyone else was turning in as well. Then shortly after that a knock was at the door, and Jeff stated that \"our friends in the next room needed to leave now\". The police were also at the door as well. I remained in bed, while my friend was at the door with them. I thought it was just a misunderstanding and we could all go back to bed, but before you know it we are being told that we all have to get all of our stuff together and leave the hotel as a group. I could not believe this at all. Just unreal. So we brought everything back down the stairs as quickly as we could and repacked the van. We had to just keep hope that we would find another hotel to stay in for the night and for the rest of weekend. We did get lucky and find a place that had 3 rooms available for us 10 women, in which we were trully grateful. And the accomadations were much better with elevators and luggage racks, so extra noise could be avoided. And my friend also was not given any receipts or paperwork from Jeff from the hotel regarding our stay there. This was only the beginning of the nightmare. My friend that booked the rooms tried to call the next morning to talk with the manager about our horrible experience with the employee, Jeff, and express how we thought we were wrongly asked to leave the hotel, but was transferred to housekeeping twice. She finally was told after many repeat phone calls that he would be in at 930 am. She called later and continued to get the run around. It offically became a big mess that was not going to be solved easily. My friend also found out that there were extra charges on her credit card from the Days Inn. My friend also called corporate Days Inn to get some answers. This was just a complete nightmare. I highly recommend not staying at this hotel at all, especially if you have to check in late at night. I am not staying at a Days Inn ever again!!!!!!", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baraboo", "Title": "\u201cWORST STAY EVER !!!!\u201d", "Author": "Tonya K", "ReviewID": "UR120866898", "Content": "Checked into the hotel late. Called prior to let them know we were going to be late, once we arrived the HORRIBLE experience started immediately. The night audit employee was making discrimination comments about our group before we even entered our rooms. At about 2:30 a.m. we were woken up by the police stating that we have to leave the hotel due to noise complaints. The cops had to go to the front desk and question which rooms were being noisy because they could not hear anything. Yes, once we arrived at the hotel and all were adjusted we met in one of the three rooms and talked and drank some beers for a couple of hours. But by the time the cops were called we were all in our own rooms and sleeping. Not a fun way to be woken up and then told you have to leave the hotel. When we arrived late there may have been about 10 minutes of noise for us to unload and carry things to our rooms. But since we were on the 2nd floor and the DON\"T have an elevator we had to make several trips up the stairs for 10 people, but after that it was not out of control at any point. Not Recommended - BAD CHOICE to stay here. Needless to say the cops were not surprised.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lyndon Station, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cHorrendous Hotel...Horrendous Staff\u201d", "Author": "badger_girl11", "ReviewID": "UR120858456", "Content": "I had reserved 3 rooms through an online site with \"discounted rates\" when I called the hotel to double check the reservation about a week before we were scheduled to arrive, there was no answer ther first 2 days I called...I called several times a day and got nervous so I called the 800 number for Days Inn...they got through right away and found that they had only reserved 1 room, since we had a large group that simply wouldn't work. This should have been when I should have cancelled everything. I called back directly to the hotel again...this time it took about 3 times calling to get anyone to answer the phone. After we finally got the reservations correct, I called because we would be a late arrival for check-in. Once we got there, the lady that checked us in was very nice. The gentleman that came on shift shortly after Jeff V Thompson, was very rude and condescending. As we were bringing our suitcases and things up to our 2nd floor room with no elevator or luggage racks, he made some snide remarks about myself being pregnant and being on the trip with my friends. We arrived around 11pm and after we were sleeping for about 15-20 minutes around 2am, the police were knocking on our doors waking us up telling us we needed to leave. Apparently there were complaints about us being loud. As the person that had paid for all 3 rooms and my name was the only name on the rooms, I was never contacted about the complaints. All 10 of our group were in the same room talking which apparently was too loud. Had we known this, we would have all gone to our own rooms. The police officers even said they didn't think it was right and that they had opinions but couldn't say them...they did tell us that they wouldn't stay there...at 2:30 am on a weekend the Badgers were playing Illinois we were forced to find not 1 but 3 hotel rooms which took us around 2 hours to find going from hotel to hotel. The only positive experience out of this whole deal is that we found another hotel that was cleaner, nicer and the staff was outstanding & amazing. The didn't even charge us for the first night since we checked in at 4am. We also were forced to leave in such a rush that a few items were left behind in the rooms. I called Saturday morning to speak to a manager about what had happened since Jeff was so rude and unwilling to give me any type of paperwork. I was transferred to housekeeping. I called back and was transferred again. I called back again and finally spoke to a woman who said to call back after 9:30. I called back around 9:50 and was told the manager wasn't in again. I called about 3pm and was told the manager was in Chicago and that all items would be at the front desk that were left in the rooms. I called my credit card company to find out what my options were and found out that not only was I being charged for the full price of 3 rooms for 2 nights I was also being charged additional individual charges of 3 rooms for 1 night. On Sunday we stopped by the hotel since I had left several messages for the manager to call me back. I received copies of bills and there were no items from our rooms at the front desk. The lady did tell me that our rooms were rented out after we were asked to leave, she even had a few remarks to say about Jeff the night shift. I still have yet to hear from the Manager and the lady we spoke to Sunday did say that a package was left by Jeff for the manager. I called Days Inn corporate and they have until the 28th to come up with a resolution. in the mean time, my credit card has been charged over $900 for 3 crappy rooms for 3 hours.

Since it wasn't listed as an amenity in our AAA guidebook, I was excited to see the \"free high-speed internet\" banner outside (I had my laptop). However, it must have taken about an hour before I was able to connect with my laptop, and there was nothing wrong with my hardware or settings. The 800 number we were first told to call to fix things was completely unhelpful and clueless, after which we had to call the front desk a couple times before it worked. I'm guess they went over and plugged a router in, because before then the network didn't show up at all. Besides this, the stay was decent and clean, and the continental breakfast was sufficient -nothing luxurious or anything.

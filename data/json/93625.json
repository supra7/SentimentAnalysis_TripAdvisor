Internet in room was not free. Pluses: The suite itself was very nice, with ample sitting area and separate bedroom. Having stayed in suites at several NYC hotels (incl the Lucerne, On the Ave, and Excelsior), I can say that the Wales suites are comparatively the best of the bunch. Location is in upper east side, on Madison near Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Some interesting boutiques nearby and convenience stores (incl a Duane Reade).

The hall to the elevator (and the rooms) are to the right. We were given room 509 (fifth floor) which had a window in the bedroom and a window in the bathroom; both windows looked out on other rooms of the hotel, which form a small architectural rectangle in which a pigeon stayed during the two nights we were there. Having windows was nice, but the view was to close to comfort (no offense to pigeon lovers). The room was nicely decorated in an odd sort of way. The overhead light is huge given the room's size, but I kind of liked it. The choice of blue paint in the bathroom was daring but, to my eye, doesn't work. (I'd have gone for a light sandy color which would blend with the other colors.) But that's all a matter of personal taste. The room itself made it necessary to swap places with hubby to get from here to there. It should go without saying the room was mostly bed, dresser and desk: a tight fit. The bed was a little soft for me, but I need a firm bed and I can't blame the hotel for not knowing how firm a bed I need. It certainly didn't sag. The sheets were wonderful and so was the down comforter. Bedside lights complement the overhead light, but the bulbs are too low for easy reading. (Disclosure: I wear glasses and I'm over 60). Other things to know: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 wifi is an extra charge ($12.95/day in Sept. 2011) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 we loved the restaurant next door (Island): great menu... although service iffy at times \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 one of the locals told us the French restaurant across the street (Panucue, or something like that) is just as good and a little less pricey* \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the architectural features of the room are fascinating \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the hotel advertises a roof top bar but when we checked it out, there were great seat and views, but no bar and a sign that said \"no glass allowed beyond this point\" (or something like that) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 there's no refrigerator, microwave, or coffee maker \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 there were no knobs on the closet doors but the doors still opened fairly easily \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 there were no hangers in the closet \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the closet itself goes from floor to ceiling and looks like it might have been a farmhouse kitchen wall cupboard. I liked it a lot, despite the lack of hangers and it really deserves to be in a bigger room. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the hair dryer is one of those that's attached to the bathroom wall \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the shower needs a User Manual that's clearly visible to the customer. My husband somehow figured out how to get hot water (it took awhile), but when I tried I couldn't figure it out so hubby did it for me. For other travelers who've never run into set-ups like these, it's a two step thing (I think): you have to turn a knob and, separately, move a dial... both in a way that results in hot water... at least that's how it seemed to me, even though I couldn't figure it out myself so good luck \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the stairs running up and down the hotel are charming.

It has idiosyncrasies on the one hand that could bother some people, yet on the other hand has some very nice features that could charm others. Being located in an older building with steam radiators for heat, there is a bit of noise from the radiators, but then again nothing terrible. Again, where noise is concerned, you do hear traffic on Madison Ave., if your window faces that way, but that is par for the course in Manhattan. Maybe a bit more sound insulation on the windows could help with this, but then again perhaps management has already done all it could...I really don't know. A pair of earplugs (which my wife and I both used), definitely comes in handy. And, of course, being located on the Upper East Side, some of the most expensive real estate in the world, assures pretty high costs and prices, but that's also par for the course and to be expected. We had a suite, which consisted of a full living room area, and a reasonably large bedroom. The rooms were very clean. I found the woodwork adorning and solid wood doors quite attractive. These added a real sense of charm and warmth to the suite. The bathroom was a bit small, but very functional. One problem we encountered was that the bedroom mattress would squeak when you moved...so much so that it woke us up a couple of times. It was also unduly soft. We resorted to using the pullout sofa in the living room one night, which was okay but very soft and not the most comfortable. I think management should address the issue of new mattresses where needed, certainly where there are squeaks or other noises. That said, we did get full night's sleep for the two nights we were there, so these were more inconveniences than anything else. The penthouse floor has open access to a rooftop penthouse with lounge chairs and some nice city views. This was a very nice touch. Our stay was in November, and it was a bit too chilly to stay outdoors for very long, but I could see where in warmer weather this could be really nice (and I believe there is some form of rooftop dining in warmer weather). If you like quaint, the elevators are adorable...I measured each of the two to be about four foot by four foot square...just large enough for four people, but actually with a lot of old world charm to it. The continental breakfast was adequate, and we enjoyed the mezzanine-level space with constant coffee machine, computer access, etc. We were very pleased with hotel service. Everyone was very responsive and friendly. The location is great. One block off Fifth Avenue with Central Park and all the museums on that strip. One word of advise: during our stay, my sister was at the hotel too, but in a regular room, not a suite. We peeked into her room, and found it to be significantly smaller (I would have to say too small for my tastes), and only about $75 less per night. My advice to anyone planning a stay would be to opt for a suite over a single room...much better value in my opinion. To sum up... Cons: Pricey, a bit noisy (though can't really help that), mattresses should be upgraded. Pros: Quaint and charming in its way, clean, responsive service, nice penthouse (especially in warmer weather), and great location.

I stayed a week, and the room completely suited my needs. I've lived in NYC and I didn't mind that the room had an interior view, although the larger suites do have street views. It is a boutique-y hotel, and not a large chain, which I like- but I do wish free wifi was offered beyond 15 minutes. I believe it recently underwent an renovation, and I saw no unfinished details, and the hotel had a comfortably trendy vibe. On Thursday, I noticed they offered a cocktail hour on the rooftop terrace (I didn't attend, but I thought it was a nice touch). Since the building is likely old, the room size was decent for NYC- I was comfortable with a queen bed, and the bathroom had a nice walk- in shower, and there was enough room for my dog as well. The AC unit was in the wall, and I did see a radiator-- I saw some of the older reviews complained about the sound- but those steam radiators make a ton of noise, and not much you can do. I heard no conversations or noise while I was in the room, and it was extremely quiet (aside from the AC unit). The neighborhood is safe, with ok restaurants, but highly overpriced, if you would like a top quality meal, do your research and go outside the neighborhood. I liked the breakfast- fresh orange juice, bagels, fruit, muffins, croissants, yogurt, toast, and all the tea/cappuccinos you can drink. It ran 7-9:30, and I would recommend getting down there before it got too crowded. Some issues: the paper keys which they use bend too easily and are too easily deactivated- of the six nights I was there, I had to get new keys four nights. I called for ice several nights, and waited more than twenty minutes. Not necessarily a huge problem, but reflects some service issues. I also had a bit of an issue with getting my room serviced, I was in it when housekeeping was working, then I went out, came back, and the timing was off I suppose. I really wasn't on a tourist's schedule where I was out all day- I was going back and forth to the hospital, so that probably contributed to the issue. But I found the best way to rectify this issue was to let the front desk know so they can be sure to have it cleaned while I was out. Checkout was easy, and they were kind enough to hold my bags at the front desk while I got my car. I found the staff to be extremely helpful and to exhibit concern for any issues which you may have. I am grateful that the hotel was so nice in an otherwise stressful time while my relative was undergoing surgery. I would recommend this hotel, especially if you want to avoid heavy tourist areas.

I needed some information about museum times and locations and the staff was wonderful with explaining how to get there and looking up the times for me.

I called again only to be told to turn the heater down which I tried, but this made the noise worse, the heater starting to let out steam and there was then a constant dripping of water. I rang reception again and a porter arrived. He said we could change rooms this meant us getting dressed and moving to another room with our luggage at nearly 00.45.

Our hotel room was also inward facing and therefor was very dark and gloomy (although the weather didn't help I guess!!) The location was also a problem. It's about two thirds the way up the east side of Central Park. A cab on an evening cost about $15 dollars and around half an hour to get to Times Sq. This is obviously not the hotels fault (we knew where we going before we booked) but you do lose the around an hour a day travelling to and from downtown. Over 3 days the cost of cabs also adds up.

I'd last stayed there about five years ago, and found on thist latest stay that, while it's still a fine choice for someone who wants a small-hotel experience, management may not have a firm grasp on all the details that makes hotels such as this special. It's also not quite the bargain it once was. That said, our suite was pleasant, with a distant view of Central Park, a very long entrance hall that guaranteed peace and quiet, and handsome details like original woodwork and a (nonworking) fireplace in the bedroom. The sitting room was small but comfortable and was if nothing else a good place for luggage, keeping the bedroom tidier. I'd last had a suite that combined the sitting and bedrooms (with an arch separating them), which was in some ways even nicer, as it made for a larger single space. The bathroom (shower only) was smallish, but immaculate and with period touches. Good mattress, pillows, and linens. We missed the Hotel's continental breakfast in the second-floor common room, but had a nice time at the adjacent restaurant, SaraBeth's, a Manhattan institution. Our one attempt to use the common room (which includes computers for guests' use - there is no business center) was spoiled by a rambunctious family waiting for airport transport; I was surprised that the staff present didn't do something to stop two small children from pounding on the (out of tune) grand piano. The hotel's location on upper Madison Avenue is out of the way, yet convenient to many museums (inculding the Met) and handy for attractions such as concerts at the 92nd Street Y. It can give one the illlusion of living in, rather than visiting, the city. Our rate included valet parking, which was prompt and seemed to take good care of the car. The downsides are comparatively few: window a/c units that aren't as unobstrusive as a central system, windows that don't fully open, and some aging and fading of furniture and fixtures. The night management was slapdash - loosened tie on the man at the counter, who was busy chatting with friends and listening to (very loud) latin/rock when we returned at one in the morning (not terribly late by NYC standards!). Finally, in terms of value, while the suite set-up is pleasant, at more than $400 per night, the cost was on par with some of the rooms at New York's big-name hotels.

Booked direct with the hotel website. Stayed 7 nights which cost \u00c2\u00a31183. (For NY, I thought this was reasonable). The hotel is on Madison Ave & 91st St. (5 mins walk from Central Park). The staff were helpful; Khan took our luggage up and made us feel welcome. The room was a standard bedroom, but was bigger than i expected, 2 windows, clean, air conditioned, tv and a good size bathroom with bath & shower, wall safe & plenty of drawers, space, etc. (Room 719) The bed was made up with egyptian cotton bedding, white & starched (and was so comfy, it was difficult to leave in a morning!), a range of Aveda products in the bathroom. Every day our bedding was changed, our towels were changed and the room was spotless! The roof terrace was amazing and we spent every night up there with a bottle of wine to finish the day. We usually had the place to ourselves. The lounge on the 2nd floor is gorgeous, air conditioned, free internet and a printer, free tea, coffee 24/7. At 7.30am there are bagels, pastries, croissants, rolls, jam, cheese which are all fresh. We loved the hotel and would definately recommend it to anyone. (Tip: Everytime I plugged my hairdryer in, it blew the trip switch - its an old building, no panic, ring reception and they put it back on again & switch off the air conditioning before you plug anything in ;0) There are only 1 small point that I would mention: It is a good 20 minutes walk to 59th St which is the start of the main attractions, however on the 20 minute walk (or 2 min cab ride for \u00c2\u00a35) you are walking along Central Park and there are stalls, street artists and hotdog stands, etc so its a nice walk in the morning, but a long one after 11 hours walking around the city, so we usually got a cab, which is easy, stand in the road and flag one down, we always got one within a couple of minutes, they are all metered and they give you a receipt and very cheap! (E.g from the hotel to the seaport/greenwich village its \u00c2\u00a39) Other Tips: 1. Definately go to Pier 17/Seaport - lovely shops, restaurants and the best \u00c2\u00a310 each we spent all holiday was a ride on 'The Shark' !! Its a 30 minute speed boat ride around the statue of liberty. 2. If you fancy a helicopter trip, it was only \u00c2\u00a370 each for 20 mins. We just walked to the Wall St Heliport from Pier 17 and only had to wait 10 mins and we were up. 3. If you don't want to queue for 3 hours to go on the Staten Island Ferry, there is a ferry stand just 100 yards away and for \u00c2\u00a37 we had an hours tour of the harbour and statue. This ferry does not stop anywhere though, but you get to see the sky line of the city and the statue. 4. All restaurants expect a 20% tip! Some add it on automatically. 5. If you want to get a taxi from the airport (JFK) Its a fixed price of $45 (approx \u00c2\u00a325). Cheap & quick. 6. If you see a sign for 'Giggles' Restaurant (115th W & 40th) - It was gorgeous food and nice atmosphere. 7. In Greenwich Village, 'Olivers' was good food & good for people watching. (Or you can go to the Red Lion which is cheap & great for people watching). This is the 2nd time I have been to New York, (1st time was 6 weeks before 9/11) but I have to say to anyone who is worried about safety, etc. This time has been a real eye opener and the whole city and its people have changed beyond belief. I would definately agree that this is now one of the safest cities in the world. Everybody is helpful and friendly. We wandered all the streets, day and night and did'nt once feel uncomfortable.

The internet access ($14/day) was spotty -- the room phone worked only sometimes and never ever got fixed or even checked upon during our 5 day stay also I did complain several times !

The guy on reception (can't remember his name) was efficient and friendly and before I knew it I was in a warm (this was the middle of Winter), very clean and well sized room. For a NYC hotel the room size was pleasing, and my bathroom was pretty well sized as well. The hotel is located a stones throw from Central Park and I enjoyed a nice walk (some people like a jog) around the reservoir before my meetings.

For an expensive hotel the service is shocking and the \"superior queen\" sized rooms are tiny. The breakfasts are very basic: bagels (with nothing but jam or butter to spread on them) muffins and fruit if you get down early enough. However the coffee is good and available free all day. The hotel itself is beautiful which is a shame as the reception staff are the most unhelpful and uninformed that I have ever encountered. On arrival we asked to change rooms as ours was tiny and badly laid out (as other reviews have mentioned) this was honoured reluctantly and it turned out all the rooms are very small. As Carlos explained \"what do you expect in New York where space is at a premium\"!!!! On departure our credit card was declined and we were made to feel inferior because of this. Following a call to our credit card company the hotel had been taking funds on a nightly basis instead of \"pre-authorising\" and had charged us for 6 nights in total when we only stayed for 3. We were not allowed to talk to the manager and receptionist was bordering on obnoxious and would not help until our credit card company advised him that this was fraud. Other customers were having the same problems as this so please beware.

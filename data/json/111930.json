We sadly left and headed to the next relais, but Auberge was the best of our week in Napa. The location is close to all the great food and wine locations but far enough away to make it seem like paradise where you are the only person in the world who matters. The rooms are full of natural light, and the beds are feather alternative and provide for the best sleep ever. The bathroom is divided, so the toilet is in a side area with its own door.

I couldn't affort it back then, so we decided to try it for a Valentine's Day getaway. We have been fortunate to stay in several nice hotels recently(like The Peninsula in Beverly Hills and The Carlyle in NYC) so I was interested to stay at Auberge to compare because Auberge is, by far, much more expensive. I had the same experience as a previous reviewer, in that the rate I was quoted on the phone was $100 more than the rate I found on the Internet, which was frustrating and unnecessary in my view. I also used the Concierge prior to my stay to book winery tours. She was very helpful and friendly and her follow-through was excellent. She also booked a couple of local restaurants, which was great but we did not have a car and had no idea it would be impossible to get a cab back to Auberge from St. Helena. One of the couples dining at the restaurant was kind enough to give us lift - make sure you have a car. We booked the cheapest room and got an upgrade at check-in. We had a terrace but could not see the Valley yet we liked the privacy. The complimentary snacks and bottle of wine in the room was a very nice touch, as was the nightly turn-down. The staff throughout the property was very friendly. The grounds are lovely; loved the sculptures and landscaping. We ate 2 dinners at the Bistro, which is more casual than the formal dining room but we much preferred it. We had reservations at the formal restaurant for Valentine's night, but sat down and saw it was a fixed-price, four course meal and we had had so much wine that we again opted for a cheese/pate platter & oysters in the Bistro. The staff at the restaurant did not make us feel at all uncomfortable about opting for the Bistro. We had very noisy neighbors two of the three nights during our stay. I mentioned it to the front desk manager our final morning and she followed up with me after we checked out and gave us a discount on our bill. I really appreciated her taking the time and effort to address the issue even after we departed. That is an indication that Auberge cares about their guests enough to want them to return, even in a touristy area like Napa Valley. We will return, but I do feel the nightly price of this hotel is too high given the property.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cHorrible taste to the end of our trip\u201d", "Author": "Eileen L", "ReviewID": "UR124663810", "Content": "The above heading can't summarise my first visit to a.d.s enough. Having spent an amazing stay for our anniversary and my birthday in napa with the poetry inn ( which by the way the staff at auberge bistro can clearly learn sth fr in terms of service), my partner and I decided to check out auberge in view if the supposedly excellent ratings on tripadvisor as we were planning to return to napa pretty soon. To be fair we were pleasantly greeted by the staff at the front desk and lady in front of the bistro who helpfully gave suggestions. There was also a gentleman (?manager - he was in a smart blue shirt and suit) who helpfully suggested an all day bistro menu. With a gd start, we decided to have a bite at the bistro while waiting for dinner. I distinctly rem it was 4pm on 12th feb 2012. But it was downhill -fast- once we stepped in. 1) there were 3 waiters and 1 waitress at tht time. The place was not full, but no one bothered to show us to seats. Granted, it is likely perhaps a free seating bistro, so we made our way outdoors to find a tAble. HOWEVER, just a couple of minutes later, one of the waiters led a grp of ladies to their tables outdoors, while pleasantly explaining to them the amazing views their seats will have. This irks me very much and makes me wonder abt the substandard treatment. 2) my partner truly wanted us to enjoy the lovely view, considering we flew a long distance to napa and it being our first visit here. He thus went over and spoke to the (only) female waitress who mentioned we could shift over to the seats once she was done clearing the table up. We thus waited at another table . What happened next was a positive shock. The waiter whom I mentioned above led 3 ladies to the table and promptly sat them down. Granted, the team.s communication might not have been excellent and thus, he was not made aware of us wanting the tAble. However, what made me boil was h ow the lady waitress blatantly saw the three ladies sit, and didn't even flinch a bit. I waited a while to see if she will come over and at least explain or offer another seat, but no.. With such disregard, we decided not to eat at such a place. Before I left, I sought an explanation for what happened from her. And her totally not giving me any eye contact and flippantly saying \"oh yea it's free seating you knw, hang on\" while looking at the cashier was the last straw for me. is this how a supposedly renowned hotel staff treats a customer? How did the ratings get this high?? To be honest, the view is not to die for, I enjoyed better views and service from the poetry inn, it's just such a let down that such service can exist in a supposedly 5star facility housing a Michelin starred restaurant. Obviously, the service of the staff at the Bistro is not on par with that star...

Like a prior reviewer, we spent the night at the Ritz Carlton San Francisco prior. There is really no use comparing the 2 properties - they are completely different experiences. Here's a summary: - easy drive from San Francisco, took 90 minutes both ways. Take the Silverado Trail, not Route 29, it is much more picturesque. This part of Napa is not built up in the least, all you can see for miles around are rolling vineyards, picturesque villas, and majestic mountains. - another tip, the grape leaves actually turn colors in the fall just like regular trees do. it was to see rows and rows of bright yellow, orange and dark red leaves. - upon check-in you will be offered a glass of the Auberge house cabernet - it is wonderful. You'll also get a free bottle of this red, plus a white and the champagne, in your mini bar. They are fantastic. - I really recommend the Upper Valley View suite. some of the units look down over the parking area or onto other rooms (all the rooms are housed in stand-alone cottages that generally have 2 floors, with 2 rooms per floor). our view was sweeping and majestic, over the vineyards and mountain ranges beyond. our terrace was so private we could not be seen from any of the other rooms. - at first the decor of the suite struck me as dated and somewhat 70s. lots of earth tones and wooden built-ins. however, it actually grew on me over time. also, the rooms are scheduled to be updated in the near future, one of them has already been completed. - the main restaurant was fantastic - service incredibly attentive and the food was fantastic. wine list is very extensive. - the service we encountered at every turn was fantastic. for example although it was not prime season for the pool and we were the only couple there, the attendant was extremely gracious. any time we requested something be brought to the suite it appeared within 5 minutes. - the concierge arranged for two private wine tastings for us at nearby vineyards - do this! it is like going to someone's home - they are one-on-one tastings and we were invited into the vineyards to eat grapes right off the vine and were also given a tour of the production area and caves. - one more tip - we took a fantastic hike at the Oat Hill Mine trailhead in Calistoga. it is about a 10-minute drive up the Silverado Trail just over the Calistoga town line. It has some excellent vertical climb and the entire hike has fantastic views of the valley. You'll meet some very friendly people along the trail as well. - there's a nice spa area with lots of free food to nibble on, nuts, dried fruit, excellent baked bread, different types of tea, and even champagne! services were great and they have 3 different hot tubs outside set to different temperatures. - also housekeeping was fantastic. the suite was very large and every single inch of it was spotless.

The Ritz in San Fran was amazing and one of the best Ritz's we have ever seen. The upgraded room was well worth it. Although not a complete disaster, the Auberge du Soleil was a real disappointment in several ways and definitely nowhere worth the price. Yes, the service was good but far from exceptional. Yes, the suite was nice but not even close to our rooms at other hotels that were 1/2 the price. The furniture was cheap, most of the surfaces on the counter-tops were fake marble (wow) and the shower and bathroom hardware and fixtures are available at the Lowe's around the corner. The \"kitchen\" featured no ice maker, a few bottles of soft drinks, beer and wine (that are so overpriced its a joke) and a microwave oven (probably cost the hotel about $75) too small to fit the bag of popcorn offered as one of the very few snacks. Also, the shower's water pressure was ridiculously low. Finally, instead of a real bar of soap they had pump canisters of shower gel, lotion and shampoo with really cheap contents. The floors were all poorly installed wood and not even nice wood. The pool was small and only salt-water so not great for swimming laps. The restaurant in the hotel was nice because of the view overlooking the valley below. The prices were absolutely a gouge-fest. There were no options on the menu that were less than $100/person as it was all fixed price menus. Our bill for a pretty simple dinner was $330 for two people with one glass of wine each. The service was slow and we had to ask for coffee after dinner three times. Finally we just left since nobody seemed to remember. In the morning we had breakfast at the same restaurant because it was the only thing available and the breakfast although again overpriced was part of our room package so why not? Again, no coffee for a long time. The tables on the patio where setup so that they were directly into the sunlight so you couldn't see the person at your table you wanted to talk with and the umbrellas couldn't be moved to block the sun. Service was very slow but the food was very good (kudos there). I know Auberge has received great marks from others but I don't get it. Again, I am comparing it to a Ritz but the Ritz was practically half the price and in a very big and expensive city. My recommendation--if you want to tour wine country just stay in the city (San Fran) and drive up the 60 minutes or take the train and relax.

We have been lucky enough to stay at high-end properties before, but Auberge is now amongst our favourites because it's refined and classy, but still manages to be relaxed and homely. It didn't feel like a hotel in many ways, almost as though we were staying in our own wine country apartment. Of course the bed was huge, and comfortable; and the huge room offered all the amenities you could ever think of. The resort was also extremely peaceful and quiet, and we took a lovely walk through the grounds admiring some of the art installations they have on-site. The staff were great. Very helpful, and when we returned to our room after the wedding celebrations they'd laid a path of petals to the door, and left a bottle of champagne on ice and a cake for us in the room. Which was a lovely touch. The breakfast was also incredible, but perhaps our favourite memory was much more simple, it was walking out onto our balcony first thing in the morning, and having a coffee whilst still in our robes overlooking the Napa Valley below us. Of course a property of this standard doesn't come cheap, and you're paying for the exclusivity and luxury it offers. We only got to stay one night as we were off on our honeymoon the following day, and so didn't get a chance to try the spa, pool or gym; or any of the other facilities on offer which kind of felt like a shame, but we would go back without a second thought.

There was an issue or two which I will discuss later. Overall - great! First,the grounds are lovely. My best description: perfectly landscaped sculpture gardens. Flowers and more flowers. Fountains. Overlooks. Benches. Herb gardens. Second, the entire resort is cut from the hillside. Rooms are hidden in the landscape. Much privacy. Outdoor patios are secluded. Third, I really like the folks at the resort. We initially drove into the resort and were greeted by a pleasant young bellman and a check-in lady. Smiles galore. We followed our bellman's golf cart down the hill to our room. He checked us into our room and took us on a tour of the property. The spa coordinator was helpful with a minor favor. Nice folks! Fourth, the breakfast - offered in the main dining room and part of the room price - was excellent. Order from the menu. The best Eggs Benedict I have ever eaten. Finally, the evening meal has our family divided. I loved the fresh ingredients and the presentations. My wife - the food expert - was less impressed. She was unimpressed with the wine by the glass choices, the food tastes and so on. Not horrible, just not up to the highest standard. Our evening meal was about $250 for two. On one thing, we do agree - a little too expensive. To the negatives: I killed two large daddy long leg spiders in the room and found a third spider of a different species under the vanity. Please folks, use a little unscented bug spray and check the rooms for critters - daily. At $1000 or more per night, the guest deserve this. Also, the room was a bit noisy. My wife heard banging from the room above. I heard this awful loud generator during the day. Serenity killers. Please note that not every room has a panoramic valley view. We had a view of the the sky, parking lot and another building. I suspect that - the more you pay, the better the view? This is one special place, make no mistake. I can recommend it to anyone.

Check-in was a confusing process. There is simply a big parking lot where we received no direction as to where we should go or what to do. It was only after parking and walking in to the lobby that we learned that after checking in, you follow a staff member in your car through some gates and to your room where they carry your bags inside. We didn't receive any information about the room really. The staff member kind of dropped our bags and left. I will say, there wasn't much to tell. Everything is pretty straightforward. LCD TV, big shower, fireplace, small kitchenette stocked with light snacks, drinks and coffee all free of charge. Wi-Fi is free as well. The property is really beautiful and the restaurant was far and away the best meal we had over our 3 nights in the valley. The location is great. Rutherford is right in the middle of everything so St. Helena, Yountville, Oakville are all very accessible. Napa and Calistoga are the furthest drives but still not bad. Now for my gripes: I got newspapers on the 1st and 3rd mornings but not the 2nd, turn-down service comes early, typically when you are getting ready for dinner. The sound isolation between the rooms is VERY poor. Lots of banging around and general noise from adjoining rooms, the sprinkler system (sounds like a faucet is on in the bathroom) and golf carts, ladders and general maintenance out on the property in the mornings before 9am. It's a bit of a contradiction really. You have this very private and almost isolated resort nestled up above the road where you can sit out on your terrace at night and hear wild turkeys in the distance but within the resort it is just noisy. My final complaint: It's 2011 and with all the information collected on the guests before, during and after their stay, it should not be much of a mystery that there were 2 men staying in our room, not a man and a woman. It was annoying to come back to the room every night to ladies' slippers and robe on one side of the bed and mens on the other. In my opinion it speaks to a lack of personal care and attention which is unacceptable for a resort with so few rooms. In summary, the property is beautiful, but the restaurant aside I found the service to be average and even lacking in some regard. Before booking the trip, we had a debate over whether to do a week split between the Ritz-Carlton SF and Auberge or go back to O&O Palmilla for a week. You see which we picked in the end, but frankly after staying at this very highly rated/regarded and expensive resort, there is just NO comparison.

The resort itself is beautiful. Our accommodations, while expensive (an upper valley room suite), were essentially perfect - great size, awesome views, excellent amenities, good housekeeping services, etc. Where Auberge failed, and it did so in a major way, was in the poor attitude of its front desk personnel. We were checked in by two miserably unhappy and unwelcoming young women who appeared disengaged, annoyed and were essentially hostile. Its hard to describe their attitude - but its an attitude that Auberge's management should work hard to correct. None says hello, none smiles, none offers a greeting or even makes casual eye contact - its as if they've perfected the art of disdain. As an example, when we asked, politely, where we might change our clothes, store our bags, perhaps use the spa or swimming pool, have lunch, etc., until our room was ready (which we were advised would be in 3-4 hours) we were told to \"read your welcoming materials\". Rules are conveyed as commands - along the lines of \"your breakfasts are included, you may not order room service as your included breakfast, you may not have your included breakfast in any venue other than the main restaurant\" - all of this without us having asked any questions about whether breakfast was included or where we might eat it. When in another unpleasant encounter with the front desk we offered (again politely) to leave and book a room elsewhere, we were told that we were welcome to stay or that they would be happy to \"secure us alternative accommodations\". Every encounter with the front desk (fortunately, after check-in there is little need to deal with them) was one of hostility not hospitality.

We started our stay at the Post Ranch Inn, then up to The Inn at Spanish Bay, and finally ended up at Auberge du Soleil. The other 2 places were nice (Post Ranch more exclusive than Spanish Bay) but by far my favorite was Auberge. We spent about 2 nights in each location and my best sleep was the final 2 nights--not because we were getting used to the schedule but the beds were incredibly comfortable! It's amazing about all the freebies you get in the room that I don't think I've experienced anywhere else (Post Ranch also has the same arrangement.) The mini-bar and fridge were completely stocked and complimentary and replenished daily. While there, you must walk around the grounds and take a look at their sculpture garden--what a treat, and you don't really have to be art lovers to appreciate the surroundings. Usually at a place like this, you will expect to pay >1,000/night (we had the upper valley view), but hopefully you will know that at the time of booking so you won't complain about the price and say how \"expensive\" it is. Having said that, you get so much more than a comparable hotel that throws in nothing more than free bottled water. The exception would be the Four Seasons hotels. We usually stay at a Four Seasons when we travel with our children and their amenities/service is top-notch but like I mentioned before, they have never had a complimentary mini-bar. If you get a chance, splurge on dinner at The French Laundry, which the Auberge was more than happy to reserve a table for us.

When we arrived at the Auberge, the valet immediately took our car and lead us into the lobby, where a very nice woman checked us in. They handed us two glasses of chardonnay while we paroused the map of the resort. A nice way to begin our vacation. Once we escorted to our lovely upper valley king room, we were awestruck by the incredible view. We were also amazed by all of the complimentary amenities! The fridge was stocked with our favorite beverages, including a bottle of the house champagne, (very good), and on top there was an espresso maker and a lot of different snack foods. In the bathroom cabinet is every toiletry you could possibly need, in case you forgot anything. There are candles on the huge bathtub and on the fireplace in the bedroom. Very romantic. The beds were soft on top but didn't jiggle when your partner moved, so sleeping was quite comfortable. The only thing interrupting our sleep was the very thin walls. You could hear everything outside your door and through the wall next door. However, people usually tried to keep it down, apparently being aware of that fact. If you have a problem with the noise, especially with the maids outside or next door, just place a quick call to the front desk and they somehow take care of it. Our spa day was like a day in heaven! Three different temperature spring pools with spectacular views, complimentary champagne, snacks and tea were some of the highlights. The masseuses were very focused on your personal needs. The relaxation room was private and very quiet. Housekeeping was a dream team. They always came immediately when you would call for service and they always did a wonderful job, never forgetting to replenish any amenity. Turndown service was also very good, always making certain that everything was refreshed. The room and the patio were very clean. Service at the pool was unbelieveably good! The poolside server made you feel as though you had your own butler. They were attentive, without being intrusive, and master drink makers! You tell them what you want and that's exactly what you get. There was no stinginess with the alcohol in the mixed drinks. The poolside chairs were huge and wonderfully comforable. 'Floaties' in the pool were also complimentary. Lunch was always good and served promptly. The only glitch we had was when three \"C\" list celebrities took over the pool one day with very inappropriate behavior. If only I could print what they did but I shouldn't! Finally, management came in and stopped it. We were impressed by the hotel's actions. No intimidation by poorly behaving celebrities here! The restaurant was a delight, by the way. Every morning, they offer a complimentary breakfast. You can order as much as you like from the menu. Everything was fresh and delicious. On the night of our anniversary, my husband and I had the prix fixe menu with the wine pairing. We had a table outside facing the best view on the property. The food and service were very good, as was naturally, the wine list. Surprisingly, they do not limit their selections to those from Napa Valley. There were wines from all over the world. Impressive. As others have mentioned, it is expensive to come here. But when you consider all of the top notch amenities, (including the ability to borrow a brand new Mercedes every day), it really is worth the money.

In 2008 I handled Meadowood (see separate review). This year - Auberge. Ditto what everyone else says here about Auberge's amazingness. Hands down Auberge had it over The Competition with regard to view from my king \"Maison Upper Valley View\". Overlooking the valley and above the fog, the stuff postcards are made of. The room was big, but not exceptionally functional. Token big smooshie bed (good but I've slept on better), a dining table and two matching rattan chairs that were just shy of torture to sit in. The decor, while it grew on me after the first day, is bold. I hope you like orange. And tile floor. I was glad I was on the upper floor. The freebie snacks and drinks in the minibar were well thought out. Fizzy drinks, apple juice, coke, beer, bubbly and still water and couple of fun things I'd never seen before. Snacks were healthy - raisins, granola bar, nutty cracker things, and spiffy ramen noodle bowls. I snacked without guilt and appreciated not having to cart in my own. L-O-V-E-D the Nespresso coffee maker and wondered if housekeeping would miss it. The restaurant food I too found a little hit or miss - the pasta was excellent. The burger - a shoulder shrug. Breakfast room service (eggs benedict) lightening fast and very good. The staff I didn't have any negative interaction with as many here note. After getting my Shop On in downtown St. Helena (wine country = a wine bar every other doorway) I was all excited about spending my last twenty bucks in the spa boutique. What a bust. I spent it on a glass of wine instead. An entire wall of jarred mud and mashed herbs. Don't get me wrong, I love mud and herbs. But I left without even buying a t-shirt - a crime! To console myself and sober up, I walked the grounds and sculpture garden. The gardens are *meticulously* maintained, so much so I was lulled into forgiving whoever decided to go orange in the decor. So - which one is worth your hard earned dollar? Meadowood was a better fit for me. I just *felt* better there. It's cozy. It's private. I think it's entertaining to see people dress up in all white and bat pretty colored balls around the back yard. BUT....when it comes to bang for the buck, Auberge wins. The VIEW, free snacks | drinks | Nespresso, sculpture garden, pool and grounds, oak trees not dropping goop all over your Bentley - it was worth the price of admission.

My wife and I were looking forward to sleeping in until 9 or 10. Unfortunately the clamor of people checking out, loading cars, etc. was unbearable. I find this unacceptable for a room that costs almost a thousand dollars. My other sticking point is the restaurant. The wine program is very impressive, as was all those who served us. Having eaten at most of the restaurants in the area including French Laundry, we were really looking forward to a fine Napa meal within steps of our room. We found most of the dishes over salted, even sending one back. We were not the only people that felt the food was too salty.

The \"rooms\" are actually little \"casitas\" that are named after different wine regions. I love the wood floors and ceilings and the fireplaces. You don't feel you are in a hotel room at all. It's a little rustic and very private feeling. The bathrooms are large and full of wonderful products and candles (one minor complaint - the sink faucets lacked aerators so water tended to spray quite a bit) and there are skylights over the tub. A \"first aid and intimacy kit\" in the medicine cabinet included band-aids and personal lubricant (!). The bed and linens are sooooo comfy. The mini fridge is stocked with champagne, artichoke tapenade, granola bars and lots of other fun stuff and our bellman encouraged us to enjoy them as they are included in the room rate. We had lunch on the restaurant terrace with terrific wines by the glass to kick off our visit - everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The service was great and the views even better. The spa is truly fantastic - the \"Auberge massage\" is possibly the best massage I have every had. More pressure than Swedish, less intense than deep tissue. The soaking pools were inviting and empty when I was there. The swimming pool and surrounding area are beautiful and the views from the deck are breathtaking. As for service - it couldn't have been better. Solicitous without being fawning and warm without being overly familiar. As for wineries - go to all your favorites but be sure to stop by Darioush on the Silverado Trail to see the amazing Persian architecture and beautiful tasting room. The wines were also excellent. Merryvale Winery, in St. Helena, also had a great tasting room (check out their private dining room!) and delicious wine with very friendly servers. We dined at Redd (blah-overrated), Angele (romantic and delicious country French) and Mustards (delicious upscale diner food to die for-try the pulled pork sandwich!). We drove down to the town of Napa one afternoon and had lunch at Pearl - a wonderful, casual spot which had more locals than tourists in it. Great fish tacos, salads, sandwiches. If you have the time, head south to Domaine Carneros (owned by Taittinger) and enjoy some sparkling wine on the terrace.

The size is fabulous with the seperate living room, butlers kitchen and wonderful bedroom with truly fabulous bedding! But, I tend to appreciate more lush furnishings...and the Auberge is a bit stark for my taste, with a southwestern/contemporary flair. The chairs and coaches are quite stiff and cumbersome...and the rag rugs on the wonderful wood floors a bit tired and dingy looking. Having said this...once you add a roaring fire and light the many candles...the whole effect is quite wonderful! We ate twice at the hotel, once in the formal dining room and once on the bar terrace.

I get a little excited just saying it. This place just exudes a blissed out yumminess for me. I will confess up front that I am biased. My husband and I were engaged at the Auberge in a sweet and somewhat tipsy blur. We were also married and recently celebrated an anniversary there. It has been the stage for many happy events. The rooms are perfect in decor, comfort and style. You will want to live here. They really nailed all the details with lots of nice textures, a mostly subtle color palette with a bright splash here and there. All rooms have decks with fabulous views of the valley. The candles, fireplace and well thought out lighting are all excellent touches. Nicer still is the fully stocked pantry filled with complimentary snacks, water, sodas, wine and beer. They also have a proper in-room coffee set up. I've always been annoyed by hotels in this category that nickel and dime guests with their mini-bar nonsense. The Auberge really takes things to a new level by simply providing everything you might want. You feel like a guest in someone's thoughtfully stocked guest house instead of like you are in a hotel. The beds are some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The spa is spectacular. The details are amazing, for example the massage rooms have radiant heated floors for the cold months. There are pools at different temperatures to meet your needs. There is fruit infused water that is so tasty you'll wonder what is in it. The newly renovated pool is absolutely gorgeous. Lots of lovely couches to curl up on and billowy white drapes. Service, although a bit stiff, is quite good. During our wedding weekend in particular, we joked that if we had called and asked for a pony, one would probably have appeared at our door within 10 minutes. They will help you choose wineries to visit, set up tours, arrange transportation and in our case, go find you a pair of scissors in a hurry. Downsides, which in my opinion are balanced by the upside, and can be managed if you know what's up... The place has gotten so much hype lately (mentioned on Entourage, Christina Aguilera stayed here during her wedding weekend) that it seems to be filled with an LA \"I'm so hip/famous/cool that I can't speak\" element that I don't find particularly enjoyable. The great thing is that you can almost avoid this completely by avoiding the bar and restaurant. Yes, you will probably run into this scene at the pool, but you'd be missing out by avoiding that after all! You're not missing anything by avoiding the bar (bad service, bad vibe). I think you do miss a bit by avoiding the restaurant which is lovely, but you can have the same menu delivered to your room. Very romantic, private and not a big scene. The prices have also gone through the roof. It graduated from really, really expensive to \"holy crap\" on our last visit ($980 for a lovely but smallish room recently, compared to $700 for a much bigger one a few years ago).

Having a wonderful driver who knows the small wineries where you get more for your money and often get to meet the wine makers themselves made all of the difference to our trip. I cannot recommend Larry (Your driver in Napa) highly enough.

As it was a surprise visit for my wife's birthday (we live in Virginia and had never been to Napa), I had booked another hotel and was put on the wait list at Auberge.

She informed me that a room had come available for the dates that I had requested. Whirlwind ensued cancelling other accomodations...which had a 72 hour cancellation policy. Hey...it was 75 hours out! After a couple days in San Francisco, we arrived at the hotel. The property is just what the Doctor ordered. Friendly, courteous check in. Escorted to suite by following golf cart driven by bellman. Lower Level suite was wonderful. Simple tiled floors, lovely French Doors to patio, large luxurious bathroom with sunken tub and separate shower. Great amenities. The best part was the unbelievable bedding. Room had two flat screens and a CD player witha small library of music. Working fireplace that was great both in the morning and evening. Thought it was hard to beat Ritz Carlton, but guess what, it did!!! We did not eat at the restaurant, but did enjoy the verandah by off the lounge two of the evenings. Stunning views and wonderful selection of appetizers. Casual yet crisp service. Room service as well was first class. Waiter actually retreived toaster from under coffee pantry in room and plugged it in on patio to allow us to toast bagel for Smoked salmon. Little things do make a difference. Concierges were most helpful. Steered us towards great wine venues and made any reservation requests that we had with ease. Upon departure, I had over six cases of wine to be shipped. They arranged everything and it arrived back on the East coast in tact. While the rates are very high, it was worth every penny.

Each time we tell our friends that, however, it's always followed by \"but it's worth every penny.\" Our praises start months before our stay even began. In planning our special vacation, I contacted the hotel's concierge for ideas and help. He was prompt and professional, sending me maps and lists of suggested restaurants and vineyards. He was even able to secure a reservation at a certain culinary temple in Yountville for us! We arrived at Auberge and were greeted warmly by the staff. If your idea of luxury is laced with pomp and ceremony, this is not the place for you. What sets Auberge apart is their way of making you feel thought of, taken care of, at home in every single way. Upon signing in we were told that our room had been upgraded. And what a room it was! Spacious, beautiful, perfect, it came with a private terrace overlooking the valley, a fireplace, 3 flatscreen TVs, and a luxurious bathroom. The personal touches all serve to make you feel at home (your names are handwritten on the mailbox outside your suite, you have a choice of newspapers in the morning, a welcome note with complimentary cheese and wine await you at arrival). The spa is a must (try the couples outdoor mud bath and massage treatment). They even arranged for a tennis partner for me (my partner doesn't play). The hotel also arranged for a knowledgeable driver to take us for a wine-tasting tour. And have drinks at the main house terrace at sunset; nothing will compare to the experience.

What I didnt like was the $20 fee for checking in early. In my many travels around the world I have not encountered this. I also didn't like the shower/tub. This appears to be the only area in the room that has not been re- done and boy does it need it. Poor water pressure and the nozzle is sonlow down on the wall i had to bend way down just to get my hair under the water. As for restaurants, it was convenient to have a starbucks in the hotel but there wasn't much choice for casual dining. We did try to go to the beach cafe one day for lunch and they said the wait was 25 minutes to sit outside. I found this interesting as there appeared to be many open seats. We ate at Bacio one night and the food and service was excellent. However, we did find it curious that they leave the tables set with cutlery overnight as part of the restaurant is beside a main walkway in the hotel.

The rooms are clean and well appointed. We were amazed how quickly the room was cleaned every day. We stayed in the Club Tower, and although this made for a long walk every time we went to the \"Strip\", it was a nice quiet room. The Tropicana is at one end of the strip, so it is not ideally located if you want to explore the various casinos, but the location also means that you are away from the crazy crowds and annoying \"girly card\" flickers and beggers. The location also means that it is quieter when you want quiet. The Tropicana does not have the variety of restaurants you can find in many of the resorts, but the three they do have are good. We ate two meals in the Beach Cafe and enjoyed this little place. The other two higher end restaurants have good reviews and the steak house is reputed to be one of the best in Vegas, but we did not eat there. Staff were always friendly and helpful in all areas.

The Cosmopolitan was never in my plans for this 2 day birthday trip to Las Vegas. I decided to stay at the Tropicana because of the favorable reviews I read here on Trip Advisor (usually very reliable). Upon my check-in, I was charged an early check in fee (1:30 pm), but I was ok with that. I made the long trek to the Club Tower where there was 0 air conditioning and it felt like a sauna down that walkway. Once i got to the room, the room was absolutely HOT and STUFFY. Even my cousin who usually likes her apartment at 80 degrees commented that it felt hot. So I called front desk to ask them if we could get another room, but they said they'd send an Engineer instead. The engineer did come promptly and first words out of his mouth were \"It feels Cool to me\". He did end up changing the air filter (dirty) and said he'd make some adjustments in the chiller room, but that helped minimaly. The temp dropped to 70 and never below that (even though the thermostat was set to 60). So we laid down for a nap in this hot stuffy room, and all we could hear was the jackhammer from the pool area. The noise was unbearable. So I called front desk once more AND they told me that ALL double rooms face the construction noise. They acknowledged that these rooms were noisy, BUT FAILED to do so while we were checking in. At this point, I decided just to put up with it AND not let it ruin my birthday. Dinner at Diego at the MGM Grand was fine. Once we got back and went to sleep, I woke up at 4 am in a warm sweat. The room just felt Muggy like a summer day in Houston. At 7:00 am (with the jackhammer outside already blasting), me and my cousin had enough. She said \"I feel hot and if I feel hot you must be miserable.\" So I went to the front desk, and checked out. Worst part is that the front desk agent admitted that the rooms probably wouldn't get much more below 70 degrees. WIsh these same front desk agents would have told me about this and the excessive construction noise before I checked in. SO now im here at the Cosmopolitan. Why the Cosmopolitan? Well I told my cousin Id rather pay a premium than risk spending my actual birthday day in misery here in Las Vegas. I'll review the Cosmopolitan later, but so far it's a complete 180 from the Tropicana.

This hotel would definitely *not* be my first choice, but I will try to review without prejudice, based on what the hotel does offer (not much, dear reader). If like me, you clamor for a theme hotel in outlandish Vegas style, or a luxurious experience, move along quickly, as you won't find it here. By 'it' I mean anything extraordinary in any way, in terms of kitsch, elegance, service, amenities or style. If recent renovations and a central South Strip locale are what you're after, then have at it. The good - Centrally located - very convenient and safe parking lot (only dept where The Trop truly excels...a rarity in Vegas) - Newly renovated rooms, everything works - good housekeeping The bad -lax security - nothing good to eat in hotel -Rooms have absolutely zero style (allegedly there's a Tropical theme here, other than a faux coconut air freshener, theme undetected) -no good attractions or shows in hotel - no frills architecture -no front desk to be found late at night...this happened to me several times...unheard of, and I used to tour for a living, so I've stayed in a variety of places from Ritz Carltons to Motel 6s. Basically ....in these rough economic times, Vegas has some fabulous places to stay for very low sums. There's no reason on Earth to stay here, as service and style are nonexistent. Thumbs way down.

Rooms: Stayed in the paradise tower which is the one closest to the reception - best tower to stay in as closer to the strip and the walk ways to Excalibur and MGM. Also handy for the deuce bus stop. Standard room had two double beds, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Lovely and clean and modern although the bedside lighting wasn't very bright and made it hard to read when in bed. The windows open so you can get fresh air instead of the noisy air conditioning although the road noise was loud as we had a room strip side room but earplugs soon sorted that out. No coffee maker/kettle just an ice bucket. Huge TV, iron and ironing board. Bathroom was large, towels were thick and fluffy and changed every day. Included toiletries were shampoo, Conditioner, moisturising cream and a bar of soap but no shower gel. All smelt of coconut which I'm not keen on so didn't make use of. Plenty of hot water and a good water pressure. The maids came in every day and did a great job and kept it spotlessly clean. Since it was a reasonably small hotel it didn't take long to get to our room. All in all very satisfied with the room. Check in/out was quick and no queue. Staff friendly Restaurants: we only tried Baccio on the second from last night. Food looked great but the two of us who had the prawn pasta were up all night with sickness and diarroeha the person who had the chicken was ok. We did go back the following morning to tell them that there may be a problem with the prawns and we didn't want anyone else to get sick but found out that they didn't open until 5pm which was no good as it was our last night and we didn't want to have to come all the way back to the hotel. The lady at reception when we checked out said we should have gone to security to make them aware. It would never have occurred to us to go to security to pass on a comment about the restaurant. Did visit nicer restaurants so we wouldn't visit Baccio again, was quite expensive as well. Pool - really disappointed as it was being refurbished when we were there. I'm sure it is wonderful when it is up and running. This was one of the reasons we booked this hotel as it said what a wonderful pool/pool area it had. We thought that since we were staying a week in Vegas we would have a couple of days relaxing around the pool to recharge our batteries from all the walking. We booked last April and there was no mention that the pool closes in the winter. The lady on reception said it states clearly on the website that it is closed until the end of March - yes it does now but it didn't last April when we booked it. It would'nt have been so bad if they had done the same as Caesars Palace and cordoned off the pool but left the sun bed area usable. There were only about 10 beds available for use near Cafe Nikki which were all taken. Resort fees - I don't understand these at all. Pool closed - so one facility not available. Why not do what most hotels throughout the world do, if you want to use Wifi then charge for it. Gyms, pools etc are free to use in virtually all hotels in any country as it is part and parcel of enticements to draw customers. Do feel at $14.99 a night on top of the room rate is very expensive when none of the things included we used or were able to as not in service. Also, when you read on here that the resort fee was waived for some people does make me cross. All in all the Tropicana is a good hotel if you get a good rate. Comfortable and clean rooms, friendly staff, close to the airport. $15 in a taxi. The only reason for not giving it 5 are the pool area being closed and the resort fee.

We got a great Air/Hotel Deal through Expedia, and booked a Strip View room. When we arrived, very late Friday night, the room they had for us was on the 3rd floor\u2026 not really a view in my opinion. My husband asked if they had any upgrades, or higher floors available, but they said they were booked and would try to offer us something the next day. Being very tired, we said fine. When we got to our room, it was behind the Hotel Sign overlooking the roof with the AC units\u2026.They call that a Strip View? The room was ok, not as nice as other hotels we have stayed at in Vegas, but acceptable (with the exception of the Strip View). My husband and I had a little laugh...it was almost like a repeat of our first visit. The reason I mention our first stay at the Tropicana is because my second trip had started out much the same way.

So let me say that we would certainly stay here again. And now, here are just some of the fine points and surprises: 1. The Beach Cafe --- for breakfast, a MUST. A great breakfast buffet. Not with the 100 items that we associate with Las Vegas buffets, but a buffet like a 4* hotel in a major city. Lox, omelet station, half dozen cut fresh fruit and ALL Ripe, plus kumquats, kiwi, nuts, figs, apples, oranges, bananas, and of course bacon (thick, tasty and crisp), sausage, and even fresh, ripe avocado. And the price, a steal at $18.99 which included coffee. AND if that isn't good enough, this is located adjacent to a beautiful, tropical-like grass, palm tree and pool area, AWAY from the casino so you hear music (and if you are sitting outside a waterfall) and not the kachinging of slot machines. 2. Now the room. Huge by most standards. One of the largest we have encountered in 6 or so hotels that I've been in during Las Vegas visits. CLEAN. And the room was made up within 2 hours of leaving this morning, without us even asking! 3. The bathroom. Large, bright, good towels. I'd have preferred a walk-in shower, rather than a tub/shower combo, but what's to complain. 4. The staff. So far friendly, helpful, professional. Our Waitress (Wendy) in the Beach Cafe is memorable as one of the most personable servers encountered in a location like Las Vegas where staff is often perfunctorily friendly. Wendy truly is, even to the point of knowing our names and using them appropriately. The Tropicana Experience (2) Above I wrote of Day 1 experiences in glowing terms (above). Now I add a couple of items, also favorable. The POOL area. One of the nicest in my experience. Multiple areas, multiple spas, a lot of grassy areas which are not flat (hilly?), shady areas if you want to avoid sun, waterfalls in many places (even some that are good for a back massage) AND chaise lounges with thick padded cushions at no extra charge. Next, I hate the idea of \"RESORT FEES\" and the resort fee at the Tropicana is no exception. But for the fee you get an excellent gym (a bit small but otherwise great), in room / in hotel internet service that really works (I used it for realtime stock trading using 2 computers with no problems) and also for Netflix video. The BREAKFAST buffet stood the test of time across multiple days. Excellent food and service as I said initially. Are there any DOWNSIDES to the Tropicana? Well yes. The two bars are basically for the sports lovers only with screens all over, the sound of the TV's and the patrons often at ear splitting levels. So a relaxing place to have a drink is missing. And room service \"Forgot\" my order on my checkout morning when I had an early flight to catch. So I went to the airport without anything for the commencement of a 5 hour flight. The one \"upper end\" restaurant (Biscayne) that I ate at was OK, but no cigar, at least for what I had (Prime Rib). The atmosphere was nice, at least until several loud parties descended on the restaurant, but on the whole I'd say that for a nice, relaxing dinner you can do better elsewhere. However, it is away from the casino, with window tables are overlooking the pool area, so the location is a plus. Lastly there is a lot of sound carry between rooms that are adjoining due to no insulation between the adjoining doors. So if you have partying neighbors (which we did for a couple of nights), be prepared to go next door and join their party ... unless they are fighting with each other. This hotel (and all hotels) should really put sound insulation between the adjoining doors. I don't understand why this is so rare. A Problem: How it is handled is the Mark of Excellence Soon after posting a very favorable initial review of the Tropicana, I encountered a problem. The mark of a good hotel is how they handle a problem or incident. Let me say that the handling of the incident was exemplary. Across the course of nearly a week, I dealt with over a dozen managers and supervisors. With only 1 1/2 exceptions, they were all exceptional. Providing assistance that went beyond my expectations. I would overall give the handling of the problem 4 1/2 stars out of 5, the 1/2 being solely due to one manager who I would give a 2. If it would be appropriate, I would list the many 5 star performers, but it is not. If there is one lesson that I take away, it is that if you do not promptly get the assistance with a problem that you feel is appropriate, do not hesitate to contact another manager or supervisor. And keep your cool throughout. I would not hesitate in going back to the Tropicana both because of the quality of the hotel experience and because if, in the unlikely event that a problem arises, the response of the staff and management is outstanding. So, in summary.....do not hesitate to go to the Tropicana. It is close to everything and small enough to not be a factory like some of the other properties.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cADA Accomadations\u201d", "Author": "dellama", "ReviewID": "UR126730633", "Content": "For all my ADA peeps out there.......DON'T STAY AT TROPICANA!!

Check-in: There was no queuing which was great but the lady that checked me in was extremely unfriendly. She barely said a word to me, gave me no information and was a very poor advertisement for the hotel. Room: I had selected one of the standard rooms, so nothing too exciting. As expected due to the refurbishment it was clean, relatively modern and comfortable. I had a room with twin beds and they were large and provided a quality night of sleep. I heard very little noise from the surrounding rooms. The bathroom was more dated but was adequate. It had a combined bath/shower, about what I would expect for a mid range hotel, so no complaints. There was no fridge in the room at all which was surprising, even just as a minibar to sell extra to guests. I would love to think that hotels would eventually realise that customers would like some form of storage for the odd bottle of water, soft drink or even some simple food. The room had a large tv with a decent range of channels. WiFi in the room was intermittent; I had to sit by the bedroom door for consistent access. This is most likely due to the thicker walls from the older building. Again not top of the range but perfectly acceptable for this level of hotel. The negatives... I would have liked a coffee machine or at the very least a kettle, a common theme for me in Vegas hotels. As noted above, some form of refrigeration space would have been helpful; I like the odd in room tea or coffee and to store some soft drinks (not always the ones sold in the vending machines). Dining: I didn\u2019t try out any of the high end dining options but made use of the Beach Caf\u00e9 and Marketplace. The beach caf\u00e9 was very average although reasonable for the price whilst the marketplace offered simple decent quality food for the price. I was pleased to find a Starbucks on site, useful for a morning coffee and some cake. Casino: The casino isn\u2019t the biggest but it had a friendly atmosphere and plenty of people making use of the slots and tables. I liked the environment and would happily visit even if not staying at the hotel. Sports Book: This was old and dated, very American in terms of content, so I had to go elsewhere to catch some UK sports. I think it could do with some expenditure to bring it up to date. Pool: This was my main disappointment with the hotel. I had primarily booked the Tropicana for two main reasons, the newly renovated rooms (leading to excellent reviews) and the pool. As I found upon arrival, the pool was closed, not because of the weather as other reviews had indicated, but because they were still building it! Using a lounger on the grass isn\u2019t quite the same and really did spoil things for me. I raised this complaint with reservations, see below for details. Bars: There seemed to be one main bar which was pretty nice and had a good feel to it. I had a couple of drinks there and was happy to go back. It was a good place to meet friends and have a relaxed drink. Clientele: The Tropicana seemed to have a largely older clientele, more so than most other Vegas hotels I have stayed at. This is not to say though that there weren\u2019t plenty of business and younger customers. I thought there was a good mix and found it a good place to stay. Location: Towards the end of the strip I can see that the location could cause issues for some. For me it was perfectly fine, with easy access to the strip and all the action. If you want to party, I would stay somewhere more central, but otherwise the location was perfectly good. Gym: I did not check out the gym or spa. Other: As noted above, I raised an issue with reservations due to the pool being closed. Whilst unfair to disclose details, I was extremely impressed with the response and action that I received. The gentleman who called me was willing to do whatever was required to make me happy, offering me a huge number of options to make my stay better and compensate for the pool being closed. The service I received showed me that the Tropicana actually values its customers very highly and will really go the extra mile to ensure that they enjoy their stay. The way that the hotel dealt with my complaint was enough to make me go back on its own, not because of how they compensated me, but because they were so professional, understanding and willing to show how much they valued my custom. Overall: As a mid range hotel, I think this is an excellent choice in Vegas. The rooms are comfortable, the hotel is friendly and relaxed, the refurbishment gives it a more modern feel and most importantly, the hotel cares about its customers. If I came back to Vegas, would I come back to the Tropicana? Yes, no doubt about it. Would I recommend to friends? Yes, but it would depend on what type of holiday they wanted.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brampton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat alternative to Massive Hotels\u201d", "Author": "donald m", "ReviewID": "UR126705451", "Content": "This Hotel was recently renovated and it is a great bargain for the price and amenities.

You'll have quite a walk to get to the rest of the casinos and other attractions on the strip. Also, speaking of walking, we were in the club tower and it's a long, and I do mean long, walk from the main entrance. Also, it's right next to the airport. Our room faced the airport so we heard the noise all night and day. Secondly, while our room was relatively clean and spacious, the bathroom was dirty and horribly outdated. There were chipped tiles and grout along with mildew and grim in the edges. The shower head was over an oddly shaped bathtub and was very low. My husband is around 6 feet and had to crouch down to use it. The decor has the \"south beach\" feel to it but it's cheaply done. The staff weren't particularly friendly or helpful either. We didn't use the pool, but it appears they're doing renovations and attempting to expand the area but I didn't see anyone working on that part of the property while there. Now on to the worst part: the smell. I'm not sure what they're pumping onto the casino floors, but it's like a coconut/tropical scent and it's disgusting. Also, we frequently smelled sewer gas while near the escalators going towards the restaurants and club tower. We were on a nonsmoking floor, but several times our room reeked of cigarette smoke and it seemed to be coming from of the air vent. I wish we had spent the money and stayed elsewhere.

The hotel rooms are all newly redone, very clean, the bed is EXTREMELY comfortable. Shower heads in most of the Club rooms are too low. Depending on how tall you are can be pretty uncomfortable to wash your hair. The location is great - at the end of the strip near the airport, however there is soooo much within a short walk - MGM, Luxor, Excalibur, NY, so no lack of things to do in the area. Another 10 minute walk & you're at Bellagio, Bally's, Caesar's Palace.

I was told that there were no other options until the next day, so I accepted the smoking room for one night, and they put notes in \"the system\" to hold a non-smoking room for me the next day. After about a quarter mile walk (no lie) with my bags to wait behind a hoard of people to get on an elevator, I got to my residential ashtray. It wasn't just smelly, it was filthy. The next day, after a long day in a tradeshow booth, I patiently stood back in the check-in line for about 35 minutes, waiting for a front desk person to wait on me while at least 12-15 people walked past me to be waited on at the \"VIP\" desk area, making it painfully obvious that \"regular\" customers aren't valued there.

The pro\u2019s is it\u2019s nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, the cons it\u2019s a long strip so being at the end means lots of walking. The other pro is the hotel is not as huge as some of the others so you won\u2019t get lost in it. The rooms were clean and tidy and I will say the beds were really comfortable. All other areas of the hotel were also well kept. However the room we had had an adjoining door to another room, so just when we were settling down for the night the blokes next door decided to up the anti and have a karaoke party and it was like they were in the room with us. In fairness the security guard came and spoke to them and they shut it off straight away but even then when they were just talking we could hear every word so the rooms with adjoining doors are not soundproof. We rang reception and moved rooms to one without an adjoining room. One thing I didn\u2019t like at the hotel was the way the women servers in the casino were dressed, being kind they were mostly way past mid life age and wearing red satin short low cut dresses. I felt sorry for them being degraded into wearing such dreadful tacky uniforms and whilst Vegas itself is known to be tacky, I am sure that those women (in their 60\u2019s) would prefer to wear something a little less tarty.

The Tropicana was convenient but the rates were $95 a night, which I thought was a bit high. I really think that the \"resort fee\" that so many hotels are tacking on to room rates are ridiculous. If you can't opt out of the fee it should just be included in the price of the room. The Tropicana \"only\" charged $14.99 compared to the $20.00 and up at other hotels. All I received for the fee was phone service and Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi did work, I had no issues. Check-in was slow, the clerks are friendly but they need more of them at the counter. I paid extra to have a room in the Paradise Tower but the clerk said they only had a double bedded room, instead of the King I asked for, with just a shower. The lights did not work in the bathroom but I could see that it was a roll in shower, which the clerk did not mention. I called the front desk and this clerk said he would have a room in half an hour and for me to just wait in the room. Luckily, he called back in 10 minutes with a King room. The bellman was very nice and the new room was much better. The room did look like the pictures on the web site, but the bathroom fan was very noisy and had a lot of dust on it. The tub could have stood some refinishing along with the tile floor but the sink and counter were very nice. The bed was comfortable enough and it had king sized pillows not those awful postage stamp pillows that many hotels have. On the hotel's key card envelope it says they are changing everything, so maybe they just haven't done the tubs and floors yet. There was some street noise to be heard even on the 14th floor but closing the shutters helped. I would think that the Club Tower would be quieter because it is away from the Strip. I didn't hear much noise from the hallway and just a bit of noise from the room next door. There was a rather strong perfume smell in the hallway that I could have done without but it didn't come into the room so I survived. I liked that I didn't have to trudge through a big casino to get to the elevators and the parking was much closer than at most Las Vegas hotels.

This is the second time we have stayed at the Tropicana in Las Vegas...The first time they were still working on the renovations, so I didnt think that I would be able to give a fair review, and now everything is complete so here it is. There for 5 of us for this trip, we stayed for a week. I have to say that we will plan to stay at the Tropicana for every future trip to Vegas. We had arranged to have the hotel limo pick us up at the airport, our flight was delayed by three hours due to some weather issues. I was concerned that noone would be there to pick us up, as we came down the escalator there was our driver waiting patiently for us, so that was great !! We had a little glitch with checkin, our reservation was actually for the next day, but in no time that had gotten that straightened out and off to our rooms we went. The rooms were perfectly fine as they were the last time we were there. If you havent been to |Vegas, at night it can be noisy with the traffic , airplanes, helicopters, sirens and people....you learn to expect that your sleeps maybe interupted but I have learnt to accept that. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. Housekeeping does a fine job.....The rooms do not have coffee pots but you can ask at the front desk and they will gladly supply you with one. The casino its self it alot smaller than others, but it it nice to be able find others that you are travelling with. The drink service is excellent, I think because it is smaller the waitresses are able to make their rounds fairly quickly. A couple of the guys that travel with us spent alot of time at the tables and they were very happy with the dealers and the service they received at the tables. All the staff we encountered were very kind courteous and helpful. There are numerous options for food as well....There are two restaurants up top a steak house and italian restaurant.....we didnt eat that either of these restaurants this trip, but we did the last time and they were both excellent....there is now a Starbucks---which is extremely important to me !!--and well as a little fast food/deli--they offer pizza, sandwiches, soup, fries,orings and breakfast sandwiches and stuff, as well as the naked spoon which is frozen yogurt, with options to make your own smoothies and stuff....There is also the Beach cafe, which has a full menu from breakfast options, salads, fish, burgers, prime rib and steaks.....Lots of options for any type of eaters. There is also the option to sit out of the patio for this restaurant and take in the beautiful garden area. Please note the deli and Starbucks are open 24 hrs.....There is an outdoor pool/pools the entire area is breathtaking, but I believe there were many disappointed guests as the pools dont open until April, so keep that in mind. There is also a fitness center, and also a full service spa....I am unable to comment on either of these, as I didnt use these services, but definately the next trip I will be booking a date at the spa, and then will be able to write a review. We are not clubbers ourselves, but there is one here---RPM-- I can tell you on the weekend that there was quite a line up to get in, so I guess that speaks for itself. As far as the location goes, it is on the end of the strip, I personally dont mind that, its minutes from the airport, the monorail is right across the street at the MGM, and that will get you down the strip. The Excalibur/Luxor/MGM and NewYork are all across the street with easy access, if you choose to walk around. There are also some fast food -Mcdonalds/ Quiznos/DQ and Pizza hut if you are looking for some different options....Overall I feel that there is no reason to stay anywhere else, we are extremely happy with absolutely everything that this hotel offers. I want to send out a BIG thankyou to Julie for helping me arrange everything....And to also thank her for all the little perks, I couldnt of asked for a better host !!

In our opinion, it is more comparable to TI, Monte Carlo, etc. Would we recomend the hotel to others...yes. Would we stay there again...no. The reasons for the no is that are so many other properties we have not yet had the opportunity to visit as well as it was our least favorite hotel of the ones we have visited to date. The room was a Junior/Corner Suite on the 10th floor in the Club Tower. It had a king size bed, desk, and a sitting area; and the bathroom had a one-sink marble vanity and a large soaking tub for two. There was not a minibar, wine opener, or wine glasses. We had reserved a Keurig coffee machine but had to call the desk for it to be in our room once we realized it was not there for us. The room was very quiet and we experienced no noise from neighbors. The room was nice and clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The decor in the hallways and rooms were basic reminding my wife of a standard Marriot hotel or less. Everything we saw in the hotel was clean and well maintained. The one issue we did have was that we felt that extra money should have been spent in the bathroom. The vanity had a nice sink and faucet, but the floor and wall tiles were residential grade ceramic, The tub needed caulking in spots where it met the tiles. The look and feel of the bathroom would have been better if there had been at least simple marble tile. The bellmen delivered our bags quickly and the valet was quick. Never had to wait long for our car at all. We did not have any noise issues from the pool and/or clubs. We did have to ask for extra towels and washcloths a couple of times. This was noticed since at other properties, we have never had to ask because there were always plenty. That being said, when we did request them, they were delivered quickly. The outside of the hotel and exterior entry has been updated and is nice. The lobby has not been renovated and in speaking with the lady while checking in, the front desk and lobby will be renovated soon. This area should have been one of the first things renovated since this gives the first impression of the property. However, the property is also adding a spa and is undergoing construction for improvements in the business center area. There has to be a reason why the lobby was yet to be renovated. We just were disappoited to walk in and see the new casino and then go to the unrenovated lobby area. It seemed not to flow well. The gaming area was bright and airy with a very good atmoshpere. We arrived on Monday, and the casino was slow during the day and was busier at night. As the week went on, the casino was definately busier, and by Thursday night it was packed. We checked out of the hotel around 11am on Friday, and the slots were busy with the majority of the tables occupied. The casino is on the smaller side, but this is not a negative but a plus for us. It made the property easier to navigate. There was a good selection of slot and video poker machines and a varity of table games. The chairs in the casio were comfortable. I did spend several hours in the poker room. The dealers were very knowledgable of the game and the players friendly. I really enjoyed playing in this casino. It is a smaller room, but has a good feel to it. The first night there, my table had some new players combined with several experienced players. While on the second night I played, the table was full of good players and a few local grinders. The chairs were comfortable and drink service was good. They have Kruieg coffee makers and bottled water in the room for players and a bar just outside the casino if one has to have cocktails immediately. Drink service was good. The first night it had been a while since we had a cocktail waitress come by and the room supervisor took care of that. The link between the Paradise and Club Towers had the some nicely designed restaurants and shops. Once past this area, the link appeared appeared to be slightly worn (even though it had been recently renovated). We did not use the pool area, but it appeared to be large and well maintained.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greendale, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Remodel Job\u201d", "Author": "Bucky64", "ReviewID": "UR126073196", "Content": "The hotel has experienced a $180M remodeling.

I emailed prior to our arrival to see if they had strip view (Paradise Tower) rooms available and they said we would be upgraded if available upon arrival. There were none available upon arrival so they upgraded us to a bigger room on the 17th floor of the Club Tower. No worries there, it was still a nice room. I have no complaints about the walk from the gaming floor to the Club Tower, just meant a better night's sleep for my husband and I away from all the slot machine noises! As others have mentioned, it's newly remodelled and the decor is very fresh and bright. The bathroom in our suite definitely had not been upgraded yet, so maybe they are still working on finishing those up. The location is good, I personally prefer the other end of the strip better but that really is just a personal preference. It is better for airport shuttle as you will be one of the first to be dropped off! Also pretty close to the outlet malls if you are going to check those out (but I wouldn't, thought it was a waste of half a day and cab fare). We had breakfast buffet vouchers included with our stay, which we took advantage of each morning, one less expensive meal to pay for is a good thing in a place as pricey as Vegas! I honestly wouldn't pay for the buffet given the option, the food just wasn't that good. The resort fee was a little silly, especially given that the pool area is still under construction. Also, wifi should come free with these big hotels. But I guess the resort fee is becoming a standard for many of the strip hotels. I think perhaps they shouldn't be charging as much or at all in the cooler months when you cannot take advantage of the pools. We also had a very nice meal at Biscayne, we purchased a voucher with our show tickets which enabled us 50% off any entree (but not crab or lobster which they dont tell you until after you purchase), and we both really enjoyed our meal.

My wife and I stayed here with another couple from 3/3 to 3/10. As many have mentioned, the TropLV has a very distinct \"white\" theme going on, which is fine as it gives an open air tropical feeling to the whole place. Everything was clean and new looking with one fairly big exception that I'll get to later. Check in and check out was very fast (5 minutes each) with almost no lines. The people in the hotel were very helpful and friendly. Me and my buddy used the $20 sandwich trick I'd read about and got our rooms slightly upgraded to the \"deluxe plus\" for free for the entire week. And to tell the truth, I think we may have gotten it without the trick. My room was a 15th floor corner unit in the rear Club tower next to Tropicana Ave. Our friends got the same unit on the 18th floor. I have to admit, since they weren't that crowed when we arrived, I was hoping for a bit more like a small suite, but no dice... oh well, I tried. The view of the strip was limited to the side of the MGM and to the airport. Overall, it was just OK for a free upgrade, but I wouldn't pay any extra for these rooms. I was a bit underwelmed by them overall. The rooms were mostly nice and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The windows open a crack if you want a little fresh air. Nice TV with several useful selections, although who watches TV in Vegas. The WiFi reception was mostly very good in our room. The \"exception\" I mentioned above had to do with room cleaning. My wife noticed that they didn't clean the floor and sink area in the bathroom all that well. And one time we got a towel with some unidentified stain, that was gross. And the bathrooms, at least in the Club tower, apparently were not part of the overall renovations they did last year. The tile and fixtures were noticably older and worn and didn't match the otherwise bright decor at all. Very disappointing bathrooms for an other wise polished facility. Also, our friends room had a bathroom door that had been kicked in and splintered by someone before they arrived. It took them two days and and several calls to the front desk to get somebody to even come look at it. Then they only removed the door and never replaced it during our friends 1 week stay. You'd think they'd have some extra doors handy... but no. BTW, don't listen to all the whiners that complain about the walk being so long from the rear Club tower. It was no more then 5 easy uncrowded minutes mostly across a bright and scenic passageway over the pool areas from our room to reach the Strip. And our room was about as far from the front as you can get in the hotel. I'll bet we made that trip 40 times during the week stay and it was never a burden at all. It was actually kind of nice. Compare it to the equally long or much longer walks through crowded, dark, noisey casino's, you have to make in any of the other bigger strip hotels, and you start to really appreciate the somewhat lower key Tropicana. Finally, the TropLV's location on the strip is ideal. Again, don't listen to the whiners about it's being to far south on the strip. I swear some people can't walk 10 feet without complaining. It's a short 15-20 minute walk to City Center and several of the major casinos. And if you are physically incapable of walking very far there is good access (5-10 minutes) to 3 of the 4 strip trams and the bus routes are even closer. It's also very close to the airport and just off the major highways if you want to head out of town for a trip to the Grand Canyon or the Hoover Dam.

I was hesitant at first but decided to give the Trop a try when our much larger with kitchen 1st choice fell through. I did call ahead with several questions regarding some concerns we had...like no fridge in room, location of rooms, and amenities around. Unfortunately after 2 emails I only received replies back after our stay was over...sigh. The re-model looks to be completely finished and the standard was good for the price. As others have mentioned the coconut scent is strong and we did notice remnants in the rooms as well - tolerable but we would of preferred a more subtle scent or none at all. We ended up with 2 connecting rooms and one stand alone room all in the Paradise tower all double queen beds. The rooms were fine and connecting room was particularly convenient for the kids to run back and forth between during the day. As others have mentioned the windows are covered by horizontal wooden shutters but if you turn the shutters up and not down it does block out more light and wasn't a issue for us which we were concerned about with kids. The rooms have no fridge (they quoted us $25 per night extra to have fridge brought up) and no complimentary water but you do have a vending machine down the hall with drinks and the gift shop first level near the exit does carry all the basics...drinks, snacks, small sandwiches, etc.....You can also go the MGM casino floor for slightly larger gift shop with similar items. Otherwise walk further up the strip past MGM about 10 minutes to ABC store/Walgreens. The pizza and other basic items at the food court was fine and reasonable quality and price. We ate at Nikki Cafe for breakfast and did enjoy the buffet breakfast - Not too much variety but quality of what they did have was good and made up for the lack of variety. Location of hotel was convenient and being in Paradise tower was a short stroll the the neighboring properties. We saw 'KA' at the MGM which was also a short walk over. We used the monorail on the first day but ended up taking taxi's rest of our stay which worked out to be much more convenient and not much more in price. The casino at the Trop as the others mentioned was bright and dealers friendly. Although not very full it was probably one of the more fun atmospheres to hit the tables for the casual gambler.

It was old, worn out and smelled like cigarettes. Five years ago I walked through the casino on another Vegas trip and it was just depressing. Based on these experiences, I'll admit I was a little disappointed when it came up as a four-star hotel option on Hotwire. I shouldn't have worried. The minute I walked into the new Trop it became clear that it is not the same place. The lobby is white and clean with a hip modern look. I went with a couple of friends and we reserved adjoining rooms in the Club Tower. Both rooms had a view of the Strip, were a good size and had all-new furniture. The beds were clean and comfortable with nice linens and duvet covers. If I have a complaint it's that the renovations to the bathrooms are somewhat superficial. The tub/shower combo and toilet still feel a little cheap and to me that's the real distinguishing feature between the Trop and some of the higher-end hotels in Vegas. That said, as someone who normally stays at the Bellagio but wanted to save a little money on this trip, I could not have been happier with the Trop and would absolutely go back if I was in the market for a nice hotel that's a little cheaper than the five-star options. It was a pleasant surprise in every way. Even if I didn't stay here, I would definitely come back to gamble. The casino is bright, clean and well-lit. The dealers are friendly and pleasant and the crowd is \"normal,\" neither snobby nor trashy. The casino is also much less crowded than some others and has relatively low table limits. We were able to play $10 blackjack (with blackjack paying 3-2) and $5 craps even on Friday and Saturday nights without fighting crowds. There were also plenty of cheap slot and video poker machines. Every time my friends and I ventured out to other casinos on the Strip, we ended up comparing them to the Trop and deciding we'd rather go back there to play.

I will try to break this review down into sections so people can pluck the information they require from it. Location At one end of the strip, with MGM Grand, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, New York New York's and Excalibur all within 5 to 10 minutes walk. It is only 20 minutes walk to the center of the strip where Caesars Palace, Paris, The Belagio etc are located. A trip up to Circus Circus or The Stratosphere (highly recommended) is a 10/15 minute taxi ride away. The best thing about the location for us was the close proximity to the Hooters Hotel, and not for the reasons you may be thinking! Vegas is a very expensive city to drink in, with most places selling bottles of beer at between $5 and $8. Hooters had bottles of Bud and Bud Light on what looked like a permanent promotion for $1.50. You can appreciate the savings, so we would always start our nights out here. It also has some of the cheapest tables to gamble at, not to mention the 25 cents chicken wings! Word of advice, get yourself an 'owl card', which is free, and you'll get discounts at the restaurant including this one. Rooms For the price we paid for this hotel we could not have asked for more! Huge rooms with comfortable beds, large safe, plenty of storage, massive flat screen TV and nice big bathrooms, all of which were kept very clean by the maids. The bathroom itself was the only bit which had only a partial refurbishment but it was still fine, the rest of the room however was brand new and looked amazing. The air conditioning was a little noisy but worked really well. The view we had from our room was absolutely awesome, straight out over New York New York, MGM and Excalibur, it was a great thing to go to bed and wake up to! Casino The Casino was all brand new and looked great, with a very classy 'light and airy' feel in comparison to some of the larger, older ones which seemed very dark, sometimes even a bit grim. It was however very small compared to most of the larger themed hotels, and lacked the buzz and atmosphere that made others so exciting to be in. Its worth visiting if you have a room at the Trop, but probably not worth a trip if you stay elsewhere. Which leads me onto the last part of my review, the hotel as a whole. Hotel/Resort The Trop is quite different to a lot of the other hotels we visited in terms of there doesn\u2019t seem to be the 'wow' factor get from other strip hotels. Don\u2019t get me wrong, staying here was awesome as it has amazing rooms at a great price, in a great location, with one of the best pool areas in Vegas, however I wouldn\u2019t necessarily visit it as a spectacle as I would others. It just lacks the extravagance and unique features of the other hotels that left me with my jaw on the floor: the fountains at the Belagio, the volcano at the Mirage, pirate show and Treasure Island, the sheer opulence of the Wynn and Encore etc. If you bare this in mind and treat the Trop as an unbeatable value for money base from which to explore the rest of Vegas, with a great pool to chill out if you need some down time, and beautiful modern rooms, you will not be disappointed!

We chose the Tropicana because we heard it was newly renovated and the price was too attractive not to make a reservation. Check-in: It was quick and efficient. We've stayed at other hotels on The Strip and have waited up to 30 minutes just to check-in, but perhaps because the Tropicana is still an unknown gem, our wait was less than five minutes. Our room: Our room was a very large room with two double beds in the Paradise Tower. We found the size comparable to what you would find in the MGM Grand Tower. The room had a flat-screen TV that was relative to the size of the room (it may have been a 42\" TV), and unlike other hotels, had channels that played commercial-free music of several genres. The only \"low\" point was the bathroom. While the room itself appeared to have been renovated, the bathtub enclosure seemed to have the same tiles as when the hotel first opened and the grab-bar was loose and almost fell into the tub. We booked our room without specifically requesting a tower or room. When we checked-in, we requested the Paradise Tower as many TripAdvisor reviews suggested. We were told that it would be $15/night more than our original reservation, on top of the additional $15/night resort fee. We went with it without debate. Our room faced The Strip, but toward the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. It was not a horrible view at all. The Paradise Tower is found at the front of the building, so guests do not have to walk through the casino to get to a room, which was a convenience for us. The location: The Tropicana is directly across the street from the MGM Grand (where we stayed in previous visits), so we were very familiar with the area. There is a transit stop outside of the hotel/casino that heads northward on The Strip. In general, the Tropicana is in a great location and is easy to access by foot and vehicle. The staff: Everyone from the reception desk to the cleaning staff to the 'food court' staff were nothing but pleasant. Our philosophy is that if you are nice and have a smile, people will be nice and smile back. The dealers at the tables were also very pleasant and seemed to enjoy conversations with tourists. Because of our flight, we had to check out around 4am. The Trop Plus rewards desk was closed, but reception was able to find someone quickly so that we can apply any credits we accumulated toward our bill. We found that the comps with Trop Plus were very generous, compared to other hotel/casinos. In our three night stay, we were able to have the additional $15/night Paradise Tower fee and our resort fees comp'd, giving us a $90 savings on our bill. A negative: Some people may not like the overt coconut/vanilla scent of the casino, but it grows on you. Plus, we much preferred the coconut/vanilla scent over the industrial cleaning soap scent that is at the MGM Grand. Also, our room facing The Strip made things a little noisy. We didn't mind, but others might not enjoy the sounds of ambulance sirens at 3am. Overall, give the Tropicana a try. They renovated the hotel and casino and it shows.

However, I was not only pleasantly surprised by the fresh, clean look of the \"new\" Tropicana, but I actually loved staying there! It certainly can't be compared to the luxurious 5 star Bellagio, but the crisp smart look of the casino as well as the new plantation-style decor put me at ease the moment I walked into our suite. I reserved a Paradise suite overlooking Las Vega Blvd facing north. The view was fantastic, particularly at night and I loved the fact that I could actually open my windows rather than slide open a small slot in the base of a window frame to allow the cool night air into the room. I was also astonished by the size of the Paradise suite. It was huge! You could throw a party for 15 people and still have room to dance! The parlor area had a credenza that housed a mini refrigerator where I found several complimentary bottles of water. On top of the credenza sat a 42\" plasma HD TV (there was another one in the bedroom) as well as a Keurig coffee maker with all supplies necessary to make a fresh brew and get me started in the morning. The credenza also had a built-in mini sink. A second credenza allowed for plenty of storage of whatever you might want to put in there. As to the new decor, the parlor contained a desk and two chairs a very comfortable chaise lounge and ottoman wrapped in antique cream colored, ultra sued. The cardinal colored daybed-style couch was framed by dark amber bamboo which gave it more warmth. The color pallet of the suite consisted of honey and chestnut woods, bamboo, cream colored walls with accents of cardinal red. Though it had a fresh updated look, I decor gave me a sense of being transported back to the hip Rat-Pack era where Frank, Dean and Sammy once gathered to plan their casino heist in \"Oceans Eleven,\" and I liked that very much. As to the staff, 99% of them went over the top in the friendliness and helpful category, almost to the point of being obsequious in the case of one gentleman who delivered a meal to our room. Speaking of room service, the menu is quite limited, but they will try their best to accommodate your requests even if a particular item you crave is not on their menu. Again, this was just another example of how hard they try to make your stay as pleasant as possible. The only complaints I had was with a slightly rude parking valet attendant (though all the others were terrific) and the less than satisfactory room cleaning service I received. The person who \"cleaned\" our suite didn't dust the nightstand where some talcum powder had landed nor did she empty the ashtray in the parlor. I always clean and tidy my room before I leave it so there is never much for a cleaning person to do and I always leave a tip every day. There's no excuse for missing those things because neither was hard to miss. For anyone who has seen the pool area and the mature tropical landscaping surrounding it, you'll understand what I mean when I call it a tropical paradise. For those who have not seen it, even if you don't plan to go swimming, you HAVE to take a walk along the jaw-dropping trails of the landscaped pool area. Oh and bring your camera with you. As a professional travel consultant, I stayed at the Tropicana principally to do a sight inspection of the new renovation. What I never expected was to find myself so pleased and happy to be staying there. Would I go back again? Oh hell yes, in a New York minute. The only recommendations I would make is for better oversight of the room cleaning staff and an expanded room service menu. Other than that, Tropicana managed to hit one out of the park.

Just a few of each type of tables and a good amount of machines. One was actually very generous. It paided me the largest amount I ever won at one machine. If you play craps, go early and get to know Trudy. She is very nice and helpful! We were not able to eat at the Trop. The Biscayne was dark the days were were in town.

Had it been for pleasure my ranking would have been lower. I understand this resort hotel had a bad rap and was redesigned. Things did appear to be new and it seems the designer was going for a \"white, clean, and neat\" theme rather than something grandiose. The minimalist approach unfortunately did not work for me. In leaving the resort today, I have several positives but more negatives to share with readers. The facility is in a prime location, adjacent to the MGM, NY/NY, and Excaliber resorts. It is about a 15 minute taxi ride from the LAS airport. It is very clean and doesn't have a smokey odor. It has two high class restaurants (although I did not eat at either as they are quite expensive). There are shopping kiosks to pick up small gifts, incidentals, and groceries. Room service was prompt, polite, and my calzone was delicious. I asked for a room change and within 20 minutes a bellhop had delivered my new card key. I stayed in two different \"deluxe\" rooms, both of which were very clean, odor free, and I was not bothered by housekeeping. The first room was on the first floor (actually about 3 stories up). My second was on the 14th floor. I recommend a room with a king bed as it is a bit roomier and has a comfortable ottoman, unlike the double queen room. There was a great large screen HD TV in the room, the beds were ultra comfortable with no shortage of pillows, and the rooms were spacious. Here's what I did not like. The first two nights I had \"gansta\" neighbors that were so loud and belligerent, that I eventually had to change rooms - not the fault of the hotel. However, I called security, and after 40 minutes, there was no apparent intervention resulting in my room change shortly before midnight. As to the physical aspects of the room, first the windows do not open more than 6 inches so you cannot enjoy the cool dry breeze of southern NV. The windows are also covered with some sort of honeycomb filter that makes it impossible to take a photo of the Las Vegas skyline. On the lower floor I had to listen to the police sirens at night. On the upper floor, I had to listen to the helicopters as early as 7 am. There were minimal other amenities - no fridge, no microwave, and no coffee maker. I can deal with no being able to stock my room with groceries, but not being able to brew a cup of coffee is an unforgivable oversight on the part of the hotel and something I expect to have, even in the cheapest motel. I had to get dressed, take the elevator to the lobby, and then stand in line for 10 minutes to get coffee at a Starbucks stand (largest size 16 oz for $3.50, refills $2). The decor is very plain, geometric, modern-cabana-ish. The beds are all white linen reminiscent of a hospital, but I reiterate very comfortable. Check in and check out were hardly smooth, taking 15 and 10 minutes, respectively, due to a line similar to what I'm used to seeing in a post office -- a big long reception desk capable of housing 15-20 employees, with only 2 stations open, and on each occasion one of the stations was encumbered with lengthly interactions with just one customer the whole time I was in line. I was wondering if the staff were trying to sell a time share it took so long. On check-in the woman was terse. On check-out the gentleman was warm and asked how my stay was, but then excused my complaints as being the norm for Vegas. I don't gamble but the lobby and gambling areas seemed overly lit with low ceilings - kind of cramped and not very cozy. I did not use my laptop because you are charged for wi-fi service in your room. My calzone from room service was $21 plus tip. Overall, I probably would not stay here again, even if the price was lower. The limited aesthetics and lack of reception staff kind of did it for me.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOverall just an average stay...\u201d", "Author": "apsdtravel", "ReviewID": "UR125041053", "Content": "The trouble I had with the tropicana was how long it took to get to the room.

I changed my reservation from The Mirage to to the Tropicana. I did let Nicole Marshall, their Guest Experience Manager, know that I was coming to Las Vegas for the first time and that I'd be celebrating my birthday (one of the bigger ones) before I came. She offered me a special rate, a complimentary upgrade to a Strip view room, a dining credit, late checkout, and other incentives. I did bring all of the emails regarding the booking with me--DEFINITELY DO THIS WHENEVER/WHEREVER YOU TRAVEL!! I was in the Paradise Tower (the one closer to the strip, off the lobby), Room 1823. I had requested a nonsmoking room with a King Bed, higher floor, a little bit away from the elevator and ice & vending machine. When I walked into the room I was pleasantly surprised by a gift basket containing wine, candy, wafer cookies, cracker/cheese. I used my dining credit to get dinner at Biscayne, where I had the tasting menu. Food was pretty good although I wish the service had been a little faster. There were two snafus. About 8 a.m. on Saturday I had woken up briefly to take some medication. The people in the room next door (1825) were quite loud and I could hear them through the walls, there was rap music playing, and there was lots of shouting. I know better than to confront people in this kind of situation, so I called Security. They did send someone up a few minutes later who spoke to them. It got a little quieter, but not by much. I called Security again and the same guy returned. This time it did get quieter, but by then I had decided to shower and go get breakfast. The other incident occurred when checking out. When the clerk handed me the bill I noticed the $40 dining credit had not been applied. I told him this and that the checkin clerk confirmed it was noted on my reservation. His first response was to tell me to pay the excess amount ($51.73 instead of the $11.73 I expected to pay) and to get my reimbursement when I got home. Unacceptable!! This is when I produced the email from Ms. Marshall confirming that I was to receive the credit. He then made some phone calls and the credit was applied. As I mentioned above, this is why you should ALWAYS have paper confirmation of every aspect of your trip! I have to admit I was put-off by all of the smoking in Las Vegas, including many public areas of the hotel. It would be great to see the Tropicana take the lead in offering a non-smoking hotel (in all areas).

I spent most of my time at the blackjack tables while my wife spent her time on the machines. The dealers were all very friendly and extremely helpful. The drink service was better than any of the other hotels we gambled at. We got tickets to see the Recycled Percussion show and it was definitely worth it! Its a high-energy and interactive show that we both really enjoyed. If you are at the Tropicana, definitely go to the show, it was extremely entertaining. The one small downside was that the Tropicana seemed a little lacking in the shops and food places. We didn't eat at any of the onsite restaurants (they looked expensive, but good) and found ourselves making a short walk across the street to have a cheap breakfast or indulge ourselves with a buffet. We really didn't consider it an inconvenience considering how close the shops and other restaurants were.

I became extremely busy here in NYC with back to school and work after we left Vegas. I stayed at the lovely Tropicana LV during January 25-28th 2012 with my boyfriend for his mini birthday getaway (my treat), which is his very first time in Vegas, and I was so excited to show him around. I booked an awesome combined flight (Virgin America) and hotel deal through bookit.com because of their BillMeLater payment plan (so i can pay 6 months later and use the money I had available for activities!) It was our very first time staying at the Tropicana LV and I loved every minute of it! The reason I gave them 5 instead of 4 stars is because of their very attentive friendly staff- hands down outstanding customer service!! From the doorman, to the check in, to the housekeeping, the host and hostess and all the staff we encountered daily at Cafe Nikki was very pleasant, and the staff at the Tropicana Lobby Giftshop next to the entrance was so amazing, especially the Filipina lady and another lady I cannot remember their names but my receipts says Chona and Michelle! I think just about everyone literally everyone we encountered was truly genuine with excellent interpersonal skills and that's really rare in the hospitality industry/ customer service in my opinion, so not only did we have a BLAST on the Strip, we looked forward every time to return back to our hotel. A big thanks to Kimberlee our check in agent, she upgraded us for free to a non smoking king size room in the paradise tower with the view of the strip on the 12th floor, and free daily breakfast buffet, and late check in! Words cannot describe how happy we were, she is just an amazing individual with a great personality as well! I emphasize this a lot because it is rare for us to encounter amazing staff and have good deep intellectual conversations with them such as in the Tropicana. It's funny when our check out agent asked how our stay was I was so speechless because words cannot describe what an excellent stay it was, I managed to mouth out \" it was awesome!\" and I bet she knew our stay was awesome too judging by the many great reviews. By the way check in and check out was super fast than I expected! I remember Alina our room attendant is such a sweetheart she would always write a note to thank us and showered us with extra bath and body products and towels every time we tipped her since we made a big mess in the room. We were greeted by like everyone of the staff, which was pleasant. You might think I'm crazy but I've stayed at the Trump and the Hilton and other hotels before but I never encountered this kind of experience with the staff members. You would think its a small boutique hotel were you know everyone. I wish we could have tipped everyone we encountered at the hotel but we would've ended up with a big hole in our pocket that's how amazing all the staff at the hotel were, I will bring more money for tips the next time... I forgot to make note of everyone's names, but they all truly made our stay welcoming and we didn't feel out of place (since I think we could have been the youngest guest during our stay- early 20's). I will definitely go back to this hotel and recommend people. The hotel's scenery is very beautiful I think its a perfect place for couples... I love the tropical feel I love the carpet and the smell of the casino I think was this light vanilla scent... usually I'm sensitive to smoke and strong fragrances, but it smelled very pleasant every time we passed by the casino! Also thanks to the staff in Glow to recommending my boyfriend a barber on East Tropicana for his haircut and shape up for an awesome value (we apologize that we couldn't afford the prices in Glow). The staff also recommended us to The Gun Store, which was so much fun! Last but not least, I am thankful for the staff that stopped us as we exited our hotel to go to a club, we walked right back in our hotel because he convinced us to attend the RMP Nightclub with free cover and free vodka open bar for ladies till Midnight!.... the RMP is in the Tropicana, although there were long lines the wait wasn't too bad at all. I had a great time at RMP, yes I did get super wasted I am so glad we stayed there its beautiful, the dj played GREAT music, it was a sorority night so almost everyone was in our age range, free drinks for me, they gave out free glowsticks, and best of all my drunk boyfriend was able to carry me back upstairs to the hotel room cause I was about to pass out!(lol). Oh and the bartender Phil (if Im not mistaken) is incredible, he has so many awesome moves and tricks- he was juggling the bottle and the mixer to make our drinks, BRAVO! He even assisted to take our pics and was very thankful for the tips (in NYC the bartenders are rarely thankful in fact they are stingy thats why I pointed this out). Because phil was so awesome I stayed at the bar after midnight when the free drinks were over and opened up a tab for my bf for his b-day night! Besides the outstanding service we received at the hotel, I just need to mention the other most important things about our stay was the fact that the hotel Jacuzzi was open 365 days of the year. Besides the great reviews that I researched of the hotel (in order to convince me to book) and the amazing affordable price- the fact that the outdoor Jacuzzi was available really nailed it! We took advantage of the Jacuzzi every day after breakfast, after lunch, after dinner, and even at 4am in the morning,lol. The staff provided towels for us- Iove how they are so attentive you may not think they are there, but out they come with towels! =] They have 2 large hot tubs, not everyone in the hotel took advantage of it so we had the place to ourselves most of the time. It may be winter season but by the Jacuzzi being available made our stay at the hotel even better. And the rooms is very spacious I was surprised, I love the whole design, it felt very tropical and romantic it felt like summer vacation for a winter season. Our room must have been renovated because everything was perfect (minus the itty bitty flaws that I noticed that obviously cannot be removed- me being ocd- such as the shower head was too low for my 6ft tall bf but its not the end of the world, he just had to bend his neck down to get his head wet which was uncomfortable since he has neck problems and it looked like there were permanent scratch stain marks on the bathroom floor tiles but its very minor, and I noticed a tiny stain on the shower curtain- like I said its just me being OCD).. besides this everything was spotless. The bathroom was big! And they had a shower pole for grip, and I love how the toilet was separate from the shower and sink! and the shower curtain pole was designed to have more space in the shower, two people can shower together! We had free wifi, and free usage of the safe, which we took advantage of daily. By the way my issue with the safe is that I think anyone can reset it and easily access it, because I found out by accident when I mistakenly pressed the wrong numbers and the reset button. I left the instructions in the safe along with my valuables (because im ocd).. but when you think about it the staff is most definitely trustworthy, so I felt more at ease later on. I absolutely love the closet with the large mirrors and the many hangers it came with!!! I also loved the whole design of the room, everything seemed perfect, it came with an ipod dock speakers so we blasted music, and a large flat screen hd tv!! Besides the AMAZING view of the trip , the best part of the room was the bed it was the most comfortable bed on the planet it was stuffed with many plush bedding's! I slept so good, it was so good that it was so bad when I had to struggle for my bf to wake up in the mornings and after his naps!! I'm not kidding!!! I barely watched a full tv show since I would literally melt away to sleep ;) I forgot to ask the hotel the brand of the bed and bedding's, I must have it! I most absolutely loved all the lamps that each came with an attached electric outlet unit- a must have! I even appreciated the bi tropical plant in our room and the photos. I appreciate every small detail even the ceiling had a nice detail to it. Overall the stay of this hotel was excellent, there were minor cons but it definitely did not overshadow the fact of how excellent our stay at the hotel was! The other cons that I will point out was there was an afternoon when the hot water was not working, it was on the warm too cool feel, and I am used to taking really hot hot showers not warm or cool showers but that quickly changed later by my next shower. There was also a time when we bought a wine bottle and we didn't have a cork and room service said they would charge us just to pop open our bottle, we of course went to the gift shop to buy one for cheap price. But I just want to point out a detail how room service came like in a minute or less after our call! Lighting fast service,lol! I also want to say the soda machine in the 12th floor for some reason wasn't accepting my dollar bills and the coin slot was stuck inside and didn't take my coins- these are all minor flaws that really didn't affect our stay in a negative way. I wish the was like a hot water machine so I can make hot tea or coffee, but its not a big deal. It also would've been nice to have a fridge but then when I thought about it we really did not need it! We had the ice machine on our floor to keep our liquor cool, and we did not order food through room service so we didn't need the fridge. The location of the hotel on the strip was perfect!!! Across from MGM Grand and Hooters and NY NY... and not that far to the Miracle Miles Shop. The location made the cab ride to the airport dirt cheap! =] I want to sincerely apologize for my late review and the fact I wrote an extremely long review, I couldn't help myself. But I hope this review helps!!! By the way this hotel should be ranked up to the top 10 hotels in Vegas because of all the great things I just mentioned that all comes with an an amazing value!!! =]", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cClub Suite - Sweet\u201d", "Author": "Texassun", "ReviewID": "UR124941549", "Content": "We got a great deal on Expedia and had 4 nights in the Club Suite.

We were not diappointed! We got a great price for flights and room on troplv.com. After a quick trip from the airport, we were checked in, upgraded and on the way to our room in less than 10 minutes. The lobby, casino, and hallways were clean and shining. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. The room was spotless with a great view ot the strip. The only complaint was a slow bathtub drain. Although the casino was small, we found some machines we liked (we only play the slots) and even hit some good wins. A few tips to the CW kept the drinks coming! The pool was closed of course, but I spent every morning in the hot tub and every employee that walked by spoke and was friendly. We didn't eat at the Bacio or the Biscayne, but they got great reviews, looked very nice, and seemed crowded when we walked by.

Check In: The revamped lobby is warm and classy. Check-in is smooth and pleasant. The front desk fast tracked our check in even though it was 10:45am. The customer service is second to none. Our room: We stayed in a suite in the Club Tower. If you have an opportunity to upgrade to a suite, DO IT! The remodeled suites are spacious and luxurious. Our suite had two flat screens, a bar, a mini fridge, a kuerig coffee maker, three hundred thread count sheets, his and her sinks, a marble shower(with excellent water pressure) and an iphone alarm clock. The only small drawback was the location of the Club Tower is a few minute walk from the casino and front desk. We loved the room. The Cleaning Staff: The cleaning staff was on top of it. They accommodated our crazy Vegas schedule and we had white glove clean rooms everyday. Food: Every morning we ate breakfast at the Beach Cafe. There was a wait to get in almost every day for good reason. This place was outstanding from made to order omelettes to smoked salmon. High quality all around. We also went to the Island Buffet which was very nice. Gambling: The new poker room is awesome. Everything was new and clean. They had a fridge stocked with non alcoholic beverages you could grab at any time and attentive cocktail waitresses for drink or two. The dealers and poker room managers are a class act. I even got to play cards with 2006 WSOP Champion Jamie Gold. This completely made my Vegas trip. Others: On my birthday, they sent up a gift basket of fruit, nuts and candies. This literally blew me away. Tips for a better stay: Tip everyone.

There were not enough cocktail waitresses. unless you were playing on a table game you had to wait for ages for a drink(I was there to drink and gamble!). 2.

I wanted to write this right after I got back from my trip, but somehow never found the time to do it and eventually forgot about it. Our (my grandma and me) stay at the Tropicana was in June 2011 and my graduation gift. In the preperation process for the trip I contacted Nicole Marshall whether it would be possible to receive a room upgrade, since it was going to be my first time in Las Vegas, which she confirmed after a few days. Thank you very much, Mrs. Marshall! When we arrived at the Tropicana the first inconvenience was the fact that we waited in line for about 50 minutes although there were only 3 other guests in line before us. I think that 2 employees at the check-in desk are just not enough for a hotel with over 1400 rooms. When we finally stood in front of the lady that would check us in, she kept looking for our reservation in the system. It took her another 15 minutes to actually find it. Unfortunately she told us we would have to stay in a smoking room for our first night, because there was no other Strip View Room available at this time. Well, we weren't lucky about that, but there was nothing we could do about it. We were told to come down in the morning again, to check if another Strip View Room is available. The room we got the next day was great and made up for Besides this there was just one other unpleasant incident one day before out check-out. My grandma asked at the Concierge desk, if there was any possibility to weigh our luggage, so we wouldnt have to pay an extra fee at the airport. She was told \"Of course, just bring down your suitcase and we will put it on a scale.\" So, that's what she did... But instead of actually getting a scale, the lady at the Concierge desk apparently couldn't remember that she said that and told my grandma that there was no way to weigh her suitcase. When my grandma told me about that I couldnt believe it, so we both went down there with our luggage and suddenly the lady seemed to remember what she said and it was no problem at all to check the weight of our suitcases. I don't know if this was just a misunderstanding or if employees just like to kid around ?! Nevertheless, apart from this everything was really nice. The renovated rooms are fabulous and the beds are really comfortable! The pool area was a nice place to relax and catch some sun and the Southbeach Marketplace is a pleasant place to get a snack or a tasteful breakfast. I really recommend this hotel, because now, with the renovated rooms I think it really can compete with other big hotels on the Strip. Next time I will be in Vegas, there is a high probability that I will choose the TROPICANA again!

If it was in the hotter season it would not have worked as well and our stay would have been unpleasant, As well, there were people smoking on the same floor so at times the corridor was filled with the smell of smoke. I really think that the hotel should designate floors as non smoking to make the stay for the non smokers as pleasant as it is for the smokers. Also, if you are not fond of the smell of suntan lotion (coconut and vanilla) you might find the scent a little much as it's pumped into the casino / hotel.

We didn't know what to expect, as we've only stayed in the MGM Grand, Luxor, and the Bellagio, but we absolutely loved it. In the five years since we've been to Vegas, the Tropicana is truly unrecognizable. It was open, airy, had an upscale tropical feel to it, and was FABULOUS. We had a late check-in (about midnight) and had no wait at all. We were taken care of by the super friendly ladies in front, and were given room 724 in the Paradise Tower. The elevators were close by, and we were immediately put into party mode as we heard the band jamming and saw the cocktail waitress pole dancing in the middle of the gaming tables. :) Our room was huge by Vegas standards and had two queen beds. The furniture was very nice, and the plantation shutters gave us an AMAZING view of the strip. Out of our window, we could see the Luxor, Excalibur, and Mandalay Bay. Most importantly, we were pretty damn lucky in the casino downstairs. We took advantage of their \"free play\" rewards, and got back $150 to play in casino money. We had a couple of $400 wins as well (this was playing penny slots). We also had the opportunity to eat in the Beach Club for breakfast and we all loved it. Again, the upscale tropical feel was echoed throughout the restaurant. We also ate in the food court, and were pleasantly surprised by the food there as well. Lastly, the pool area is BEAUTIFUL. I can't wait to go back when it's open to try out the water slide. HIGH OH! I would highly recommend to anyone traveling to Vegas on a budget, as the rooms are absolutely STUNNING for the price.

One day we came back late and there were no towels left in our room after cleaning. Not sure how this possibly gets missed? We also experienced some apparently drunk people trying to gain access to our room around 6:00 a.m. one day. They did leave and were probably in the wrong tower. Rooms are nice but the shades don't work well so it gets light very early. The location is not the best and if you are seeing a show at the Mirage or down in this area you are looking at a $12 cab ride one way or a 30 minute walk.

Booked the hotel based on other reviews and we were happy with the room. The recent upgrade to the hotel rooms and the hotel was very evident. The self-parking is very convienient and the check-in went very smoothly. I had reserved a King Bed Non-Smoking in the Club Tower but did not spend the extra $15 per night for the Vegas Blvd. view. At check-in we were offered a two Queen Beds room with a Vegas Blvd. view on the 15th floor so we took that. Glad we did because I think there may have been more noise on the airport side, but not sure on that. But the view of the MGM, Treasure Island and New York, New York was nice at night. Others have mentioned the walk from the casino to the Club Tower and it is a little distance, but that didn't bother us. If you take a short-cut through the pool area you can get to the parking ramp fairly quickly. The room itself was very nice, great TV, large bath tub with shower, bed was great and we slept very well. Overall we were very happy with it. At check-out there was one issue when the second night came up as higher than the first night. I told the check-out person that the rate should have been the same for both nights. She looked at the reservation and agreed but didn't know what happened. Maybe it was because we were switched to the other room??? She took off the resort fee which put the second night back to the rate it was supposed to be so that was fine with me. We have stayed in other Vegas hotels before, some better and some not, but for the price, we would go back to the Tropicana in the future. If money is no object, then definately go for the Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan or Wynn, but for us, the Tropicana worked out fine.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, great value, right on the strip\u201d", "Author": "subhodeep", "ReviewID": "UR124016943", "Content": "We were a group of 13 people travelling on holiday and we stayed at the Las Vegas Tropicana.

Have now stayed at Tropicana 3 nights in 2 different trips. Room Reviews: I have only stayed at the Tropicana twice since the refurb. As long as a room is clean and comfortable, I don't really ask for more from a Vegas hotel. I am not there to hang out in the room, as I can do that at home. I stayed in a comped regular room in the back tower (I forget what it is called). It is a bit of a hike from the front door, but a 3-5 min walk does not really bother me and the elevators are lightening fast and zip you up 18 floors literally in about 10 seconds. The room was bright, clean, comfortable bed, flat screen TV, \"free\" internet, work desk, etc. It was certainly nice and quiet in the back, with just a parking lot and the airport behind you. I ended up working several hours and had no issues with the internet connection. The desk is a tad high for the chairs, so I would not want to work 8 hrs straight, but comfortable enough for a few hrs at a time. I am not a fan of the scent of the bath amenities (shampoo, etc), but that is one of the last things I care about in a hotel. There is a Starbucks kiosk right at the elevators, so you can pop down for a caffeine fix quickly. My last stay, I was bumped up to a suite in the main tower with a view straight down Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure which suite it was, as it was a comped one night stay and I was not about to ask questions. The suite was huge. Probably 800 sq ft. It had a fridge, flat screen 2 couches, coffee maker, and corner suite so windows on 2 sides of the room. The separate bedroom was nearly as big as many vegas hotel rooms. It had a flat screen TV that matched the one in the suite area, and a very large bathroom. I was only there for about 10 hrs total, so did not get to really spend much time there other than the 5 or so hrs I slept. Very nice room though. Everyone I have dealt with on the Tropicana staff has been extremely friendly/nice and helpful. I can't think of a single interaction that was unpleasant during my stays there or when visiting the casino (which is daily when I stay at MGM). Casino: This is what brought me to the Trop a few yrs ago and made it my favorite. It is smaller than many strip casinos, but has the games I want to play. There are 2 craps tables and usually 5 or 6 BJ tables going. They have other table games (roulette, let it ride, etc), but I don't play those. The refurbished casino looks great. Everything is new and shiny. The main reason I like the Trop Casino is the staff, from the pit bosses to the dealers. Very relaxed, fun, and personable. You actually enjoy conversing with most of them while playing. They usually have a $5 craps table and at least a few $5 BJ tables, though there were more $10 tables than $5 tables during the weekend the last time I was there. Yes, many of the cocktail waitresses are over 40 and look it, but all are as friendly as can be. I don't go there to ogle the cocktail waitresses ... I go to gamble. (Note: If you want a pleasure pit type environment and crappy BJ rules, hit up NYNY next door). The drink service is usually quite good at the tables, though there is an occasional 20 min or so lull where they are scarce for a bit. I can usually get drinks as fast as I can put 'em down. Hotel Restaurants: I must say I don't eat here much, other than a quick late night bite at the deli/pizza place. They do have mostly higher end restaurants from what I have seen. Plenty of fast food type places at NYNY and MGM, both of which are a 5 min walk from Tropicana. Pool: Went to the pool one afternoon last year, and I think additional refurb has been done since then. No complaints about it. Not as large as the MGM pool area, but plenty of chairs and not too crowded. It was late september, so not really prime party season (it was as lively as the MGM pool, which I also went to). Overall, for a mid-tier hotel, the Trop is one of my first choices in Vegas. I typically go there to gamble quite a bit whether I am staying there or not.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brasil", "Title": "\u201cExcellent !\u201d", "Author": "carpor", "ReviewID": "UR124011685", "Content": "Beautiful hotel with large rooms, amazing pool, friendly staff and a very good price.

Got a good deal on Priceline so decided to give this hotel a try. Location is good, close to several restaurants and other hotels/casinos. However, it is at one end of the strip, so not real close to mid strip...which means a lot of walking. (Food court with Wendy's, Sabaro, Del Taco, Subway, and a couple other places real close for resonable food), also a La Salsa (great breakfast special for $3.95), and a Denny's close for other resonable food. Had a two queen bed 18th floor room (had confirmed a King a two weeks before arrival, but upon check in was told they didn't have one). Had a nice view of the far south end of the strip, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay. If you want a view up the strip the other way...those rooms cost a little more. Room was more than adaquate in size, but did not have any \"extras\" (coffee maker, fridge, etc.). Decor is vibrant and refreshing, beds/pillows very confortable. Only main issue with the room was housekeeping. The room was clean - when they cleaned it...but had a hard time getting them in there to do it. So, here's the story... 2nd full day there went out all day and came back at 3:30-3:45pm to an unclean room.. a bit late in the day for the room not to be clean. Wanted a nap so called room service and said they'd send someone right up....waited an hour and still noone. Finally chased down a room service cart in the hall and gave them our dirty towels for soime clean ones, and told them not to worry about the rest of it. Not a good display, but figured OK, it's Saturday and they are busy. So next day, out all day again (and walked past the cart cleaning the room next to ours when we left first thing in the morning), came back again between 3 and 4 and room not cleaned. Hubby walked two doors down across the hall and asked the housekeeper there if she could do our room next, and she said wasn't her room and she'd have to call her supervisor. Didn't want to wait an hour for noone to show up again, so decided to ask front desk if they could expedite some service. To their credit, the front desk manager was very apologetic and said this is not a normal \"service\" level for them. He even comped us a dinner for our trouble and got the room taken care of right away.........here's the kicker though. That night (or actually next morning) at 3:45am! we were woken up by the door slaming in the room right next to ours and the vacuum going in the room, and out into the hall in front of our door. So, we go out all day for two days and can't get our room taken care of, and then at 3:45am their cleaning the room next to ours and making all kinds of noise when guests are sleeping. I have never stayed anywhere with such crazy housekeeping service. The rest of the staff was very nice, the Niki's Cafe restaurant was good, and the casino was alright (a little small, but OK). Guest Services Manager Nicole was outstanding and answered all our questions before and during our trip. There is a stop for the Duece bus right at the hotel so makes getting around easy. Taxi service is $11-$15 or so, same or less than a shuttle and direct service. All in all, for the price we payed it was well worth it...for full price at over $100 a night, probably wouldn't say here again (too many other choices at that price point).", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel\u201d", "Author": "lynne42england", "ReviewID": "UR123956734", "Content": "we visited this hotel in January 2012. it is undergoing a lot of updating.

I chose the hotel because of the good reviews and the reasonable prices (I was able to get a special 24hr sale - it's worth it to suscribe to their newsletter if you plan on booking a room there). Check in was very fast, friendly and efficient. They gave us a 2-queens bed room, in the closest tower, facing towards Tropicana blvd (we had booked a Strip view room), with a view of the MGM Grand, on the 12th floor. The room itself was bigger than we expected! I liked the look, and it was very clean. Good bathroom, good beds. The wireless internet worked perfectly and I used it a lot. When we arrived, there was a problem with the in-room safe (the door couldn't close because there was some kind of metal thing sticking out). I called the reception and 5 minutes later, someone was there to fix it. We had some poor timing with the maid services after our 2nd night, so the room was only done once. However we went to the front desk the day before leaving and they were able to accomodate us with a late check-out (free of charge, at 1 PM). We tried two of the restaurants, Bacio and Caf\u00e9 Nikki. Bacio was superb, and excellent value with the prix fixe meal for early birds (jetlag helped us on that one!). Caf\u00e9 Nikki was more standard, with ok food and service being slow. We couldn't try the pool as it was closed in January. The hot tub was open but we didn't get the chance to try it. I liked the Casino's atmosphere (and smell!); it was not too dark or crowded, even on the week-end. Our room and hotel felt like a safe haven after walking all through the Strip. The location was ok, farther from the heart of the Strip than bigger hotels, but still next to a bus stop and right by the airport. Proximity to the MGM was also a big plus.

The view was amazing, All different parts of the strip. The penthouse loft had a spacious living area, dry bar with built in fridge, a downstairs bathroom, an eight person jacuzzi that we used every night. then up the spiral stair case with a very nice size bathroom with another jacuzzi, stand in shower, toilet area and a big double vanity and even the bathroom has a nice view of the strip.

We had to make a few changes to dates on both rooms we booked. Noriel in reservations was quick to respond to us and very helpful. Check-in was via their temporary check in area (the new one will be open now). This was efficient and friendly. This something that was characteristic of all of the staff at the Tropicana. Maybe it's because it's not one of the big monoliths on the strip that it allows them to provide this friendly service. But it's probably about hiring good people and keeping them well motivated. The room was clean and fresh. Nice contemporary muted colors and the all important comfy bed. Nothing to complain about here. Good TV with proper HD too (we are geeks \u2013 these things are important). Bathroom had been refreshed too but nice to see they had retained a full size bath tub.

While it was a bit inconvenient ($9 taxi rides each way), I think I made a good choice. Most of the Tropicana has been recently renovated, and it's updated and clean. My room, a \"Deluxe\" room, was more than adequate. Comfortable bed, large HDTV, quiet. I stayed in the closer Paradise Tower, which I highly recommend. The casino was a good size, not as large as others I visited, but more than adequate. The dealers were friendly, and while I played some blackjack and slots, I'll leave the gambling reviews to those more experienced and qualified. My one quibble with the Tropicana is its dining options. I traveled alone, and didn't have an interest in the more upscale hotel restaurants. They probably wouldn't have been my choice even if traveling with my wife. But in a moderate scale hotel like this, there should be a lot more casual dining choices. There's a Starbucks, a pizza/sandwich shop, and a yogurt store. This is a weakness the hotel really should have addressed in its remodeling. Still, a good experience.

It was either staying at the Trop or Mandalay Bay - so glad we chose the Trop!! We spent time at both Trop and Mandalay Bay due to my husband's conference being at MB. We will chose Trop again and again, hands down - there was no contest in my book. We stayed at Trop for a week, and the hotel is absolutely fantastic. The first thing I have to say about Trop LV is that the customer service is absolutely outstanding. Every single person that we encountered in the hotel, at every level, throughout our stay was helpful and accommodating but never intrusive or over the top. We were always asked how we were enjoying our stay and whether there was anything the person could do for us - even when we just ran into someone in the elevator. They are clearly focusing on customer service, and in an era where the concept doesn't exist in many places, it was so nice. Additionally, when we returned home and I had a question about something relating to the newly opened spa, I received an email directly from the VP of Hotel Operations and he continued to correspond with my until my questions were fully resolved. The rooms are fantastic - beautifully decorated, extremely comfortable and spotless. I am extremely picky about hotels, particularly the beds and pillows (we have a Tempurpedic bed at home, and it's had to sleep on anything else) and will therefore only stay in certain hotels. I'm happy to say that Trop was a fantastic home away from home for a week - probably the most comfortable bed second to my own I've slept in. Bathrooms were great and beautifully decorated; the shower was hot with plenty of water pressure. We loved the size of the hotel, casino, etc. The hotel has two towers - one closer to Nikki Beach and one directly above the casino. We didn't spend any time at Nikki Beach - weather was too cold for it, but it looked beautiful. We requested a non-smoking room on a high floor in the Paradise tower above the casino and it was perfect - close to the hotel entrance, easy in and out and quiet. One night we did have a small problem when a family with small kids moved in next door and the kids were screaming and loud at 6 am. We called down to the front desk and it was immediately taken care of - no more problems the rest of the week with noise (again, great service!). Location of Trop is great - free shuttle to Excalibur, Luxor and Mandalay Bay right there and getting around is very easy. Loved the 24-hour Starbucks in the lobby - common in Vegas hotels, but still fantastic and a definite perk for me! Thanks Trop LV for the best Vegas stay ever - we won't even look at other Vegas hotels anymore - we are definitely staying at Trop when we are back! If you're considering Trop, just go.

I was assaulted with $15 a day resort fees but was told at least I would have 24 access to their pools and saunas - except that the pools are closed and as I would soon find out, the saunas are anything but free. The room was about a 3.5* with awkward shutters (no blackout shades) and tv channels that sometimes didn't work. When the time came for sleep I noticed there were no feather pillows and called the front desk which never once picked up right away. I was told \"no one has feather pillows here\" with the suggestion that why should I be so special. Well, I reminded them that they purport to be a 4 star hotel so how could they not have feather pillows (and only lumpy foam)? I was put on hold and then told housekeeping would look into it. Well 5 minutes later two maids brought me comfy feather pillows. It's way long to get to and from your room and all the food there like the rest of the strip is overpriced. A cup of Starbucks coffee is at least double and one night a Starbucks guy asked me for ID when I bought a 54 cent cup of hot water....ridiculous. On my final day I checked into their swanky new spa/gym as I did the first day but this time was jolted by a pushy woman claiming to be the manager. She asked me to sign in similar to my first visit with another employee, however, insisted I wear a pink bracelet - a first in any hotel gym I have visited. I felt like I was being branded in WW2 Germany. Did she have an armband for me too? When I reached for it she said \"No - you will wear this or I'll call security.\" I looked around and there were exactly two other people - both women - in the gym. Little did I know that wasn't the end of her security threats. When I went to the change room to change (like I did the first time without incident) the hyper lady actually came in to the mens change room and began to yell at me \"what did I tell you you have to pay more or leave!\" Apparently the change room and steam room is not free contrary to what I had been told at check in and contrary to my first spa visit. I told her \"no, I'm not leaving take it up with the front desk.\" She stormed out and made threat number two about calling security. This is all before I have even had coffee for the day. When I complained directly to her that I've had it at this hotel with the lies and the overcharging she said she could have upgraded me but since I was rude now she wasn't going to. She then called security while I had enough of this harassment and told her to tack the fee onto my hotel bill and continued on the treadmill. When two security people arrived I explained the situation then returned to the treadmill and magically was \"upgraded\" after hyper/pushy lady apparently gave an embellished story about me \"reaching over the desk.\" After this nonsense I was left alone - and the problem? A whole $18.00. She already had my room number and should have just added it to my hotel bill if she was worried about it. This hotel has some qualities of a four star hotel but overall is a disjointed, unprofessional, money-obsessed crass pathetic holding cell. However, if you are blind and deaf with no olfactory function and love to be harassed and disappointed then this is the place for you!

We planned to leave on Sunday so we wondered about finding an inexpesive but nice place to stay for a beyond reasonable cost. It was, afterall, New Year's Day. We selected the Tropicana and go tthe room for 5 nights for about $220 including taxes! I was very happy and the reviews on TA seemed to support this choice although I was concerned about the number of smoking comments...off we wnet with fabreze in hand! We arrived to a beautiful hotel outside. The bobbies were attractive and very \"South Beach.\" This is their motif and it wworks. They pipe in a tropical fragrance that works. However when you walk all the way in you are hit with the cigarette smell. It is pretty strong but as we discovered once you leave the gaming area it is no longer a problem. The registration desk was in the last throes of being overhauled when we were there so our registration desk was a small area outside the Poker room and Sports Bet. This is due to be completed near the end of January, in time for the Super Bowl. We were checked in by competent and helpful staff. Make sure they know what is a priority for you. The front tower will allow you quick access to the casino and dump you out on the strip with little walking. The back tower is nearer the pools and convention areas but is in the far corner of the property from the strip. If you have a car parking is easy to both towers so I would choose the back tower next time...we were in the Paradise Tower (close to the strip) Once you ar ein the elevator all of the smoke issues dissappear. The interior is warmly decorated maintaining the South Beach feel and the coconut air fragrance. Our room had wonderful quality sheets and a huge number of pilllows. The TV is beautiful but just a clunky and horrible as all TV channel selections usually are with all of the hotel junk and oddly placed channels (you know...different from home) but you arenore to watch TV, right? There is free Wi-Fi but I did not attempt to use it. I did not study the alarm clock, so it may have had a dimmer but holy Bat-Light was this thing bright. I put a pillow over it. The outside of the ENTIRE casino is white. The windows are covered with a \"wrap\" like you will see on busses. This is a while vinyl that has thousands of micro holes in it so you can see out from the inside. I am sure this keeps the heat down and preserves the white outside they are trying to achieve. It is very difficult to look outside if you are close to thewindows. The windows open about 4 inches but if one were to bring a torx screwdriver this could be remedied! The shower really was wonderful with aquality head and really plentiful towels. Now, they had the same \"save water\" signs that all hotles do but no matter what we did we had new towels everyday. I even put the sign ON my towel one day and it was new that afternoon....or folded to appear to be a new towel. However it did not seem to be an old towel even a folded one..you know, you can just tell. One day, late in our stay we encountered a baby moving in next door. We have kids so we understand but after 45 minutes of non-stop screaming I called security. (I should have knocked on the door but I thought maybe they would move one of us, an option I could not offer). Anyway security showed up, the baby was quiet and for some reason housekeeping brought us a bag of shampoo, conditioner and lotions!?!? I thought they had moved them but I heard the baby the next morning, maybe they just thought the child could not be heard...I kind of felt bad for not talking to them. We tried all of the restaurants but Biscayne and all were good (find reviews). Starvbucks is open 24-hours which is good because there is no in room coffee and a room service carafe is $12 (plus 18% gratuity plus a delivery fee...a $9 cup of coffee all told). Parking is easy and free, access is easy if you are arriving but you must plan you departures because you will only leave in one direction since this corner is soo busy. The tram on the west side of the Strip is avaialble across the street at Excalibur and the Monorail is across the street at MGM to get you all the way north past the Las Vegas Hotel (nee Las Vegas Hilton which was renamed on January 3rd at the end of their franchise with Hilton hotels).

I had to spend 10 minutes on the phone with the booking agent while I was checking in, for the Hotel and the agent to get it all straightened out, which, they finally did. But once the registration snafu was ironed out, really, I couldn't be happier with the place, especially at the great rate I got. I think most resort fees are a rip-off, but the fact is, even with the resort fee included in the total rate I paid the Trop was clearly a better deal than where I had been considering staying.

There is a Starbucks in the casino which tends to have long queues but they move quickly and Cafe Nicki has a breakfast buffet for $18 or breakfast menu. We did not try Bacio or Biscayne as they were shut most of the Christmas period.

The other issue for me was the resort fee of $14.99 per night which as far as I can see is extremely expensive wifi.

The Valet staff was very helpful in providing healthy and interesting information on day trips within a few hours of Vegas (Valley of Fire was awesome).

I asked our Casino Host about the mistake and he ended up comping us those 2 nights also, and comped all of our food costs during the stay!! All we can say is check it out.

I was so worried about our safety and I went to front desk to have my room keys re-programed and told the story again to the gentlemant at front desk, he said the same words \" I'll call the security and check the system to see who used what kind of key opened the door\". However, nobody came to my room and nobody tell me the result of the investigation.

First, I am greated by a heavenly aroma when between the glass doors . . . it's so pleasant and inviting. Also, every time I walk through the doors, often held open by a valet, I feel as if I'm coming home and can hear \"welcome home\" being whispered as I step through the doors. The front tower (Paradise Tower) is very convenient - just a short elevator ride to your room floor. However, I recommend trying to get a room in the back tower (Club Tower). It's a longer walk to get there but the view of the strip is superior in every way and you don't get the traffic noise that you will hear if in the front tower. The corridors are surprisingly quiet for a casino hotel. The rooms might not be as fancy as some of the other high dollar hotels, but they are very clean and extremely comfortable. I'd love to take one of their mattresses home with me. In the casiono our waitress was quick and courteous. Just when our drinks were almost empty she would appear to ask if we needed another, and she had them waiting for us on her tray. It was the best drink service we received during our entire visit. When at other casinos we often had to chase down a waitress or couldn't find one at all. Not so at the Trop. We always were greated in a friendly manner by an efficient waitress. I'm always surprised the casino at the Trop isn't filled with patrons. The casino is neat and clean, there is a great variety of games to select from, and the slots give back as much if not more than they take, making for a pleasant gaming experience. Also, the choice of slots is a perfect mix of older favorites that are hard to find and the newest on the market. Bottom line is I feel like the Tropicana is one of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas. It is a perfect mix of classy sophistication with the intimate feel of the smaller casinos from years gone by.

That being said, even the basic rooms are super clean and spacious, so you'll be fine either way b) If you're nice to the front desk, they usually have extra coupons to give you for free drinks, discounts/free food at their restauraunts and so forth. c) The resort fee can be waived if you (again) ask politely at the end of your trip - otherwise, the $10 is still pretty decent value.

If I compare the cost against the likes of the MGM, Planet Hollywood, Aria, Excalibur it is very good value well located for the lower part of the strip, in easy walking distance to New York, MGM, mono rail and a bus stop practically at the door if you needed it. The staff were very helpful and friendly, we would happily use again for such a trip though if I was travelling with my wife on a quiet get away at a similar time of year (Las Vegas is empty early Dec) I would probably stay at the Aria which is more upmarket but more expensive. I would compare the Tropicana to a good upmarket Holiday Inn (4 star) and very very adequate for a bunch of people spending very limited amount of time at the hotel but seeking a good sleep when required.

We just got back from vegas 2 days ago and I learned that my 2 yr old baby got bed bugs bites on her stomach and leg. I'm so unhappy about it. I trusted the reviews and paid more to stay at Tropicana but it turned out I'm so disappointed. The staffs were nice on the phone, the room were spacious, the beds were adequately comfortable but that was about it, As soon as we got there, I checked the pillows and I found out 3 out of 8 pillows had dirt/hair on them. I called the front desk and house keeping brought me 2 pillow cases. Well, I brought some of my own so I used my pillow cases. Then the sink, I could see there were stain or finger print on the handle and the floor I could see dirt/stain. Not too much and it was too late so I let it go. On the way home my baby complained her stomach hurt. I had to check during rest time and learned of two red circles (about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch) on her stomach and upper thigh (in a straight line) with a small white/yellowish bump in the middle of each. I have never seen this kind of rash in my life. So today I did my searched and learned that those were consistent with BED BUGS bites. My baby still complains of pain and discomfort even though the spots seem to get less red. I feel terrible for her. We were only at the hotel and the car, Of a couple dozens of hotels we have been to, we have never had bed bug bites. I'm so disappointed. And also I feel stupid. I though we paid more for the hotel to get comfort and cleaniness but we got the opposite. I want everyone to know so they can be aware. And be careful of the catch of the Trop Plus member \"your first 200 bucks on us\". We put in 220 total but the next morning we only saw 40 bucks back in our card (as opposed to 100 bucks that they were supposed to give us back). Anyway, We will never come back to Tropicana again.

My 1st thoughts are what a terrific place! Since I have season tickets to the NFR I go every year and I have always gotten a suite at the MGM. This year I thought I would try the Tropicana. Not in the least bit disappointed. Location -- The hotel is in an ideal location on the strip. You can walk across the street to the Excalibur and MGM, the MGM has monorail access going north on the strip and the Excalibur has the monorail to the Monterrey. And if you want a cab, the line is never long. Rooms \u2013 I booked a Paradise Suite. Great room and terrific layout. Large living room area with plenty of seating, fantastic view of the strip, refrigerator, coffee maker and 42\u201d flat screen TV. The bedroom had a king sized bed, large closet, safe and sitting table, with plenty of room for luggage. The bathroom was very functional, maybe a little light on shower water pressure, but nothing to complain about. It came equipped with sundries, plenty of towels and a hairdryer. The Paradise Suite is located in the Paradise Tower which is closest to the front of the property, so it was just a short one minute walk to get outside; extremely convenient. Gaming/Restaurants \u2013 It\u2019s a full service casino complete with a very nice sports book. I must admit I never got drawn into the craps table which is what I usually play, but I like to be with loud groups and it never seemed to be going that direction when I was in the casino. The dealers and staff all were very friendly and I did end up winning some on the slots. I only got a chance to eat in Caf\u00e9 Nikki but did so a number of times and was never disappointed. If the NFR schedule allowed I would have certainly dined their Italian restaurant as I hear it is quite good. Bars/Entertainment \u2013 I always come to the Trop during the NFR and take in the comedy club. This year I was fortunate enough to get to the 2nd to last performance as apparently the club is closing at the Trop and reopening at the MGM. Too bad, I always love the Trop\u2019s venue. Not sure what they are putting in its place, the comedians joked about a restaurant/bar/swimming pool\u2026 guessing not! The main lobby bar has live entertainment and while I was there it was titled \u201cEye Candy.\u201d Yes it was. Great dancers, sexy music and very fun. The drinks aren\u2019t bad, the staff is relatively attentive and it\u2019s a pretty inexpensive way to enjoy part of your evening. Don\u2019t waste your money on Crazy Horse or Jubilee, just go to the Trop and enjoy a drink and the show. Staff \u2013 The 1st people you meet are the Bell Hops, and they do their job well and with a smile. The gentleman who brought the luggage to the room was even so nice as to offer to go get ice so the party could start. Our maid was phenomenal. I don\u2019t know how she cleaned the other rooms after being so through in ours. She noticed the coffee was all used and offered to leave more than the usual supply, we were never without bottled water, towels, clean sheets, clean everything. The front desk staff was courteous and friendly. The only complaint regarding the staff would be the IT personnel. Our room had the wireless router for a couple other rooms, and it quit working. After having people in the room to fix it, it still was not functioning so upon calling down to the desk they connected me with IT. The young man at the other end of the phone did not have much experience with Iphones and their Wi-Fi properties, which he proceeded to tell me each time he tried to get it to hook up. Of course I\u2019m not going to be mad he doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience but when he gets frustrated and wants to vent to me I have to say call me back when you figure something out. He never did. What did happen is since the other rooms were still having problems they sent an electrician up, who was very friendly and he contact COX who provides the service and they fixed it. Finally I can\u2019t talk about the staff without mentioning Nicole Marshall. Originally when I booked I couldn\u2019t reserve the Paradise Suite for the final night of our stay. When I contacted Nicole to see what she could offer she was very quick to provide solutions utilizing other suites. She also said she would stay on top of it and if possible try and keep us in the same room, which ultimately is what happened Nicole took very good care of us. So in summation, if you are looking for a clean, comfortable room in a casino where service does count than you won\u2019t be unhappy at the Tropicana. True it won\u2019t have the crowds of the mega casinos but if you want that, just go hang out at one, why stay there? Prices are great, the location is ideal and all the staff wants to do is make your stay enjoyable. It\u2019s a win at the Tropicana!", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cCompletly Met Expectations\u201d", "Author": "MRJKY", "ReviewID": "UR122145966", "Content": "My fianc\u00e9 and I returned from a 3 night Christmas stay at the Tropicana and it absolutely met my expectations. Traveling on a budget, the Tropicana offered the best opportunity to stay in a very nice hotel/casino with enough to do within a reasonable walking distance and at $50/night I could not have had a better experience. The rooms have been \"refreshed\", to say they have been newly renovated I think would be overstating it a bit. While it was a nice room there was some older features such as the bathroom tile and some fixtures but clean. All in all it was very nice and certainly well worth the money. If I could offer one exception it would be that houskeeping did not come until very late. We hiked at the Trial of Fire one afternoon, we left at 10am, returned at 3pm and still the room had not been serviced. That was the second day, so we just decided we would do without being that our stay was so short. We did order room service one night and it was exceptional. Granted, we did not order filet but our sandwiches were well prepared and savory. I have often heard via tripadvisor post that the room service is expensive in Vegas. Room service is typically expensive anywhere you go whether it be Vegas or Atlanta. I would say the room service prices were not out of the norm for any other place that I have stayed. While there are some attractions on location many were closed for the holiday. However, Recycled Percussion was playing on Christmas day and it was incredible!! Wherever you stay in Vegas, you should absolutely go see this show. We did not gamble much in the casino, mainly when we had a drink at the bar we played video poker. The casino and other common areas were decorated to look like that old South Beach hotel. Everything looks to have been updated and is in very good condition. That being said, if you are looking for gigantic themed casinos then go elsewhere; that is certainly not the Tropicana. The Tropicana is an excellent getaway especially if you set the appropriate expectations. If you want to an easy walk to the Paris and Caesars Palace you may want to stay closer to the center of the strip (and if you want to pay double what we paid). Can you walk it from the Tropicana? Sure, it just depends how much you are willing to walk. We walked as far as Paris and that was a hike, we opted for a cab ride back. The Trop is connected by walkway to the MGM, Excalibur and New York New York. From the Excalibur you can catch a tram that runs to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Also, if you are looking to do a lot of off strip excursions the Tropicana offers easy access to the highway at the south end of town. It was a very nice stay and if we travel on a budget again we will definitely stay at the Tropicana.

The rooms have been updated and have a 42\" tv, safe, ironing board and blow dryer. They have WiFi for a cost that is charged along with their added room fees. The room was quiet but that had alot to do with the fact that the place was a ghosttown. My wife and I checked in Friday morning and stuck around for a few hours in the casino and noticed that there were less than 50 people walking around the gaming area. Now if you like the older slot machines, penny slots and very,very little people around you then you will like this place. Also, if you are \"NOT\" into blackjack, roulette or craps then this is the place for you. They have very few tables to play on but it seems to be the perfect amount for their empty casino. I really cannot see how they keep their head above water with all these other casinos nearby within walking distance. Well I guess it could be their new promotion where they give you back $200 of your initial slot losses. The catch is they give you $100 free play on certain slots and you cannot cash out until you use the entire amount once. The other $100 is credited to you account for a future visit( LOL). The machines are outright tight and this seems to be a shady gimmick. I went to the MGM grand across the street that night and returned twice to my room at the Tropicana and it was dead in the casino. The MGM Grand, New York,New York and even the Excalibur were far better places to play, be in, eat or just walk around and hang out. If you like excitement, action and all that Vegas has to offer then the Tropicana is not the place to be. If you are reading this and are elderly and like places that are quiet and are thinking about staying here beware. Unless you specifically request a room in the main casino tower, the walk from the casino to the rooms is very, very far and I noticed some people having problems and complaints with the hike.

We chose it mainly based on price and location. The room was $89 a night, on the 17th floor in the Paradise tower. It was listed as a city view room and I guess technically it was but I had hoped to see more of the actual strip and not mainly the Luxor/Excalibur. Also there is a overlay on the outside of the windows that leaves a pattern of small circles on the glass, making it pretty hard to see anything clearly anyway. It's like looking through a really dark screen. Taking pictures is ruled completely out due to it. And as already mentioned the room stays very bright due to the window coverings which are wooden slat shutters. No matter which way you face them, up or down, the room stays really bright. Check in was super slow. 2 lines of people (Regular check in and Breeze check in) with only 2 people working the lines. The Breeze check in line (Booking via the Trops website affords you Breeze check in) was stalled due to a problem of some sort with the couple already up there. We waited 20 minutes without either line moving before someone (A guest checking in who was tired of the wait) went and had them get a manager who opened up 1 more window. After that check in was easy although far from friendly. As a side note, while there is a luggage ramp outside to roll your cases along there is not one inside so be prepared to lift your bags up about 7-8 steps to get to the front desk area. Also be prepared to watch the bell hop stand at his desk, next to these same stairs, chatting with another employee while he eyes you making two trips to get your bags up the stairs but does not offer to help. We actually ended up helping an elderly couple get their bags up as well while he watched. The room was clean and nice. The bed very comfy. As already mentioned the room is very bright, even at night and especially in the AM due to the shutters and no way to truly shut out the light from outside. The bathroom was clean and new looking as well. The adjustable shower head (Rain, jet, massage) was fantastic, great water pressure and perfect height. The towels are thin and see through in some spots and some had black stains that have probably been there a while. The provided glasses are super small and when we called down to request wine glasses we waited 30 minutes for them and were then given 4 more teeny water glasses instead. Housekeeping skipped us entirely one day as well and we were out of the room by 12:30 that day so not all that late. The casino is standard, nothing that makes it really stand out from any other one. The atmosphere smell that is piped in stinks. I think it is supposed to be vanilla but instead smells like a day old cigar. It's also in the hallways leading to the rooms. We did not eat there so I cannot comment at all on the restaurants. The outside staff is far friendlier then the inside staff. The location is fantastic for getting around. You can get the Deuce and Express Deuce right out front. And monorail access is located next door at the MGM which you can get to easily by the overhead bridge between the 2 hotels. I'd strongly suggest getting a 3 day Deuce pass versus the monorail. The monorail is great but it costs more and you will pretty much always end up walking the equivalent of a few blocks inside the casinos to get from the monorail drop off behind the hotels to the strip. Where as the Deuce runs along the strip and you get off directly in front of whatever casino you are aiming for. So much easier! And it's a great way to see the strip and whats on it as wella s people watch. Plus if you are wanting to get to Freemont street you will need the Deuce anyway since the monorail is for the strip only and the Deuce drops you right off at the Freemont street experience. Forget taxis unless you have too much cash and want a quick way to get rid of some. So in closing, the Trop has cleaned up nicely, the location is handy for a lot of things, the rooms are decent and clean but it still has some work to do as far as customer service goes and the windows/window coverings need re-thinking.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, California", "Title": "\u201cgood rooms and price, bad customer service\u201d", "Author": "may0529", "ReviewID": "UR121839993", "Content": "I loved the room i checked into and for only 30 a night it was a steal (room 1581)!!!However the front desk girl who checked me in, Rose, was rather rude and unkind.

This isn't one of the five star properties on the strip, but it is tasteful and appealing to the eye with reasonable value fo the money. There was one of three check-in clerks working despite the people waiting. The line wait was about 20 minutes, and the clerk was efficent but strictly business. I attempted to upgrade our room and ended up with a view of the neighboring buildings airconditioning ducts for my trouble and tip. The room was neat, and we verified no evidence of bedbugs were present. There were some large orange/red stains on the carpet and furniture from a previous spill. The stains detracted from a sense of cleanliness, and I have to wonder why they give that room out if others are available. The next morning we found hairs from prior occupants in the bath and elsewhere. Due to a long line at checkout, we used the express checkout box and forgot to tell the desk clerk about the hairs. A trip for ice and drinks from the machines turned into a visit to three floors before success. I ran into an employee on the elevator and reported the failures. I got a shrug and, 'Yeah, they're always broken.' Overall it wasn't a bad experience, and our stay is about what I expected for the price.

Excellent view of the green MGM and New York New York resorts so all though set back from the strip still felt a part of it. No worries that cleaning teeth, showering feet can all be done whilst sitting on the toilet as the bathroom was huge and fitted with a big corner bath that could accommodate two people. The only problems experienced whilst at the hotel were trying to find the box office to book the very funny Brad Garrett show (Brad Garrett hilarious and most politically incorrect show I have heard since seeing the Manchester master Bernard Manning.) and the food at Cafe Nikki. The service was slow in the evening and people were hidden at tables between great wooden pillars so the waiting staff could not clearly see when to clear the table and/or provide top up drinks. The following day because it was easy went to Cafe Nikki for lunch and the food and service were even worse. It seems all though Wendy, our server, did not mention it or give us any options the beef burgers are served raw in the middle. Sending the first one back and asking for a cooked burger was no better as the second was still raw. So all though McDonald's, Wendys, A&W, etc. all believe that a burger should be cooked it would seem the Cafe Nikki kitchen does not share their successful burger cooking formula. Wendy failed to provide the endless Pepsi product as advertised on the menu. All in all and as Brad Garrett mentioned during his show (many a true word spoken in jest) the food at the Tropicana was not very good.

Non-smoking rooms are just a suggestion, and although we did phone the day before and the day of our check-in, there were still no non-smoking rooms available. Hate to be a whiner, but it did get us a nice upgrade from the manager. Our friends were not so lucky because they didn't phone ahead. Second - bring ear plugs and a blindfold.

We arrived at 9:30 AM knowing it was way to early to check-in, but we thought we'd store our bags and have them call us when our room was ready. Maria, at the Front Desk, was so nice and helpful. She gave us a few options and upgraded us to a Junior Suite for it being our wedding, and promised that we would get a call as soon as it was ready. We got a call at noon that our room was ready, and when we got to our room I thought \"Ahhhhhh.\" So fresh and clean and classy! It was on the 15th floor on the corner with lots of windows. The junior suite is a good size, but they could probably replace one of the 3 armchairs with a loveseat and a little bar. There was ALOT of empty space, but it was just fine for 2 ppl, well even 3 or 4 as I had a couple of guests as I got ready for our big day. Sunset was a great time for pictures in our room, with views of the Luxor and mountains behind us. It was very quiet in our room, we felt like we were the only people in that part of the hotel! It was a perfect place to recharge after the cacophony of Vegas. At check out Yolanda offered to print out our boarding passes for us, and made easy for us with our departure. Some cons: No bathrobe in the rooms (you can request them, but I didn't realize that at the time). Also, the shampoo,conditioner, and lotion seemed kind of cheap. Wouldn't mind a bit of luxury there! Also none of the little soaps were face soaps, usually hotels put a bar of facial soap in the rooms. Also no mini-bar or in room coffee. And it's quit a walk to the Club Tower, making it annoying for coffee/drink runs, or when we forgot something in the room. Also it's at the South end of the strip, making it a bit inconvenient, especially if you want to check out Fremont. Also, this was one of my favorite casinos, as it wasn't dark and smoky.

After browsing online for several months, the Tropicana seemed to provide the best value this weekend (NFR rodeo and LV Marathon). I've stayed here several times before, but it's been 10+ years. Things have really improved! The south strip location worked well for us. Each of us arrived/departed at different times. The Tropicana is convenient to the airport (approx. $15 cab ride). The MGM Grand, NYNY, and the Excaliber are right across the street and provide quick access to additional dining and entertainment options. Three adults stayed in a Club tower room - non-smoking with two queen beds. The Club tower requires walking a good distance to access - not a problem for us, but something to consider if you mind a long walk back and forth to your room. The hallways and common areas were clean and well maintained. Everything really has a new, updated look. There are plenty of elevators - never a wait. The room was clean throughout. New carpet. The beds were comfortable with nice bedding. New flatscreen TV (with broken remote). Good climate control that actually maintained a comfortable temp. No coffee maker. Plenty of available outlets for phone chargers, laptops, etc. Ipod compatible clock radio. Windows are covered with shutters to block the light. The shutters swing open allowing each window to slide open a few inches. Our room had a view of the pool area(closed), NYNY, and the MGM Grand. We didn't try the WiFi access. We commented several times on how quiet the room was - no noise from the surrounding rooms, outside traffic, people in the hallway, or airplanes. The bathroom was fine, but apparently not fully remodeled - several cracked tiles on floor, odd corner tub/shower with a crusty old shower head, trim falling off tub faucet, toilet that often required multiple flushes. Towels were clean, but no \"fluff\". Vanity, sink, faucets looked to be new. We didn't dine, gamble, or see any shows at the Tropicana. We had drinks at the Ambhar lounge. Fred (bartender) was a funny guy that provided great service. When I booked my reservation online, I requested an additional roll away bed for the first two nights. Due to \"fire code\" regulations, they would not put a roll away in a room with two queens. I tried to book a second room at check in, but they had limited availability and wouldn't come close to matching the rate we had for our reserved room. The room was plenty large, so we made do. At check out, we paid $15 per night in mandatory resort fees, even though we didn't use or benefit from any of the \"resort\" services. The free parking garage was convenient to the front door.

Upon arriving, we were told that that tower didn't have a non-smoking room and we would have to take a room in the Club Tower. They told us we could come by between 1-3pm the next day to request a new room in the correct tower. Not thrilled, we went to the room. If you've ever seen the Trop from the outside, you see just how far away the Club Tower is. After the long walk, we made it into our room. The room looked pretty nice. New LG TV on the wall. But when I went into the bathroom, it was pretty dirty--especially the tub. Not a little dusty. It looked like the faucet was rusted. But it was just dirt. So I called down to housekeeping and let them know. They said they would send someone up to clean it. A little unhappy about the combo of wrong tower and dirty bathroom I went to blow off some steam by tweeting about it. Well, by the time we got back from eating (HOT DOGS AT PINKS IN PLANET HOLLYWOOD!!!), they had gotten back to me on twitter. The manager on duty called my room. She personally apologized and even offered us a food credit for our trouble. Even though there was public pressure (my tweet had been retweeted by a few Vegas people), I appreciated the personal attention and gesture. The next day we still wanted to switch towers. Not thrilled about having to be around in the middle of the afternoon to do this, we packed our stuff and left it at the bell desk. I went to the check-in desk and let them know I wanted the new room. Again she told me I had to come back between 1-3pm so they could do a room switch. When I told her I brought my own bags down, she said that she could then block out a new room for us anytime. I wish they had told me that. If I hadn't taken the initiative, I would have been sitting around waiting to switch rooms instead of enjoying Vegas. I gave them a call later just to make sure we got the room. And we did. No problem. The new room was even nicer than the old one. Definitely cleaner. And a much shorter walk. The casino there is pretty nice. The dealers seemed friendly. We ate a few breakfasts at Starbucks and had a late supper at Cafe Nikki. Steak and Eggs at 11pm is awesome. The food was great. Overall the staff was wonderful. The bellman was from NJ, so we had some hometown chat while we stowed our bags. I'm not thrilled by the location. We hung out at MGM and NY NY while we were down there, but we usually find ourselves more north.

I highly recommend the Tropicana.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cedar City, UT", "Title": "\u201cTropicana needs attention to housekeeping.\u201d", "Author": "RandiRA", "ReviewID": "UR121382918", "Content": "My husband and I recently booked two rooms at the Tropicana for a one night outing to see the Cirque \"O\" show, for my mother and ourselves. We chose the Tropicana based on location, website photos, off-season price and TA reviews. From the time we arrived all staff from valet parking, bell desk, registration and restaurant service were wonderful. Everyone was friendly, informative and helpful. Upon first glance, the updated rooms were great. We liked the modern \"Miami Beach\" decor, but it quickly became evident that the Tropicana declarations of a newly \"renovated\" property actually meant newly \"decorated.\" The bathroom floor tile was very old 4\", outdated, chipped and scuffed. The stone threshold between the bathroom and bedroom appeared either very dirty or permanently stained. The bathtub had numerous, large chips in the enamel. The housekeeping, or lack of, was quite surprising. Our bathtub had standing water in it, hair (not ours) in the sink and the carpet, particularly in front of the dresser, had many stains. The carpet appeared fairly new so part of the re-decorating, but obviously not regularly cleaned. My Mom's room had the same stained carpet and her bathroom sink actually was sprinkled with dirt particles, as though a broom or mop had been shaken out in it. There was long, dark hair on the bathroom counter, also not her's. A housekeeper was doing the room across the hall from us so I told her about our bathrooms. Her response was to simply open the bathtub plug and let the water drain out. I had to ask her to \"please clean it.\" There was a memo in each room alerting guests to a hotel water test on Nov. 28th that would require turning the water off completely between 1:00am-5:00am. We were there on the 30th so fortunately it didn't apply to us (the memos should have been thrown away) but I can't imagine checking into a LV hotel with the idea of gambling, eating and drinking the night away only to discover, upon check-in, that I wouldn't be able to flush the toilet or have any water in my room during the night. It was surprising that the room service menu was limited to pizza and strombolis from their Italian food court cafe. In a 24 hr. town I would always expect a breakfast, lunch and dinner selection. We don't gamble so the only other hotel amenity that we used was the Cafe Nikki for breakfast. Again, we loved the updated decor and table with a pretty view of the tropical, palm tree surrounded pool & patio. Our server was great. On the negative, the prices were high for basic breakfast in an older, average Las Vegas hotel. Coffee was $4, bacon and eggs $12, pancakes $9 and the breakfast buffet was almost $19 per person. We've done a lot traveling in many states and countries and aren't opposed to indulging in good dining, but that was extravagant for an average property, at low season, during a negative economy, in a resort town where business is off 40% and there is a lot of competition. That one experience would certainly deter us from trying any of their other restaurants when there are so many excellent choices in Las Vegas. Others here have had very positive stays at the Tropicana so perhaps the bad housekeeping in our two rooms was the exception, but managements policy to cut corners by not replacing the worn out tile and tubs and not regularly shampoo the room carpeting will send us elsewhere. With so many good $50 a night rooms in LV right now I doubt that we'd stay at the Tropicana again as room cleanliness is high on our priority list.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel without the glitz!\u201d", "Author": "MarkBTID", "ReviewID": "UR121352010", "Content": "Visited the Tropicana for my 30th birthday with my wife in November and had a lovely stay. 1st impressions are of a really clean, fresh and modern looking hotel and these don't go away throughout your stay. The smell of coconut as you enter is a nice one and not overpowering. Check in was pretty quick and we had been upgraded to a City View room due to my tweeting of the hotel which was an unexpected but very nice surprise. The room itself was excellent. Very large, big king sized bed which was the most comfortable I have slept in. Huge TV on a nice big unit with safe, 4 big drawers and a desk with chair. Also in the room is a chaise lounge, a palm tree style plant, 2 bedside cabinets and an i-pod dock which is great to plug your own i-pod into and listen to your own tunes when you feel like it. The view from our window was onto the MGM Grand and down the strip, looking down on the bridge between Trop and MGM. When lying on my bed I could see the MGM, Planet Hollywood, Paris and Wynn. Very nice. The bathrooms were fine, it did look like they hadn't been upgraded as much as the main room but they still clean and well functional. Decent sized sink and unit, bath tub with a shower that had a very powerful head and a toilet more secluded in a boxed off section of the room. The only slight issue is that we had an adjoining room and you could hear the guests in that room. Luckily we had quiet neighbours but this could be an issue if you had a noisy neighbour. Casino itself is small for Vegas standards and there is no distinct theme like NY NY, Paris etc but it is spotlessly clean. It has a bright airy feel and there is always someone cleaning. All staff were friendly and talkative from check in to dealers to waitresses. The pool area was very nice, nice gardens and the pool was spacious and clean. Food options are limited compared to the bigger hotels but still more than adequate.. Cafe Nikki was the only one we sampled but the meal here was gorgeous.

We wanted to be at that end of the strip (it is near MGM, NY NY, Excalibur) because we were going to the Las Vegas Invitational Bball tournament at the Orleans (cheaper cab). I was hesitant to book at 1st because the price was so low compared to other hotels in the same location but after reading a few reviews on TA, we booked. Although the ceiling in the casino is low, which is odd after going to other casinos, the entire area has been redone and looks great. I can't compare to the old but my husband said it was a definite improvement. Check in was a breeze and off to our room we went. We were on the 8th floor and were able to get a king bed, which is what I wanted. Although I asked if the room had a view and was told the double bed rooms have the view, king bed rooms look at airport. Ok, no big deal about the view since we wouldn't be in the room too much anyway. Our room was clean and nice. Flat screen tv, desk area, plantation shutters. The bathroom was ok. Seemed they may have skimped or skipped redoing the bathroom, but again it was clean. We had a non-smoking room and it seemed to be a real non-smoking room. We did have a view of the airport but never heard any noise (we even had the windows cracked). All in all, a great hidden gem especially for the price. I would consider staying at this hotel again. The bad: the a/c was terrible. We had it down to 60 and still had to open the windows as it seemed very stuffy and warm in our room. I didn't call b/c w/the window open it was tolerable. I did, however, mention to the front desk at check out and I am pretty certain the information went no further. The bathroom, as I mentioned didn't seem it was updated. The tub/shower is weird. It is at an angle and every time one of us showered there was water on the floor no matter how the shower curtain was placed. Although they have plantation type shutters, the room wasn't the typical pitch black room that I have stayed in while in Vegas. The sun was peaking thru the shutters no matter the directions we put them. To consider: as with most hotel rooms in Vegas, it seems they are miles from the front desk and this is no exception.

We had spent ages picking out our hotel for our first trip to Vegas. I work for a major hotel chain so I am always really picky when it comes to hotels. We wanted a reasonably priced, nice hotel. We didn't want to spend a fortune on a hotel, as it would give us more spending money on the casino floors! We got exactly that, and so much more. The hotel is literally minutes from the airport, so after almost 28 hours travelling (thanks to hurricane Irene) we were thankful of such a short journey. Arriving at the Trop, we were greeted by the amazing smell they pump through the AC. Whenever I smell coconut now, I am reminded about the great time in Vegas. Check in was a breeze, and as we booked direct with the hotel we were able to use the VIP line. Then the room! OMG! It was amazing. I had a paradise suite on the 22nd (I think) floor. It was a corner suite, with stunning views on three sides of the hotel. The room was massive!!! It had a huge living area with big flatscreen Tv, fridge and coffee maker. The separate bedroom area had another huge flatscreen and quite possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Truly couldn't wait to get in at the end of the day and didn't want to get out in the morning! We gambled some on the casino floor, I lost loads but other members of the party were a good bit richer by the end of the trip. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants but had pizza at the small diner place on the ground floor, great value and fed us well. Pool area was nice, had a look but didn't stay long as we weren't in Vegas to lounge by a pool! Location was good. It is at the south end of the strip and most places could be walked to, however the monorail at MGM just across the street is always handy. Every member of staff we spoke to all were great. We also contacted Nicole Marshall prior to our arrival and she went out her way to make sure our stay was as great as possible. She even sorted out some comp tickets for Brad Garret as we were celebrating an occasion while in the hotel. It was an amazing night. We also went to the Mob Experience. I had doubts about this but thoroughly enjoyed it! Great fun and the ending was a good laugh! We stayed for 5 nights and it genuinely made our Vegas experience even better. I would not hesitate to go back to the Tropicana. Truly a beautiful oasis in the middle of the madness of Vegas!", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Wales", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price, right on the Strip.\u201d", "Author": "RockDoc666", "ReviewID": "UR121059702", "Content": "This hotel is fine for those who are passing through Vegas, and don't fancy a branded or themed holiday.

We couldnt check in yet since it was too early so they just called us when our room was ready. Room: No big complains with the room, pretty standard but with a tropical feel to it. Things that we didnt like were the lack of coffee/tea/fridge in the room. They don't like people being independent of restaurants in this city. Bed was super comfy, TV is a 40\" LG with inputs. There is a nice couch thing to sit on. Great view if you open your window, otherwise its hard to see out of the window because it has a screen on it sort of like a microwave. The bathroom was a good size. Normal tub, good water pressure, toilet could swallow a dead horse. You wont be in the room much, but when you do it will be comfy, quiet and relaxing. Casino: Again, great for your first trip. Pretty quiet, large enough to play any type of game. Didn't fee like you would waste anyone's time learning how to play a game. Low ceiling so its pretty smokey though.. Club Nikki: Cool club, very uh.. \"urban\" the night we went. Saw a free MJ actor though so that was sweet. The bouncer denied a girl that wanted to get in without an ID, and he said \"Yeah well you look like your 50 but you still need an ID\" when she said she was 35.

Would be nice if the windows either opened more or they got rid of the white screening applied to the windows. would be nice to be able to really stop the light too, the slatted shutters are pretty, but they don't really stop enough light. Some good blinds would have been nice. The club tower was a bit of a problem with me too, as I have 2 rather bad knees and there is quite a hike to get to your room. The beds are great. Very comfortable. Wireless internet in the room was good but there were some issues with the television picture shredding while watching shows, but then again, who watches TV in Vegas The room was very quiet and clean and comfortable. The headroom is limited in the bathroom and the big corner shower tub. The shower head is mounted very low, making it a challenge for me to wash my hair. I managed to smack my head on the shower head 2 of the 3 mornings because I had to bend over to wash the shampoo out. The breakfast buffet in cafe Nikki was great. The fresh made while you wait omelets were excellent and well done, Definitely the highlight in an otherwise bland and flavorless dining experience for for all the other meals I ate in the other hotels buffets.

Check in took us around 20 minutes in line as they had one person on the desk, this person was not at all friendly, we were so excited to be there and felt disheartened when the lady gave us attitude. #2. When we got to our room, there was no hot water in the bathroom so we called to the front desk muliple times and did not get any answer. The bathroom we had in room 1559 was BADLY in need of a cleaning, there was mould in the grout the floor tiles were all cracked the filters in the ceiling and wall was very dirty and the toliet would barely flush. #3. The room has very bad circulation, if you took a shower the whole room got damp and would feel damp unless we opened the windows. #4. There is a very very long walk from the Club tower to the exit of the hotel with not a lot going on inbetween, we felt that we had to go out most of the time to eat because there is very LITTLE selection in places to eat. or thing to do, the shows are not the greatest and the hotel is very far south on the strip. After going into other hotels I would NEVER again stay at the Tropicana, it should not be rated #16 on here and I am not a very picky person at all. # 5. The cable kept coming and going after a long day out we are not partiers we would come back to relax and we couldn't even count on watching a show without it beng interupted. As I said before, my husband and I are not picky people and have stayed in much worse hotels than the Tropicana but have had better customer service than this. For those of you out there that would like an honest answer...the Tropicana should be rated somewhere in the 150 range, in my opinion.

It was our first night out in almost three years - we have a 2 1/2 old twin daughters. So, we were really excited about our trip. Overall, the hotel wasn't so bad. However, the positive reviews I've been reading seem overrated. I stayed at room 1123 at Paradise Tower during the first week of November. The wait line at the check-in was ridiculous. When I arrived (4 p.m.), there were three people in front of me, and yet it took 30 minutes for someone to help me with check in. Anyways, we checked in to room 1123, located on the 11th floor overlooking south side of MGM Grand. The room did not feel spacious. The room was clean with simple tropical-themed decorations. Nothing special. I upgraded to City View room for $25 more but the view overlooking MGM was not spectacular. Of all the things that were renovated, the bathroom tiles were not remodeled. It looked dirty with lots of old stains. The bed was comfortable; however, two things kept us waking up at night - the noisy heater and lack of black out curtains. The plantation shutters looked nice but they kept letting mornight sunrays through our room. The heater, every time it would turn on, would make such a loud noise that it would wake us up. The hotel staff were not all that friendly as many reviewers said. They were not rude, but I didn't find them particularly friendly or nice. There were just doing their business. In addition, the hotel ceiling on the northern portion by a snack shop and a restroom (leading to 2-story motel structure) was so low that I felt claustophobic (and I'm 5-7). The ceiling was probably 6 foot and 2 inches high and anyone who's taller than that could not have made it. In addition, the hotel has a very small, I mean VERY SMALL casino! For the size of the hotel, the casino should have been at least three times bigge than its current size. I didn't want to play there. Other people probably thought the same - the casino was virtually empty on Sunday evening. One crap table - no players, one roulette table - no players. Four or five blackjack tables - some action there. Only about 20 people seemed to be playing the slots. The hotel guests appeared to be much older compared to other hotels in Vegas (average of 65-75 years old). Consequently, the cocktail waitresses were also older (60-70) wearing awkwardly revealing uniforms. I didn't want to see cleavage of someone who is older than my mom. I understand millions of dollars were spent on renovation. I seriously think that was a bad mistake. The hotel should have been demolished and rebuilt. There were many issues with the old hotel that could not have been resolved with renovations. I even joined Trop Players Card and participated in even the odds program. (I lost $70 and got $35 back) But I don't think I will come back to Tropicana. It's just not worth it. Even if I get a free room, I would pay and stay at other newer hotels. Overall, the hotel isn't terrible but I just wanted to inform people that if you are going to stay at Tropicana, significantly lower your expectations. It's just an old man wearing a brand new clothing made in China.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tofino, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat All Around!\u201d", "Author": "Lara A", "ReviewID": "UR120314463", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed at the Tropicana for three nights and had so much fun!

A bit of a line but the guest service agents were super friendly and willing to help with any and every question. We also got a complimentary upgrade to a mini suite which was great! We had a view of the south end of the strip and we were not bothered by any noise whatsoever. The room was large and clean. A fridge would have been nice but other than that I can't complain. We went to numerous casinos during our stay and we agreed that the Tropicana was the one that most suited us. Not too busy and not dark and gloomy like most. The servers came around often enough with beverages which was not the case at any of the other resort casinos (I ended up spending 40$ at the MGM Grand for a bottle of MGD and a double rum and coke due to lack of service there.) The pool looked awesome and it was not very busy but we never got around to enjoying it. Cafe Nikki was perfect! The food was amazing, the prices are extremely reasonable, and the service was superb!

I had a King room and it was spacious. I liked the desk/table set-up, room for two people. There was a nice flat screen TV in the room. Hairdryer in bath. There was no coffee pot in room, want you to use their coffee spots downstairs I guess! I don't drink it, so didnt' care, but I know some people like to get up and make coffee. A friend of mine said she brought a 10.00 perculator type thing from Walmart and took it, made her own and said you can even just leave it there if no room to take it home in luggage, because is cheaper than buying the coffee in the shops, even if you leave it! The bathroom was spacious and the tub was a garden size. The shower head was low or weird or something. I am 5'2'' and it just did hit my head. I think a tall person would have issues and have to scrunch up under it. Not sure what the problem is, but the water was hot all the time and immediately when turned on. I liked the curved shower curtain most now have as well. The room was quiet, I never heard neighbors, etc. The bed was very comfortable. There was a digital clock with iPod dock. I don't care for the \"resort fee\", I know many of the hotels charge this, but it is basically just adding to the room rate and I'd rather they just include it, since it is mandatory anyway, it is part of the rate, we are not stupid. I am not too sure what the fee covers, maybe the \"free wireless\", which is not free when you pay $14.99 a day to use it! Just include it all in the rate and be done with it. The only thing I did not care about at the Tropicana was the shutters on the windows. They were pretty, but a lot of light filters in through them at night and I like it dark. I tried shutting them in both directions and still got a lot of light in the room. I would prefer curtains, but the shutters are probably easier to deal with by the staff. I was in the club towers, which is a tower at the back of the complex. From the outside, it looked like it was a great distance, but inside walking it was no more than 5 minutes from registation to elevators, unless you walk real slow. I do tend to be a fast walker! The pool area looked nice, but it was too cold for that this trip, weather in low 60's and 50's. I never found the business center, though I saw signs directing to the area. They did have some internet kiosks near the elevator for the Club tower and you can print boarding passes free there. There is a deli, food seems to come from Cafe Nikki and appeared to be the same food on their menu, you just order at the counter at the deli whereas Cafe Nikki is sit down. There was no room service menu, but an abbreviated room service flier in the room. Plenty of food options at the hotels in the area, NY NY, Excalibur, Luxor, MGM, etc. I did not eat at either of the other two restaurants in Tropicana, one was Italian and one more a steakhouse I guess. Casino never seemed to be very full, even at night or weekends. I do not gamble so can't comment on anything there. My money went to the resort fee! LOL!! All of the staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful. We rented a car right at the hotel one day to go to Hoover dam and it was convenient, inexpensive and they were helpful.

And I also talked to a couple of the concierges before my arrival, and they were helpful with suggestions, dinner, and show reservations. Glad I took care of this because in person there were sometimes long lines for the concierge (who also took care of our Hoover Dam excursion). The room: comfortable and clean. Beds were ok, pillows were ok. I didn't think they were incredibly comfy but then I slept really well all 4 nights! Plenty of room. Had 2 double beds. Quiet. Renovated. The bathrooms had apparently not been renovated - old cracked tiles, small bath/shower, thin towels, minimal amenities (ie no shower cap or shower gel) Enjoyed Nikki's Club for breakfast - huge portions, yummy oatmeal, yogurt and fruit, etc. There were a couple other options in the hotel - a Starbucks and another cafe/frozen yogurt spot for a quick bite. Did not eat at the hotel for lunch or dinner. (Across the street at the MGM was our favorite lunch at Wolfgang Puck's Grill!) Pool was spacious, comfy chairs, very loud music. I found it hard to find a quiet spot anywhere in the whole hotel - I like to read and relax when not in meetings, and the room had terrible lighting for reading. Unfortunately there wasn't really any other place to sit quietly either. The casino was not crowded like a lot of hotels, but like all of them the area was incredibly smoky. Coming from a state with no smoking laws this was very irritating - not to this hotel specifically. (My friend woke up one night thinking something was on fire and it was her hair and pillow that reeked with smoke!). Our eyes and throats bothered us the whole time. Location was ok - not in the \"thick of things\" near Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, etc. But the MGM across the street had a monorail station to other hotels, it's a quick and cheap cab ride to other hotels, and the location at the Tropicana was definitely less crowded and quieter than the other places as well, which I think is a good thing. This hotel does not have free entertainment like the other hotels either - ie Bellagio's conservatory and fountains, Treasure Island's siren show, Mirage's volcano, etc. Again, this could be a good or bad thing depending on what you're expecting.

It reminds me of the smell from a cheap car air freshener. It does seem to cover up the smell of smoke, though. Everything is brightly lit and clean. Much better than the dark and dirty of some older Vegas properties. The in room dining is actually priced at \"hotel\" prices and not \"Vegas tourist\" prices.

The site has been designed to allow guests to share their tips, comments and advice on the Tropicana to hopefully allow everyone to make the most of their stay! The tips and comments are broken down into a wide number of categories, so whether you want to advice on the dining options or the casino, it should be easy to find - it's more tips and advice based than review based like Tripadvisor.

The only complaint is that the water was soooo cold. Everyone in the pool was commenting on the temperature of the pool.

Flat Screen television with a few good channels. The view was really nice except I wish the windows weren't covered in the material that they are. Its basically a bunch of tiny circles on the window. The bathroom was nice and roomy. The Casino - kind of refreshing that it didn't have a huge casino. I kind of liked the smaller setting. Pros - pool, room, casino Cons - location The location on the strip was a little further down from the action, but as long as you take the bus or the monorail it was easy to get to the more popular hotels. Also the walk from the reception to my room was a little lengthier than I would have liked. The fitness center is not completed so basically its only a few machines and weights right next to the pool, which was adequate, Im sure however that when the fitness center is completed that it will be nice. Overall, great hotel and atmosphere. The pool is probably one of the best on the strip. The hotel is really affordable and a great place to vacation.

We travel to Vegas at least once per year. This is our first stay at the Trop and were quite excited to see the recent changes made. I will start by saying that every employee we came in contact with was more than friendly, they truly go out of their way and kill you with kindness. Other than that, we were not impressed. They are trying to be/offer a Mandalay Bay experience and falling short of what they are selling. I reserved the room almost a year ago, we received an excellent rate of $129.00 per night, I had requested an upgrade to a \"Strip View Room\". They agreed and said it would be an additional $25.00, great deal. Ever heard the saying \"You get what you pay for\"? We waited in line for about 25 minutes checking in. There were 2 employees at the desk. However the VIP Line had I believe 4 employees there with no one waiting in the VIP Line it was only after waiting the 25 minutes that these employees decided to help us common folk. Then we got to our room, 1225. The view was of the back side of the MGM and off to the East side of Vegas, oh, it also included a beautiful view of the rooftop of the main Casino. There are very few \"in room\" amenities. No fridge, coffee, water, etc. They want you spending your money downstairs. There is a blow dryer and an iron.The carpet in the room was stained throughout with bright red blotches and the bathroom floor was streaked with black marks. Not a lot of attention to detail in the cleaning process. I wore flip flops around the room. The beds were comfy. The A/C was a small 12x12 hole in the wall that blew directly into another wall inside this little cove area of the room, not out in to the room. We had it set at 68 and could not get the room to cool down. We finally opened the windows to get a little bit of a breeze into the room and stayed awake the rest of the night listening to the loud music played througout the parking area and sirens. On our fist day we went to Nikko the \"Cafe\" type restaurant. Food was way over priced and not great. Service was very slow, but employees were very apologetic and nice. The hotel is conveniently located for events at Thomas & Mack, we walked back to the hotel each night.

Bottom line: If you are considering the Flamingo, NY-NY, Luxor, etc., then you should definitely consider the Trop, too. It is nicely appointed, decently located and not as overwhelmingly huge as some of the other resorts. The price is right, too. And the pool is beautiful. Do not stay here expecting the luxury of City Center, the Wynn or even Caesar's. But by saving money at the Trop, you will have a lot more money to spend while you're in Vegas!!

You might try to stay closer to the front, but we never heard one minute of night club music, even on the 12th floor. The best thing about the Trop? The bed. **The bed is probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.** The bathroom was a nice size with a big tub. There were mildew and paint splotches in the shower, which I did not expect considering the renovations were so recent. One day, housekeeping made up our room and left us with 1 towel, which we did not know until after midnight when we got back to our room. That was annoying. The casino ventilation has not been upgraded and is not even close to that found in the newer properties. The smell of smoke as you approach the casino is overwhelming. The \"South Beach Marketplace\" is a 24-hour Starbucks (yay!) & a couple of quick service eateries. Nothing great. The breakfast buffet at Cafe Nikki is $18.95 and hardly worth it.

None of the confusing maze and multi-story compounds much larger properties have.

The Tropicana is not as large as many of the themed hotels, with under 1500 rooms - small for this town. It feels more of an hotel and less like an airport terminal. The decoration throughout is fresh and relaxing, with a Miami South Beach meets Caribbean plantation theme. My room was spacious and beautifully furnished with a chez longue, plantation shutters and 42\"-50\" TV (all HD) and good quality bathroom toiletries. The best thing about the room however was the luxurious bed. Quite simply, this was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, with a superb (Serta?) mattress and high quality cotton sheeting. The AC worked well and I found the room quiet and restful. This hotel easily deserves 4 stars following its complete remodelling. Even the perfumed public areas were pleasant and not in any way overwhelming. Presumably, this 'freshener' is cycled through the air conditioning. My only gripe, is that there are some steps from the parking garage to one of the hotel entrances so not ideal for the disabled or someone with heavy luggage. I didn't like the service I received at breakfast in Nikki cafe. The server appeared disinterested and perhaps tired from the night before? The reception staff were extremely helpful when I tried to complete an airline check-in and they went out of their way to assist.

We were welcomed by the bellmen who droove our suitcases and shoppings to our rooms. while i was at the check inn desk. We were checked in smootly within 5 minutes due Barbara! We took the elevator to floor 19 and got rooms 1923 and 1925. Enetering the rooms we were overwhelmed! Everything what we seen on the picture's was in the rooms we were Silenced! We knew the rooms looked nice on Internet but in reality it was MUCH MUCH more nice! Very quickly the bell boy ringed at our doors bringing our things! 4 minute's ? So wooo we were in las Vegas !!! We got rooms with city view ( view on the strip MGM , Paris , Paris ) 2 rooms! the rooms had connecting doors from the inside!... So no walking in the hallway to knock nock... The rooms even were better as all the pictures i have seen on internet! Happy Happy Happy But :-> after a few hours i woke up due Beep Beep Beep sounds.. it was the digging machine's digging and preparing the Nikki Pool area,, i tried to silence my ears... I tried pillows on my ears,,,, But nothing helped.. I kept hearing the BEEP BEEP BEEP it sounded exactly like my alarm wake up clock... I phoned to the Front Desk explaining my problem... happily they understood!! we were then transferred from city view BEEP BEEP rooms to the other site of the tower with a view on Excalibur, Mandala and Luxor. That was a great sight also! still on floor 19 The sun did shine in that room! so i lowered the shutters and slept long. next Morning Miss Nicole Marshall phoned to my room asking if all was OK .. yes it was beside i had a bad cold and was couging.. In the aftrenoone we droove to red rock canyon. after arriving back to our rooms from Red Rock i had a message from the Front desk asking me to report in......So i was worried if the complained we made was to much. So i went to the front desk verry worried what would happen...BUT There was a Yellow Gift bag for me there, Containing tea , Honey sweeties and other things with a little note: get well soon.. Regards : Nicole. I Consider that as very very very special! Ok we stayed 8 nights and then went to the Grand C and from there to Page. From Page we went back to Las Vegas. We checked in at the Golden Nugget and beeing in the Golden Nugget room we both were dissapointed wishing to be back at Tropicana, But OK we slept at the Nugget but i did set my alarm clock at 10,00 I woke up and called the Trop ( Nicole) I Told here we were downtown at the Nugget but we want to be back again in the Trop.. is there a room for us? YES it was !! beeing in Page and checking my email i got a message from the trop giving me 20% off so i mentioned that and got the answer... OK i can do better as that and i got 30% and resort fees waived!!! We checked out of the Golden Nugget , went to the Trop.. But we were told ok rooms not ready yet.. Come back after 15.00 So we went back at the car and droove up to NMount Charleston.. we had a great time. We returned back at tropicana about 18.00.. The rooms were ready! 2 rooms again on floor 20 with inner connecting doors and a view on the strip! We wanted to stay in thoose rooms 7 days more :) But then in the middle of the night i heard ( at 04.30) Tick Tick Tick I Just returned from a long walk on the LV Strip Tick Tick Tick I looked up to the ceiling and WHOO there was a big wet place leaking water... tick tick .. I Phoned the front desk : Telling Hey there is a poblem in my room! Water is dripping true the ceilings... Nlothing happened.. and it was getting worse... not only tick tick tick.. but almost a little river off water was dropping from the ceiling in my room! I put plastic cans , cofee makers and a lot more on the floor to catch the leaking water, and i phoned again to the front desk saying: HEY SENT SOMEONE TO MY ROOM! There is a major Problem! After 10 minutes a maintain men arrived with some tools.. he looked in my room and said! Pjew i have to get someone else! and he left 15 Minutes later an invasion came :) Security, maintainance and a lot more ppl.. They all together in a meeting decided that the water that was coming in my room came from the upper floor! So all thoose ppl left my room and went 1 floor up. I dont know what was gooing on there .. i heard a jacuzzie was overflooding... the real rea\\son what happened above my head was never told... anyway the dripping ( Tick Tick Tick) stopped slowly so i went a sleep about 06.30 maybe 07.00 Ours later i woke up... i looked at the ceilings and oh men it was terrible! the wallpaper also. I Called Front Desk and told sent someome over to look at the damage..... Well they did sent someone.. He looked and said Ow No...and left 2 hours later front Desk Called me telling me we had to moove from the damaged rooms telling me to report at the front desk. So i went to the front desk ..But hey at the front desk they wanted my ID (passport) wich was crazy! They Phoned me! to report in! So i was sent up back to the water room to get my passport and went back to front desk. There i got the keys to 2 rooms below us and was told to change from the water leaking rooms to floor 19.. So i did. (My friend was walking on the strip) so i mooved all we had from floor 20 to 19 :) I was very aware if i have not warned the Trop on the leaking damage it would have gone from floor 20 -> 19_> 18-> 17->16 and more So i was very aware that i saved the Trop Hotel some damage money. OK we installed ourselfes on floor 19 .. but nobody contacted us.. We talked about it and concluded that is strange. Next Morning i went to thye Front Desk Telling the story... The ladies at the front desk already knew about the water problem... 1 off them I cant give the name said Hey GO Complain! You dont have to take that! So i asked for a manager and i got one.. He heard my story.. asked me why didnt you complain earlier.... saw the pics i took.... and then asked me : Will you be OK with 4 free nights for both rooms to undo the trouble you had. YES i agreed.

Included in the room was; a couch with two end tables and foot table, a sitting chair, a writing table and chairs, a large flat screen TV, a Keurig coffee maker, and a refrigerator. The bedroom included; a king size bed with end tables, a sitting chair with foot stool, another large flat screen TV, and a chest of drawers which contained the safe. the closet had plenty of room and had two bathrobes in it that you could take home for $100.00 each. The bathroom was average but very clean. Minor Issues: We had a couple of issues during our stay which did not hamper our stay in any way. There was a small leak in the supply line for the toilet which a pool of water on the floor but maintenace fixed it immediately after we reported it to the front desk. Another issue was that we did not get maid service one day which was no big deal as we just called the front desk and had fresh towels and addtional coffee sent to our room. The last incident happened late one night when we got back to the room there was a food cart that had a large bowl filled with snacks and fruit along with a bottle of crown royal. it was obviously delivered to the wrong room by mistake so we reported the error and they sent an individual up to bring it to the correct room. It was unfortunate that the mob experience tour was closed as we would have enjoyed that but it sounded like there was some possible financial backing for the exhibit and hopefully it will be back up and running in the near future. I do have to comment that if anyone has questions regarding the Tropicana you need to send an e-mail to Nicole Marshall. She helped with our questions from the time we decided to stay at the Trop. She had our resort fee waived, and also sent us follow up e-mails after our stay when we completed their survey. She is definately very customer service orientated and a pleasure to work with. It is going to be hard to go back to a \"regular\" room in Vegas again after staying at the Paradise Suite. Maybe I will have to see if Nicole can let us know when they are having specials on the paradise suite because I would definately stay there again!", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLoved The Tropicana!\u201d", "Author": "MissT1981", "ReviewID": "UR119788460", "Content": "Lovely spacious room.

We arrived at the hotel at about 6pm and walked right up to the counter where we were helped by a really nice woman named Evie. The room was really nice--very clean, spacious, etc. I have absolutely nothing to complain about regarding the room, though the bed was a bit soft for my taste (but slept fine due to vegas exhaustion!). A/C worked just fine, basic toiletries, hair dryer, etc. I agree with the other reviewers that the Paradise Tower is the way to go, since the other one is so far and seems to get noise from \"Club Nikki.\" The casino was fine, though we didn't do any table games there, only slots. It seemed that slots paid out a fair amount and we won a fair amount. The Wheel of Fortune slots seemed to pay out nicely. The pool was nice, though the water was frigid (Oct). There weren't enough chairs/chairs were broken, but we seemed to get lucky enough to get chairs together. Pool service was nice, though drinks are pretty expensive. There is a $11/day resort fee, though this is par for the course. There is a Starbucks, a deli/pizza place, and a frozen yogourt place, all of which were good and reasonably priced. People were nice, though service was fairly \"no frills.\" If you're looking to be fawned over, this isn't the place, but the people were all very nice. No complaints whatsoever.

I travelled with a girfriend and both of us were Vegas Virgins. We shared a twin room which was quite large with 2 very comfy beds. Personally I thought that the lighting in the room was a bit gloomy, although the lighting in the bathroom was a lot brighter. Trouble being that I prefer to sit down when doing hair and makeup and the only mirror with a chair was in the bedroom. We opted for a higher floor room, but had to take a smoking one. You could smell the smoke when you first entered but we didn't think it was to overpowering, The pool area was busy, but then again we were there over a weekend, I would imagine that during the week it would be a great deal quieter and the water was not at all cold. I did not notice any sunbeds that were broken, and whilst it was a bit of a tight squeeze we did manage to get 2 beds on each of the days. Personally I would prefer there to be no music around the pool, but it wasn't overly loud. Although on the Saturday and Sunday Nikki Beach held their pool party and the music from it was rather booming, lots of bass. We did go into Nikki Beach, but only for about an hour as we found it to be full of a younger crowd, and we couldn't really understand the rules on where we could sit or not. The beds and Cabanas can be hired for the day, but at huge cost. We asked one of the waitress about this and was given a price of $500!!!!!! and I think that was cheap, as it was the last party of the season. We took breakfast and lunch in Nikki Cafe and found the food to be of a very high quality and the staff were very efficiant and friendly. Likewise the Biscayne restaurant where we ate on our first night. Neither of us are gamblers, but we had a go and came out evens. The casino, is, in comparision to some of the other hotels rather small, but then again the hotel itself is on the smaller side. Which I prefer. We did go and see a number of the larger establishments, and they are massive. You could easily spend an entire week in some of them and still not have drank in every bar or eaten in every restaurant. We took a trip to The Grand Canyon with Sundance Helicopters which was fantastic, quite breath taking. And we went to The Gun Store, which was also breath taking, but in a totally different way!!!!! An excellent expreience. We also went to Fremont Street, but we didn't like it at all, it felt down at heel and a bit scumy.

People that complain about things on this site have to realize no one hotel is perfect and if you do not like something then try to do something about it! Yeesh. Another special thanks to the desk staff for assisting me with printing off boarding passes as the lobby CPU's would not work correctly yet they were more than willing to attempt to print them off for me! The maids are very polite also and do an awesome job. The casino staff and waitresses are also excellent and one night we almost had to ask them to stop serving us LOL. So again, thanks Tropicana for giving us 'specials' and we will continue to stay there when we come as it is a great place to stay...sad thing is more people will stay with reviews like this. I strongly recommend a suite in the towers as they give you soooo much room and extra amenities...however the standard rooms or strip views are also well equipped and more than comfortable. My only complaint and it is a 'me' thing is I am not fond of adjoining rooms - unless of course you know who is in it as they can be a bit noisy at times....but that again is a 'me' thing and is not against the Tropicana!

This was our first trip to Vegas (in fact to America) and we were a little apprehensive when we arrrived at the airport but we needn't have worried.

The rooms were clean, of a good size and the maid service was regular and thorough. Beds were very comfortable and of typical American size - large and very comfortable! Unlike neighbouring properties such as New York New York and the Excalibur there was not a wide choice of places to eat within the hotel, but the restaurant and fast food options were of very good quality. Location is great. It is one of the closest hotels to the airport. The hotel did not seem well populated at night time and this resulted in a lack of atmosphere in the casino and bar areas, compared to other hotels we visited.

Returned before 3pm and was told Housekeeping (HK) was running late and it would be later than 3pm. I explained we had early dinner reservations downtown at Hugo Cellars (excellent) and needed to get in our room ASAP. She said they would put a rush on it. HK didn't show up to the room until 2:55pm to do a 40 minute cleanup. When I complained of the service (3pm is check in time) they claimed I had made a special request and that caused the issue (I asked for a room w/ a view who doesn't). When we got to our room at 3:40pm we found the floor in the bathroom still dirty and the carpet sandy and an old piece of gum stuck to the side of the chaise lounge! The room windows are on the small side for Vegas standard with heat film over the glass that was an obstruction to the view, which was of the MGM and some of the strip. Another issue was at pool side where the majority of the plastic lounge chair backs were broken so you could not sit up in them. Even the pool-boy suggested we complain to management.

Fancied a change from the Luxor which was looking tired when we last visited. The refurb has been done to a high standard-the room we had in the club tower was a good size, clean, well decorated and the bed was sooo comfortable. The mattress topper and quality of the sheets was the best we had ever had. The view was also good overlooking the pool and the strip. The only slight negatives with the room was the noise from Club/Cafe Nikki which drifted upwards but having read other reviews was something we were prepared for. The room was quite stuffy at times as for some reason the air con would not go below 16 degrees c.The bathroom was also a good size with a large corner bath. The only part of the room not completely refurbished was part of the bathroom with the wall and floor tiling and bath/shower. Be warned if you are tall-ie over 5'6 in my case, as you will have to stoop under the shower head as it is fixed. Bit of shame to cut corners in the bathroom when everything else had been refurbed. The towels were also poor quality. It would be great if tea/coffee facilities were in the room as we really missed this. I appreciate having read other reviews now that the management can arrange this on request, but to be honest I assumed that if this was possible they would already have been provided-the same with the lack of fridge-not something i would think of asking for at reception! The staff were all really helpful at the hotel-but we felt sorry for the hostesses who had the worst uniform going-an unflattering and old fashioned skimpy outfit that you would expect to see in a different occupation! Thank goodness for Starbucks as the choice for the food and drink establishments was a real let down considering how nice the rest of the hotel was if you were after casual dining. We ate once at Cafe Nikki and the music was that loud it was like eating in a nightclub. On another day we had a drink outside and again the awful music was blaring-I asked the bartender if he could change the music-bless him he smiled and said he has to listen to it all day and there was nothing he could do.The hotel really lacks a decent bar to sit at and enjoy drinks/bar meals-we went to different hotels for this. Loved the scent being pumped through the casino-but be warned if you are a non-smoker, the smell of cigarettes is really thick and strong-but this is the same in all the casinos! We used Virgin holidays-watch out for their transfer bus on arrival-despite the Trop being 15 mins around the corner, we sat on a transfer bus for 2 hours!!! They took us to the far end of the strip driving down all the back streets for a bunch of hotels. This is something we complained about to the rep.

Check-in was swift and efficient and we paid extra to retain our room until 3pm on our last day, and then up to floor 16 in the Paradise Tower. The room (a deluxe) was large, spotlessly clean, tastefully decorated, with 2 huge beds, beautiful linens, and a large bathroom with lots of good towels. There was a hairdryer, iron and ironing board, along with a large safety deposit box and free wifi. It also sports a massive television, should you feel inclined to watch US television. No fridge in the room, which we would have liked for a variety of reasons including the storing of the doggie bag! (Large US portions!) We noticed a fridge in the corridor on our last day from a room that had been vacated, and realized we could have rented one for our stay \u2013 we wish this had been pointed out to us, but maybe we just should have asked. The Tropicana is next to the airport, but the window glazing is excellent as we can honestly say that we were never troubled by aircraft noise. In addition, the Trop casino area is mostly light and bright (and we would say \u2018airy\u2019, but they do allow smoking as in all casinos in Vegas), and not as massive as some. It took us until day 2 to realize that to get into the pool complex \u2013 Nikki Beach - that you do not need to be a resident in the hotel (well, we never saw anyone checking whether people were resident, so anyone can make use of it). Needless to say, the pool area really does fill up, so it pays to stake your claim early. We also found that a huge number of the sun-beds were broken and no-one seemed to check them take them off site to get them fixed. There is an abundance of fresh towels and the pool is large and fairly warm too \u2013 note there is no \u2018deep end\u2019 \u2013 the depth ranges from 3ft to 4/5ft only. We have to comment that Nikki beach is EXTREMELY noisy thanks to the OTT loud music. The speakers around the pool churn out music constantly which was fine by us, but Club Nikki (at least, that\u2019s what we think it was), suddenly comes to life around mid-day and the music thumps out at an ever increasing decibel level, competing with the music coming from the pool speakers \u2013 nightmare! We therefore retreated to the far end of the grass banking, which made it tolerable. Some people, we guess, must just enjoy the racket! Anther thing to point out about the Tropicana is the over-powering \u2018scent\u2019 of coconut air-freshener, which is pumped out 24/7 from the air-conditioning \u2013 it really stinks and we are at a loss as to why they do it. Thankfully, no such aroma pervades the rooms!

Let's start with the rooms: They are clean, comfortable (one notoriously difficult sleeper said it was the most comfortable hotel bed he had ever slept on) and feature a pleasant d\u00e9cor. The sportsbook: This was a big one for my group - our entire Saturday was dedicated to watching and gambling on college football. And we couldn't have been happier with the room. There were tons of huge HD projectors to dart our eyes between, comfortable chairs and some cool nooks with big HD TVs on the wall. Before the trip someone recommended we do out football watching at Caesars Palace. We checked it out, but the bright lights from Pure washed out the images on the wall. At the Trop, they keep the lighting perfect - the picture really pops. We loved it. The service: I've been to Vegas about 10 times, and the service has been pretty good no matter where I stayed. My experience at the Trop was even better, though. Nothing crazy, just a lot of employees willing to actually interact rather than just address my immediate need. My group had great conversations with a hostess, two bartenders and two blackjack dealers. It was cool to feel like a person, not just an object to satisfy. The food: We didn't eat a lot of different food at the Trop, but we had several meals at Cafe Nikki. (One member of the group wanted to have every meal there, but the rest of us insisted on seeking a little variety.) The breakfast buffet was very good - make sure to pour yourself some real apple juice and get a custom omelet. The lunch and dinner options feature a lot of great sports bar food, and it's all well-made and reasonably priced. Other great things: The pool, plenty of card tables, fun poker dealers and one of the highlights of my trip - they serve Victoria cerveza at Cafe Nikki and throughout the casino. Thank god, a casino that serves a Mexican beer other than Corona! My only complaint is the Casino's music selection - it was really soulless. I'm talking Ricky Martin \"Shake Your Bon Bon\" played several times over the course of the weekend. Luckily, they don't play the music too loud (if the songs were better, I would encourage them to crank it up a bit more).

After walking miles upon miles everyday the last thing you wanna do is walk more miled to your room other than that it is fantastic. Word of advice.. buy a $7 dollar a day bus pass good for 24 hours from time of purchase. You can board the deuce, the express, or any other bus in town. If you stay in your room and like brand new and modernized hotels, check this out, you will not be dissappointed. Retro on the outside modern inside. Don't forget to tip for everything because they expect it there. If you don't, you're room is not cleaned. Trust me. Sometimes you forget and come back to a room in the same condition and that is how it stayed for the last couple nights. I did however end up stealing many toiletteries off the cart. That was more fun than tipping anyway.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cParadise Tower\u201d", "Author": "Webster702", "ReviewID": "UR119361194", "Content": "I lived in Vegas for over 30+ years and they did a great improvement on the rooms,up to date looks and feels, great services from check-in thru check-out, and it was best discussion for stay those nights for my birthday.

So here goes... I moved from the East Coast to AZ early this year and before I started my new job I decided I would treat myself to a long weekend in Vegas. After some elaborate room searching I was able to get a great deal for my stay (I booked 2 consecutive reservations; one for the weekdays and one for the weekend and ended up with a great price!!). Now when I got to the hotel I was exhausted (I had clocked about 14 hours of travel due to delays and a missed flight). The bellman was immediately offering assistance and got me over to the front desk right away... Small wait at check in but nothing out of the ordinary... and then... The front desk set the tone for my stay.. The front desk agent was being polite and doing that small talk thing that they have all been taught to do (you know what I am talking about) but the difference? She was actually listening... She asked me to wait a moment and stepped away, when she came back she said \"I imagine you are tired after such a long day. I've gone ahead and upgraded you to a nice quiet room so that you can relax\". She set up my reservations so that I could stay in the same room straight through the weekend and made me feel like she actually cared... I get escorted to my room by the bellman and he points out all the renovations along the way. Now, I remember my first trip to Vegas about 10 years ago when the Trop seemed to be going in the same downward spiral as all the other Vegas classic hotels (the Sands, Sahara, Frontier... etc). I can only say one thing after walking the renovated \"These people know what they are doing and are bringing the gem back!!\" The hotel was clean as a whistle, the hallways felt plush as you walked and they smelled awesome. All along the way the bellman made recommendations according to what I said I liked to do... he mentioned some great restaurants, 'must see' Vegas attractions and gave me the 411 on how to get around Vegas and enjoy myself... PERFECT! Now the best part... The room!!! They did it right... The linens and bed were just what the doctor ordered, the room was massive and had a decent view (it was a view Eastward so none of the casino lights were visible from my room... i.e. I got a full on black out that was perfect for sleeping. VEGAS NAP A SUCCESS). Plenty of storage in the room too! The bathroom was decent and the amenities were great... was it the best bathroom ever? No. But it was all I needed for this stay. Housekeeping during my stay was more than I expected... The room was immaculately clean each day and when I ran into a room attendant in the hallways they would always smile, greet me and ask if I needed anything (ohh yeah, when I asked for anything, they actually followed thru and delivered). The casino staff was cordial and polite. I always had a drink within a few minutes of sitting down to gamble and there was regular presence on the floor. The selection on the casino floor was pretty decent FYI, for the Vegas/gambling novice the Monopoly Big Event machine all the way in the back is a lot of fun if you have a group of friends with you.. play the \"invaders from the planet moolah\" machine in the middle.. even if you lose it is a hoot and a half.. yes I am easily entertained by some slot machines. Everything during my stay was smooth and comfortable... I am so glad that this Las Vegas gem is coming back! Check out the Trop!!! I heard that the rest of the renovations are almost completed and that it is even better!!

We're not a gambling couple so cannot comment more. The hotel location is on the strip and connected to MGM and Excalibur. Very convenient, however, it is not central. Walking the length of the strip can be done but the walk back is tiring! (Your feet will be very sore if you walk everyday like we did!) Cannot comment on Club Nikki as we did not go due to a very long queue! The club also seemed very 'pretentious' as did many of the clubs in Vegas, but I may have been wrong! Also didn't eat in the hotel as were tempted away to the buffets and restaurants in the other hotels.

I'd give this 5 stars. But I'm giving it 3 stars. I want to focus on the good things first, because it has many great points. It's a great hotel, there's no doubt about that, it's in a fantastic location - on the junction with New York New York, Excalibur and MGM Grand - it's light and airy in the casino (and not too large), the staff are amazingly friendly and the price is good for where it is situated. It's recently been refurbished and they've done mostly a great job. We had a room on the 17th floor in the Club Tower (there's no 13th floor!!) and the view was of the south end of the strip and the pool. Wonderful. The rooms are clean with good amenities, lovely lovely housekeeping staff and a decent size. Why I've given it 3 stars? Well if it's not your first time in Vegas, you'll no doubt be aware that it's **exhausting** to wander round all day. So you'll want to sunbathe by the pool. The pool is freezing. It was 95 degrees outside, but the pool was soooo cold. Most of the sunloungers were broken. The functional sunloungers were all taken by about 9.30am. Please Tropicana management sort out the sunloungers!! And then to the music. The music piped through to the normal pool area is fab, a mix of good popular stuff, appealing to everyone.... then at 12 noon the music from Nikki Beach starts (the part of Tropicana where you have to be 'beautiful' to lounge in a cabana, and pay to get in - hence it's never full) - now I'm no pensioner - I'm 35 - but the music is SO LOUD it's disgraceful. A thumping bass line of dance music all day from lunchtime that overrides everything else - I had noise cancelling earphones in and could still feel it thumping against my (broken) sunlounger. I really hope someone from Tropicana reads this. It's awful. Everyone around me thought it was awful. Please make it stop.

The monorail is expensive, difficult to access and stops a fair distance from The Strip, at the back of the hotels. Whatever you do, take comfortable shoes because Vegas involves a lot of walking.

First 4 nights were in the Club Tower. My husband contacted Nicole before we arrived and told her it was my bd & our anniversary and she had a huge surprise for us when we arrived. We were put in a Club Spa suite and boy were we excited--arrived at 1 am. Shortly after we got in the room the phone rang and we were told that there was going to be a delivery to our room and within a few minutes chocolate cake & champagne arrived. So at 1 am after being up almost 24 hours we were enjoying our goodies. The suite was beautiful and very spacious with a coffee maker, refrigerator, spa tub, sauna, and a huge shower. The bed was comfortable and they even gave us masks to keep the light out. It was fantastic and the room was beautiful, clean & well cared for--we felt like royalty. We had to move the second night and I told my hubby to be prepared to come back to reality for the next three nights as we were leaving the suite but much to our surprise the deluxe plus room we have we also wonderful. The bed was again great, the tub large although not a spa tub we great and the room was neat, clean and spacious. I loved the bright colorful furnishings--they were refreshing. We then left the hotel for two nights in AZ and returned for our final two nights in Vegas and were booked in a Deluxe Room in the Paradise tower. This room although not as big as the plus room was nicely furnished and well taken care. It was clean and the the bed was comfy as the other two. Check-in was efficient--no line, the valet parking was well staffed and efficient and everyone working was very friendly and it looked like the employees enjoyed working there. I loved the brightness of the casino it was a welcomed break from the dark dingy casinos. We did not eat at either of the full service restaurants but had great pizza at the South Beach Market place one day and several times enjoyed the gellato at the Naked Spoon. Because of the layout of the property we missed Cafe Nikki completely--just never realized that is was separate from Club Nikki--so I can't comment on it.

So for this price it was \"okay\" (we also got $91 off of hotel due to our comps). We did not get 3 rooms together as booked (and paid for) which is typical of Las Vegas -- at first they were going to give us smoking rooms but due to all members of our group being non-smoking, two of which were asmatic we were given non-smoking rooms, not all of together and not in same towers for first night. The next day they moved one room to our tower (at back) on same floor, the other room we left as it was in same tower but different floor. The staff did not offer to find us alternate rooms at beginning, we had to insist that they find us rooms. If they could not have given us non-smoking rooms I am not sure how much fuss we would have had to make to get what we already paid for. I believe the least a hotel in Vegas should do is hold \"non-smoking\" rooms for people that reserve non-smoking 6 mos in advance. We had an incident with a member of our group - she was going up stairs at Nikki Cafe where art work is on a wall but part of that artwork involves a \"sandbox\" for better lack of term that actually juts out 1 foot beyond the wall. She did not see the curb of the sandbox and tripped and fell into the artwork and was scraped on the hands (trying to break her fall) and wrenched her neck and back. Staff did not assist her, customers did. Then staff came and offered bandaids for her scrapes. We were told to make an incident report which we did to the security officer in the casino. The casino security officer did NOT take her to a private location (like an office) but took her back to the restaurant to view the site of the fall -- had her sit in visible view to all patrons and took photos of her injuries (this is just NOT acceptable way of treating a guest). While doing this two other restaurant patrons tripped and fell as well. Security said that this was not the first time someone fell. They gave her a small icepack (that is all they had, no tensor bandage for her sprained ankle) and sent her on her way. Not one person from the hotel offered an apology -- in most hotels you would hear from Management who would at the very least offer you some sort of comp for the inconvenience. This was most disappointing treatment by hotel staff. The pool staff were very lazy -- compared to Palazzo staff. [Palazzo staff hand you your towels and offer to assist you in seating (moving chairs etc) and they have maintenance staff that come around every half hour cleaning up the glasses and garbage people leave. The Pool Staff go along and pick up all towels left on chairs that are unoccupied.] The Trop staff did none of this. You have to actually reach into the towel cabanna and pick up your own towels, the staff do not assist you in moving the \"plastic\" chairs which are 80% broken (they cannot be set to recline only lie down) nor do they or anyone else clean up the pool area (garbage or towels). made us wonder if anyone even bothers to clean the pool and hot tubs! The decibel of music coming from Nikki Beach is unbearable (as is the selection of music) at the pool and overpowers the beautiful music from the Pool area itself. The area of the pool by Nikki Beach smells of sewer (very unpleasant) so reccomend you sit as far from Nikki Beach area as possible. The only \"nice\" things about the hotel is the comfort of the beds and the back tower's proximity to pool. The room (1773) we had was dirty, the carpet had a burn hole by the door and on the desk (this was a non-smoking room ?) and a red stain on carpet (likely from a drink spilled). The shutters on the windows are okay - providing you do not want to sleep during day as they do let light through. Loud music from Nikki Beach makes sleeping in afternoon impossible. Also at night you cannot sleep until it shuts down. The rooms are nothing to write home about - did not even take photos of. I will say that the photos on the website are NOT what you get, deceiving in size and what is included in your rooml.

We had room service one morning for breakfast and it was very good. We found unlike other Hotels on the strip that we walked around the Tropicana was not as busy which we found great. If you wanted busy all you had to do was walk outside for five minutes. The little caf\u00e9 downstairs was perfect for a quick breakfast or snack and the prices were very fair. We didn\u2019t gamble much so I can\u2019t say much on that. We did take in the comedy show at the hotel. My wife really didn\u2019t want to go because she is not into comedy shows but after it was over she said it was good and she was glad she went. The valet guys are good, always ask you if you need directions and they don\u2019t look at tip you just gave them, they just place it in pocket and thank you for it. It appeared as if they didn\u2019t expect the tip but it was bonus. I would recommended to my friends to stay here and if returning to Vegas I would have no problem staying here again.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple Ridge, BC", "Title": "\u201cThe renovated Trop is excellent\u201d", "Author": "DGM1", "ReviewID": "UR118797707", "Content": "Stayed at the Trop for a 4 day vacation and it was really very good.

We ate at the Biscayne and it was absolutely wonderful! I have to eat gluten free and Pavillo (spelling?) was extremely accomodating and quite knowledgeable about my needs. That was the 2nd time we had eaten in this restaurant and were equally satisfied both times. Our ONLY disappointment at the Tropicana is that the one and only \"Let it Ride\" table, which is our game of choice, doesn't open at all until 8 PM. We even asked the pit boss if it could be opened, and he stated that he didn't have the staff for it. We ended up spending most of our gambling time in other casinos for that reason. Considering there were at least 3 dealers just standing at other tables with no players, we found that to be unacceptable. We play the game daily for hours at a time, and we had played there on prior trips during the day, so this really was a disappointment.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cI found a new home in LV!\u201d", "Author": "Johnlogie", "ReviewID": "UR118777707", "Content": "Been to LV many times BU had never stayed at the Trop before as I always thought it looked a bit sad and dull. When planning this trip the reviews were great and explained that the hotel has been completely renovated. I want a great pool area to top up my tan so chose the Trop and got a great rate on it's web site for a king club deluxe I was staying in Fremont street the first night so hit the bus up to the Excaliber and crossed over to the Trop. I arrived just after noon so was prepared to check my bags with the Bell service but was really happy to be welcomed at check in who was really engaging (my Scottish accent helps too I think). I asked for a quiet room and he offered me a new king room in the club tower on the 14th floor looking towards the airport and hills which was just fine for me although I think he would've tried hard to find me a strip view if I'd asked. Very efficient and friendly plus he took the time to talk me through the resort map and explained how to get the the gym, pool and my room. The Trop has a $10 a night resort fee. I actually this it's was great value as it included wifi by the pool and in the room plus gym access and pool towels. Other realist charge you for everything so I think it was very reasonable. Walking through the hotel I was very impressed with the decor, it's very light and airy with everything clad cream leather with gold trimmings. Felt very upscale but also laid back at the same time. A great feel to the place so it was a very good first impression. The club tower is a bit of a walk from the reception, yo need to walk through the casino, up an escalator and then walk over the pool overpass to get to the club tower. Not that bad a walk but some may find it hard going. The good thing is that there is a Starbucks near the elevators in the tower so you can grab a dose of caffeine to get you the final stretch to your room :) There are 5 or 6 elevators so I never waited long for one. Also, I really liked that when you pushed a call button, the sign for the elevator that was coming to you lit up meaning you didn't have to guess and run for it when it got there, nice simp touch that I haven't seen much. The good thing about staying in the club tower is that you have direct access to the gym and pool area from the elevators. My room was fantastic, definitely best in class compared to any of the others I've stayed in and amazing value. Real nice touches like lots of drawer space, shutters on the windows which can be opened along with the window which is a rare feature. The TV was huge and had may too many channels for me to be bothered hoping my way through The bathroom is well appointed with a corner bath with shower and lots of towels. All in all I was really impressed with the room. The Nikki Beach pool area is fabulous! Exactly what I was looking for. The only gripe was the lack of fully functioning beds. They obviously purchase the plastic frames very cheaply as the hinge on the back to prop it up to a sitting position was broken on many. That said I managed to find a good one every day and they are all fitted with thick mattresses so are extremely comfortable. The pool are is very cool indeed, I was really impressed by it. The pool bar is well staffed and not as expensive as I though it might be. There is also waitress service for food which again is pretty reasonable, decent quality and plentiful if a bit lacking in choice. I never went to the club but it looked amazing and will definitely visit next time when Im not travelling alone. There was no loud music from the club that I could hear at the pool, just soft rock/pop which was fine. The casino was surpassingly compact but I loved it. The staff told me it was almost doubling in size soon but I didn't find it lacked anything. I played the tables and slots and loved the atmosphere of the smaller casino. The only thing it did lack was waitresses who were hard to find sometimes. I never ate at the hotel as I like walking the strip at night. There are two main restaurants plus a few others for snacks and a 24 hour Starbucks. If I'm honest, the lack of food choice was disappointing but as you can easily get to Excaliber and it's free monorail to Luxor and Mandalay bay or cross the road to either MGM or NY NY so choices are massive all around you.

Nicole Marshall was superb in making our stay even more special (we were celebrating my big 50 birthday!) and her help and suggestions by email before our stay really added to the whole holiday. Plus she surprised us with a birthday gift of two tickets to see Gladys Knight in the hotel theatre which was amazing. Our intial room was not available on arrival and the only hiccup to our stay was that when we arrived at 9pm at night we were put in a smoking room in the Club Tower which still wasn't cleaned!! This meant us having to hang around for half an hour in the Starbucks coffee shop, a bit of a pain, but when we did get into our room we were surprised with two mini bottles of champagne and two enormous chocolate covered strawberries as a birthday treat! The room (18th floor) we had for our first night was lovely, but we did notice the smell of cigarette smoke in the corridor (not in our room though). The view was amazing, it had a large bathroom and two queen beds. The walk to the Club Tower wasn't bad at all, take any other reviews that moan about the 'long' walk with a pinch of salt. An extra 5 minutes walk along an internal corridor that has small shops either side and a coffee shop at the end and you're there! Nothing to complain about, some of the hotels we visited during our stay (MGM for example) were so HUGE you must have to walk for miles to reach your room! On our second day we moved to room 1826 on the 18th floor of the Paradise Tower. Another fabulous view - over the south end of the strip towards Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay. A huge room with a large king size bed, great flat screen tv, great toiletries in the large bathroom, loads of storage space and we also arranged for a coffee maker in our room which was lovely. The staff at the Tropicana were all incredibly helpful, polite and friendly, from check-in to concierge to maid service and everyone else in between. We ate at Biscayne at the hotel which was superb and I would strongly recommend, we also had breakfast twice in the small cafe there (whose name escapes me) but that was very good value. We played on the slots a fair bit and joined the players club which gave us some cash back with Tropicana's promotion at the moment. We were very low rollers but we had some fun gambling a little - I tried the roulette table once and my partner spent some time in the Sports Book and also managed to watch a couple of Manchester Utd games while there!! We didn't try out the pool but did have a walk around the area and it looked fun with space for everyone. We didn't try out Club Nikki or the Nikki Restaurant but they both looked pretty buzzing. I'm trying to think of any downsides to our stay, but the only one I can think of is really petty .... ie. the shower water pressure wasn't as good as I'd like but nonetheless I had a good shower every morning!! For the price we paid the Tropicana was fantastic! It isn't a huge themed Las Vegas hotel with an enormous casino and loads of restaurants and theatres to chose from, but that's what we loved about it. It's smaller, friendly and even though towards the end of the strip near enough to the hustle bustle to only be 10 minutes walk to the centre of the action, but far enough away to escape the crowds and manic fun of the Strip!!

Upon arrival I was a little disappointed as there were 2 clerks at the check in desk but soon two more arrived and the line moved along.

We stayed four nights on the 11th floor. Being school probably just started, there were virtually no children around and the whole floor was very quiet. Our room had a view of the pool.

Bearing this in mind, the Tropicana is MIND BLOWING!!!! We had sooooo much fun there and it far exceeded all of our expectations!! Reviewing the place on its' own merits should be enought to convince anyone to stay here but one cannot help additionally comparing it to the surrounding hotels on the doorstep, where the Trop comes out on top, mostly. It is so much lighter, brighter, airy and more colourful & modern than the NY NY, MGM Grand and Excalibur, which, although much bigger than the Trop, all look strikingly dark and dingy and stuck in a late 80s/ early 90s weird cheesy time warp.

I mentioned a fridge at check-in and they brought one to the room straight away, and it was free of charge. There's a tip for ya! I could see that the bath didn't quite fit in with the rest of the room as it looked quite old-fashioned but it was clean and big enough for 2 people with a ledge to sit on so you could have a beer in the bath! The pool was fabulous. Although it's always packed you can always find a bed and it's really big. It was 100 degrees when we were there and we loved the super-cool temperature of the water. We arrived on Tuesday and there was music playing but it was at a nice volume, and it was sing-alongy & up-beat, new stuff and older songs too. But come Thursday, the dreaded Nikki Beach opened it's doors and it IS pretty annoying I must concede , especially since it seemed so totally unappealing to us, a teeny weeny little pool too small to swim in surrounded by loungers and beds where posers pout into their $20 cocktails, and yes it was ridiculously loud monotonous heavy-bass painfully cool 'non-music' that drowned out the 'normal' music. But it didn't spoil our time around the pool it was just slightly irritating. The casino looked massive to our naive eyes when we checked in but actually it is a lot smaller than the others. But it's still really big - how many slot machines do you need?? We don't play at the tables (we were there for a wedding, not to gamble, athough we had a go on the slot machines for a laugh) but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Gladys Knight plays there, Brad Garrett has a comedy club there and the restaurants always looked busy. We looked around quite a few of the other hotels and despite their more impressive sizes and greater choice of bars and clubs and restaurants compared with the Trop, I would choose the Tropicana hands down if I went back to Vegas. We got a really good price with Expedia, it's in an excellent location (wherever you stay on the strip whether north south or in the middle you will end up pounding the pavement anyway to get from one hotel/casino to another), the decor is sooooo pleasant and bright, the room was absolutely wonderful and the staff were very personable and efficient. Apparently the pool is the best in the price range soon. I think it is the best choice, no doubt. We loved it.

I've stayed in the MGM before and liked being at one end of the strip but I hated the MGM because it was just too big and didn't like the rooms. The view from the Tropicana was INCREDIBLE!! We were looking right at the MGM, NY and Excalibur and had a great view of the strip. I loved the tropical scent that was piped throughout the hotel, I could have sworn it was in the pool as well. The pizza/cafe in the hotel had fantastic food and for a reasonable price. Plus there was a Denny's nearby. I like laying by the pool so I did a lot of research to find a nice pool and this one didn't disappoint. Having said that, the area is nowhere near the size of the pool area of the MGM so when they start blaring the music from Club Nikki, mixed in with the music at the main pool (that I LOVED) plus a third section going, it sounded just awful and was not relaxing in the least. The only two \"big\" complaints I had was that, because we stayed the weekend, we didn't realize just how loud the music at Club Nikki would be, though the lady at check-in said that being on the 15th floor we should be all right. With the windows open it was like having the music right there in your room. With the windows closed you could still hear it very clearly, until 3 a.m. both nights. I know that you don't go to Vegas to sleep, but 3 a.m. is a bit late for me to be listening to blaring music. The second complaint was that when we finally made it to the pool I was happy to see how many available lounge chairs there were. Well, there was a reason they were available - they were all broken!! Having undergone a big reno, couldn't they have sprung for new chairs? I gave up after the 9th chair and just collected 3 lounge pillows which I used to prop up my chair. Not a big deal in the end, I was just glad to soak up some sun. :) Would I stay here again - yes! But not on a weekend. Maybe the sound was better in the other tower.

They offer sun beds and sun tents which were very affordable and we also found the drinks were also very affordable again cheaper than most of the other hotels!

Tropicana Las Vegas is one of the well talked about hotel/casino resorts on the fabulous Las Vegas Strip! It was my first trip to Vegas and of course my first time staying at the Tropicana. I chose this hotel because of the attractive decor. The warm color schemes and they had great deals for employees like myself through my job(Delta Airlines). From check in to check out, the front desk agents were welcoming and polite. They all were calm, and easy to talk to. They were very knowledgeable of their position, the hotel and could pretty much answer all of my many first timer questions. I felt so revived at the Tropicana, and so alive. Once I got to my room, it was like my own piece of heaven. It looked like a little beach cabana (lol) very clean, very cozy, very sexy. I honestly forgot I was in Vegas for a sec. The thing that stole my breath was the POOL! I have never seen such a beautiful pool side like the pools at the Tropicana. For some reason I believe that their signature color is white (the hotel building white too)! In the sun that pool looks electrifying, I'm talking blinded from its beauty. I read that it has the best pool in Vegas lol...I don't know how true that statement is but I'd like to see others try and compete. Key word TRY! Club Nikki...I honestly don't need to say anything else...but to words \"LOVE IT\"!!!! I didn't dine there however, but I did take a peak in the restaurants and if the food taste as good and the restaurants look, then you better believe you are in for a taste divine treat! The dealers at the casino were awesome. It was my first time at a \"BlackJack\" table and they weren't to busy to answer my questions.

My partner and I had informed Nicole that we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary (before arriving via email) and she upgraded our room with no extra cost. We stayed in the Paradise Tower which is very convenient as the lifts are just to the right of the lobby. The rooms were spacious and clean. Maid Service every day, Hair Dryer in the bathroom. Iron and Board in the wardrobe. IPOD docking Station, 40 inch LCD TV, Ice and Vending machine in the corridor. Beds were very comfortable and there were extra pillows in the wardrobe if needed. We had a view of the strip. The Casino was very airy, bright and clean - not dark and dreary like some of the other Casinos we visited. Having never visited Vegas before I thought I might be intimidated in the casino but the dealers in the Tropicana were friendly and willing to teach you how to play. And the waitresses were quick back with your drink unlike other Casinos. The pool area had plenty of beds and a great pool. There was a bar there also. I didn't attend Club Nikki as I thought it might be for the younger trendier crowd and the music was kinda loud and not my scene, but for younger visitors this might be ideal as i heard it is a great experience there also and they usually have celebrity guests. We only ate in the Pelligrino near the Pool as we were out for dinner most nights and the food and staff there were great. The location of the Tropicana is perfect, it is at the top of the Strip across from the MGM and New York New York, it is very easy to get around and there is always cabs at the door, and the walk ways are near. We walked around most of the hotels on the strip and I was always happy to come back to the Tropicana it has a great atmosphere and great people working there.

Rooms are clean, bright and have all the amenities you will need. The pool area is actually larger than some of the newer resorts. The casino is smaller as well. The service was excellent. It's at the south end of the strip near the airport and right across from the MGM. The price was right as well. Book as far in advance as you can. I booked 90 days in advance and got an amazing rate for each of the three nights I stayed. There is a $9.99 daily resort fee which cover's wifi in the room plus some food and drink incentives.

The food was pricey for that type of service ($11 for a club sandwich - no chips, or anything served with it).

Myself and my partner travelled to LV for 3 nights in July 2011. We were joining a group of people who were staying in this hotel, so we didn't need to look elsewhere on the strip for alternatives. We booked through lasvegas.com and got a rate of $60 per night (although the $15 resort fee/per night/per room was additional to the $60 as is standard with all of the LV strip hotels I believe). The first thing that hits you as you approach this hotel is the smell of coconut; somehow the fact that the hotel pumps this tropical scent throughout the aircon had failed to register with me prior to our arrival. After a few days we just became accustomed to it. The rooms were not overly luxurious; the bathroom was quite basic. But the beds were comfortable and the hotel had all we could ask for, at what I still think was a decent overnight rate. The breakfast buffet was about $20 per person, which also seems standard enough in Las Vegas hotels. The hotel concierage desk helped my organise a helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon prior to our arrival, we secured a rate which saved us more than $200; we flew with Maverick and I have to say although it was pricey it was well worth it. There is a starbucks inside the hotel, and it is within walking distance of CVS pharmacy and Ross etc on the strip. The outlet malls are well worth the visit, I went to the one south of the strip which was about a $15 taxi ride, although I do believe there are buses you can take which are much cheaper. Overall I was very happy and would certainly stay here again, but if you want to be more \"in the thick of it\" I would suggest staying further up the strip.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cranbrook, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Newly renovated rooms\u201d", "Author": "Dawn B", "ReviewID": "UR118019923", "Content": "The rooms in the Tropicana have been remodeled into a South Beach theme.

The suite was very tastefully decorated Vegas hotels. The Tropicana consists of the Paradise Tower that is nearer to Las Vegas Blvd., AKA, the Strip, and the Club Tower sits farther back. Some readers have complained of the \"walk\" from the Club Tower, but because the Trop is a more intimate property, it really is nothing compared to the walk one would have to your room from many main towers of the other hotels in town. Also, if you book a Club Suite that faces the Strip, the panoramic views of the Strip from your suite are some of the best in Vegas. I would avoid the rooms facing the back of the Club Tower because these face the airport-although I suppose that because the rooms themselves are so nice, it would not matter to many people. The staff is excellent. Although everyone there was great, the front desk supervisor Gerard was gracious and understanding and our server Ryan at Nikki Cafe was wonderful. Nikki Cafe is one of the restaurants on the property and we enjoyed breakfast there every morning. The interior design of the Cafe is gorgeous from the bamboo ceilings to the lacquered wooden tables, to the Maori-inspired accents. It could easily be found in an Amanresort. There were several small nits with the Trop--most related to the music that they play. The music is too loud, espcially in Nikki Beach and by the Pool. Another issue is that the outside \"club\" called Nikki Beach plays different music than the rest of the pool area, creating a crazy cacocophony that detracts from house nice the pool area is. The music should be toned down and coodinated between Nikki Beach and the rest of the pool area. I love all kinds of music ( rock, metal, blues, jazz) and do not mind a good amount of volume but the volume here was over the top. All in all though, I recommend the Tropicana for its freshly renovated rooms, great staff, and for some of the other design features such as Nikki Beach.

Its not much to ask a staff member to say Welcome to Las Vegas - its not like they were that busy! Long walk to the tower we were in so I would say ask to be in the Paradise tower if you can! Not many restaurants - we ate at the steak restaurant but it was expensive for what we got! Now I have to say I was in contact with Nicole in advance and she was very friendly but her staff didnt follow what she had added to our booking and I had to sort that out myself. If Im being honest I expected a little more but at the same time I was happy to stay there and for the price we paid it was great value! If I was staying in Las Vegas again I would probably spend more and stay in The Venetian as this was the nicest hotel we saw when walking in and out - but of course Tropicana doesn't claim to be one of the fancier hotels so as they are in different price ranges this would just be my preference.

Each room had a fab view of the strip with New York New York, the MGM Grand & Excalibur within view. We each had 2 very comfortable double beds, a flat screen hd tv & an iPod dock. A good size wardrobe aswell. The room was huge by US standards & the bathroom was a good size with a shower & bath tub. I will say that there was a bit of grime around the seal of the bath, certainly not enough to put you off though. We didn't experience any noise which conisdering the pool was directly below us was good. I think the opening times for the pool were good (9am-7pm) as it meant there were no issues with noise whilst you were asleep. The wifi was also very fast.

We didn't use the pool but it looked very clean & well kept. We also didn't go to Club Nikki although the pool parties at the weekends looked really fun! Check out was a breeze, took less than 5 minutes & they store luggage if you have a late flight.

(they also failed to remove empty coffee cups from the room) However, beds were made daily & they did mop the floor when I had an accident with the shower! We had 3 or 4 pizza house menus pushed under the door at night. Something I felt a bit uneasy about. The shower was good but difficult to use at first. You have to pull the handle out & twist!

At the Tropicana when I asked for two beds there was no problem and no extra charge. I also asked for a strip view on an upper floor and got those also, with no additional charge. We arrived four hours before check-in but since there was a room available, which met all of our requirements, they let us check in early--again no charge. On the day of our departure we asked for a late check-out, which they gave us and again no charge. After all of this they asked at check-out if they could have done anything else to make our stay more pleasant. This is great customer service!!! The room was on the 12th floor and overlooked the pool and part of the strip. I was a little concerned because I had read in some reviews that the pool could be pretty loud, although we heard nothing. That may have been because we were not there during a weekend. The pool area is great with plenty of room to move away from the crowd near the pool and find some trees for shade. Our room was clean and well appointed. When we were checking in a lady was pushing a rug cleaner past our door and asked if we wanted the rug cleaned. It looked great to us so we passed.

We booked 2 paradise rooms and were not disappointed with them. Both rooms had a king size bed with one looking at the strip and the other overlooking the pool area (including Nikki Beach). The rooms were very clean, the beds extremely comfortable and for 2 people the rooms were huge. One of the things that was great about the hotel is that we didnt have to walk miles back to the room, or walk throught the casino when returning to the room which is really refreshing for a Las Vegas Hotel. Rooms - Spacious, clean and well maintained. Shutters were at the window instead of curtains which was great and the bathrooms were large and well equipped. The shower had multiple settings which was great to wake you up in a morning. Hotel Amenities - Good selection of food options, with both lower and higher end of catering options available. We used Pellegrinos quite a few times and the pizza and sandwiches were huge and well priced. Some shopping options available which were convenient but if you are looking for clothes bouitques you need to go other hotels or shopping centres. Everything clearly signposted except for the toilets over by Nikki Beach nightclub entrance which were very confusing, and resulted in more than one lady going into the gents toilets! This needs to be looked at and would recommend seperate signs indicating which toilet is for which sex. Pool - This was lovely with music played each day around the area. Nikki beach can be a little loud (we were there for the Labour Day celebrations but it didnt disturb our sunbathing) but the pool is large and so quite spots can be found. Towels were plentiful as were the sun loungers, and were able to get a sunlounger at anytime in the day. Pool was ice cold but certainly cooled you down from the 107c temperatures that they were having whilst we stayed there. We were able to take our own food and drink around the pool although a pool bar was available if you decided to purchase there. Location - Ideally located on the strip with NYNY, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, MGM and Monte Carlo all within walking distance. Also the hotel is located at the begining of the Deuce bus route ensuring that travellers are able to get a seat, although be aware that express buses do not stop here which was a little frustrating. Special mention needs to go to both Nicole Marshall and Joseph Phillips who both helped to make our trip even better by providing assistance in advance of us arriving.

There was time where it was warm in the room, despite the window blinds being closed and the a/c turned all the way down. It was over a hundred degrees outside during the days though, so that might have had a lot to do with it. Also, during the days, you could hear the bass from the Pool Music in the room.

We scored a 20% off promotion from their website, so we got an amazing price for this freshly reno-ed property. A coconut smell greets you when you walk in, which is kind of cute, and as another poster mentioned, better than the smell of smoke! We had a Deluxe City View room with a view of the Luxor, and it was perfectly clean with a great bed and lots of room. The one thing it lacked was a bar fridge. We spent several afternoons loafing around the pool, which was nicely laid out with lots of deck chairs. The $16 price tag on the sippy-cup margaritas and mojitos at the pool bar is a bit steep, but in true Vegas tradition, they do pour about 4-5 oz of booze in each one. Also, the pool had a pretty noticeable scum ring on the tiles the first day we got there (a Wednesday), but after that it was cleaned. The music (played throughout the property) was oddly pedestrian - I heard maybe three songs I hadn't heard before in the entire week we were there? The fitness center is pretty tiny, but I guess you're meant to get more exercise walking the strip? I liked the diversity of the crowd at the Trop - a good mix of kids, older folks, and young people meant that no one felt out of place.

We stayed at the Tropicana and we were impressed with the hotel room overall. The bed was great, super comfortable. The room safe was a great touch being I brought my lap top, it was large enough for my camera and my 15\" computer with room to spare. The T.V. was a good size flat screen, 42\" from the look of it, even though I only turned in on once. The only part of the room that I didn't like was the bathroom, the bathtub and shower are combined and the shower head is rather low. My girl friend didn't have much of an issue but any one over 5'10'' would have to duck down to get their head under the water. The pool was great, I can see why it was rated the best in Vegas, nicely away from the Strip I didn't even hear any traffic. The fitness centre was decent, with a ten or so workout machines, some free weights and cardio machines. The casino was smaller than some other casinos but nice and not too smokey. The casino was very clean, a lot of effort was put into making sure it was a welcoming place to stay. We stayed in the Club Tower it was nice but walking to the far side of the hotel each time was annoying, especially after a long day walking the Strip. If I was to stay again I would pay the extra move to the front tower. The staff was good, we were able to check in early around 12:30 which we really appreciated and they were helpful in finding places on the Strip. We took a trip to the Grand Canyon to the South Rim, we got a good deal along the strip for $115 each. I first thought of going to the West Rim to see the Sky Walk but one of the tour sellers that sold both tours informed me that you can't take pictures on the walk way and you have to pay extra to walk it anyway. The views from the South Rim will amazing and we got to see two different vantage points on our tour. It was a long day, eight hours, but I couldn't recommend it more. Freemont Street in the old casino district was my second favourite spot after the Grand Canyon, try and go early in your trip, we wanted to return again but ran out of time. The Light Show is really cool, the have a Zip Line you can ride and we went to the Golden Nugget casino and I won $100 when I signed up for a players card, but most only win $5. Get the bus pass for 24 hours to travel back and forth, it too far to walk, we tried! There is a great custom burger place in the restaurant section of the New York, New York, try the onion rings they were great. The buffet at the Excalibur and the Luxor were really good and affordable but I think the MGM had the best buffet I have ever been, my girl friend is a Chef and she was really impressed but it cost more than the other ones. The walk along the MGM, Paris, Planet Hollywood side of the strip is much faster than the NY/NY, Beligio, Treasure Island side of the strip. The MGM side you can walk across the street at most crossings but on the NY/NY you have to walk across sky walks and it is a lot of up and down stairs. I had a great time and I hope this review helps.

A must see for all!! I loved it, and the staff in this hotel and most other hotels made us Brits feel extremely welcome. The Tropicana Hotel where we decidede to stay is clean and airy, you may notice due to all the white decor it is actually not as overwhelming as some of the other hotels, which we liked, because it meant we felt more relaxed when we arrived back at our hotel in the evening. We didn't unfortunately try any of the restaurants in the evening simply because there was so much choice out on the strip when we were out exploring, however me & my partner did try the breakfast buffet at Nikki Cafe for $18 approx each, this was very nice, though you can find breakfast buffets on the strip for quite a bit cheaper, however we found a lot of the more popular buffets had very long queues, and at nikki cafe we were always seated straight away. We went to the Nikki Beach pool party on Sunday 28th August which was great fun, I would strongly recommend anyone go who is over 21 and likes lounging/swimming with table service (there was a minimum spend of $100 between the two of us for our choosen bed) and live DJ. There was a great atmosphere, and everyone including the staff were friendly. The casino isn't as big as some of the others, but as first time holidaymakers in Las Vegas, this just made the tables more approachable to us (We are not big gamblers). We were very pleased with our stay at the Tropicana, and have no regrets booking with this hotel since it was excelent value when we compared its standards (comparable with the other large hotels) against the price you need to pay to stay at some of the other hotels on the strip, however where ever you finally choose to book, it is difficult to get poor service in Las Vegas anywhere (maybe just avoid Imperial Palace which looks like it could do with a renovation).", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cMade our Anniversary Very Special\u201d", "Author": "PhxFan", "ReviewID": "UR117609076", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a combination business/vacation trip which happened to fall over our 10th anniversary.

Room service was very speedy, food was just ok - could do with improvement. The poolside was ok, but you really have to be in Nikki beach to have a good time, the music is very loud and the pool crew is all 18 to 25, very much like a nightclub and looked like everyone was an awesome time, I felt a bit old going in there (I'm 31). The casino was nice, Trop has 2 craps tables and the craps dealers were friendly, the waitresses were also very friendly and quick with the free drinks (just make sure you tip them a couple of bucks!

They were as excited as could be and couldn't wait for the fun. Check in was quick, 10 minutes and off to our rooms, they were clean at first glance and very nice. But I found a penny and a few broken potatoe chips, against the foot board on the one bed and wondered how long it's been there and how long it would stay. Guessing the vacuum doesn't get used much, if there's nothing obvious laying on the floor. Beds were great, towels and basic's were just what we needed. Room view was over looking Nikki Beach, loud thumping music all day, but hey I can live with it. Went site seeing the first night son #1 bought a water at casino store when we got back and on our way to the room($2.50) we watch tv and call it a nite. Friday morning, I hit Starbucks @ 6:30am, call family down at 8:30 and hit Sugar Factory for breakfast, come back to get a few things to go to Factory Outlets to go shopping, but #1 son left his 350 dollars and I.D in a white bank enevelope on the dresser, but when we return for his money, it's no where to be found (cleaning service hasn't been here yet OR SO WE THOUGHT) turns out the pre-inspection lady makes rounds first and enters rooms to schedule room cleaning !!!!!! So she was the only one in our room, admittely, ut that means nothing, they tell us !! Never heard of this, but thats how they do it. So we tear this room up-side-down, no money, no I.D., no envelope. Find tons of place's they dont clean though !! Call security, because there's absolutely no doubt where it was, and where it isn't. But you may as well, throw it all on black and take a chance with roulette instead, because they could care less that it's gone. I didnt expect them to call in the FBI, but give me more then 2 minutes and at least act like you care, because security was really in a hurry to get back to the casino to watch all the honey's walk in and out the pool area. So they had me fill out paper work describing it, because they really could care less, and they'll let us know if something turns up. So fault one: stupid son's stop being so trusting hide your money, fault two: use room safe, up to this point, I didnt even know we had one, but I learned, fault three: just make my own bed (and dont worry about vacuuming, their not doing it anyway) and let a message on door do not disturb and leave old towels outside door, and have them put new towels in a bag outside door. I learned to let no one in that acts like they cant speak English. Any how, very few people are in the pool, when we stayed at the Flamingo, everyone was in the pool. But with the temps at about 105 it's too hot not to get in, but the pool water is shockingly cold, and if you watch everyone get in, they are surprised and really dont stay in the water very long. I'm not sure what the water temp is but It must be colded through some refrigent system, the water temp has to be in the 70's and it is almost to cold and no one stays in, Didnt hit club Nikki, had to be 21 to go in there and act like your something. Drinks were probably double the price in there, I paid $7.00 dollars for a Bud Lime, $12.00 dollars for a icy slushy rum drink for my wife and $8.00 dollars each for 4 no alch-drinks. Water was $6.00, but they'll give you 2 glasses of water free, but ONLY 2. So yeah we're talking $47.00 dollars for one round, me I'm thinking it's crazy, and appariently so did other's, because most people I saw had mugs that they took to their rooms to re-fill, thank good-ness I couldnt get my kids into Club Nikki It would have probably been much higher. Almost forgot, when daughter went with me to buy the drinks, the guy from behind the counter asked if she was 21, I said no! so he says she has to get away from the bar, which doesnt look like a bar, it's looks like a mini-pizza, restaturant, soda-beer stand. Well she didnt move quit fast enough for him so he YELLED, GET AWAY FROM THE BAR !!!!!!!!!! Litterally SCREAMED IT, I said relax dude! there's no sign that says this is a bar, and nothing painted on the ground to say stay behind. Very Low Class, I wasnt impressed with the a-hole and lack of respect for people, but most are tourist, and he could really care less. So as a test I had my kids stand at the craps table's to see how long it would be before security made us leave because they were under 21, and after watching for 25 minutes and security standing 20 feet away,,,,,,,,,no one ever said a word....I thought this was funny. So U have to go to the BAR to get your under 21 adult a soda, they can not go for it ! Anyhow, seen alot of people go in there (Club-Nikki Gate) and alot come out, it's geared to the youngings, not the gambler types that these place's were built on, very few of these kids going in there were in the casino, but then again Tropicana probably made alot on their drinks. Basic small coffee at starbucks 3.50, scoon's were same 3.50. Besides that didnt eat here, they could actually use more restaturants. Be prepared for a country hike to park your vehicle, walk to the front door, thru the casino, across the cat walk (over the pools) to the elevator's, and to your rooms. Ok, it's not bad, but if you do it a few times, you'll learn to hate it. (I'm not opposed to excerise, I run everyday......ran my first 26.2 mile marathon May1,2001) But do the walk a few times, gotta be better enterance to Club Towers, but not according to security. Over-all, nice place. Nicer then it's was previous years, but nothing special. Being from the east coast and only getting here once a year, I would stay somewhere else to just check the place's out. But so far Tropicana is in the middle of the road of place's I'd stay. Also 5 dollars craps during the week, 10 dollars on weekends,,,,,,,,left ahead for a change !!!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fremont, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable\u201d", "Author": "Ann F", "ReviewID": "UR117395274", "Content": "Overall stay was very nice.

I also noticed little details such as the shading that had been put onto their windows to help with the amount of sun that comes into the room. It neared 110 degrees when I was there so the shading really did help with keeping the room cool while having the blinds open. Overall, I am completely satisfied with the room we stayed in.

Pools is Vegas are definitely a personal preference, Trop's pool was nice, but not my favorite Enjoyed Vodoo at Rio and Ceasars a little better. There's not a lot of dining options in the Trop, but your such a close walk to any of the other properties it really wasnt a issue for us. In summing up the review, I guess I'll say Ive been to Vegas close to 20 times, some for work so for fun.So a lot of where you decide to stay comes down to your preference. Overall our stay was really good, I would stay again if the price was right, just not sure if it would be on the top of my list of places to stay on the strip.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "kwatts1", "ReviewID": "UR117188574", "Content": "It is so much brighter and more modern than others on the strip.Servicewas excellent and so were the rooms.

Our club room (2 Queens) had a nice set-back view of the strip. Our club room (1 King) had a worse view of the airport, but also mountains in the distance. I slept soundly at night because the beds were comfortable and the rooms were surprisingly very quiet. I appreciated the IPOD alarm clock. It would have been nice to have a mini fridge and coffee maker, but there is a Starbucks near the elevators. The walk from the lobby to our Club Tower room was quite long, but I think that's to be expected at any strip resort. Unfortunately the escalators were broke a few times, which made our walks even longer. The rooms are decorated very tropical and pretty, but the bathrooms aren't so great. We had problems with the toilet and the floors were cracked so they appeared to be dirty. Showers were miserable because the shower head was so so so low! After a long day/night of walking down the strip, I was so uncomfortable having to bend down to wash my hair. If you are short, than this isn't a problem, but at 5'10, I could only comfortably wash my stomach while standing up straight. Hopefully they do bathroom/shower updates to this hotel soon! Customer service was great and very understanding, no complaints there. We didn't try any of the restaurants because they looked too expensive, but they were decorated nicely. The pool area is really nice, with good landscaping and plenty of space. Also, Nikki Beach (which has a cover) keeps the rowdy partying crowd separate from the more low-key relaxing main pool. Everything seemed to be very clean. I liked the location of the hotel. Across the streets from MGM, Excaliber and New York. It's near the beginning (south side) of the strip but still close to all the action and walking distance to many places. We were able to walk to the Mirage in nearly no time at all and bought a bus pass ($7/day) to get to the outlets and fremount street at night. To be honest, I'd probably stay somewhere else next time I go to Vegas, either splurge for a 4 or 5 star, or visit one of the more extravagantly-themed hotels on the strip (cesar's palace was so beautiful!). But this is definately a nice place that I'd recommend, especially for a good price.

Usually, I'll roll with the flow. This trip [Oct 14-17, 2010] was disappointing on numerous levels. CONSTRUCTION - I know they were updating the Trop. New pool coming in, etc. It was an inconvenience but I could have worked around it. Not that big of a problem. SPORTS BOOK - Hopefully they have one, now. Again, I worked with it and just went to Ballys. THE PARTY NEXT DOOR - We had 2 rooms. 1 room was the g/f and daughter. I'm in the other room. Same tower but different floors. Turns out they rented the room next door to someone who was having a birthday. I'm assuming, since the party was in the room, the birthday was not #21 or they would have been having it in the bar area. Have you ever pulled up next to a car that has the bass turned up so loud that it vibrates your own car? Well, that's what was on the other side of the wall from my bed. I figure \"hey! its Vegas ... they can have a little fun\". So, I put up with the yelling, screaming and loud music til midnight. Called the front desk and asked them to have things settle down. Which it did ... for 20 minutes til the alcohol took over again. At 2:00 AM, I demanded a different room which they provided on the opposite side of the hotel. So, about 3:00 AM, after dragging my stuff through the lobby to the other tower, I get settled into a handicap room. After a few hours of sleep, I ask to be put back into my old room [since it is closer to my g/f's room]. They tell me they can't do that because it hasn't been cleaned yet. I explain that I'm well aware of that fact since I'm the one who has been staying in it. That logic was lost on them. Now, I've stayed at the Rio a couple of times, the Imperial, even the Westward Ho way back in the day and this was by far the worst place I've stayed.

Despite having to wait about 20 minutes in a queue for check-in, we were impressed that we were able to access our room immediately (we arrived at the hotel earlier than expected at 11.30am). This enabled us to get straight out to the pool which is a nice area, with a good mixture of sunny and shady spots for relaxing and catching a few rays. There are plenty of sun loungers which are allocated on a 'first come, first served' basis. If you're willing to run up a big bar/food bill you can reserve one of the comfy 'double beds', some right by the pool (they expect you to spend $100 which isn't too difficult if there's two of you and if you're intending to stay all day it is worth doing - we really enjoyed it). The pool area gets very busy, particularly over the weekend. The rooms at the Tropicana have been nicely refurbished with some pleasant touches like an alarm clock with an ipod dock. The air conditioning is really quiet so you can keep it on all the time without it disturbing you. There's no fridge or coffee making facilities, so if you want a coffee in the morning you have to trek down to Starbucks. No big deal but it wouldn't hurt to have a coffee maker in the room. The beds are really comfortable and the room itself is spacious with a well designed bathroom area. We asked for a quiet room, away from elevators and ice making machines, and we were very happy with the allocation. The only downside is that the walls are thin which means you hear a lot of what is going on next door!!!! That said, we liked the Tropicana. It is unpretentious and good value for money.

It was my wife's birthday and we decided on the the Trop to see the new face lift. The rate was about average for this type of proerty on the Strip. We could have stayed at several others on the Strip for the same rate. We saw the reviews about the service and how stealler it was. We did not experience this. We experienced typical LV service. They have signage demanding checking your baggage. We did this nly to turn right around and have to tip the guy and get our one piece of luggage back after checking in. Checking in: There as no wait which was perfect. The gal that checked us in was not pleasant. She wasn't very accomodating. We informed her that we would NOT be using the pool, the WifI, the phone or fax and certainly not utilizing \"2 for 1\" over priced drink coupons. We were there to gamble and that's it so we did not see any merit in paying the \"resort fee\". She advised that EVERYONE pays it regardless. This simply is not true. There are many on Tripadvisor and other travel blogs that state they were forgiven on the resort fee. I also asked her about an upgrade since this was my wife's birthday. She said the ONLY rooms that face the Strip had two double beds not a King. We thought that made no sense and again was probably not true. Then she did not put us in the Paradise Tower. Not a real big deal but it would have been nice to not have to walk so far to our room. The hotel/casino did not seem to be all that busy so I doubt they were \"booked\". Their casino is not very big and we did not do very well there. The promotion they run is basically advertising that you will lose. It is not a very attracative promotion. A promotion is supposed offer a few bucks in free play to get you interested and gambling. The facelift to the property was pretty nice, much better than it was previously. The room was okay, clean enough but we had to ask for a box of tissue and towels, which we received with no issue. The bathrooms were only halfway upgraded. The shower was ample but old and hard to turn on. not to mention it seemed to have a shower head height designed for people shorter than 5 feet tall. I am under 6 feet and had to duck under it to take a shower, rather strange. The bathroom amenties (shampoo and soap) was generic and didn't smell very good. It stayed pretty quiet during our stay so we give that a thumbs up. They have a Starbucks kiosk at the elevator of the tower we stayed in so that was convenient. Cafe Pelligrino we thought was very good, their prices are about average for Vegas as well. We thought the pizza by the slice was awesome as were their breakfast items. The service at the counter was very pleasant. The food we had was fresh. We did not try any of the other restaurants on the property. We did like the location however, South Strip is not bad at all. Plenty of other casinos adjacent. We did well at Bally's and the Wynn when it came to winning money. Overall we think the Trop LV is about average. We would probably ot stay here again for the rate we paid and due to the lack of customer service by the check in desk. We hope their scalping of $22.00 in resort fees is worth losing repeat customers. Had they not forced us to payf or something we did not care to use, we might consider staying again and giving recommendations. Attitude is a big deal to us and we tought the gal at the front desk did not show much in terms of customer service or hospitality.

We were first in line and there were five people at the check in desk but they ignored us for at least 15 minutes. They chatted with each other and studiously ignored us. Finally one of them checked us in and was at least nice to us face to face. Later we went to get our players card and the women working in this area were quite rude and acted as if we were imposing on them by asking them to explain their policy to us. Our room was nice and clean but had NO extras. No coffee maker, no microwave and no refrigerator. There was a hairdryer that barely worked and an iron that we didn't use. Oddly, the second day of our stay, a refrigerator magically appeared under the desk but it was in an odd position and made it hard to use the desk chair. The other REALLY bad thing was that the toilet wouldn't flush. Since we didn't spend much time in the room and when we were in the room, it was quite late, we just dumped a bucket of water into the toilet to get it to flush and that worked. When we checked out, we told the man at the front desk about the toilet and he did refund our resort fee. As far as the location, it is at the end of the strip so there is a LOT of walking or taxis. Another thing was that there are very limited options for dining late at night. For a city that stays up all night, you'd better not get hungry. We ate at the small cafeteria and it was horrible.

There is a poolside bar and Club Nikki looks cool(did not get to visit). They have done a great job with renovating the interior and exterior. The Trop has been around since before I was born and when I visited it(casino only) in previous years it was very tired looking. I think they have come a long way and are going in the right direction. There are still some renovations underway and I am anxious to visit again to see what it will look like when they are finished.

After a stay in December 2010, I was very comfortable in selecting The Tropicana as the hotel for our guests because of our wonderful first experience. My husband and I stayed in a Paradise Suite in the Paradise Tower, just steps from the strip and all the action of the Casino. The room was spacious for entertaining (complete with mini fridge and coffee maker) and the bed was extremely comfortable. Thomas at check-in set the tone for a fantastic trip with his friendliness, humor and helpfulness. He advised we'd been upgraded to a Paradise Suite and wished me a Happy Birthday. The staff at the Tropicana go above and beyond to make the guests of the hotel feel special and appreciated. Every single encounter we, or our friends, had with staff was a pleasant experience. Everyone commented on how impressed they were with the Trop\u2019s team and how friendly and happy all the staff seemed to be. Another staff member we really enjoyed is Thomas the bartender. He makes an excellent mojito and remembers what everyone drinks. We always had a blast playing a little video poker while enjoying a drink and chatting with Thomas. He\u2019s friendly and hard-working. When the bar got busy, Thomas moved with lightning speed and put a smile on everyone\u2019s face! I was happy to see that the word is getting out there; the Casino was lively and busy during our stay and we had a blast at both the table games and slots. Drink service in the Casino was excellent! We were able to enjoy many of the hotels amenities this trip and just loved the pool. Stacie was wonderful and got us set up for a relaxing day in a cabana by the pool, a must-do for future trips! We enjoyed breakfast at Nikki Beach several days and had a wonderful dinner at Biscayne. It's pretty rare that in a group of 10 everyone raves about their meal, but that was definitely the case at Biscayne and once again, the service was excellent! A friend & I both had our hair done at The Tropicana's Salon......once again very friendly service and we loved the results! I feel badly that I've forgotten the name of the lovely lady that did our hair, but I was in a bit of a frenzy getting ready for the party; she worked the afternoon of August 7th.

Gifts were left at reception for my Mum & sister & a birthday cake was sent up on mums birthday. The Tropicana is smaller in comparison to the themed hotels but we loved this fact as the size of the other hotels is very daunting & easy to lose each other in whereas the Tropicana has everything close to hand & the pool is wonderful ! Nikki Beach is only open at wkends, not really my scene but looked really beautiful but can be noisey during the day if you sit too close to it but all you need to do is sit at the other side of the pool , problem solved !! Never went to the Nikki beach nightclub but a couple from our party did & they really enjoyed it, free champagne for ladies up till 12am !! Cant comment much on the restaurants as we only ate the buffet b/fast there once which although nice , was very small in comparison to the buffet at the Excalibur where you can get all day pass for $27 which allows you to eat there or the Luxor. Strabucks is open 24/7 which is great & the food at the deli was lovely if you wanted quick bite to eat. If your a steak lover you must try Gallaghers at New York New York !! The pool area is lovely , never any problem getting a bed , water is cold when you first go in but I think thats more to do with you going in from 110 degree heat !! There is a pool bar where you can also order food & you can also be served at your beds if you cant be bothered walking to the bar. Casino is lovely & bright , never had any problems getting drinks while gambling. The Amber lounge has a Happy Hour btw 4-6pm , excellent for half price cocktails :-) All staff are excellent and go out of there way to help you , best service I have had anywhere in the world.

We stayed in the hotel for four nights over the Easter weekend and it was my first time in Las Vegas. The hotel has apparently been refurbished very recently but our rooms seemed a little tired already. The bathrooms had definitely not been refurbished and could do with a bit of a makeover. The rooms were however clean and spacious and had a comfortable big bed. The pool area is really nice and was a mixture of families, older people and young people. The sun loungers and towels were free of charge with the room booking and there were plenty to go around. The pool area was clean with nice gardens around it. The pool bar had good service. The hotel has a couple of options for food which varied in price and quality but there was something to suit everybody. There are two Starbucks in the hotel and a couple of small souvenir and newsagent type shops. Check in was quick enough and we used express check out, so that only took a couple of minutes. The casino is bright, airy and scented with coconut, which was a nice change from the darker, smokier casinos. We played a lot of slots over that weekend and the machines at the Tropicana seemed the unluckiest for our group and also had the least attentive waitresses. I only managed to get one drink in the Tropicana over the whole weekend! Beware of the hotel telling you that you have free boarding pass printing. I had to go through a major rigmarole with the front desk to get passes printed despite requesting this a day before and emailing the pass to the desk. As I said at the beginning of this review, there isn\u2019t really anything wrong with the hotel, but don\u2019t expect to be blown away by splendour.

A real class act since we were honored to be sitting in the front row. I picked up a t-shirt from theTropicanan logo ship and they are true to size and are one of the better quality shirts. I am experineced in this area having collected over 100 t-shirts and over 100 sweatshirts from my stays in Las Vegas.

We completed the transaction via phone and the merchandise arrived at our steps in a matter of days. We are not getting anything from the hotel to completed this review.

We go to Vegas a couple of times a year and wanted to try a different hotel. First impressions were very good, it's a clean, modern hotel...not so big that you spend hours wandering around lost. The rooms are simple, but clean and modern. Having the ipod dock in your room is a nice bonus, but half the TV stations don't comi e in, not that you're in Vegas to watch tv. Upon checking in we got pulled into the VIP line and the lady who checked us in wasn't overly friendly. She confirmed that we asked for a non-smoking, king sized bed. We went up to our room and I could smell cigarette smoke...thought it might just be leftover because it's an old hotel. By morning I couldn't stand the smell anymore, so went downstairs to ask to switch rooms and was informed that we had been put in a smoking room. not good. I asked for an upgrade or something to compensate for the fact that I was stuffed up from the smoke and we had to change rooms after unpacking, was told that the hotel was full and we could switch to a non smoking room at 3:00. Not a great start to the trip. Other than that, the staff were great, very happy to serve. The pool was smaller than I expected, but nice enough. Considering the hotel was full, there were still plenty of chairs if you got down there before noon. Didn't try the Nikki beach restaurant, or go to the club Nikki. The bar in the hotel has amazing cocktails, so for sure check out happy hour. The location is much better than Luxor or Mandalay Bay, it's only a two minute walk into the MGM, which is good. and there's a bus stop right outside the hotel, so if you get sick of walking around, it's nice to just hop on. The bus stop will also take you to the outlet mall. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll stay here again. The price is good, but then they add on the $9.99 plus tax resort fee every day, so it adds up quickly.

This hotel has just completed at major face lift. It was very bright, clean, and welcoming. We loved the grounds and property. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful, as well as everyone else we came in contact with during our stay. This was our 4th time in Vegas and we enjoyed the smaller hotel feel as we found it faster and simpler to get around in. The Tropicana Hotel is in a great location, right on the strip, where the action is. This is our favorite end of the strip, we love it here. While we loved staying at the Tropicana, we also like to pop over to the Luxor, Excalibur, and New York, New York Hotels as well. Staying at the Tropicana makes it easy to do this as it is right across the street, and next to the MGM as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel to stay at. As an added tip to your Vegas stay, we really love the meals at the Pyramid Cafe at the Luxor Hotel across the street. We find the prices to be very reasonable here as well as great home cooking. This was our 4th year visiting the Pyramid Cafe as well. Don't forget about the shows in Vegas. If you want to conserve your money go to the 1/2 price ticket boothes at 10am for tickets that did not sell out for shows that coming evening. You will find a booth at the front of the M&M's store and one down at the Fashion Show Mall. Also make sure to visit Fremont Street, you'll be glad you did. The canopy light show on the world's biggest TV screen, plus the live entertainment, and everything else that goes on down there, is totally awesome. Not to mention also Fremont East with its old neon signs and Vegas's famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop from the TV show Pawn Stars being just around the corner. This area is a must to go to. This year, while in Vegas, we did the Scoot City Tour to Red Rock Canyon. We had a great day. Our tour guides were fantastic, the day was fun, and the scoot city scooter cars were awesome. I heard it said that you will look like a bunch of Skittles getting down the road, and that we did.. way cool! We really enjoy Vegas, it is a must to do at least once in a life-time.

They have done a fantastic job of renovating the place - the lobby is lovely and bright, friendly check in staff (no line at all), the hallways are really nicely decorated in a South American theme and the rooms are excellent - 10/10 (and I never give a 10!) Everything is and felt new - brand new carpets, furniture, bed, bathrooms - everything. Large screen TV, lots of hangers in the closet, a good hairdryer. There was no fridge- but I knew that going in and no coffee machine, but its no big deal. The buffet was great and is the only Vegas buffet that I know of that has an outside deck so you can watch over the pool and the waterfall whilst you eat. The staff could not do enough for us - some of the best I have ever dealt with they made us feel like we were staying in a 5 star resort. 2 things I did not like: 1. Pool. Now - the pictures are of the pool that you see all over the internet and one-third of it does look just like that - but those seats under the palm trees are never available. Turn around and the other 2/3rds of the pool is pretty much all concrete and row upon row upon row of tightly packed lounge chairs. I understand, its a large hotel, you need to have a lot of seats but this was like a school auditorium full of chairs - and don't forget - you can smoke anywhere in Vegas and we couldn't find vacant chairs not next to smokers. Also, the pool bar is just a pool kiosk (like at a post office) we were hopeing (since we didn't like our chairs) to seat at the bar for a bit until something else opened up - that was not possible. The swim up blackjack was closed all weekend (and this was 4th July) The adult pool is very expensive to get in, and when I peeked in, I saw the smallest square pool I have ever seen and a large bar, and chairs that are available to rent at very high prices. 2. The gambling. You cannot surrender, split more than once nor double down after splitting. Deals all hit on soft 17's. Basically, every player advantage that all the other casino offer (well, the 5 I went to on my trip) allow you to do that, so there were not many winners nor many smiley gamblers which was a bummer. Overall - I would go back for sure - I would gamble at a neighboring hotel and get to the pool really early to get a palm tree lounger!

We all know why...the much talked about renovations. There were a few disappointments but over all we had a great time. We stayed in the Paradise Tower in a Paradise Suite with a connecting 2 queen deluxe room. The location of the Paradise Tower was perfect. Easy access from the room to the casino, to the bridges leading to Excalibur and MGM. You'll enjoy this easy access while looking for affordable places to eat : ). After reading about the great service at Tropicana, I was disappointed with our check in. Without going into all the detail, I'll simply say we should have been called when the previous guests decided not to leave the room that was holding for us, and we weren't. Couple of comments about the room. Carpet in the suite was dirty to the point of being sticky in some places. Since we'd had the earlier hassle with check in, and we were finally in our room, we decide to ignore the carpet and get on with the fun part : ). I have no doubt that had we made a call, our carpet would have been cleaned, or we could have been moved. I was also surprised by the condition of the floor tile in the bathroom of both rooms. I'd read on TR about the tile being old and not having been renovated, but I never imagined it being as bad as it was. For some reason, the condition of hotel bathrooms are important to me, I understand that this isn't the case for everyone. I should add that the bathrooms were clean, it was just a visual thing. You can't beat the grounds around the Tropicana pool. I don't know of another location in Vegas where you can put your lounge chair under a tree on the grass near the pool. We're in our late 40's.....feel like we're still in our 30's, and enjoyed the vibe very much. We rented a cabana on two occasions. If you're going to spend the day at the pool, drinking and maybe eating, cabanas are the way to go. We like the casino and found a room with fun slots that paid us well. One night while one of us was winning $600 on WOZ (playing 70 cents a spin !), another in our group was winning over $500 at Deal or No Deal. Each night at least one person in our group won a significant amount at the Trop. The size, price and location of our suite in the Paradise Tower, along with the pool and cabanas will probably be enough to get us back to the Tropicana. My advice to others who are considering the Tropicana.....give it a try. Go there with an open mind, and don't 'expect' the special treatment that others mention in their reviews. Enjoy the location, the pool, the newly refurbished room, the bed (so comfy). And don't get hung up on the little things. No matter where you stay in Vegas with a room rate comparable to the Tropicana there will be some issue with the room, the service, the casino....

My only reservation regarding this hotel is in regards to their restaurants. While the food is very good, it is generally fairly expensive.

We always loved the pool and the late, lamented \"Follies\" show and were sad to watch the property slip into decay. Therefore, when we read about the makeover and the (mostly) positive reviews on this website, we thought to give it a try on our recent 20th anniversary trip. We are happy to report that we had a wonderful time from the minute we pulled up to the valet parking to the minute we left. Every employee we encountered was similing and took great pains to make us feel welcome (unlike some other properties where they act as if they are doing you a favor by taking your money). Check-in took all of five minutes, and luggage was delivered to our suite within minutes of our call to the bell desk. The corner suite with a strip view was huge and bigger than some apartments we've lived in. There were two large flat-screen TVs, a comfortable bed, a fridge and a brand-new bathroom. There were one or two minor flaws with the housekeeping (there were a few things left behind by the former occupants in the drawers) but in fairness to the housekeeper, there was a lot of space to clean and it seemed like she had to do the whole floor by herself. We do not sweat small stuff like that in any event. The casino was small but comfortable and easy to navigate. We found the machine selection to be adequate for a property of this size and the payouts to be on par with other strip casinos. The slot club personnel could not have been nicer and more accomodating and the current new-member promotion is easiily one of the best in LV at this time. After venturing across the street to see a show at the chaos that is New York New York, we couldn't wait to get back to the Trop. When we asked a security genteman for directions to the slot club, he insisted on walking us to it instead of just pointing. That's the kind of service one finds only in small midwestern towns these days and something that leaves an impression. We had some nice pool time and enjoyed a great brunch buffet at Cafe Nikki. While the selection of food may not have been as big as the buffets at the larger casinos, every item was first class, from the lox to the lime tarts. We are only sorry we did not have the chance to eat at either of their upscale restaurants, as they looked very nice and were reasonably priced. Other than that, my only regret was that we had to leave and didn't have time to sample the 2-4-1 margaritas at the tequila bar during happy hour. Some of our former LV favorites like Luxor have gone dramatically downscale while others have decided to aim for a demographic which specifically excludes middle-aged modest players like us; we are not, for example, going to be hanging around Club Nikki in our bathing suits pretending we are yound and rich. We are therefore happy to find another property with modest prices where we feel comfortable and welcome and look forward to our next trip.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cComfortable enough and cheap, but location was less than ideal\u201d", "Author": "jswan7", "ReviewID": "UR115917105", "Content": "We were looking for a cheap room for a long weekend in Vegas. I was enticed by the fact that Tropicana had just finished updating all of their rooms and were due to finish the new pool remodel by the end of April. They had the best combination of price and ratings, so I was hoping the pool would be mostly finished for our visit. Unfortunately, the best and largest part of their pool was closed for our entire stay, so that sucked. It is probably done by now and looked like it would be nice when finished. The casino has an odd smell. I think it's supposed to be coconut, but smells more like old pipe smoke mixed with sweet-scented tobacco- not very appealing in my opinion. They did a nice job remodeling the casino and rooms but, that said, you cannot change the fact that the ceilings are still very low in the hallways and rooms which reveals the building's true age and it does not look as nice as some of the newer hotels on the strip. The room was a LONG way from the casino, way in the back. We had a king-size bed that was very comfortable there was an adequate space for a large chair and table next to the bed and a nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was updated with nice, good quality fixtures/materials and my husband loved the large tub for taking baths. The showerhead was ridiculously low though for my 6-ft tall husband. It was ok for me at 5'6\". We had friends staying at MGM, so we did not spend much time in the casino or restaurants. There is a poor selection of restaurants available in Tropicana and only one that we saw open outside of dinner hours, Cafe Nikki. We had dessert there one night and it was very good. We had their breakfast buffet which was a very good price and they had a great selection. Food taste was average/adequate, but all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Coffee was very good and they included my latte with my buffet charge. Overall, our stay was fine, but I did not like how far we had to walk in order to go anywhere else on the strip and we were not really interested in spending our time in the Tropicana.

Im not too picky on hotels but this one sounded nice and we untimately picked it as we wanted lots of pool time. They recently renovated and we kept hearing that this was one of the best Vegas pools. Dont get me wrong...it was OK...the tiles were grimey along the inside of the pool and It just gave me a very bad impression right off the bat. My biggest complaint about the pool is that it closes at 7 PM!!! Seriously?!? The hot tubs were open 24 hours. Also they have a seperate pool for Nikki Beach that you have to pay admission to, they are seperated by a fence and the music was blaring over there so you all you could hear was the bass from that pool and you couldnt enjoy the regular music at the public pool! The casino is small...which I prefer but you cant EVER find a waitress for a drink! We only ate at the pizzaria and the food was OK and reasonably priced. One morning we did have to wait 20 minutes for a toasted bagel (guess they forgot). The hotel smells like coconut, which I liked, but 2 of my friends HATE the smell of coconut. I new about this but apparently they did not. They were both thankful that the rooms didnt have much scent. They beds were OK, lots of pillows, the bathroom was large enough. I dont think the AC was working properly...we turned it down as far as it would go (60) but it never really cooled off in there (some nights we got very hot). Every single day we had to call room service for more towels...4 girls need more than 3 towels! and there are definately not enough outlets in the rooms. Most of the staff was nice enough, but the girl at check-in didnt seem too thrilled to be there and didnt go out of her way to welcome us at all. We had a great view of the strip on the 18th floor. The elevators seemed very slow and every tiem you got in the same tropical song would start playing...after 5 days that was pretty annoying. I thought that being closer to the end of the strip would be quieter but Friday and Saturday nights we heard police, ambulance, or firetruck sirens about every 20 minutes! Probably wouldnt hurt to carry ear plugs if you are a light sleeper...and I had read before about the plantation blinds in the rooms...they are terrible! Most Vegas rooms have black-put curtains but these giant blinds did NO good at keeping light out especially since you are right on the strip with all of the lights. Since I knew about the problem I took an eye mask so it helped. I am hoping to go back to LV in Dec for NFR but I will definately not stay at the Trop again...Unless other hotels are booked and the Trop has some insanely great offer I just cant pass up. I was really looking forward to this hotel for a girls summer trip and was very disappointed! If you book here, be sure you are aware of the Resort Fee...what a rip off and $9.99 per day for things we never needec or used.

The Tropicana has a uniqueness about it in that the casino is bright, clean and fairly quiet as far as Las Vegas goes. Both the casino and reception areas are relatively small, the hotel isn't over run with shops, bars and restaurants either and I liked this much calmer atmosphere. We arrived fairly late on in the day but were still able to get an upgrade to a strip view room. This was fantastic, we were on a high floor in the club tower which gave an amazing view of MGM Grand, Excalibur, Luxor and New York New York. Rooms are very spacious, well decorated and comfortable. A safe is provided in the room free of charge. On arrival, the bathroom in one of our rooms didn't look like it had been cleaned so we rang reception who sent a maid up straight away. Very impressed by the responsiveness of reception in sorting this out for us. Pool area is of a good size, towels are provided by the hotel for use round the pool. Cabanas and super comfy sun beds are available for hire each day, there is no rental charge if you spend a certain amount on food/drinks throughout the day. Tunes are played by the pool during pool opening hours and make relaxing by the pool extra fun. Other plus points include free self-parking which once you find your away around the hotel is only a short walk (unlike other strip hotels where you walk miles to get back to your room from self park).

For example, we were upgraded to a mini-suite in the pool tower because it was our anniversary \"getaway\", although we had originally booked a deluxe room in the pool tower. The mini suite was spacious, and had a separate sitting area with a dining table for two. We truly enjoyed having the extra space and views from the mini suite. The room was clearly above average with amenities. Our two biggest thumbs up are for the bedding, (extremely comfortable and clean), and the television, (large screen plasma and excellent picture), and the soaking tub in the bathroom. The downsides to the room were the air conditioning and a faint unpleasant odor. The room never seemed cool enough to me, but my spouse thought it was fine. The halls and hotels have a great coconut/citrus smell, but our room seemed to have a constant, faint odor. We got used to it after the first day, and after that we only noticed it for the first minute or two after going into the room.

We really liked the light, airy feeling of the casino, and found the slots to be pretty good compared to the other casinos on the strip, (downtown slots seemed much looser to us), but the Trop casino was OK. The absolute best attraction of the Tropicana is the spread out and cool pool. Actually, not just the pool, but the service you get at the pool. Many, many kudos to the pool manager Staci for such a fantastic job setting us up in a cabana, and also to the staff who seldom let the glasses go dry and were making us feel welcome.

If you self park and come in via the rooms of entrance 5 do not be put off, they are not in use. I'm sure there will be something going in their place, maybe even new rooms? Everything is pretty much on the main floor, although there are shops and theatres on the mezzanine, which wasn't well signposted. Front desk: we arrived early bit were told we would get a call when the room was ready; we didn't but came back after some time at the pool and our room was ready ahead of normal check in. Whilst waiting though we were given dummy key cards so we could go to the pool so that was fine. The person who checked us in, Shonielle (? I think??) was terrific, she helped us out with everything we needed. You can also print your boarding pass for free at the machine in the lobby. The bell staff were courteous too. Casino: take advantage of the promo with $200 on them. It's complicated but worth it. I will say that when you use your free credit, everytime you win press cash out so you get your winnings. The free credit stays in the machine until you are done, so even if you win one dollar press cash out. Most waitresses were nice, although one in particular was not very efficient or pleasant. Facilities: this let's the place down a bit, there is a shop and a gift shop and stalls but not a lot on offer. There is also (although I have read differently on here) no buffet as such. For eating there are 2 high end restaurants and one very small, not cheap, but good food \"Food Court\". The gelato was excellent. Rooms: nice!! Very comfy bed, nicely renovated, a chaise lounge, a massive tv, decent bathrooms with shower and tub. Also nice tropical decor to the rooms and nice pieces of art. Terrific rooms and all less than 12 months old. Classy tropical would sum it up. Stayed in paradise tower (first one; recommend it as it is closer to everything) with a 20th floor view of Excalibur, Mandalay bay, Luxor.

After ignoring me for about 10 minutes, she finally decided to let me know she had not forgotten about me and she was looking for a room. I specifically emailed 3 times for a note to be taken down about my room and how I had a late arrival. Yeah, no one cared. Finally, she says she does not have my non-smoking, 2 queen available. INSTEAD I am forced to go into a smoking room (my friend as asthma) and with 1 king bed. They sent up a roll away bed for the night so my friend could sleep on that. The roll away bed would not fit in the room we were given and I had to rearrange the entire room so that my friend wouldn't need to sleep right infront of the door. The next day we got the room we asked for after having to wait an entire day for it. This ultimately ruined my plans to the outlet mall. This hotel needs to get their act together.

We were considering it but you could see it when you walk over the bridge and it never looked busy to me (night or day). pool - I wouldn't waste my money on nikki beach. The best part about this hotel is their pool. Lots of room, lots of loungers, bar servers, upbeat music. location - if you like to walk then no problem. this hotel is south of the strip so there is either a lot of walking or taking transit. My husband had a bad back so we didn't get to walk around as much as we had hoped to. monorail - NOTE the rail does not take you to Freemont. You are better off catching the express bus that will take you Freemont. Bus stop is very close to Tropicana. If you choose to take the monorail it is just next door at MGM. casino - not the largest but a decent size. table games are average and costs vary depending on time of day food - 24 hour cafeteria (great pizza, grilled cheese, and fries), starbucks on site, 3 restaurants.

It's about a $12-$15 cab ride from the airport and takes less than 10 minutes to get there. The location is great. There's elevated crosswalk access to the Excalibur which has a free tram connection to the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. NYNY is adjacent corner and the MGM Grand is the other crosswalk from the Tropicana. This gives you great access to either side of the strip to start casino hopping and sight seeing on the strip. The Tropicana is a clean property and we loved the palm trees all over. The pool area is really cool. There's tons of lounge chairs (free) and no hassle to grab towels. The pool has a very curvy design which we felt offers lots of room for guests to hang out (with a drink perhaps) alongside at the edge of the pool and chill. The casino itself is not enormous like other newer casinos. We didn't choose the Tropicana to gamble - we chose it to be a relaxing spot with a good pool to spend our days. We were on the 9th floor overlooking the pool area and towards the Hooters Casino & airport. Regardless of the view, the room was clean & the hallways have a sweet smell, almost like coconut or something. The place didn't reek of smoke and the room was clean, bed was very comfortable, had a nice 42\" flat screen tv, the bathroom was spacious and the shower was clean and had good pressure. We didn't pick the Tropicana for all the glamor that is Las Vegas. Pick it for the chill pool scene and nice rooms, staff and ease to get around the property and to the strip.

After surfing the reviews of the various hotels on the strip, we chose the Tropicana!! Great choice!!! Arrival check-in was easy, and desk clerk very helpful with our questions. The room was super clean, modern, and more than adequate size for my husband and myself. The bathroom was large, roomy and well lighted. Beds were more than comfy!!! Had a corner tub/shower combination for spacious and open for ease of comfort after being out in the warm sun or walking the Las Vegas strip. We would have really enjoyed a small refrigerator in the room, for breakfast snacks, and drinks...but, as with any resort we know the \"business side\" of not having them in room...It would had been a real \"convenience\" for quick breakfast before starting the day as well as for families with children to save money here to spend elsewhere... Thomas, a bartender at the Amhbar Lounge where we went for \"Happy hour\" was such a delightful individual... very social, friendly, and happy to everyone he greeted and served.... The Casino was light and bright.... smoke free, and spacious.... Not huge as \"get lost\" feeling as the other large resorts on the strip...just very very comfortable for all the activities between the tables and the slot area. We used the monorail across the street at the MGM to go to Harrah's for the Legion show... (9+) and walked the strip back to our hotel to take in the sights. We also saw the Mob Experience at the Tropicana and enjoyed the show staff personal involvement presentation and history detail during the tour. We also took a tour to the West Rim with the Skywalk experience through Las Vegas Sightseeing Tours/Greyline. Great day with stop also at Hoover Dam...Skywalk is truly an engineer's dream come true and so enjoyed the experience of the Grand Canyon below...Lunch was provided, their staff friendly and outgoing with \"all\" the number of people coming through. Food was very tasty we thought.... The resort buildings on the strip are amazing! So many new ones that have been built, with all the different designs, architectural detail, and the unending interior detail by each resort....one can spend days going through all them and just \"looking\"... Pretty incredible places.... My husband and I are little more conservative on pricing when eating out...Hotel restaurants were a little more expensive than what he & I wanted to pay, and walked the strip for other food dining choices which we felt more in line with our retirement budget... The restaurants were very classy and well designed and had many customers it appeared. So all in all, I would recommend the Tropicana and glad we chose the resort for our stay. Great fun time !!!

The bathroom was quite large for a hotel room which is nice but the drawback is the light switch is all the way in the bathroom and hard to find in the middle of the night-we went to K-mart and purchased a cheap nightlight which solved the problem.

I stopped into the casino mid-2010 and was surprised to see that the casino was brightened and slightly cleaner. When early 2011 rolled around I decided I would be one of the guinea pigs to stay in the \"New Trop.\" Eating my words, I checked in to a Paradise Suite that was alllllll the way back in the Club Tower.

I own a small company and we come out as a group several times a year for corporate events. The Tropicana is now our corporate hotel for all of our business when in Las Vegas as well as my hotel of choice for pleasure. I will be coming back this September with several employees and I am looking forward to staying with them again. I am so happy I took the time to write this review and share this experience, to often we do not take the time to talk about the good experiences we have instead of just the bad ones.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms with even better price!!\u201d", "Author": "WanderlustLuv", "ReviewID": "UR115575447", "Content": "I had a great time at the Tropicana!

I took off cover and left it for house keeping to see. They never did anything with it. I had to open window and bang filter to clean it. My daughter stayed in another room with spouse and they had to change several times due to odor in one and in the other they put them by the pool. The music was so loud they couldent sleep. They then had to move them again. I was very disapointed in the motel. I think it is another one that wasted their money on renovations. If they arent going to change some of the old habits in maintainence and cleaning then it will be another one to be imploded. People were unhappy and will stop comming back. And the parking situation was horrible.They don't have enough garage parking and lots of the other areas were for emlpoyees with un easy access.

I have been a bunch of time since then but this was the first since the recent makeover. The first thing I noticed was the white on the outside, making the appearance almost non-descript which I was about to find out was a metaphor. I used to love the old style Vegas feel of the place and the rough around the edges decor gave it a sense of history. The blue sign over the entrance has been changed to red with a new font and that stale smell of cigarettes, gambling and spilled drinks has been replaced by a coconut infused scent when opening those glass doors. Mores the pity. Don't get me wrong, the new look is great and if you hadn't been there on a regular basis beforehand you would find it difficult to complain. The casino floor is clean and bright, the rooms spacious and nicely appointed (with the possible exception of the bathrooms - functional and clean but shower/bath is still a bit old school). It just lacks a little soul. I didn't check out the new Nikki Beach set up - I am a bit old for that scene - but the new Cafe Nikki was nice and the breakfast buffet, sitting outside by the pool was great. The new Starbucks and snack bar was a Godsend, especially at 3am after a heavy night drinking and gambling. Free in-room Wifi and the helpfulness and attitude of most of the staff was also great making the whole package difficult to beat from a cost/benefit point of view, not to mention the superb location. Its just that it didn't feel like the Trop I knew. I think they have gone too far chasing a new crowd.

The elevators were quick and our rooms were beautiful, large, peaceful (which you need in Vegas for a little down time) and the BEDS were unbelievably comfortable! Do not forget to eat at Nikki Beach Cafe! The food was outstanding - truly! Everything we had was excellent and surpassed our expectations. The yellow fin tuna appetizer (though it was large enough to be a main) was spectacular as was the butter poached lobster bisque was so rich and decadent. You get a large bowl, so maybe share it! The buffet was excellent and if you eat later in the morning they add lunch items such as JUMBO shrimps, smoked salmon and beautiful salads. Breakfast and lunch for $17.99 - crazy. It also included juice, coffe, tea. I personally could have eaten all my meals at the Tropicana. We didn't get to try BIscayne but the menu looked delicious. The pool area was absolutely heaven. I really did feel like I had gone to a tropical paradise. Lots of grassy areas, lush landscaping, fountains and a lovely free form pool with shade available which was appreciated as it was 42 celcius when we were there.

Our room was a nice size, with a very comfortable bed and plenty of dresser and closet space. The only glitch to our stay was with the bath tub design. The placement of the shower head was much too low and the design of the bathtub lead to pooling water during a shower which puddled on the bathroom floor and all around the tub edge. Other than this minor glitch, I would very much recommend the Tropicana as a place to stay when visiting Las Vegas. It's close to the monorail pick up which is just right next door at MGM, and there is quick access to the street overpasses to both MGM as well as across the blvd to Excalibur. The staff is very nice and friendly and quick to help you with any service you may need.

Either they are stuffing the ballet box so to speak, or these reviewers need to get out more. The rooms are OK for the money, but not at all upscale. They are updated, but the bones are still old. Think plumbing that does not drain and hot water that is iffy. They could also be cleaner. The old adage about putting lipstick on a pig comes to mind. To me they are very similar to the \"go\" rooms at the Flamingo, yet the Flamingo is rated way down there. The pool is very nice, but the music is outrageous. It is way too loud, think hearing loss loud. Also if you are over 30 you probably won't enjoy the pool playlist. I spent 3 days at the Trop pool and I heard one song that I have on my i-pod playlists. Now, I consider myself a fairly mainstream guy when it comes to music. I have over 2,000 songs on my playlists ranging from 1962 to 2011. I enjoy rock, classic rock, pop, and country. What I do not enjoy is rap. The fact that I heard 1 song in 3 days that I would have on my playlist tells you all you need to know about the Trop pool music. Come on Trop management at least mix it up, people over 30 have money to spend too! The one area that I would give the Tropicana a 5 star rating is the service. The people are friendly and the serviced is great.

It included the limo ride to and from the hotel as well as a $100 food credit. The resort fee includes the internet. There isn't an extra internet charge. **We got the Penthouse Loft for $900 for 4 nights/5 days which is an outstanding deal as compared to the regular $3000 without the deal we got. From the beginning of our trip, we knew it was going to be a great experience. Our limo driver was cordial, very helpful, and answered all our questions. Our limo ride was pleasant. As soon as we arrived to the entrance of The Tropicana, we were greeted in a friendly manner. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30 p.m. The front desk ladies were very friendly and checked us in immediately. Our luggage was taken care of and would be sent up. We ended up on the 21st floor of the Paradise Tower. As soon as we walked in to our Penthouse Loft, we were pleasantly surprised. The room was beautiful. We didn't get the loft with the jacuzzi downstairs (probably because it was just my husband & me) but nonetheless, the room was amazing!!! The penthouse loft had a dining area, living room area and a bar area downstairs with a gorgeous view of the Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and New York New York. There was also a guest bathroom downstairs. There was a refrigerator and a coffee maker with delicious coffee. As we walked up the spiral stairs, we continued to see how the Tropicana has outdone themselves. We got to the second floor and immediately loved our soft King size bed. There was another TV upstairs. The master bathroom was huge and very clean! There was a jacuzzi overlooking the strip which looked beautiful at night. Our shower was huge and the bathroom included a toilet and a baday. The hotel provided amazing toiletries that we definitely used. Since we had the $100 food credit, my husband and I decided to eat at Pellegrino's. We ate pizza, chicken strips, burgers, soups and other treats. The food was good for the price. The cook and the cashier were very good with us and even remembered us going there for lunch every day the five days we were there. We would highly recommend trying their pizza. It was great! Also, the casino area is small but intimate. It has the popular slot machines and you can't beat the Tropicana play incentives. We liked the Tropicana because it was bright. My husband is legally blind, having only 4% of his vision and the brightness of the casino allowed him to still be mobile around the buildings and casino areas without assistance.

We had no idea that because Britney Spears would be in town that particular weekend, all the room rates (at just about every hotel) would be higher than usual, so I cant say that we got a killer deal on our stay. HOWEVER, when I contacted the hotel to ask if there was any possibility of a room upgrade because of our special celebration, I received a gracious email from Kennon Wolff, one of the managers, who did indeed upgrade us to the extent he was able (the hotel was almost to capacity) and also offered us complimentary show tickets to Recycled Percussion (A MUST SEE if you get the chance, it was alot of fun!) Our room was on the 19th floor and was beautiful, clean and had a great view. The bed was comfortable and we even received a phone call from the front desk after checking in to make sure our room was to our liking! We found ALL the hotel employees pleasant and helpful, all of them giving the impression that they truly enjoyed their job. One of our days was spent simply laying by the pool, and we enjoyed the music and variety of people there (meaning, yes there were \"the beautiful people\" but also middle aged folks like ourselves as well as families with children ----no reason for anyone to feel \"out of place\" like sometimes happens at other places) I dont know what the \"old Tropicana\" was like, but the remodled version is beautiful, airy, and completely amazing. We are not gamblers, so we didnt spend any time in the casinos except to walk through them to get where we were going, but I have to say that the Tropicanas casinos were the least smokey and brightest of all the ones we walked through......it was a pleasure not to be hit by a wall of smoke everytime we went somewhere on the property. They even pipe in a breeze of coconut-ty scent throughout the corridors, which I personally found fantastic---not heavy or cheap smelling, just gave things a tropical feel.

We upgraded to a Club Tower Spa Suite - worth every penny! The suite had a separate living/dining area with a wet bar and 2 piece bath. The bedroom was huge and included a Jacuzzi. The main bathroom had a his n' her's vanity, steam room/shower and a sauna. It was great to come \"home\" to this after a long night of walking the strip to relax. The staff were attentive.

We ate at Biscayne one evening. The food was superb, as was the service. Our waiter, David, was very attentive and went as far as to ask us what show we were going to that night. When we mentioned we were going to see Carrot Top he shared a story of how he and Carrot Top used to shop at the same grocery store. A simple, but effective touch in delivering good, personalized service. We also ate at Bacio for one meal. The food was great again, as was the service. Upon leaving, chef Carla Pellegrino thanked us for coming and wished us a nice evening. This was also a simple but effective touch. How nice to have the chef thank you for coming to the restaurant! You don't see that often enough. We found the price at both restaurants to be fair for the food and service we received. The location was great and the casino was nice and bright. We are not gamblers but we each put $5 in to penny slots on the day we left (could not leave Vegas without at least trying) and I walked away with $105.

All of my group was on the 11th floor in the front building (Paradise) and I loved that location. Those rooms were centrally located around the casino, bars, front desk and front entrance of the building. The pool area was beautiful! We didn't get in the pool while there, but we enjoyed walking around and laying out by the pools! The Nikki restaurant was nice even though we had a bad experience with our waitress in the Nikki restaurant on our first day. We also got pizza at the other little snack/cafe and it was good! We did most of our eating breakfast and dinner outside of the hotel. The entire property was VERY nice!! The staff was WONDERFUL and VERY helpful! They always opened the doors for us as we entered the hotel and was helpful in giving directions or making recommendations! The concierge helped book our group tickets for the Gladys Knight concert. Gladys was performing live @ the Trop and was AWESOME! The concierge also helped book our tickets for the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam tour (Sweet Tours) and what an experience it was!!...one that I will never forget! When I return to Las Vegas, I will definitely return to the Trop!

I wanted to see how the remodel had gone. I booked online directly through Tropicana and after contacting Nicole Marshall, received an upgrade to a Strip View room and the resort fee waived. (resort fee is $11.99, not $19 as stated by another reviewer) The rooms have definitely been done over, and my non-smoking room did not have any hint of smoke in it. I think the only thing I can say about the remodel is that it's still a pretty basic hotel, but with new paint, wallpaper and furnishings. Not bad at all, but now blow-you-away great, either. I will include photos. The bathroom has a vent fan that runs as long as the light is on, which is a little annoying and the only towel rack for the shower is 6 feet away from the shower. I may just be spoiled by some of the other newer Vegas properties, but I still only stay at the mid-priced places, so I'm not comparing it to Wynn. The bed was very comfortable, and the chaise by the window was usable in that it didn't collapse like the one at Flamingo when you sit to change your shoes. The elevators at the Trop are really slow for some reason. There was actually a line I had to wait in when I was going up to my room with my bags. It seems that too many people stop the elevator at the Mezzanine Level and it holds up the people going to the rooms. It seemed like the elevator opened at that level every time I rode it, even if it was just some confused person standing there with a beer in their hand. Anyone who books through Tropicana is entitled to the VIP Breeze Check In which is a separate line that moves quickly and hopefully gets you early check in and late check out. Only problem is, that with them giving people 2pm check out, that means early check in probably won't happen. I did not get early check in. My room was ready at 3pm. (But I did get late check out.) Inside the hotel, all the employees were friendly. But the guys working valet were not so friendly. My friend valeted her car when we thought I'd be checked in, but when we went right back out to get it and waited in the wrong place (not clearly marked), she was chastised by the valet for not being there when he brought the car around. Well who would think the car would be brought up facing the lane where the cars enter the parking lot? That was just strange. Everyone else just uses another lane in the drop off area. Also, when I was dropped off by a cabbie who didn't realize that the completely empty North entrance was open, the valet there swore after him and the next one also yelled at him. Well, that's fine, but keep it civil in front of the customers. It looked to me like they didn't know which entrance they wanted anyone to use just yet. When I oringally booked, I was supposed to get some sort of deal where 2 pool chairs were reserved for me, but I don't know if that got lost in the shuffle when Nicole upgraded my room. I never had time to use the pool with my taking cabs all over, so it didn't matter. My \"Strip view\" was of Mandalay Bay/Luxor/Excal. It would have been nice without the banner over the windows. I guess most of the Trop is \"wrapped\" in a white banner at the moment. I'm not a fan of them. I like to have a clear view out the window. (that's just me) When I went to do the express check out on the TV, the resort fee was showing, so I went down to check out at the desk. I had my reservation printed and the friendly clerk took the charges right back off the bill for me. Finally, I'd say that the new Trop isn't bad at all - I personally like a more central location on the Strip, so I'd recommend Tropicana more to someone on a budget, someone with a rental car that is doing off-Strip excursions, or just likes that end of the Strip more. I would not recommend it for someone who likes the mid-Strip properties, or a bit more luxurious room. At least not the regular room - maybe a suite? All in all, it wasn't bad, but I just didn't get the vibe from it that I expected.

We would definitely recommend the Paradise Tower - we were in room #931 which was a King room at the end of the hallway overlooking the pool. It is much more convenient than the Club Tower and we never heard any noise from the club or the strip. Everyone we encountered at the Tropicana was very friendly and helpful, including the wonderful woman who cleaned our room (I am mad at myself for not noting her name; she cleaned our room from the 1st - 5th of July). The Tropicana is much cleaner and brighter than most of the other hotels/casinos that we walked through. They seem to cater more to their hotel guests than to the walk-in casino visitors. Our room and bathroom were spacious and clean. The wireless was easy to use and high-speed. We were able to easily find lounge chairs at the pool, which was busy but not overwhelmingly loud or crazy (we are in our mid-40's). The only downside that we can think of is the location ~ at the south end of the strip, so a long walk to some of the action/restaurants, etc; however, we knew that going in. Our visit ended with more wonderful customer service at check-out from Gwen, who reduced our room rate by $30 after she found out we had taken the red-eye home and left at 9pm (and this was over the phone after we had arrived home!).

The only negatives I have were I wish the pool was open later, and a bartender who was at the sports bar made us a little uneasy. He was rolling his eyes and complaing about customers to the cocktail waitresses, right in front of us. He didn't even acknowledge us, another friendly bartender came from the opposite end to wait on us. I've been in the service industry for years and the Brad Garrett look a like bartender was completely distasteful. Hopefully he was just having a bad day.

We really enjoyed our stay. The first thing we noticed was how friendly all of the staff were; from the front desk to the folks we met in the elevator, they all had smiles on their faces. You don't get that treatment everywhere in Vegas. And they were able to accommodate our need for adjoining rooms, even when the hotel was sold out. The hotel is very clean. Everywhere we went someone is cleaning; sweeping the white tile in the gaming area, wiping down the elevator, emptying ashtrays in the gaming area. Our room was great - and it was their standard room. I've never slept better in a hotel, especially in Vegas. The mattresses are the best. Loved the layout of the bathrooms. They aren't huge, but arranged very well for their size. And my favorite thing: we didn't experience any \"hall noise\"!! No talking, slamming doors, etc. that normally wakes us in other hotels. We were in the Paradise tower and our room faced the MGM Grand. We heard the occasional helicopter or siren, but nothing that woke us up. We are a family of 5, with 3 teens, so the pool area is very important to us. The new Trop pool area didn't disappoint. We had an easy time finding lounge chairs and the kids enjoyed the pool. The location on the Strip is great, you can catch the tram across the street at Excalibur to go to the Luxor or Mandalay Bay, and the tram that rus the east side of the Strip is just across the street at the MGM Grand. The only downside was the pool was a little messy in the late afternoons and closed early. As much emphasis as was placed on keeping the hotel clean, it may have been due to the amount of wind that was occurring in the afternoons during our stay (blowing cups etc. in the pool.

From the moment we walked in the Resort doors I was impressed. It has just been renovated and it is in excellent condition. Clean, bright and well ventilated. And better than the resort's condition was the impeccalbe customer service. In this day and age not many companies put an emphasis on customer serivce. Not so with the Tropicana. Every employee we came into contact with greeted us and/or provided us with the best best customer service. Check in was easy as was being able to upgrade to a suite that became available. There was once person who impressed me the most and that was \"Yolanda\" at the front desk. She was very personable and focused on making our stay wonderful. I wanted to surprise my husband with a suite (we were celebrating his birthday and our anniversary) and Yolanda was able to make it happen. To top it off she had some chocolate covered strawberries and champange delivered to our room! The suite was huge, clean and the bed was so comfortable. the room also had, a fridge, coffee maker, safe, and internet (included in the resort fee). Now all that being said I do have only two issues of a negative nature. First is that I paid to be upgraded to the Paradise Suite with a strip view. However, our view of the strip was blocked by a massive sign hung on the exterior of the Tropicana. So all we got to see was the Excalibur and New York..And second is almost all the alcoholic drinks we received were pretty \"weak.\" Especially in the Brad Garrett comedy club.

Just back from my second stay at the Tropicana, and hard-to-believe news is that it's even better than it was last fall. A stylish 'boutique' hotel experience isn't what you expect on the Strip - but the Trop delivers. And at very competitive prices, too. A few things to know up front: -- The Trop is big enough to stay interesting and vibrant 24/7, but at the same time it's manageable. Like Mandalay Bay, it's far enough south to provide a break from the relentlessly bustling, noisy and overcrowded sidewalks of the mid-Strip - so after a visit to the Bellagio fountains or City Center, you truly get the sense of \"coming home\" and escaping the mid-Strip bedlam. -- Guests stand a good chance of getting individual attention here. The Trop's staff are remarkably friendlier than you'll find at most Vegas hotels; best guess is that they're treated better by management, too. It pays off for the guests. In the course of a single day, the cheerful younger doorman at the side entrance, a guy named Vernon at the entertainment desk & a woman working at the tux/bridal shop had all struck up conversations with me. The Cafe Nikki waitress at dinner and the waiter at lunch were both personable and professional. Nicole Marshall could write the book on hotel hospitality. -- The Trop's casino, room decor and pool area tell you right off that this isn't a standard hotel designed by corporate beancounters. Instead, the casino is gleaming white with touches of dark, rich red - way livelier, brighter and fresher than anything you'll find on the Strip or downtown. The tropical theme of light colors (with plenty of cream tones and bamboo accents) is carried throughout the corridors and rooms of the two high-rise towers, the Paradise and Club. Lastly, the pool area landscaping is spectacular; lots of gently sloping lawns and palm trees rather than the acres of bare concrete so common at Vegas hotels. -- Even with the renovations completed, the Trop still offers value-for-your-money rates. Downsides? Not many. Like almost every Vegas pool I've visited in the past couple of years, the Trop's has louder music than I'd choose. It makes sense for the Nikki Beach operation to be all about a party atmosphere, but the general pool area has a different mix of guests - and dialing back the volume couldn't hurt (particularly in the morning). Similarly, it's becoming harder for popular Vegas hotels to keep the pools clean. The 'perpetual spring break' vibe of the Strip is growing, and young partiers seem accustomed to tossing their empty drink cups into the water. (This trend is even worse at MGM's lazy river).", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medina, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice Casino\u201d", "Author": "FiftiesHavingFun", "ReviewID": "UR114962704", "Content": "This Hotel just went through a major renovation.

Brad Garrett's Comedy Club- First of all I knew before we got to Vegas that Brad Garrett is not always at the club, again when we purchased the tickets the agent reiterated this. We went the night of June 25th and saw Bobby Miyamoto and Steve McGrew. The night was opened by a wonderfully funny black lady (sorry, can't remember her name).

When I thought of the Tropicana I immediately thought run down, but not to my knowledge, the Trop did some major changes... And great changes. As soon as we arrived from California, Valet greeted us and treated us like kings! yea, that's what there supposed to do, but this was way different from our last trip to vegas, and we come often. We checked in very fast because the gentleman up front who has been there over 25 years (he told me, very funny guy), was about to leave but saw I was eager to hit the tables... HA! His shift was about to end in five minutes, but he took me anyway. He was a very funny fellow... The next morning we hit the pool and it was pretty packed, a great pool is probably why...

The 'new' Trop resumes residency on the famed corner. I was reluctant to stay here, but my admin booked me on a last minute find. What was I to do, I was already on the plane and she said the room rate could not be beat...hesitantly I asked what the rate was - $59.00 p/night!!! OK, I'm running in the other direction. I decided to see it for myself, (i mean i could always leave, right?) I was impressed! The reservation agent on the phone told my admin to tell me to go directly to VIP check-in. Huh?!?! I was like what...really? (I know my admin had informed the res agent that her boss is VERY picky) She greeted me with a overwhelming smile and quickly located my reservation...(i hate how sometimes they are not so ready and re-verify your name multiple times b/c you booked w/ Hdotcom or some other travel site); it was later in the day when I checked-in, so i was assured i'd be able to go directly to my room; so anyway...from valet to walking thru the 'new' entrance i was like...am I in SOBE (south beach, miami) everything smelled new and looked new, honestly felt a little regal almost. I was impressed, WOW the Trop delivered! (OK, so I lived in LV for 17 years before moving to southern California; so I was sorta aware of the remodel; but I wasn't prepared for this...I mean the Tropicana has been laying dorment for so long, one could only think...how much of an investment can they really commit to do to make this place...well, ah, er...relevant again?); i honestly thought it was coming down... OK, back to my room...WOW! I was in the tower closet to the front of the hotel - new elevators! HUGE room...i'm a bathroom guy - so i judge the room on how comfortable the bathroom is and appears...right down to the shower head and water pressure when you flush...front desk rep told me it was a 'new' tower and that everything was brand new; oh c'mon...No, but really. The room smelled like a brand new car. and the bed - COMFORTABLE! (no saggy mattress - you know how they try and cover up an old mattress by adding new bedding); other amenities included a flat screen TV, Hi-Speed wireless internet (i usually dont connect to hotel 'free' wireless b/c it just isnt safe, but the Trop has Cox...) the rooms completely black out at night, NO VEGAS STRIP LIGHTS COMING IN...sometimes the curtains don't come together all the way and that one beam of light always finds your window...and, most importantly - the room smells good - NO SMOKE! whatever it is they pump thru the ventilation system in the casino...gently fills you room, w/out over powering your senses. What i really liked is that Valet remembered my name from the night before and each time i came back to the hotel...and the front desk reps have said \"Welcome back!\" every time. i've been back to the 'new' Trop many times after the first time, and have brought my friends and business associates - all hesitant but figured, if I can stay there and brag about it, it must be OK! The Trop has been my place to stay since Dec'10 and every month thereafter...both of my businesses are in LV so I have to travel back and forth, the Trop is home while I am attending to my business. (i once got what they call a 'courtesy' upgrade...compliments of the hotel for what i can only assume was my frequent stays) ROOM, excuse me SUITE, WAS...AMAZING! ty trop It's quiet once you settle in - despite the active construction, you hardly notice it. Room service menu has a good selection of food, tho' depending on what tower you are in; it could take a while to get it. (i think even the staff know it and actually apologized to me that it may have taken longer than expected/usual) After a long day at work if your room is in the tower towards the back of the hotel...Ugh! prepare yourself for a long walk! All in all...I'm a believer! see ya next stay Trop!

Our room was very nice and the bed super comfy. The staff we encountered were all friendly and helpful. We arrived around noon, were told we would be called when our room was ready and received a call a short time later. The Trop is on the south end of the strip, away from a lot of the crowds and activity, which we liked. It can be quite a trek to and from other casinos and shows, but there is a tram available for a small fee. We ended up walking most of the time, which got to be a bit much, but helped burn some of the calories we consumed on our vacation. We did have some trouble with the water working in our room one morning, but it was fixed fairly promptly. Also, one day our room did not get cleaned, and by the time we returned to our room that night, we were so exhuasted, we decided to forgo it. The next morning, I called when we left for the day and the housekeeping staff said they'd put us on the top of the list. When we returned in the early afternoon, the room had been cleaned, although the bathroom floor could have been done better. The only other negative part of our stay was the noise coming from the promotional videos being displayed on the exterior of the hotel. Our room was on that side and i found the music and flashing lights very disruptive while trying to sleep. I am a light sleeper, however, and the noise did not bother my husband at all. The work out room was fairly well equiped. One eliptical was broken and there are no stationary bikes. There is a good selection of free weights and machines, however, as well as two treadmills. It is in sort of an awkward spot in a pathyway to the pool. Also, no TV's, so bring your Ipod. The workout area could have been cleaner. The racks with the towels was absolutely filthy. But overall, it worked and was not too crowded. We usually had breakfast at the Starbucks on site, which seemed in line price-wise with other Starbucks in the area. Other than a cafeteria-style deli, the hotel restaurants, however, were out of our price range, so we dined elswhere. Overall, for the price, we were very satisfied with our stay.

They upgraded us to a double since we were a larger group and they were available, at no extra cost. These are $200/a day in food and drink and we may as well selected a double from the start because we surpassed that in food and drink!! Easy to do when 6 people spend 6 hours luxuriating!

The room was great with soft, fluffy pillows on a very comfortable bed. Flat screen tv in the room. Ambhar Lounge situated off elevators very lively, good service, pleasant atmosphere although we were not thrilled with the bands they provided for entertainment. Las Vegas has some super local bands such as Front Page, Klique, Chaze, HNLV, which would have supplied a more entertaining sound for a more variety of guests. Cafe Nikki provided a wonderful outdoor dining experience during the evening hours. As with any hotel there were some problems. One evening no hot water for a period of time. Check-out morning no water at all. Computer down during check-out, however, just received credit card statement and all charges were correct. Check-in lines much too long and time consuming.

The bathroom was all done too except for the tiles and a few in the corner of the shower had a bit of black. The air conditioning worked beautifully and the tv was a big flat screen. The bed was so comfy and the sheets were fresh and clean. Even the comforter because it seems that they wash that with the sheets unlike the old polyester cover hotels used to use.

We ended up at the Venetian indoor canals with the shops and we went into the Signature Galleries shop and I was interested in a piece and the lady actually put us in a room and shut the door! She was so pushy and desperate that I actually had to push past her and walk out!! Her name started with an F? She was a white lady in her 50's, I believe, with glasses, and thin.

Our second night we were out and got a VM saying we had to move because the bathroom was leaking. It took awhile for someone to bring us our new keys and move us to our room. The keys didn't work and we had to call the front desk which sent up security and they didn't know what was going on. My friend couldn't stand the cigeratte smell once we got in the room and we were moved again which took along time. All in all probably a 2 hour ordeal in the middle of the night. We told the front desk which was aware of some of the problems and we got the resort fee back.

Although, I never saw it before they remodeled I love what they've done. You feel like you're staying in old Vegas or in Miami or Palm Springs. The atmosphere at the Tropicana is so much more relaxed than other hotel on the strip. My husband and I were able to check out both pools. The first day we hung out at the large pool. We lounged on the grass (something you can't do a most LV hotels) ordered lunch and drinks. My only complaint was that there weren't many waitresses/waiters to order from and we were starving. The food and drinks were great, though :) The second day we decided to check out Nikki Beach. After we figured out how the cabanas and stuff worked we were able to stash our stuff and hang out with everyone else in the pool. The specialty drinks at Nikki Beach are great and the staff there is really nice. We dined at 2 of the Tropicana's restaurants, as well as ordered room service. The first night, we ate at Nikki Beach Cafe, outside overlooking the pool. Our waitress was great and so was the food. The second night we ate at Biscayne. We weren't terribly hungry at the time, so we ended up just ordering an app and drinks in the bar(ish) area. The nuts on the table were AMAZING and so was our Charcuterie Plate.

The living room was huge - TV\u2019s in both living & bedroom, coffee maker, bottled water, fridge - looked better than the Tropicana\u2019s website photos.

The king room was also large - had TV but didn\u2019t have the other \u2018extras.\u2019 This room was next to the lifts, so I was worried that it might be noisy, but although we could hear people coming & going next door there was no noise from the lifts themselves.

Can\u2019t comment on the casinos as we were using Las Vegas as a base for touring, not as a destination in itself - it was reasonably easy to get into/out of out of Las Vegas from the Tropicana: also close by the airport, so no hassle on arriving/departing. Restaurant choices inside the hotel seemed limited, but it was no problem to find options close by - New York New York suited us best for food. I wasn\u2019t able to make a booking via the website, so I emailed the hotel directly and ended up getting a very good deal - decent rate, no resort fees, free late check out for our second stay (all of which were confirmed at our first check-in).

It was my boyfriends\u2019 first trip to Vegas so needless to say we were very excited about going. Prior to making the reservation I had read in several reviews that the pool area and Club Nikki was not completed in the time initially expected so I called the hotel and was assured by our visit in the beginning of May that both would be done. So I booked a five-day stay. Upon arriving in Vegas the weather was perfect and I could not wait to get poolside. We got a ride from a friend to the hotel and right away the exterior impressed us. There was only a brief wait at the reception (which was a plus) and even though we were early they were able to get us a room right away. I had been told on the phone that we may be able to upgrade based on availability but when I asked the clerk was VERY unpleasant and told us that it would be an additional three hundred dollars. I asked what the difference in the footage was for the room we had booked and the upgraded room and was told that she had no idea and she made no effort to find out. She also assured me the view was of the mountains in the room we had and so I settled on the room we had initially booked. When we travelled the substantial distance to our room and opened the door I was so sad. The room was small the view was of plastic! Not sure what they were doing but they had plastic covering the windows. Eventually this was taken down and then we got to see the not so lovely parking lot and airport. The hotel was still under construction and although the pool was done Club Nikki was not and the construction was loudly going on right next to pool. The worst part however was the bathroom. The toilet was stained, the shower had been broken and hanging from the wall and my poor boyfriend could not stand and shower because the showerhead was to low down for his 5\u201911\u201d self. He had to hunch over to get his head wet. There was no coffee maker or mini fridge so we had to trek down to the dinning area to get over priced Starbucks every day since coffee is mandatory for me to survive. On the plus side the bed was comfy, the room was magically cleaned whenever we got back no matter what time we left for the day and the casino was nicer then most of the other hotels. We also ate several meals there and found them to be decent. Biscayne is the steak house and the food was good but is going to have a tough time competing with the plethora of outstanding restaurants in the area especially since the service was pretentious and borderline rude. Would I stay at the Trop again? Maybe if I got a REALLY good deal I would give it one more try. Would I recommend it? Not sure. I would give the facts (including the very strong smell of fake coconuts being circulated through the air duct system 24/7) and let the person decide on their own.

You can sit your lawn chair anywhere, this mean around the pool or under a palm tree if that suites you. The restaurants looked nice, but just couldn't make time for them. Lastly, the people at this place are nice, being from the South it is important to me that people are easy to talk to and keep their word. We had some issue, but to there credit were resolved quickly. Now to the negatives: The air conditioning in the room is fair at best. The food and drink also is crazy expensive as compared to other places nearby. Lastly, the casino is almost empty at times and the table minimums are very high. Must do's: If all you want to do is party and gamble DO NOT READ THIS. Rent a car and go see some of the state and national parks nearby.

The front desk person, though pleasant, tells me that our room is not available - I say, I thought check-in was 3:00. She said, oh, it is. But I guess the guest in your room hasn't checked out yet. Okay, so when can we get in our room? She says, \"Hard to say, why don't you check back around 4:30\". 4:30?? No information on what to do with our bags in the meantime, no apology, no explanation except that she told me they were \"sold-out\". I walked away looking dejected enough that some other lady called to me and said, 'you look upset, can I help you?\" I was relieved that someone was going to give me some information. She told me to leave the bags at the bell hop's until our room was ready..then she launched into a sales pitch about Polo Towers, wanting to give me free show tickets to go hang out there for a 2 hour presentation. Nice. No Thanks. The front desk person also said that she'd call us if the room was ready. No call. Decided to check back at 4:00 to see if it was ready - it was.

The good stuff: We had an awesome room - it was clean, well appointed (except it lacks a coffee maker), great view, quiet and close to the casino and the pool. The only issue was we didn't have a Do Not Disturb hanger in our room and housekeeping gives one swift knock with about a 1 second wait until they just walk on in - had a few close calls! Pool was fun. Lots of seating. Pool is freezing!! But, when it's 100 degrees, a cold pool is nice. Drink service was pretty non-existent, but that's alright -the pool bar is very centrally located.

We hadn't stayed at this hotel before it was renovated, but after reading some older reviews and seeing the place now - it definitely has come a long way! Everything seemed brand new, from the pool, to the comfy lounge chairs, to the plush beds and the huge flat screen tv, we were more than pleased. We checked in on a Wednesday afternoon and it was a breeze. No line ups and super friendly staff. Since it was our anniversary and we were staying there for an entire week, management was nice enough to waive the hotel fee and offer us a free mini fridge for our room. That was just an added bonus! The location is super convenient being right next door to MGM where you can catch the monorail to any part of the strip. Also, there are convenient bus stops right outside the hotel if you're adventurous enough to take the bus around town. Cabs are also reasonable if you're visiting another hotel along the strip. Cafe Nikki was excellent - I recommend the Fantasy sushi roll - I couldn't get enough of it! My husband had the Nikki Cuban sandwich which he thought was just okay. The restaurant patio overlooking the gardens is beautiful, and they have a light mist coming from the above to keep you cool on those hot summer days. We were saving the Bacio italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner, but sadly it's closed on Mondays. We'll definitely try it out next time though. They also have a great gelato shop right on the way to the pool, perfect after a long day in the sun. The housekeeping staff were very good and we always returned to a spotless room. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the loud club music at the pool. There are two sections to the pool, one side for Nikki Beach Club, and the other is the regular pool. I'd suggest keeping the club music for Nikki Beach side and offering a more relaxing atmosphere for the general pool. (Don't get me wrong, I'm in my mid-twenties and I actually liked most of the music they played, I just wish I had a choice of a quiet pool area to doze off in the shade).

The first night we received an upgrade to a spa suite which was fabulous! Although for the rest of our stay we were in our orginally booked room in the Paradise Tower. I should note that the spa suite was located on the top floor in the Island Tower and for those who think or read on here that is a long walk from the entrance...it's not. Maybe if you had trouble getting around it might be then I would recommend a room in the Paradise Tower. The walk to the Island Tower is nothing though compared to all the walking you do in Vegas. Not a big deal. Our room was clean and comfortable. The remodel really looks great! The bedding was simply amazing! The pillows and sheets are so comfortable...it was just what we needed after long days (and nights) in Vegas. The bathroom was spacious and clean. There was lots of counterspace which was nice as I like to take over the bathroom as my boyfriend puts it. The walls are a bit on the thin side as we could hear music from the pool area (our room was on the 10th floor) but that wasn't really a big deal. I heard no noise from the airport whatsoever. We never did give room service a shot but we did eat one night at Cafe Nikki and the food was delicious! Maybe a bit on the pricey side for what you get but it was good nonetheless. We often went other places to eat during our stay. We did visit the pool once and it was very relaxing! Perhaps that is because we went to the crowded family-oriented pool at Excalibur with friends the day before (not our scene). The water was a bit cold I thought but there were loungers available so no complaints. Bring your wallet though if you want to have some drinks poolside-you will need it. We also didn't gamble too much in the casino so I can't say much about that. It looks a little on the small side but very bright and airy. It also smelled great compared to several other places we went. All in all I would stay at the Tropicana again on future trips to Vegas!

We chose the Tropicana in response to the exceptional reviews we read on the web. From the moment we entered the newly renovated Tropicana Hotel we knew we had chosen the right place to stay. Upon check-in, the front desk clerk, Evie, informed us that unfortunately our requested room type was not immediately available. However her demeanor and willingness to suggest alternatives made us feel welcome and defused a possibly uncomfortable situation. Without provocation, she elicited the assistance of the Hotel Manager, Thomas Martinez and the eventual resolution far exceeded our expectations. As a matter of fact it seems as if the management has inspired all their employees to embody an element of service from a past era; understated, attentive and friendly without being gratuitous. Customer service is not the only impressive feature of this destination. Contrasting the usual glitz and overstated glamour of the Las Vegas Strip, the Tropicana has been transformed to embody a clean, relaxed, understated style, the likes of South Beach and the tropics. From the hint of coconut when you walk through the doors to the cascading waterfalls and whitewashed towers, no element has been overlooked. The rooms defy any visitor to feel as if they are staying in a hotel. Natural wood tones, wicker and bamboo are contrasted by crisp white linens and panama shutters and complimented with accents of the hotel\u2019s signature orange-red. Oh\u2026did I mention the pool area? Foliage and fresh flowers surround the lagoon style pool and the padded lounge chairs are plentiful (we never had to hunt for one, even during the weekend). The crowd is as diverse, eclectic and fun as the poolside music and the bartenders mix a cocktail that will ensure you are able to relax and allow your cares to dissipate with the beat.

June is the best time to go before the temperatures get too hot. We were able to enjoy great entertainment right in the hotel and casino.

The exhibits and especially the actors, both real and virtual kept us completely off-guard all the way through. It was mind blowingly and even hauntingly realistic. If I were a supersticious man, I would suggest that I felt the presence of Meyer Lansky in those exhibits. It was both strange and scarey. Bravo to everyone involved in this magnificent endeavor. It was more than worth the money. And the promotion was great too! We also were honored to spend a night with Gladys Knight. Her voice is as strong and soulful as ever. She made us feel a part of her family and took us on a sentimental journey that we will never forget!

Additionally, when we checked in I did the famous \"$20 sandwich\" trick, and it earned us a great room in the island tower on the 17th floor and a \u201cfree\u201d refrigerator for our stay. The room was extremely clean, new and fresh. The tile in the bathroom should be re-grouted, but the vanity and sink are new, and we were happy with our accommodations. We LOVED the view of the strip and the pools. The TV is a large new flat-panel, and the in-room safe was deep enough to accommodate at laptop. We had dinner at Biscayne on our first night and did the Prix Fixe meal with wine pairings for $39.99. The first course was a vidalia onion with spicy ketchup, and we all agreed, it was sort of a joke. It was half an onion ring, and while it was tasty, it was a bit of stretch to deem it the first course even if it was supposed to be an appetizer. The rest of the courses were fabulous. We all enjoyed the wonderful room service and we heard great things from fellow visitors about Cafe Nikki. The casino is bright and clean and the coconut smell, by our accounts, was subtle. Every single staff member we encountered from the dealers, valet, room service, front desk, phone operators, you name it, were friendly and helpful. As much as we enjoyed visiting the Mandaly Bay, we found the staff to be rude and unhelpful with the exception of the wonderful waitpeople at MIX. Our experience there made us appreciate the Tropicana staff even more. The pool area was great, super clean with plenty of chairs, towels and wait staff. We enjoyed our hours at the pool, especially the people watching. The music was a bit grating, but I don't dig on Rihanna, Pitbull etc. We enjoyed our stay and would more than likely return. We chose the Tropicana because of it's history--it's 54 years old--and because of the recent renovation. However, it is clear that the Trop is aiming to attract a younger crowd. The club Nikki nightclub opened while we were there, and some staff encouraged us to check it out, so we did. In our 40's, we don't feel ancient, what with 40 being the new 20 and all, but it was clear to us the clientele was no older than 24 and frankly we felt unwelcome. On our last day, we called for a bell boy and that's when we met the incredible Edward (Eddie). Out of all the friendly staff members we met, Eddie was truly the gem that stood out. Eddie has been with the Tropicana the longest out of all their employees, but you would never know it, the way he was handling our baggage with ease. He told us stories about the Trops history from the Folies Bergere, to the famous people who have stayed there. We encouraged him to tell us more, but he had work to do. We could have listened to him all day. Eddie should be cherished and valued as the wonderful employee he is. I embrace change, and the Tropicana's remodel is a major step in the right direction. My hope is that while they aim for a more youthful market, they also respect the Trops history and the fact that there is huge demographic of people who are well over 25 and would like to stay in a historic property, have a great time in the clubs, and enjoy the historical perspective some of the employees offer.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAfter a glitch with check in the hotel was great.\u201d", "Author": "discodollydiva", "ReviewID": "UR113158601", "Content": "Stayed here over New Year's in the new rooms they had remodeled.

I can certainly tell you that the Trop did not let us down. The rooms were modern, with Kohler fixtures in the bathroom, VERY comfortable beds, and rooms that didnt have that normal \"hotel\" smell. From our first encounter with Terry at the front desk to our help with baggage from Jake as we left, the Trop has certainly placed customer service at a premium. I have to admit, we immediately went to the new pool, and had concerns. Because the Nikki Beach was having an industry day, the cacaphony of sounds from the techno beats of Nikki to the music from the regular pool was deafening and irritating...the initial stay at the pool was unpleasant. However, later in the week when Nikki was closed during the day, the regular pool was great. However, on Thursday, the music was WAYYYY too loud, and kept a number of people away. I was told that this is something they are working on. I have a feeling the pool is still a work in progress. The room was quiet (thank goodness Terry put us AWAY from the Nikki Beach side!) and we got GREAT sleep when necessary. We did not try Biscayne or the Italian restaurant because they were a bit pricey. The first floor restaurants were a bit pricey but normal for the strip. By far, the all star team member was Maria from housekeeping (for the Club Tower). She as professional, welcoming, and a VERY hard worker....the Trop (and Las Vegas) needs more great people like these in their hotels...kudos for Maria!!! The Trop casino was unlike others on the Strip....it was open, airy and well lit. If you like old school, dark, dingy and smoky...you wont like the Trop casino. Special props to Ed, Wally and Todd in the Poker room. The Trop has just redesigned their poker room; its small, but WAYYY nice....hopefully business will improve. If you are a poker player, you need to check out the Trop poker room. Most importantly, we felt safe at the Trop. Security personnel were visible, but not obtrusive. My only concern is wide open access for non-guest access to the pool (other hotels restrict access). We did venture mid-strip on evening, and DID NOT return...the volume and class of people, were...lets say less than desirable...we will continue to stay south or off-strip for future trips. The only other issue we had was an encounter with a less than caring female bell captain on the last day of our trip. She could have cared less about customers...this was VERY quickly taken care of as Jake and Nick saw what was happening and intervened. As a side note, I left a golf hat in my room hidden in a room lamp (yeah I know...stupid!). Josh from security was helpful the next day and went the extra mile trying to locate it. Unfortunately, other security staff could have cared less, as I made other inquiries the day after....I have given up the hat as a lost cause.

Lots of chairs, good service, fun locale. Again, very resorty. Very diverse in all aspects, you'll feel comfortable. Stay away from the Nikki Beach side if you're not into loud pulsating music. I didn't go in but I peeked and it looked like a lot of fun if you're young, fit and into drinking beer at 10am. : ) The views, especially at night, of New York, New York and the strip are amazing. And it's a short walk to both NY NY and MGM where there are a whole bunch more, shops, shows, resaurants. Very convenient but just a *tad* set away making it really feel more exclusive. My only suggestions to the Tropicana are these: 1. Back it down a notch with the coconut-pineapple air freshener in the hallways. 2. MORE Tropicana-themed souvenirs!

The property is renovated, upgraded and beautiful. We were offered the choice of two rooms - a tower closer to the casino or to the pool and we took the tower closer to the pool, which was PERFECT. Great view of the Strip, at the end of the floor. And the rooms were almost sound-proof! You couldn't even hear the planes coming into the airport nearby! Went and saw Gladys Knight in concert. Worth the general admission ticket. Make sure to get in line early for good seats to see the show. Cafe Nikki has a really good happy hour - $5-6 apps and drink specials. Try the mojito! Or the bloody mary. This resort is strong on customer service! The employees were VERY friendly, helpful and courteous, from a housekeeper who gave us extra towels to someone who walked us out to the pool when we were lost and a chef at Pizza Pellegrino, who offered us a full menu even though we wanted pizza. A couple hiccups: We checked in to the Tropicana at 2:30 p.m. and our room wasn't ready, so we had lunch at Cafe Nikki. My only concern was that we were at the restaurant during a certain window of time, when only a buffet was offered and we could not order off the menu. We were told that there would be a phone call letting us know when our room was ready (after 3:30 p.m.) and we never received a call, so we had to wait in line again for our room - which was ready. Never mind that we had to haul our luggage while we were waiting because there was no attendant at the luggage storage area. (Not fun) Also, our television did not work the first day of our stay. We called the front desk who told us it was a property-wide problem because of the television/satellite/cable provider and they offered to comp us on-demand movies. But, if you think about it, who goes to Vegas to watch television? The first day of our stay we went to the pool and it was filled with teenagers and college students, who were loud, running around the pool and making a mess, strewing empty beer cans, bottles and cups across the pool. Yet the next four days at the pool were nothing like that - completely relaxed, quiet afternoon at the pool with lots of sun and lots of adults.

You can definately tell the rooms were recently renovated. I could tell the bathroom didn't get as much of the renovation like the guestroom. The toilet had water stains, and the shower/tub still had the holes where the faucet previously was. But the vanity area was pretty nice. The location was good. It wasn't that far from the airport, so the taxi ride was a little cheaper. It's connected to a pedestrian bridge that connects to Excalibur and MGM Grand. I was also able to extend my check-out time. All I did was ask the front desk and she extended for a couple of hours free of charge. We only really had 1 issue.

The Tropicana did not deliver any of these so we will not stay there again, but if you have different requirements, there\u2019s a lot to recommend about the Trop. The Trop did a nice job with their remodel. This is not a luxury property, but it is good value for the price. Everything looks up-to-date and fresh, and the smoke factor is really low here. Employees here are some of the most helpful and friendly in Vegas, esp. the valets and bellmen. Property looks really clean. Elevators were fast and available. Location is good with quick access to MGM, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The $11/day resort fee actually gives you decent value compared with other Vegas hotels, including in-room internet access. On the downside, if you are in the Island Tower, it\u2019s a l-o-n-g walk to your room. Parking is bad, and too far a walk from the front door. Check-in took way too long, but check out was quick. The Trop doesn\u2019t have enough gaming tables, and the minimums were $15+ even on Sunday night. The casino itself is mostly slots. The pool is clean and nicely landscaped, but otherwise average. The musical selections blared over the speakers were awful. The pool is large and there were plenty of chairs, plus they have grass areas that keep the heat down when it\u2019s over 100 degrees. They need more waitresses at the pool \u2013 we never had anyone come by for a drink order. ROOMS: Pros- The rooms match the pictures on the website - big for average Vegas room, nice d\u00e9cor, plenty of drawer/closet space, in-room safe, nice towels, bed was good, bathroom is big (bath amenities are very basic), flat screen TVs, lighting is good. Everything looked very clean. Cons \u2013 Walls are thin, no black-out curtains, only plantation slide louvers, no view due to anti-glare window coatings, no mini-bar or fridge. The Trop has been advertising in L.A. like crazy, trying to attract the hip and beautiful crowd with Nikki Beach. So far it\u2019s not working. Like most Vegas properties, Nikki Beach is the leased pool area that requires a cover charge to use. The Trop doesn\u2019t have any packages that include entry to Nikki Beach so there is no advantage in getting in. Nikki Beach was a disappointment. Unless you rent a daybed or cabana, there is no seating at all. The pool looks like it would fit in a standard backyard. The Trop isn\u2019t the pretty people party crowd, but it also doesn\u2019t smell of vomit and no one is passed out in the hallways.

We arrived excited for the grand opening as well as a fun and relaxing weekend. We were not disappointed. We had been at the Tropicana property just six weeks earlier and we were amazed that they had been able to complete the construction so quickly. Six weeks earlier they were just breaking ground on the pool and club area. VIP check-in was a breeze. The front desk staff is courteous and accommodating without any wait at all. Our room was on a ground level floor as requested, on the opposite side from Nikki Beach in the far tower. It's a bit of a hike through the casino and over the pool areas. But once we got into our room we were able to relax in our very comfortable room. Any opening night for a night club creates opportunities for missteps and production snafus. Nikki Beach has a reputation for attention to detail and high production value. We were not disappointed. Checking into the invitation only grand opening event only took a few minutes (the staff was cleverly using software on an iPad) and we were greeted with smiles and cold beverages immediately. The indoor space is low on dance area and high on VIP and lounge space. The outdoor pool area cascaded down towards the pool with levels of bedded areas and lounge chairs. There was plenty of passed food, free cold beverages and interesting ambient entertainment. The music was a more relaxed lounge-house sound and seemed appropriate for this more social invite-only event. Celebrities included Halle Barry, Gladys Knight, and a few other unexpected names that I can't recall at this time. At approximately 10pm the club and opened up to the general public and DJ Robbie Rivera took over the decks, who played a much more energetic and heavy house set, perfect for getting the energy pupped up in the club. The dance floor was busy for most of the rest of the evening. The Nikki Beach / Club Nikki was well staffed for the evening and all of the staff seemed to be well trained and on purpose the entire evening. They were friendly, attentive and kept the space from getting to crowded by keeping the flow of the club moving. Later that night (early in the morning), we returned to our room and ordered room service. The food was delivered within 45 minutes (as stated) and was hot and delicious. Quite a surprise for room service food. We also ordered room service again, the following morning, just before checked out and had the same experience. The food was warm, savory and delivered on time. I highly recommend the Cuban Breakfast Wrap - best room service entr\u00e9e ever! Check out was quick, efficient and pleasant. We had our receipt in our hands, our luggage stored for the day (until our departure) and were on our way for a final day of shopping and sight-seeing. In closing it's important to point out that, as someone who grew up in Las Vegas, I was very surprised to see so many young persons on the Tropicana property at almost any time during the day. Much different from the Tropicana's previous reputation for catering to a much older clientele. I assume this is all part of their upgrade and partnership with Nikki Beach. The younger crowd brings fun, playful and beautiful to the property.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAll around wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "roeman218", "ReviewID": "UR110549994", "Content": "After a rough flight to Vegas from Canada there is nothing more that I wanted than to get checked in quickly and efficiently so that i could relax and I got just that!

The room was about a good 7-10 minute walk from reception, but not a problem, when you walk miles everywhere anyway. We didnt eat at the hotel resturants but you can get 50% off your meals if you buy a $3 coupon from the ticket booths on the strip. Where we also got show tickets for Jersey boys, and the rat pack shows. Both well worth it. The Tropicana is south of the strip so you do a lot of walking to get around. You can buy a 3 day hop on bus pass which runs up and down the strip for $7. Well worth the money , as it stops at every hotel and can take upto 1 hour to run from one end to the other. Or the express bus which only stops at certain stops and is obviously quicker. The pool areas look great, lots of bed both in the sun and shade, always beds available when we looked. The casino is very small when you see other hotel casinos, it depends on what you want.

My brother and I went from 5/17-5/21, and stayed at Skylofts at MGM in a 2 bedroom suite the 1st 2 nights and I had booked a Penthouse Loft for me and a Paradise Suite for my brother at the Tropicana the last 2 nights. Going in, i had no misconceptions that the Trop's Penthouse would compare to Skylofts, however based on reviews of the remodeled hotel i decided to give it a try. So..on 5/19 my brother an i checked out of Skylofts and walked over to the Trop around noon. Began the process of checking in and was told that the Penthouse loft was not available (either was the Paradise Suite for that matter). Now, i know it is common practice to not guarantee smoking vs. non, queens vs. king, etc. However, when someone reserves something like a Penthouse Loft, it is a very high probability that the specific suite selection is quite on purpose. To top it off, as the subject of my post states there was no explanation why the loft was not available, just that we would \"love the spa suites\". Well, i didn't reserve the spa suite. Forget the fact that i had to haggle with them to drop my price down. Something like this probably doesn't matter to most people, but it certainly gave me a bad 1st impression. As for the rest of the hotel, they really have done a nice job with their remodeling, especially the pool area. Everything seemed quite clean and other than the front desk, the employees all seemed to be quite personable. As an aside, if you are looking for high-limit blackjack, they really seemed to be short on options (and dealers). I had to walk over to MGM to get my fix.

The bed is the best bed I have ever stayed in a hotel. I loved it!

The rooms were spacious and everything was new. What I was frustrated about was not getting the room type we reserved and paid extra for.

It wasn't that far of a walk, but after being out walking the strip it would have been nice to walk in and go straight to my room. I called travelocity to try to get it straightened out, but they weren't much help even though I had paid extra for each night to have a city view room. The best they could do was move us to a room with two queen beds instead of the king bed room we were in and by that point we had already been there 2 days and were leaving in another 2. I asked about a refund and they claimed the room we had (not city view) was the same price as city view even though the website clearly had different rates. I didn't want to waste time arguing with them over what amounted to about $60 so I let it go. We ordered room service the first night we were there and our food was fabulous and the service was great. We had our food in less than 30 minutes. I think the food came from cafe nikki.

We wanted somewhere on The Strip but as we were there for the gambol/poker we weren't concerned too much about a luxury spa etc. We got a great price on the Trop and as we heard it had been done up, we plumped for it. I had also been swayed by the good engagement on here by Nicole - I like a hotel that takes the time. I'd got in touch but due to the guys wanting to book just after payday, we booked through a third party - Nicole got back to me a few days after with a better offer that I sadly couldn't take up but once again, excellent. The hotel itself was perfect for us and our needs. The place looks fresher than a lot of the hotels at the South end and the room was perfect - comfortable and clean. The pool was great. One or two gripes - the resort fee is standard Vegas fare so I don't mind but non-residents could just wander out to the pool and use it - some other hotels check room cards etc and I prefer this. This was the same for tower access - any random could get in a lift without a room card, I never like this. That aside, the Trop won't have the same footfall of randoms as the middle of the Strip hotels so it may not be such an issue or they may be addressing this as the makeover continues. Food wise we ate at Nikki Beach which was dead on - good clubs, burgers, sushi. The waiters were good and the outside deck is lovely. Biscayne was really good though. We had a really good time - top steaks, great wine and the crab/cheddar mash is something I'll need to try and recreate! We didn't gamble much at the hotel, some roulette & blackjack was all. The poker room looks nice but with few folk about, most beginners will just head across to the Excalibur for NL1/2 rather than the NL1/3 on offer in the Trop (change this!).

Pre-Check-In: After booking the hotel via Expedia, I found out on Facebook that Nicole Marshall is one of the nicest guest relation people in the whole city. Wrote her about my trip and asked her if it would be possible to get a fridge for my medication (the trip was a mix of birthday present and reward for being healthy again) and a quiet room. She responded within 24 hours that it wouldn't be a problem and told me that she would place a note on my reservation. Check-In: Arrived at 2:15am to see that there was no line at all and I could check-in right away. The way to the front desk, doesn't give you the whole casino tour, as it sits on the left side of the main entrance. That's a big bonus, since you don't have to move your luggage across the whole casino in order to check in. The women at the check-in gave me a warm feeling, called housekeeping because of the fridge and told me they'd knock within 5 minutes. Just as I got up to the room, housekeeping already knocked and helped me set up my fridge. Room: I had a room in the Paradise Tower, which has it's elevators right at the entrance to the right. From the entrance to the elevator it's about a 7-10 step walk, so you get in and out of the hotel fast, if you want to do some shopping/seightseeing/... . The rooms are big, even compared to other (more expensive) hotels on the strip. I had enough room to move around, set up my computer on the table without feeling like a canned tuna. It was a pretty quiet room for Vegas standards, which I really loves, since I am still recovering and needed some sleep aswell. Only downside, I got veeeeeery loud neighbors the last 3 nights (weekend), but since I already saw they were very well booked and since I also didn't want to change rooms, I didn't mention it. But it doesn't change my opinion of the hotel ... they couldn't have known. Also on a plus-side ... I had some friends stay at the Treasure Island and they complained that they didn't have a docking station for their IPod ... Tropicana has a very nice IHome station that also works with IPhones (which is rare, most docking station are IPod only). Nearly forgot ... there's a huge safe in the room, that handles a 17\" Laptop with ease ... I had a big camera, laptop, mobile phone, car keys, and and and in the safe and there was still enough room for another laptop and some more stuff ... safe didn't work when I arrived, but within 5 minutes security was there trying to help me. Sadly they couldn't fix it either, but the next morning a locksmith replaced the lock and it worked like a charm. Casino: They had the \"Even the Odds\" promotion still going, which gives you 50% of what you lose (in slot play) back on the same day and 50 additional percent back on your next stay (between 1 and 12 months later). So even if you don't plan to lose, it is pretty nice to have a fallback-option ;) The casino itself is bright, unlike most other Vegas casinos and while it feels different, it's a very nice feeling to play in a friendly environment. Pool: They have a great pool that tends to get a little overrun on sunny days, as it's very inviting. The water was a little cold at first, but after some 85-90\u00b0 days it really heated up and it was great to swim some laps there. Nikki Beach is opening in May aswell, so they'll add another pool to the mix, where I'm sure people will meet to party and enjoy themselves. Construction looked pretty much done when I was there and I got a sneak peak of what to expect ... it looks very promising and could become a got-to-be-there spot in Vegas, if the management does a good job promoting it. Housekeeping: Unlike some other people writing reviews here, I had no problems there ... they cleaned every day (except for my second to last day ... but that was because I told them it wouldn't make sense, since I had to leave at 3:00am in the morning) and did a pretty good job. Overall: I already told people to take a good look at the Tropicana, if they don't mind walking a little to the to the crowded places, to get the most bang for their buck on the Strip. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat ... would love to check out one of the suites next time.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, N.Y.", "Title": "\u201cStaff, and service was terrific can't say enough about Kennon Wolff.\u201d", "Author": "tropicanvacation", "ReviewID": "UR108680925", "Content": "Tropicana was a great hotel.

We were 2 couples and we had all been to Vegas before. After reading all the good reviews for the Trop we decided to give it a try. I must admit we were all slightly disappionted. Don't get me wrong it's a nice hotel, but they've done a good job on selling themselves and we found it's not quite as it seems. We all agreed that if it was your first visit to Vegas you'd be more than pleased. But if you have been before, you tend to do comparisons a little too much. Having said that our negatives didn't ruin our holiday. I really don't know where all the over friendly staff were on our week, we didn't find this the case at all. Not that they were rude or unwelcoming, but neither over the top friendly either. In fact most of the staff seemed to be new and unsure what they were doing. The rooms are really lovely, we upgraded to a deluxe room and it was great, with a fab view, and as sooo many say, the beds are AMAZINGLY comfortable...we had no probs sleeping, which definately helped with jetlag!!! Love the smell of the hotel, wafts of coconut but not a strong smell. Loved Cafe Nikki, nice ambience and yum food! The size of the hotel is great not large and easy to get around. The pool area is very nice, music is a bit repetative after a few days! The cocktail girls aren't assertive enough, our friend on the last day said they hadn't asked her once if she wanted a drink, we had to call them over, and they weren't overly friendly. We tended to go get our drinks in cafe Nikki ourselves. We were very disappointed with the Ambhar lounge, we had the impression of a cool lounge bar, with cocktails, music, etc, but this really was a let down. Its a small area with sport on the screens, which confuses me when there is a sports bar. We did spend time there though, happy hour 4pm-7pm half price cocktails! We ate at Biscayne, bit of a strange ambience, waiter was humourless, which made us laugh!! Food was OK, mediocre, you can get much better in other hotels. My Husband tried the taster meal, it wasn't good! Didn't eat in the Italian, it looked nice, but both restaurants a weirdly situated. The casino is bright and airy, my husband enjoyed some gambling. The drinks girls come round more often there than round the pool, and the drinks are free in there!! All in all we had a great holiday, nothing ruined it. It'll be even better when Nikki beach/club opens this week, it looks very nice, a bit smaller than I had imagined. It's a great value hotel but not in the same league as some of the others, once they've ironed out some teething problems it'll be much better.

I contacted Nicole Marshall as you will notice many people say. She was absolutely awesome. Did it take her a minute to get back with us? Of course. But imagine how many emails she must get a day from ppl wanting some sort of deal, \"hook up\" or assistance with something for their upcoming trip. Anyway, from the moment we arrived at Tropicana, we were greeted with warmth, friendliness and a smile. Our room was absolutely SPECTACULAR. It was a Penthouse Loft and it was just amazing. What I loved most about the room was the small dining table on th lower level. A lot of suites make the mistake of having some huge dining table that takes up most of the room as if you will have a huge sit-down dinner in your hotel. However, I did end up having a dinner in once and from our windows were able to look out onto the strip while enjoying our meal. The jacuzzi upstairs in the bathroom was ridiculous. It was so deep that a \"little person\" standing in it would drown if the water was filled. Again, there was an awesome view of the strip from the tub. As for the rest of the hotel, I would have been content to just stay there at night. The casino isn't too large and unlike my voyages into other casinos and hotels, I didn't get lost when trying to leave. The band playing in the Ahmbar Lounge was SPECTACULAR. After a night out, I'd often headed back to the lounge only to wish I'd have stayed there in the first place. They played modern songs and encouraged audience participation. The bartenders were AWESOME and the Berry Beach drink had me tipsy before I was finished with the first. I got a cabana during my stay and it was totally worth it. The cabanas are GORGEOUS. All white with a few red and island accents. Many hotels make you pay a large amount of money for a cabana and then on top of that, you buy your drinks and food. Tropicana charged us an amount and it included that set amount's worth of drinks. Completely worth it. I am from Texas. I am used to seasonings, flavor and tad bit of spice in my food. After visiting several Vegas restaurants, I was left disappointed in Vegas food. I'd wished I'd packed some Tony Cachere's seasoning in my purse. I'd given up and accepted the fact that in other areas, people just don't cook the way I'm used to. Then I went to Bacio inside the hotel. Our waiter was absolutely delightful and our meals (Chicken Parmesan and Filet with Lobster Hash) were the best food we had in Vegas...seriously. I still dream of the lobster hash some nights. HA! It made me wish I had taken the time to visit Biscayne while there. I did, however, have some of the Spicy Havana Nights sushi rolls while at the pool and those were pretty good as well. The only issue I ran into was WiFi. It was spotty and sometimes worked and other times did not. Not a huge deal as I wasn't planning on working while there, but when trying to use my Nook to purchase a book to read while relaxing, I ran into some issues. Of course, this was a level 1 problem on a scale of 1 - 10 in my book. I've seen complaints of the section of the Strip. To each his own, I suppose. We ended up walkign down to Venetian once or twice but really, we would have been content to just stay on our end. I love NY,NY's rollercoaster. There is a small food court between MGM and Tropicana. We went to Excalibur for ice cream one night after clubbing and walked to MGM for KA on our last night. For me, everything I really needed was in that area of the Strip unless I wanted to venture out to sightsee the rest of the Strip. However, this was trip number 4 for me and I've seen the rest of the Strip. For those who say the walk to the other tower was bad, I disagree. While my room was in the main tower, I'd gone exploring the hotel once and the walk wasn't that bad. Was it a minute or two? Yes. But hardly the hiking trip many ppl have made it seem. In conclusion, I would readily stay at The Tropicana again. It wasn't too large, the staff was awesome and while I had never seen the hotel previous to my trip - it was beautiful in my opinion. I have stayed at Venetian before as well as Treasure Island and I would, without a doubt, choose Tropicana again. From the lounge, to the staff, to the calm but fun pool to the DYNAMITE Bacio - I was impressed.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, TX", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with amazing customer service\u201d", "Author": "msthang22", "ReviewID": "UR108401880", "Content": "We stayed here May 12-15th. Our flight was 3 hours late so we got to hotel about 3am- the lady @ check in was so kind, engaged us in conversation and was very pleasant - wonderful first impression. We had a room with a queen bed - room was beautiful - nice that they have safes large enough to stow your laptop. Ours wouldn't let us set the code so we called down to the front desk and security was in our room in less than 5 min to fix the problem. The cleaning staff was so kind, curteous and friendly as well. The room was spotless - very crisp and clean ! The beds are AMAZINGLY comfortable - wish I could have brought it home with me - slept like a baby there! The bathroom is large with plenty of space, large flat screen tv's , loved the decor. Perfect amount of space to relax in! The resort fee per day is 9.99 - one of the cheapeast on the strip - we used our internet - and the connection was great - I think once it was slow but otherwise , no problems! Some will say the hotel is small - well compared to MGM and Venetian , yes it may be smaller but that's what we loved about it - you dont' have to walk 2 miles just to get through the casino and then get to your room - I liked that it was easy to navigate !! The pool was large enough to accomodate everyone - I like that part of it is in the shade so if you get really hot/sunburned , you can chill in the cooler areas. We got lucky both days with finding lounge chairs but it can get crowded - I do have to give kuddos to the lifeguards/employees who were always helping guests locate chairs - they really went above and beyond with customer service. We didn't utilize any of the restaurants in the resort as we were traveling on a budget but they did have a 24 hour starbucks and small cafe type place which is really nice. I love the location - it's not in the middle of the strip but it's close to alot of the bigger hotels to go sightseeing and you can take monorail or bus down the strip or just walk. The Nikki Beach area wasn't open yet - they are still finishing construction but we never were woke up by it. It looks like it will be really cool once it's all complete Oh and don't forget the 24 hour hot tubs - OMG - that was WONDERFUL - especially after a day of walking all over the strip - total relaxation for sore muscles - take advantage of it - there are 2 of them! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vegas, It will definitely be at the top of my list next time I go.

The \"new\" Tropicana Las Vegas is GREAT! It was with more than a bit of trepidation that we booked a weekday getaway for ourselves and family visiting from Manila at the newly renovated TROPICANA resort in Las Vegas, but let me begin by saying that we could not have been more pleased with our visit! If you've been to Vegas in recent years, you would know that the Trop has had a horrible reputation and it deserved it. But this is no longer the case. This hotel has had not only a complete renovation of the buildings and rooms, but the staff seems to have benefitted from this makeover as well. From the parking valet to the doormen, everyone actually seemed to care! (Next trip, we'll be reviewing the restaurants) The only \"bump\" in our visit was when we got to our rooms and the carpets were still damp from shampooing. Now, I don't know about y'all, but I REALLY can't complain about a hotel being \"too clean\", so it was no big deal to call the desk and let them know we'd like to change rooms. Since the bags were not up yet, a short jaunt back to the desk to pick up our new room keys took all of 15 minutes. AND we were able to get the adjoining rooms that were not yet available when we first checked in. On top of that, the desk clerks Ladonna and Gerard were SO nice, they made sure we were sent free in room coffee makers for the \"inconvenience\". Keep in mind that we were not paying top fare for the rooms, so this made their gesture even nicer. Mr. Yamenidjian, the new boss, has done a fine job of staffing the Trop with some of the most professional, welcoming and courteous staff in Vegas and he should be commended for it! The rooms were spacious and SPOTLESS. They were welcoming and the beds were wonderful. The bathrooms are also very nice, but the grout on the floors could use a bit more work. Showers on the 6th floor where we were are full pressure and the convenience of the in room safes and FREE WiFi cannot be overstated. BIGass flat screen LED tv's and comfy lounges had us kicking back and relaxed enough to plan the evening in no time. Even being close to the airport at the south end of the Strip, the rooms were so quiet we never noticed any jet noise. The alarm clocks even had Ipod docks! We didn't have the chance to check out the restaurants, but that can wait until our next visit which will hopefully be very soon. Being just across the street from the MGM Grand and the monorail, the Trop's location is almost perfect. Just far enough away from the rest of the Strip to be quiet, but close enough to the monorail to be able to do the entire Strip in one day! In a nutshell, we have found a new favorite place to stay in Vegas and we will continue to visit as much as possible. The Tropicana has gone from \"rundown\" to \"wonderful\" and is at the time of this writing, the best VALUE in Vegas.

A couple annoyances...the check-in desk is on a raised platform with 5 or so stairs up. This makes checking in with suitcases inconvenient. There is a small ramp, but it's on the opposite side of the check-in area from where you enter at the main doors. Maybe it's a minor inconvenience, but if they just spent millions remodeling the place, why didn't someone think this through? The Island Tower is quite a trek from the casino floor without many distractions along the way. The room was adequate. Best part was the bed--so comfortable! Much more comfortable than Treasure Island, if not Cosmopolitan as well. The recent renovations meant my room was fresh and in good shape. I think the decor will quickly be outdated in another 5 years though. Table minimums were much higher than I expected--$15 most nights with a rare $10 table. Food options are pretty bleak. Thankfully, Starbucks opened the week I was there. The noodles restaurant and side by side cafe were overpriced for the quality of food. Unfortunately, didn't have time to enjoy the pool because it looked like a great setup. The gym was very strange. It was essentially within the wide hallway that led to the pool. 2/5 cardio machines were broken. Overall, my stay was fine.

The waiter, Brian, was not exhibiting the high standard of service we had come to expect there. I gave up trying to get a second drink or even a spoon to stir my 1st one! Cafe Nikki happy hour was a great success though - 4pm-7pm. Fab Mojitos $5 Beer $3! YUM! We loved the location, the rooms, the slots & the friendly but not too over the top staff. There was construction work going on while we were there but we didn't hear anything at all. The only disturbance was in the resturant on the last day as previously mentioned. Great things we did while we were there: Love at The Mirage (Mesmerising!) The Gun Store (Terrifying at first but we had THE BEST Range Master - Brian - a legend!) Hash House A Go Go (HUGE portions!) BLT Burger at The Mirage ( YUM) Gospel Brunch at Mandeley Bay (Great food & a whole lot of soul!) Outlet Shopping Centre (Leave room in your case for lots of bargains.) Freemont Street Experience (Fun old school style!) Not so Great BB Kings Blues Club (Food OK & Fab band but no prices for drinks on the menu & bloody hell that was a dear night!) Drink prices at the House of Blues ($11 for bud light! A cheap but dry night!) I could go on & on but in short - We loved our stay at the Tropicana. I wish I was back there now!

It started with a tip from the hotel manager, when I contacted her about room selection, and she advised that they have i-docks to bring my i-pod and get a white noise application if I'm used to sleeping with sound in the background. Amazing tip. Great for those of us who are light sleepers but love to vacation. The first day of our arrival we were heading out, I asked my friend if she knew when the pool closed and the gentleman that was walking beside her, a staff member, told us, and also asked us if we had just arrived. We said yes, and we weren't even sure how to get out to the strip, he then walked us through the casino, up the escalator and outside, telling us information as we went, really very nice, and then when we were thanking him, he handed us his card, turns out he is the general manager of the restaurants at the Tropicana, Stephen. So we felt really great that he had taken time out of his schedule to show us out and give us advise. Our room overlooked the pool, fairly standard room, but great view of the pool, the strip, and nicely furnished, with new linens and such. All and all we had a really great time, fantastic waiter named Peter at Nikki's cafe. We really enjoyed the pool area, great pool, the weather was hot, the pool was refreshing, and warm enought that I spent a couple hours a day in the water. Pictures to follow.

Refurnished and refreshed. The rooms were spacious with super comfortable beds. The casino and common areas have a bright look to them with all the white they are using. As mentioned in other reviews, they could use more food choices. We ate at the quick grill area and at Cafe Nikki and the coffee and muffins were fresh and tasty and the dinners at the Cafe were outstanding. The pool area was kept extremely clean and the personnel made sure you kept your chairs from overlapping in to the aisles blocking other people. Garbage was picked up constantly. The music being played, while not my choice of music, was not overbearing. At one point we asked if they could switch to a different track as we had heard all the songs once around. They took care of that without hesitation. The casino has room to improve on the slots. We had a blast with what they had. A couple of areas are sparse and could use more machines, but the ones they have gave you a bit of play for your money. Housekeeping did a good job of sprucing up the room except for the last day. We must have taken too long to get out of the room because it never got cleaned. Not the end of the world, but having someone to make my bed each day spoils me while on vacation. I tipped them every day, so they missed out on that the last day. As mentioned in other reviews, they have doormen to hold the doors for you. What a nice touch to be greeted with a smile and a \"Good Morning/Afternoon\"! They helped us find the Pawn Shop and genuinely seemed to care if you were having a good stay. All the employees had smiles and good attitudes. We really felt like they put forth their best effort to be welcoming and we would return. We had no problems with anyone and we were there four nights. Overall I think the property has come a long way. I have to admit, I was doubtful about the whole package: the promises with our existing reservations right through to the customer service. But, no worries. They came through 100%. Everything they promised us at checkin was given without any issues, the renovations were all as described and the customer service was top notch. Thank you Nicole, our vacation was wonderful! The reviews that talk about the \"long\" walk to the pool if you are in the Paradise Tower are ridiculous. If that is considered a long walk, somebody needs to get out and exercise more. This is a smaller size property and not scaled to the size of the MGM or Wynn or Venetian. If you enter the front door you could be at the pool or up to your room within 5 minutes. I like not having to walk for 20 minutes and get lost several times while trying to find something. The elevator wait got a little long Friday evening and Saturday. I would definitely return to this hotel.

I gotta tell you, the incredible changes - all positive - I have seen at the Trop have been astounding. In '06, we went there because it was cheap and affordable, and we couldn't get be picky with where we stayed. The subsequent visits, however, boasted comparable prices with rooms and amenities that rival the best of the best in Vegas and around the world. The rooms were gorgeously decorated in the style of South Beach, with lots of warm whites reminiscent of flowing linens in the sun, and vibrant hot hues like oranges and yellows. The furniture was very well matched, and mostly made of wood. There were beautiful paintings depicting music and dance scenes from South Beach adorning many of the walls. The rooms themselves were wonderfully spacious, and the beds were to die for. When we first checked in we were greeted by a delightful Filipina woman named Yolanda, who held pleasant conversation while simultaneously being of huge assistance. As we walked the short distance to the rear tower, we were greeted nicely by virtually every staff member along the way. There were also a smattering of actors from the Trop's new Mob Experience (mroe on that later), who always stayed in character but still mingled and greeted guests, which was a lot of fun. The view was stunning, as the Trop is located at the same intersection that is shared by the MGM Grand, the Excalibur, and the NYNY. The TVs and all the other applicances/furniture/amenities were all brand new! At one point I called down to guest services and spoke to someone named Pat, and they were so pleasant and helpful. We were able to see the new Celine concert, Beatles LOVE, Ka, and go to attractions like Shark Reef and the Springs Preserve Museum, all because of the help of wonderful staff. Incidentally, we rode to the airport in a cab driven by an older Japanese-American man named Eddie, who said that the Trop has been his beat for over a decade. He asked us how we enjoyed our stay, to which we of course replied that we absolutely loved it. He then told us that he has seen a huge increase in the numbers of people (and therefore, business) at the Trop in the last year, and that every single one of them has been gushing about their stay at the place. He said that the positive changes in guest feedback have been completely consistent and entirely noticeable, whereas before the Trop was just another casino. Now it's a place to be. The place to be.

He had a speech ready which I\u2019m sure he had used millions of times since a lot of people complain (which was confirmed by the Concierge Desk when I was complaining to them). In any event, I called Tropicana that evening and made reservations for Friday, Saturday nights. I was very pleased...the room wasn't ready when we got there and it was getting to 2:30 pm and so the front desk gentlemen removed the resort fee for the two days. (BTW VERY VERY reasonable resort fee compared to other hotels - $9.99). The rooms was really nice and clean and the beds comfortable (stayed in 1621); they did remodel their rooms very nicely. The pool atmosphere was nice, liked the music. NIKI CAFE was awsome!!!! The food was fresh, clean, waiters/waitresses friendly, loved the feel of the outside seating and the high top tables. The view with the waterfall beautiful! I used to stay at Tropicana in my 20's and always enjoyed the atmosphere although the rooms were run down. To my surprise everything has changed and the Hotel, the Service exceeded my expectations fully! Tropicana may not be glitzy with all the expensive stores like Mandalay Bay or MGM...but it is a great value. Very clean and very friendly. I will highly recommend it to my friends with kids and those without kids espcially when Niki Beach opens...BEing alone there with my son, I felt safe in the Tropicana environment...felt welcomed and taken care of. Overall had a great time with my son. We watched KA and a magic show, went to Adventuredome. Shark Reef, I will definitely be back to the Tropicana.

Since we were able to check in before 11 am, I decided to hit the pool for some sun. The pool area AND the pool itself were VERY clean. There was a little noise from the construction underway on the other side of the pool area and it was drowned out very nicely (not even noticable) by the music playing ! The new pool area should be finished by May....judging from the progress the crew made during our short stay, I'd say they are on target. All renovations are very nicely done.

I have read the reviews and it seemed people have found staying there was a long and boring walk to their room, so we decided to check our bags and wait till or room in the Paradise Tower was ready. The next day we decided to see for ourselves how boring this walk would have been. i can honestly say that is quite the contrary. The walk down the connecting walkway was no trouble at all.(6-8 minutes) And the views from that tower were fantastic. I would stay in either tower when we go back. Unfortunately the pool was closed during our stay but it sure looked very inviting and the grounds just added to it. Also the location of the hotel is at the quiet end of the strip which was quite nice if you wanted to go out for a late walk. All in all the tropicana is a great place to stay.

The dealers were very nice except for the ones on the craps table commenting that they had a audience and that they would charge $20 for watching. We found that pretty unprofessional as we were only trying to learn the rules of the game so we could try playing, but with those comments, we just walked away. We were quite pleased with our stay. The only downfall was that we had to take taxis mostly everywhere because of the location of this hotel. Of course we stayed at the Ceasars Palace, the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Luxor the other times and Tropicana is not comparable, but on the other hand, when you stay at those fancy places you have to go elsewhere to play the tables because of the high limits they have there. I would probably stay more central next time only because we like to walk and visit around and Tropicana was a bit too far on one end.

Yes, the hotel is a little out of the main drag but it's next to MGM, New York New York and Luxor so no big deal. 3. It's very easy to get to the I15 which is a great way of avoiding the Strip when you're driving. Once you've driven the Strip you'll know why that's important! 4. Wi-fi was a pain.

Good parts about being in this location include the fact that there's slightly less hubbub at night, and it's near the Town Centre Mall which has a good cinema and eating options and is so simple to drive to.

I found it quite pleasant. 8. Pool area will be good. Massively under construction as I type so we're like sardines on the sunbeds that are round the open part of the pool. It's ok though and I think it will be very good once completed. 9. I must comment. You can walk to The Cosmopolitan Hotel. They do a buffet there, the Wicked Spoon. It is brilliant!

Added to the hotel are a Starbucks (sadly and annoyingly not opened yet!), an over-priced grill (but surprisingly tasty pizza!), and a Nikki Cafe, which is attached to the soon-to-be-completed Nikki Beach pool they're building! Overall, a happy experience here, and while not the multitude of things to see/do as most of the other casinos, it's close to them, and cheaper, so you really can't go wrong.

After reading many positive reviews on the New Tropicana I thought I would contact Nicole Marshal to check out what kind of deal we could get. She is the main reason we decided to book, she is prompt, helpful and very nice to talk to on the phone. The only thing is we did try to meet her during our stay and we were never able to thank her in person. I digress, before the trip started, Nicole gave us great deals/rates for our five day visit that I cancelled our free/comped stay at MGM as I figured it was worth a try. She made our dinner reservations at Biscayne for us and the meal was very good, got us tickets to Recycled Percussion which was fun, but was very short, not even an hour long. I read that staff at the Trop are exceptional, we on the other hand never met any staff that left any lasting impression on us. None were rude but none went out of their way to help us except for Patrick the doorman/bellman, when we arrived he was very attentive. The casino is bright, abit too much for me, but was clean and enjoyed the cocunut scent throughout the property. We did play slots quite abit here, never won anything, and we would have liked it to have been bigger with more selection, but that is just our personal preference. Food choices are not great at the moment but were told that quicker food options are underway, which will be nice since right now there is no place to pick up a quick slice of pizza, coffee etc. Our room was nice, clean, and a good size for a standard room, but I was dissapointed on the floor and view, since I did request higher/strip view, and we received 10th floor facing construction and Hooters, but again, we do not stand looking out the window for hours on end so this was not a huge deal for us, just would have been a nice perk to have had it. The bathrooms like others have said, still look abit worn and dated, but they serve the purpose. Housekeeping was always done when we returned to our room around 5.00 pm everydaynto freshen up except the very first day it was still not done, but we just went downstairs for about an hour and when we returned the room was cleaned. We had internet in our room that worked quickly and was nice to have. All in all, we will definately stay at the Trop again, we like that location, but we like to walk alot. We hope our next visit the construction is done, and the food choices are better. Thank you to Nicole for all she did to make our trip nice, it was much appreciated. Oh one more thing, our flight home was not till 8.30 pm, and she arranged a late checkout for 4.00 but mentioned to ask that day to see if we could extend it till 6.00 pm and the front desk did, for free. No other hotel has done that for us before, and this was really nice to have the day of our leaving since we had access to our room and did not have to worry about moving our bags early in the day.

To start with the positive, the hotel\u2019s staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from the door staff and front desk right through housekeeping. Brad Garrett\u2019s Comedy Club is fantastic, and if you get a chance to see comedian Michael Loftus when you are in Vegas, take it! The guy had our diverse group crying. On the down side, the awful odor of fake coconut that pervades the property is truly nauseating, and even extends to the restaurants. I\u2019d guess that since the hotel likely has a higher proportion of chain smokers than many others in Vegas, they are trying to compensate with the Smell-O-Vision, but it doesn\u2019t work. That, along with bright orange 1970s-era carpeting and a preponderance of trashy clientele (even by Vegas standards) made me regret my choice. The Tropicana\u2019s location at the end of the Strip gets annoying very quickly, especially when you realize that its amenities (many still under construction) don\u2019t measure up to the rest of the Strip. The restaurants, like many in Vegas, are staffed by well-meaning but untrained waiters. The pasta restaurant served me a $22 plate of the \u201chouse special\u201d rigatoni which was simply inedible. The waiter did ask me how the food was, 20 minutes after serving it. While adequate, our room was nothing like the others noted in reviews below, lacking a fridge, coffee maker, or new decor. We weren\u2019t offered any \u201cfree upgrades\u201d, and we were charged a steep $75 for a late checkout at 5 p.m. The verdict: you can do a lot better for the same price in Vegas, and even the best staff can\u2019t make up for a remote location and a bad smell.

I always enjoy my visits, partly because I'm a pretty low maintenance person and partly because I'm prepared to roll with the punches to make the very BEST of my precious vacation time. We decided to stay at the Tropicana this trip, and I was so impressed with the place that it may become my new \"regular\" hotel. The service started before we ever left home. I emailed Nicole Marshall with some questions and requests, and she responded promptly with all the information I wanted. Hooray! I did not run into one grumpy or rude staff member the whole time I was there. Our waiter at Bacio was particularly awesome, as was the woman who checked us out. I wish I could remember their names to give them proper credit, but I'm terrible at that. One evening we needed more towels, and housekeeping was at our door within ten minutes, towels in hand. The room was fabulous. We got a suite in the Paradise Tower with a beautiful view of the Strip ... we could see MGM, Excalibur, NYNY and Monte Carlo quite well. We had a coffee maker, a refrigerator with bottled water, a desk, a couch, a nice chair with ottoman, a big flat screen TV and a bureau in the living room area. In the bedroom, of course, there was a cushy, inviting King bed, another TV, another chair, a closet with full length mirrored doors, two nightstands, and a safe large enough to store our laptop computer with plenty of space to spare. It was clean and spacious, and if there weren't a thousand things to do in Vegas, I could've spent hours just enjoying the room! Our room was cleaned and our amenities were replenished daily. FYI, they have hair dryers in the rooms, and they provide some pretty good smelling shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion if you want to travel lighter and leave yours behind! The casino was pleasant and enjoyable. I only play slots, so my opinion doesn't factor in table games, but they had a good variety of slots. I didn't win big, but if I held that against a property, I'd have to dislike MOST places in Vegas! The good news is that I didn't lose big, either. And although the casino is a bit smaller than surrounding ones, I liked it because I never felt disoriented. We ate once at Cafe Nikki and once at Bacio, and both meals were good. It's true that the Tropicana doesn't presently have a huge variety of eating options, but being located within easy walking distance to other places made it an absolute non-issue for us. The pool and hottubs were fantastic. Even though it was fairly busy while we were there, we found chairs by the pool pretty easily. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that if you want to use the hottub at night after the pool closes, there are no towels available nearby. So be prepared to bring towels from your room if you go down after 7 pm for a soak. During the day, there was ample staff to provide us with towels and drinks poolside!

This was my first time in Vegas, and we prepared months ahead to ensure that we had an amazing time. Reading all the fabulous reviews about the Tropicana and the details and attention they have towards their guests, we decided to give it a shot. I started exchanging emails with Nicolle Marshall, guest relations manager, explaining to her that we were getting married and that I wanted to treat my wife to an special week in Las Vegas. Since I read that so many guests got upgrades and gifts for this special ocasion, she was kind enough to offer us a free upgrade upon availability. Lets divide this review into different aspects: Check in: Quick. Theres always a little line of people but nothing that will keep you waiting for more than 10 min. Upon check in, we were told that there was nothing available for an upgrade in the paradise tower (which is the one on top of the casino) but that we were gonna get a mini suite in the island tower. I like to walk, and the first two times we walked towards our room we were fine. But after the second time, it gets annoying. It is definitely a long long walk, and it feels longer if you've been walking all day. We were located in the first floor, last room. First night went by, and exactly at 7:45 am in the morning the construction of the new club (Nikki Beach) started. Someone with a motor drill was right outside our window drilling in a way that it felt he was inside with us drilling the bathroom. Needless to say I WALKED all the way to front desk and complained about it, and we were told that if we wanted to relocate to the paradise tower all they had to offer us was a regular room. Of course I took it cause id rather stay in a smaller room without the noise of a construction outside my window. We were offered our first night on them, a nice detail I guess, but I didnt get my sleep after that. Cleanliness: The rooms are nice. Clean. They can improve the bathrooms a little more, since they look old. But in general the renovations in the room are really nice, Nice TV, ipod dock, and cold A/C. Casino: Small, to me it was great cause since Im not a gambler, I could just walk around between the few tables they have and gamble here and there. One thing to note is that if you are playing slots, you will rarely be offered any drinks, as a matter of fact there were 2 times that I couldn't even see or find someone to ask for a drink. On the other hand when I was playing roulette and poker drinks were flowing all the time. Costumer service: Excellent. To me the nicest people in the hotel have to be the valet service, Outstanding, nice people that are always ready and running to get your car. People in check in were really nice as well. Food: We only had the chance to go to Cafe Nikki for breakfast, we got there around 10:15 am to find out that we had to wait 15 min to be sat, not because there were no tables (half the place was empty) but because they didnt have enough servers at the time. I was bugged by it. I wanted a nice patio table (there were like 6 open tables there) and I was told by the hostess that patio wasn't open anymore, that we had to wait for something in the dining room or we could just self sit ourselves at the bar. Needless to say, we sat at the bar, the breakfast buffet was great with really good and fresh food and at a decent price (16$). It really got me thinking why would you only have staff for half a restaurant and make people wait. Its just not my style to have breakfast at the bar, but then again, a lot of guests had to sit there in order to get quick service. Bartender was super nice. I cant give a review on the rest of restaurants since we didn't eat there. Rooms: The regular room that we had to get in the paradise tower, was between 2 suites, connected through doors. Which means if you have no luck and someone decides to throw a party, you are in for a long night. Luckily enough only one night we were bothered by noise coming from one of the suites, but be aware of this. Pool: Small nice pool, with people always offering you towels and making sure you are having a good time. Nothing outstanding, but im sure when the renovations are over is going to look much better. Check out: When we got to the check out, this lady handed me the final bill, which didn't have the first night that was i offered off. When i pointed this out, she said that there were no notes on it, and looked at me. Of course i asked for a manager, which came out immediately and was really nice and helpful. He just asked me for the name of the manager I talked to. Thankfully i remembered the name, but im so distracted that normally i tend to forget names, so be careful and if you talk to a manager or costumer service, make sure you remember the names of the people you are talking to. He then took off the night and offered us to waive the resort fee for all the hassle we went through. Conclusion: Tropicana is a nice hotel, with nice rooms and great costumer service. Sadly all this reviews saying that you get free stuff and upgrades, on my personal experience, didnt happen at all. All we got offered when we were walking to our room the first night was a \"complimentary dinner\", which we accepted, only to find out after more than 20 min talking to an asian lady that could barely speak english, that we had to attend a timeshare exposition the following day at 11am, and then find out that they were completely booked, so we wasted our time, their time, and we got no complimentary meal. My final thought is that you will have an average experience at the tropicana, with nice rooms and smiley people, but after my first time in Vegas, i realized that for the same price, or maybe a little more, I cant get a room in a much bigger and better managed property. All we got for our wedding week in Vegas was a waived resort fee, and a free night because there was a construction outside our window, otherwise, it would've been a regular hotel stay. No upgrade to a suite, no free tickets, no coupons (they were out of coupons books...really? in vegas?), not even a coupon for their comedy club. No hard feelings at all cause at least we got a clean room and nice service, but I won't be staying in tropicana next time I go to vegas. As for Mrs. Marshall, I emailed her the day before our check in to confirm everything, got no answer, or no follow up on our stay. Keep up the work. communicate better with your guests, finish those renovations, and im sure that the Tropicana will be a much better hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Luis Obispo, California, USA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "mamalad", "ReviewID": "UR103348199", "Content": "Had a wonderful time at the tropicana this week!

The front tower is closer to the casino, but loud due to the proximity of the strip (think sirens all night). the back tower is a little walk from the casino, but closer to the pool and much more quiet.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cDiamond in the ruff.loved it...loved it!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Vegaslady58", "ReviewID": "UR103284842", "Content": "Travel to Vegas 4 times a year....The Tropicana was incredible.

I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect staying there, as I had only been to Vegas one other time, 5 years ago. Well, I have to tell you, I was delighted with my experience. Here are some details. The property: It looks pretty good, but they are clearly working on it right now to update it. I think in around 6 months it will have a new pool and a dance club. The room: The room was clean as a whistle with contemporary styling. The bathroom was a bit older than I would have liked. I actually informed the management of a problem I had with the bathroom, and they were able to move me to an upgraded room for my last night. All hotels have problems and it is how they handle them that makes the difference. One of the highlights of the rooms (both I stayed in) were the beds. They are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. They were absolutely wonderful, and I did not want to get up in the morning! The bedding is attractive\u2026it has the European look where the duvet is white and they put on accent pillows. No old school bedspreads\u2026yay! By the way, flat screen TV too. The entertainment: The timing was such that music legend Gladys Knight was doing a show and I was able to see it. I could not stay in my seat- song after song of fantastic hits, bringing back memories and making me smile. She really connected with the audience which made the experience even more special. A gem of a show. The lounge outside of the theatre also had some really fun entertainment. I saw the Brad Garrett comedy show too on another night and that was good for a lot of laughs. The food: I ate at Caf\u00e9 Nikki twice-once for breakfast and once for lunch. The food is fresh and wonderful. Never made it to the steak place (Biscayne, I think?) but it looked top notch. The pool: I enjoyed one entire afternoon at the pool reading and relaxing. I sat next to a friendly group of 20 something guys. The guys were drinking up a storm and enjoying what sounded like their 3rd or so afternoon at the hotel pool. The service for drinks was great- the waitresses were around a lot to keep the drinks flowing. It would have been awesome to eat lunch poolside, but they do not offer that. There were lots of security-looking guys who kept making the rounds at the pool. I was finally wondering if there was a celebrity around or something, to explain why. One young, handsome employee in a suit (he was not a security guy, I don\u2019t think) started talking to the guys sitting next to me. He brought up that he wanted to try to set the up the guys at the Excalibur pool for the next day. It seemed odd that he was sending business (tons of drinks, for sure) to another hotel. Staff: Every single employee I dealt with was exceptionally polite and friendly. Where ever I went at the Tropicana, there were always employees around to help with your needs and answer questions. So, I recommend the Tropicana for a surprisingly luxurious bed, the awesome Gladys Knight show, delicious food, and the really friendly staff who do their best to please. I can\u2019t guarantee that this will happen to you, but I also won a few hundred bucks there playing roulette in their casino!

This trip we were going to celebrate my birthday. We typically stay at Harrahs but because of the excellent reviews and the crazy price we got through the airline we decided to give the trop a try. We arrived via taxi to the hotel. First thing we noticed was the area was under construction. Which didn't bother us just a bit of an eye sore. We pulled up to the entrance, which has been updated and seemed very nice. There was no one there to greet us or to offer assistance with our bags. This really didn't bother us but thought I would mention it becuase I remember other commenting on the greeting they recieved. Walked into the casino/hotel lobby and had to find someone to ask where to check in. Found the check in and everything went smooth. No upgrade offered nor did we ask. Got up to our rooms which was not that bad of a walk. The room was nice and updated. Bed was comfy and for the price we were happy. The casino, just was not our style. Seemed older and just no real atmoshphere. We did play a little bit but just wasn't feeling the vibe. One note, we didn't get any cocktail service while we were playing and come to think about it I don't remember seeing any CW around the machines. Did see a few around the tables though. I ended up moving to a video poker machine at the bar and the bar tenders there were always great, friendly, and on top of things. I guess the bottom line here is we spent most of our time at other casinos gambling. As far as eating we had other food places outside the trop on our list so we didn't have any major meals here. However, we did come in late a couple of nights and ate at the sandwich place in the trop. the first night it took along time to get our sandwich (30 minutes) but once we got our food it was really good. The second night when we came back in late we decided to give them another shot and service was much better and the food was great again. One other negative for us there was no starbucks or coffee house in the hotel. Each morning we ended up going over to the MGM to get our starbucks fix. So the only major negative that happened to us was during our last night there. We got back to our room around midnight and noticed someone had checked into the room next to us. They must have decided to have a private party and had there radio sitting right next to the door that adjoined our rooms. So instead of making a fuss about having them turn down the music and calm down the other things that were going on in there we decided to move. We called down to the desk and requested to be moved. They had no problems moving us. This was a pain to back up everything and move to a different room but seemed to be a better option then fighting with strangers in the next room or laying awake listening to there sounds all night. When we got down to our new room it was all good. But I noticed that this room also has an adjoining door to the room next door. Lucky for us there was no one in the room so all was calm. It just seems strange that after all the money they spent to upgrade/update there rooms they would have sealed up some of the adjoining room doors. Not sure, but I am assuming most of the standard rooms have the adjoining room doors. In my past experience these adjoining doors always allows for to much noise to be shared. To sum things up, we are planning another trip to vegas this summer and have decided to stay at another property. Just becuase we like a different casino vibe and like to have lots of things to do in the property we are staying at. But for the price we paid I have no issues with the trop.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Big Change\u201d", "Author": "cgarmer", "ReviewID": "UR102904654", "Content": "Wow, this is an all new Trop.

The iHome made getting ready to go out a lot more fun. Loud music and beer with your \"s#!t, shower and shave\" is always a good time. The tub did need to be redone; it was the only thing not remodeled. The casino was different than most others. The Trop has a more laid back feel. You will not see the 35 person craps table with the screaming, yelling, high fives and billows of cigar smoke. You will however be able to find a table or slot in a nice atmosphere with comfy chairs. The white interior mixed with the dark wood and the red lighting does give the Trop a Miami feel. My wife and I had a great time losing our money there, but an even better time winning it al back right before we left. This is a gem on the strip. Most people do not know about the remodel or the quick cocktail service. The only negative, and it is not even a negative about the Trop, is the area you need to walk through to get from the middle of the strip to the Trop. Between the Plant Hollywood and the MGM there is a stretch of Las Vegas Blvd that is a little shady at 3am. We did it one night then decided that was enough and got a bus pass.

The hotel is very close to the airport and we paid 15 dollars for the cab ride as the driver decided to take the long way. It should not cost that much. We booked our stay at the Tropicana over three months in advance since we saw a crazy deal for $144.51 for four nights tax included. Based on the reviews we contacted Nicole Marshall to verify our reservation and get a room with two beds in the Paradise Tower which is near the strip and front entrance. We were very dismayed to upon check in to find out our room was in the Island Tower. The desk clerk said there were no rooms with two beds available in the Paradise Tower. So much for booking ahead of time. The last thing we wanted to do after walking all day on the strip was to walk another two blocks just to get to our hotel room. The room was very nice and looks just like the photos on the hotel website. The beds are very comfortable and we had no issues with the room except the location. The casino is bright and cheerful instead of dingy like it used to be. Its nice to gamble in and the drink service was better at night than during the day or early evening. We knew about the slot promotion so we decided to get a card but the line up was long so we got one later after losing a lot of money in the slots and never bothered using it. We asked for a coffee maker and did receive a Keurig coffee maker and all the stuff to make coffee with which was good. We knew about the resort fee which is $9.99 per day plus 8% tax and did not feel we got anything of value for paying it as we didn't go to Vegas to sit by the pool. We never ate anything at the hotel as the dining options were expensive. We spent most of our time at Planet Hollywood seeing shows and eating at the buffets so probably after wasting time walking back and forth we should of just stayed at Planet Hollywood which has no resort fee. We looked at the sky high menu prices of all the Tropicana restaurants and it would be nice if there was at least some specials in the restaurants. We don't want to eat greasy fast food but a restaurant with reasonable prices and we probably would of stayed gambling more at the hotel. I know we gambled enough at Planet Hollywood because we were there eating most of the time. Its a nice hotel and I would recommend staying there at least once while its new but I don't think I would stay there again.

I've been many times but never stayed at the Tropicana. After reading many reviews and reading about all the changes, I was curious. I was able to get a great deal which included airfare and 4 nights at the Trop (through Expedia). There were a few issues. I had read about the bathroom floor tiles being old and some were dirty/chipped, so I expected it. Too bad that they renovated the washrooms and didn't bother to replace the floors, looks bad. Also the bathroom doors are very old, knob was very old looking and the door itself was dirty and looked like it needed to be painted. The bathtub and shower is ok, but they have one of those curved shower curtain rods, with only one curtain. So if you leave the curtain on the outside of the tub while showering, water gets all over the bathroom floor. And if you leave it on the inside of the tub, the curtain slowly starts to open at both ends and you still end up getting water all over the bathroom floor. This should be fixed, very poor design. I ended up having to request extra bath towels so we could cover the floor near the tub. We arrived late at night and the only place to eat was at Cafe Nikki. We were too tired to start walking around the strip to look for other food options. It wasn't very busy at Cafe Nikki but we still had to wait for a table due to the fact that they didn't have enough servers. The late night menu was very limited, compared to the regular menu. It took a long time to get our food, and when we got it, it was average. The dressing on the caesar salad was below average, I'd say. The people who work there are friendly and generally nice, they try their hardest to please. Currently there aren't a lot of options for food, but they are working on a Starbucks and a marketplace with casual food/fast food. One day I wanted a latte and I asked at Cafe Nikki where I could get one. I was told that I could order one at their bar (inside Cafe Nikki), so I did. They use Starbucks products, but I paid a lot more than what I would have paid for that same latte had I gone to a Starbucks (over $2 more!). The room was nice and clean. We had a view of the strip, which was nice. The flat screen tv is nice, but there's not a great selection of channels. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, so it wasn't a big deal. The pool that is open, was nice. I understand they are working on a large beach-style pool area, called Nikki Beach, which is supposed to be really nice. I like that the casino isn't huge. It does get busy but you can still get around easily (unlike at some of the bigger hotels/casinos). I also appreciate that once you enter the front door, the elevators are close by (for the Paradise Tower). You don't have to walk through miles and miles of smoke-filled casino to get to your room. When you first arrive, there are stairs to get up into the lobby. We asked about that and were directed to the right, where there is a ramp to get in. I don't remember seeing any signs directing us to the ramp though. There were usually one or two bellmen at the front doors who would open the doors for some guests, but at times there was no staff around or they were busy talking to each other. When my mother and I got inside, we were greeted by more stairs, on the left side, where the registration desks are. We asked the bellman to help us with our bags, which he did. We were later told that there is also a ramp (to the right of the front desk). It can get noisy outside at night, and we did hear sirens on a few occasions. In all my previous stays (at MGM, Mandalay Bay, Treasure Island) I don't remember hearing as much outside noise. Also, the construction that is still going on (on the outside of the property), started at 6:00 am. Our room was on the 9th floor, and we were able to hear it, although it wasn't bad enough to keep us awake. We gambled and ate at some of the other casinos on the strip and mostly just slept at the Trop. As far as some reviewers who mentioned that there is mostly an older crowd at the Trop, I don't agree. We saw quite a mix of people, ranging from their 20's all the way up to 60's/70's. I think a lot of the younger people are seeing what a good value this hotel is, and are giving it a chance. Overall, the rooms are clean and the beds are super comfy. Water pressure in the shower is good once you turn the dial on the showerhead to the 'massage' setting. Bathrooms could be better, but they are still decent. Tip: bring your own bath soap because they don't have any, just hand soap and a shower gel (I'm not a fan of shower gel and theirs did not have a great scent). Carpets everywhere are new, and the hotel staff are all very friendly and willing to help when necessary. It's on the south end of the strip but easy to get anywhere. We tried the bus ('the duece') and for $5 you get a 2 hour pass, or for $7 you get a 24 hour pass. There are stops at most of the hotels. The bus is a bit on the slow side because of all the stops it makes and how many people get on and ask questions, etc, so not a good option if you're in a hurry.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cGood Location on South Strip\u201d", "Author": "WardCleaver", "ReviewID": "UR102567658", "Content": "We stayed for two nights during Spring break.

On the strip, the rooms are big and clean, and I paid roughly $70 a night in the middle of March Madness. I was skeptical on the way there, but hotel was really a treat in terms of value. Some minor complaints: 1) No poker room. I'm not holding this against the hotel, as it simply wasn't ready yet, but apparently will be in a few months. 2) Room service refused to take cash..unless you asked them twice. Every night when I got back to the room, I ordered a meal at some absurd hour before I went to sleep. Every night, room service absolutely refused to take cash, until I told them they took it the night before. The argument was like groundhog day. 3) Lastly, I gave a reasonable amount of action to the Blackjack tables on a daily basis, losing at least $300 every night to them. I wasn't chasing comps or anything, but there was 1 supervisor there that saw me every night playing, to the point he asked me and my friends feedback on a new dealer (he was terrible, but I digress). On the second last night I was there, there was a drunk guy next to me betting $20 a hand constantly, until the very same supervisor came over, and he quickly bet $200. The supervisor quickly comped his stay, whilst acknowledging my presence but not even hinting at any sort of comp. That was day 10 of my 11 day stay. You can do the math at how much I lost at the BJ tables. A dinner would have been nice...

The bed was awewome. Service was pretty good. We ate at the Nikki cafe which was good food and also the Biscayne which was a nice expereince. I didn't find that they were overpriced, they were comparable to every other place in Vegas as far as I could see. We were able to get a late checkout until 3.00 but our friends staying in the paradise tower in a standard room weren't. The smell when you entered was actually very nice, not too overpowering.

We went to see Recycled Percussion while we were there (thanks Nicole), also a fantastic show I highly recommend it. I want to preface by saying that I have previously stayed at Caesar's, The Mirage, and the Wynn. I think the Trop culd be competitive with these properties, except they need more restaurants/coffee shops. We found ourselves leaving the property every morning to grab coffee and a bite elsewhere. Which usually meant we would do our gambling elsewhere. Location is a bit south but we enjoyed the walk, so that was not a problem. The location of the Paradise Tower was fantastic at the end of a long day. Gambling at the Trop is tight in the day and loosens up at night. The only problem we really had was at check-in. We were early (around 11:30AM) so understandably our room wasn't ready yet, but the bellman suggested we go try the front desk anyways. The guy behind the front desk (Terry) was very rude how he told us we were too early to check in. No smile No hello. Just rude. He told us to come back at 2pm for checkin. Well, at 2pm the checkin line was huge and after waiting over 30 minutes, luck of the draw we got Terry again. Even ruder than the first time, saying he told us we were wasting time and that we could not checkin until after 3PM! We reminded him that he told us 2pm and that we just waited so long in line, and that tons of people were being checked in in front of us, we saw them leaving with their keycards. So finally he brushed us off and said come back in half an hour and just come straight to him and we won't have to wait in line. When 3:15 came around we made eye contact with him and approached the desk as he was finishing up with someone, he took off in back and then we saw him slip onto the casino floor leaving us hanging. Thankfully the line was shorter now and we were checked in by Evie who was a doll. Tropicana if you are reading this, so something about Terry!

There was absolutely no line at the desk to check in and 3 people available to help us. This trip was for my 30th birthday, and our first time in Vegas, so we wanted it to be special. We asked if they had any rooms available with a King sized bed. The woman at the desk was trying to be helpful and look up rooms, but she wasn't sure what to do so she called over her manager, Thomas, who quickly found us an incredible suite on the 19th floor. He also bought us dinner at Cafe Nikki, which was delicious and completely unexpected. When we finally made it up to our suite, the view of the strip was amazing. Yes, it was a bit of a walk to Paradise Tower, but completely worth it to stay in such a luxurious room. The bed was huge and incredibly comfortable. The $10 per night resort fee was completely worth it for use because we used the internet every single day. The bathroom was large & our sitting room with mini bar & fridge was very nice also. The alarm clock with radio & ipod player was a nice touch. Our only complaint about this room was that the TV in the bedroom did not work at all! There must have been something wrong with the connection because the picture came through all fuzzy. We ordered room service from Cafe Nikki one night after returning from Arizona on a day trip and it was very fast and tasty. The casino itself was very nice, a little on the smallish side, but that was almost refreshing after walking through the MGM casino atleast 20 times to get to the shuttle. We played a ton of blackjack late night/early morning and the dealers were very friendly and nice and even waved at us a few times when we were just passing through. I also LOVED the slight coconut scent that seemed to infiltrate the entire casino and hotel. I don't know how they did it, but we loved it. The tropical music was fun as well. We regret that we did not get to experience the Mob Show, but next time for sure! It was fun to see the characters walking around the hotel. The renovations did not bother us at all, probably because we were so high up and couldn't even hear them. The pool area will be amazing once they have it finished. All in all, we easily gave everything about this hotel 5 stars. From the minute we walked in the door of the Tropicana, everyone on staff helped make our trip unforgettable.

So I know what good service is. I was so amazed at how the employees at the Trop treated me and my friends. Just a few quick highlights that I can remember. Our waitress in the Sportsbook, Claire, was such a nice person and hard worker! I kept looking at the full sportsbook wondering how she gets around to everyone and back to us so fast. It was amazing. I guess she is into fitness or something, because for the entire time we were there (all day) she never looked tired! She was funny too, great sense of humor! She also called us by name which was really cool. We also had another girl with a tatoo on her back that was super nice and fast. She was very attentive and sweet as well. I should also say the sportsbook guys were so nice to us, they kept offering to give us better seats but we had great seats. They helped us when it was super busy. They called us by names. I loved it. I went from the Sportsbook to Cafe Nikki all the time to eat. I thought that was the best hotel cafe I have been in. The girls out front, Ecko and the other girl can't remember her name, but super bubbly, great smile, they were great. We never had to wait. They dealt with big crowds and always smiled. They worked long hours, they were there for break, lunch and dinner. The waiters and waitresses inside worked hard and were super attentive to me and my friends. So nice! I really think good service brings people back and these employees went the extra mile for us. I also ordered room service and the guy was up in about 2 min! I cracked up, how could you get up there so fast??? I also had good service from the valets and bellman! And the front desk girl that checked me in and out was awesome. They even charged my friends phone!!!!! I have already told at least 15 people to come and also told my classes (ha ha) to go, so that makes about 80 ppl so far! I loved my experience there! So a huge thank you to Todd Kunesh and his team, they gave us 5 star service and it seemed effortless.

I am, frankly, puzzled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. It ain't that great....by Vegas standards. First, note that the hotel room, while recently \"remodeled\" is pretty much your standard 1956 Holiday Inn room. It was two beds, a TV and a phone. No fridge, no microwave, none of the modern trappings you might find in pretty much any two and a half star hotel near the freeway. The bathroom was a similar 1956 style. The \"remodelling\" consists of new bedding and new wallpaper. There were new sinks in the bathroom, but the shower was the standard tub with shower like one might have at home in the basement bathroom. Nothing glamorous about this place. The rooms were relatively clean--although it took until 6 p.m. to get maid service. Some folks are picky about dirty tile grout; if so, you won't like this place. The tile is all original to the building. And is dirty. That's a picky point, but when the selling point is the $80million rehab... Some folks have raved about the service here; I would comment on it if I actually got any. The luggage help was non-existant, and no one was at the door to even point us to the front desk. The hotel restaurants are OK, service there just OK, but the prices are gigantic. You cannot get breakfast here for under $16.00. Beer at the bars: $9. Shot of tequila: $14. There are a couple of specialty restaurants on the Mezzanine level, one steak/seafood, the other Italian. Those are also Vegas-expensive and forgettable. Now, about the Casino. Suffice it to say that this is NOT the HIP casino on the strip. It is more like the \"hip replacement\" casino. The casino is VERY small, and in three nights playing there I never once saw anyone screaming that they won...the slot games are dated and old. There were only a very few card tables. Most of our group went elsewhere to gamble. This same group stayed at Mandalay Bay, The Hotel, on our last trip. This hotel and casino is the polar opposite of that. Would I stay here again? If I needed a cheap place to stay, yes. If I were looking for a luxurious Vegas experience, no. The primary reason to stay here is price. You get a plain-jane 1956 era hotel room that has had recent paint and bedding changes. No glitz. No glamour.

The first room had adjoining doors, this felt as if we were sharing with strangers as you could hear everything next door. Second room with no adjoining doors was very peaceful which was ideal for a nocturnal holiday pattern! Great view of the Strip too. Both the rooms were of a high standard, great furnishings, comfy beds and decent bathrooms. Not sure about the constant air freshener (of a tropical theme), got a bit tiresome in hallways and sneaking into the rooms but necessary in the smoky casino I guess.

We both ate at the Nikki several times and quite enjoyed it (although we found it was quite noisy in the evenings on the weekend). We did not try the Biscayne or the Bacio and the Ocean Deli (Beach Deli?) was closed for renovations. As it was my birthday, we were given the 'Romance Package' free of charge, which was very nice.

While waiting outside for our cab at the airport, we could actually see the sign for our casino. However, the cab ride there was about $22! I forgot to tell him to take a certain way there that I had read on the internet (not that I even know if he took that way or not) but let's just say that the cab ride back to the airport was $10! We got to the check-in counter at around 9:30PM and up to our rooms in about 10 minutes tops. The check-in was efficient, the lady at the counter was polite, and we had no problems finding our room. The hotel is relatively easy to navigate through and the only place we did find difficult to find from our room in the towers was the pool because of the lack of signs. We could see it from our room, we knew where it was when we got near it, but we didn't know which door to take to get to it. We often found that at most hotels, they want you to get lost. One could easily take out their frustration (money) on a slot machine! The rooms have been recently remodelled and so they do not look as dated as the lobby - very modern. The shutters are beautiful AND hide the lights, both at night and during the day. The beds are very high and comfortable and we were able to fall asleep with ease. The only complaint I have about the sleeping conditions is the construction happening just outside our window. They are now in their third phase of construction on the hotel and it just so happened to be right below us. It wasn't THAT bad, and the guys worked very hard at it all day long, but I did wake up a couple of mornings from the banging. Problem solved by buying ear plugs the next day at the pharmacy. There were some window washers one morning at 9am and again, it's their job, but it would have been nice to see them at the window a little bit later. We never really saw the maid but she was always there to make our beds and fold our towels for us. My blow dryer didn't work the first day and she was quick to replace it when I left a note and a couple of dollars. I was very appreciative. The casino here was relatively small compared to the bigger places, but we enjoyed this because those long walks everywhere else tired us out! There were always enough slots, and the centre tables were pretty busy at most times of the day. My friend went up to a \"Let it ride,\" table and asked the dealer to teach her and he had no problem helping her out. We went to see \"Recycled Percussion,\" which was located right near the entrance of the hotel, and it was fantastic! There were also people walking around advertising the \"Mob Experience\" show and we would have loved to check that out but there wasn't enough time. We went swimming on the second last day and the temperature was great, the pool was busy, and the life guards/supervisors were very friendly. Only half of the pool was open due to the renovations but that was the side that got the sun at the end of the day! We ate at Cafe Nikki the last morning and had a nice meal before our flight. They had a breakfast buffet for $16.99 and the food seemed to look very good. I had oatmeal with dried fruits and it was delicious and cost $7.00. Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend it to friends.

So, my friend gave her a credit card. I understand she probably has to explain this to alot of people but it was a bad first impression. On the way to the room, me and Carri talked about how rude she was. The room looked good, standard 2 bed. Very clean. But there's no microwave, no coffee maker and no fridge (oh, unless you ask for one ahead of time and then it's $20. a night).

The hotel staff made us feel like our business was truly appreciated and they wanted us to have the best experience possible within the hotel. I have to say, walking in through the glass doors and into a bright environment with the white marble floors and colorful decorations was refreshing. It really started the mood for the whole trip. As we walked to the front desk, which is less than 60' from the hotel entrance, which is awesome, I didn't feel lost not knowing where the front desk was.

The hotel is being renovated, but it's still very pleasant and will be even more so when the work has been completed. The restaurants were quite satisfactory. Cafe Nikki provided a nice breakfast brunch. Foodies should check out the prix fixe at Biscayne for dinner; on the night I went, I had a choice between Ostrich Tenderloin and Seared Bronzino for main courses, along with suitable wine pairings. As of March 2011, the pool was a work in progress, but was already lovely, with a sloping green lawn and plantings leading down to an art deco shaped pool surrounded by chaises and cabanas. The casino has white walls, which makes it a little brighter than the usual cave-like Vegas gambling den. The waitress came around twice during the time I was playing slots, and like everyone at the hotel was very friendly. The room was terrific, recently renovated in soothing desert colors. There was no minibar, but ice and soda machines are available in the hallway. The only reason I'm assigning 4 stars instead of 5 is that I requested a view of the Strip, but instead was given a room facing the rear of the building, with a view of about 1000 acres of parking lots and the airport in the distance. Also, when I checked in I was told that the hotel didn't have a room of the type I'd reserved available at the time, so I was going to be upgraded to a suite, and then moved after 2 nights when a King room became available. Therefore I had to wait around on day 3 to check with the front desk, and then pack, move to a new room and unpack for a second time. While all these machinations didn't totally destroy day 3, they didn't make it any better either. But when I told the front desk staff person that the room change was disruptive, she immediately waived the resort fee, which made me feel a little better. While it still isn't clear to me why a room that was reserved two months in advance, and then confirmed by telephone two days before check in, wasn't available upon arrival, it all worked out.

Service from Todd the Food & Bev. Director was above great as he brought me some gloves to my room in knowing my hands were hurting from my travels in the chair.

So we arrived on February 21 and staying for about 8 nights. We had delayed flights so we were a little on edge and tired. We pulled up to the Tropicana and were super impressed of the new renovations from the outside! We haven't been here since 2009 and no offense it was a major dump than! So this was a good start pulling up. Everyone was super nice and polite from holding doors open for us, trying to help us with our luggage, straight through to the check in process! Its bright and lively when you walk in and its CLEAN! :) The walk for us didnt bother us at all. We wanted the exercise anyways. We were put on the 4th floor. Decent. So I walked into the room and told my husband not to touch anything. ( I use to be a housekeeper in my younger days) lol The odor hit me in the face and I knew right there something wasnt right! To keep this section short and sweet : lets just say that they shut the door and forgot to finish cleaning that one! ... BAD! Even though to some that seems horrible the ladies at the front desk promptly changed me to a mini suite down the hall! I told them I would get the key myself so I didnt have to wait 20 min for someone to come up. NO BIG DEAL! They were nice and very apologetic! This room was a lot better. Corner suite with an ok view. 10 minutes goes by and the front desk called us to make sure everything was ok! A+ in my book for checking in with us! We went to Nikki's cafe for a bite to eat which we had wonderful service late at night there! bar tender -- forgot his name-- gave us great ideas for our trip, talked with us and was super friendly!! A+ We went to the fitness center which was ok! I didnt realize how many people are on vacation working out! Until I was here and people were waiting in line to use equipment. If any recommendations can be made; I would suggest adding another treadmill / elliptical or two. This is what people were waiting for while I was there during my visit! Along with adding an additional water cooler, and more towels. Everything was out and it was usually only 8 am when we went!!! Housekeeping was ok, several days I think she forgot that we use towels to shower and soap as well, so we used the one that was still left! Other than that was good. All in all the tropicana is a great place to stay. Good service and it seems they are always willing to help or improve if anything needs it! I just wished that we were placed at the other end of the building. Unfortunately our room was right under the construction site! YIKES!!!! I was up every morning at the crack of dawn hearing \"BEEP BEEP BEEP, BOOM BOOOM CRASH CRASH!!!!!!\" Ear plugs worked well! Didnt take the smell of the demolition away though. Again pretty easygoing people, so we really grinned and barred that situation trying to take into consideration that they are fixing things. Wasn't too thrilled of sleeping like that though for my anniversary trip! Oh Sunday was an amazing sleep in day!

We were also able to check in early. Like the airlines(with there added fees), hotels are adding a so called resort fee. At the Tropicana that fee is 9.99 per day plus tax, which allows you to use all the Hotel's ammenities. I'd rather they just add it to the room cost so you know right up front what your total cost will be. You basically have to pay that fee. Because it was my Dad's 80th when i went to check us out Rose waived that fee for my Dad's suite. As far as I'm concerned Rose went above and beyond. I will definetly stay @ The Tropicana again. There were a couple of negatives that hopefully will be resolved when they complete thier remodle. (1) There wasn't a lot of options for reasonable priced food. I'm sorry but $16.99 for breakfast buffet is not a deal.I understand they are building a marketplace with various food options . Also I when I ordered a coke @ the bar I was charged $4.00 which is fine if you can get refills, I was told no refills. (2) While the TV's are new and a great picture the delay is crazy and needs to be resolved, also it is not real user friendly .

The rooms are fresh and bright and the beds very comfortable. My room was in the Island Tower which alot of people on this website are saying in their reviews is a ridiculous walk from the front desk. Well that's ridiculous. The only way this walk is a problem is if you're an invalid or more than 20 stone (300 lb). It's not very long at all. Some people just need something to complain about. Also, there are 6 elevators serving the Island Tower so you never have to wait long for one. The casino floor, although probably the smallest on the strip from what I saw, is clean and bright. Not like the rest of the hotel casinos, you can actually tell whether it's night or day. Not dark and dingey. All the staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant and helpful. Yes, there is construction work ongoing but this doesn't bother or affect any of the guests. The pool area looks like it will be great when it's finished, which I was told will be around the start of April. I didn't eat at all in the hotel so I can't comment on the quality of the restaurants. I did read the menus and the prices seem to be consistant with the restaurant prices all along the Strip. When I stayed, the hotel didn't offer a breakfast buffet which seem very popular with holiday makers, including my wife and I, but it's a very short walk to other hotels that do offer breakfast buffets, (The Cosmipolitan's is the best by a long way). I went to the car hire desk to get a car for the following day and when I went down next morning to collect the car, it wasn't ready so got a free upgrade to one that was, so was able to drive out to see Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon in a convertible Mustang.

If you're looking for a large casino in your hotel, the Trop is not the place for you.

Speaking of the pool area, it is all still under renovation and probably will be until at least April. Of course, that's about the time it would normally be opened up, so it shouldn't be too much of a big deal. They have renovated the rooms and I was very impressed with the cleanliness and bed. Also, be aware that you are charged an additional $10/night in addition to the regular room rate for a resort fee, which during the winter months amounts to nothing more than \"free\" internet.

We had a group of approximately 25 people come to stay at your hotel for a wedding. The bride is very detail-oriented (as she should be, it was HER wedding). She planned out everything, talked to your staff countless times and after all that, we show up to...excuse my profanity, a $#@% show. There is one easy way to remedy this. May cost you some money up front but in the long run, it may just work: Could you all maybe get the same computer system? So when Thomas at the front desk says that all the tuxes will be taken care of, the lady in the tux shop knows this? Or when Alaina(I believe thats her name) says it would be more than okay for us to store our hand made food w/ room service...when we called them they wouldnt answer, so I had to go to the bell check(?) desk and THEY couldnt even get a hold of room service. To the bell desks credit, they let me store the 2nd round of food in their break room refrigerator. (By the way, these promises were made due to room screw ups, etc) I am not writing this to be rude. I am not asking for anything free. I am pregnant and could be doing a lot of other important things w/ my time. I am typing this in a frenzy because maybe the next wedding party you have there wont have to endure the same problems(I didnt even get into all we went through). We do have mutual friends getting married there in May and I was told by a friend who was present w/ me at the wedding that shes already informed them to cancel their reservations w/ The Tropicana and go elsewhere. My friend, the bride, spoke w/ the vice-president of Tropicana when we got back and he couldnt have been more rude. Really unnecessary in my book. Also, we live in a fairly small community(but a college town, nonetheless) full of service industry workers, white collar, blue collar, trust funders, etc. To your vice president, what Callie had to say didnt matter one bit. Here, before we even stepped foot back in Montana, everyone knew about The Tropicana. On a high note, the room my husband and I stayed in was nice and clean. We took quite a bit of money from your casino, that was a plus. Alaina (again, I think that was the managers name~pretty, long dark hair), was very nice. Thomas was very nice, the day he was working. Too bad none of them ever worked more than one day in a row...which is where your computer system would come in handy! Imagine being able to type in a room # and know whats gone on w/ that room, what needs to happen, what was told to the guest, etc. If you have that capability, it was never used, and that is truly unfortunate. There are so many places to stay in Vegas. Obviously, individual business doesnt hold much weight in the eyes of The Tropicana. People will continue to book reservations w/ you, and you will continue to look at your year end numbers and not wonder what you can do to make someones experience the best it can be(for your price range). We know we didnt book at The Bellagio. No one in our party has champagne taste on a beer budget. Just stop promising things you cant follow through with. Underpromise and over deliver, ever hear the phrase? We may not matter, and maybe the wedding party that'll probably cancel in May doesnt either...but keep it up and dont try to fix it when its too late.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cexcellant service\u201d", "Author": "gilli", "ReviewID": "UR98314809", "Content": "writing from our room on the 20th floor overlooking the strip.we are here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. the room is very clean and spacious. the beds are extremely comfortable. in particular the staff are very attentive and helpful. the view is exciting every time we look out, so much going on day and night, but the windows do keep out most of the noise, although have heard some people grumbling about it. we think its great to be in the middle of all of it. we would definately stay here again and would recommend to friends also.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST HOTEL WE EVER STAYED IN\u201d", "Author": "TheKings70", "ReviewID": "UR98117963", "Content": "The Tropicaca Hotel had excellent staff we loved our room hotel in great location we had the time of our life would definetly stay again planning on returning again in august for a weekend getaway looking forward to see them again", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat value hotel\u201d", "Author": "Louandjon", "ReviewID": "UR98115223", "Content": "We loved this hotel.

(Try to get a room at the Paradise Tower, if you are able.) I tried to leave her a tip, but she refused to take it, saying it was not necessary. It was the perfect start to our vacation. Thank you Rose. The room was new, very clean and had a nice view. Our luggage arrived moments after we reached the room; he even brought us a bucket of ice and answered some of our questions. The room was kept clean daily and twice we had turn down service in the evening, including a bar of chocolate and a bottle of water. Since we did not expect this, it was a nice touch. We even got a little hand written \"thank you\" note from the maid on the last day. The Tropicana seems to pride itself on its new image. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Customer Service was beyond our expectations. We saw almost none of it at any of the other places we visited, except, of course, from people trying to sell you something. Upon entering or leaving the hotel, we were always greeted with a smile and an open door. We are not big gamblers so we only played the penny slots for a short time. We were asked if we wanted drinks twice. The hotel is very convenient and the monorail is right next door at the MGM Grand. Also, it is very bright and the cigarette smoke is not overwhelming, as it was in many of the hotels. If you are looking for a nice, clean, new room and a friendly staff, this is the place to be. If you are looking for something else, Vegas has plenty of options. One problem was that are only a few restaurants, but we were told that more are on the way.

I did book at the last minute (a night before) and I can see why there was a vacancy. Check-in was quick and the staff seemed nice, but right away we realized the \"Island Tower\" where we were appointed was really like walking to an Island. The walk from the entrance to our the elevator was a very long one. Our FIRST room was on the 18th floor at the end of the hallway. My husband inserted our room key and two young men were sitting on the bed and watching tv. We were shocked and I'm sure they were caught by surprise as well. One of them comes out and lets us know there was a mix up with the room and the bellhop was due any minute to bring them their new key and take them to their new room. They quickly got their bags and left us in the room. Needless to say we both felt kind of uncomfortable that two complete strangers had already been in our room for who knows how long. At first, we decided to make the best of it and just chalk it up to bad luck. That was until I went to the bathroom and saw the dirty bathroom floor. When I mean dirty I mean PUBIC HAIR on the floor, dusty, and what looked like to me haphazardly (if even) swept/mopped. I guess they don't expect people to walk barefoot in it or at least that's how it was cleaned. That really pissed me off and my Husband and I decided to call the front desk for another room. They apologize and say they will send a bellhop up to give us a new key. While waiting, the previous bellhop comes knocking for the previous \"tenants\" room key. We were annoyed, but finally we get a new key. My husband tells the bellhop that because of their mistake we're now late. He continues walking away and says, \"I'm just here to bring your key, I don't know\". Anyways we get to our room on the 14th floor. Bathroom floor still dusty, but we're over the room situation and get ready to go out. We come back around 2am and after the long trek to our room realize that somehow the SECOND key is not being read and the door wont open. My husband calls the front desk and they say we'd have to pick it up because the only bellhop working is unable to take it to us. So we're tired as hell from walking and drinking the last 6 hours, but my poor husband has to make the trip back and forth. We didn't have enough energy to make it a big deal. PROS: Bed is comfy (most things are when drunk) Easy to find Close enough to a Monorail Station (MGM Grand) Flat screen TV (we probably watched 30 minutes total) Hotel/Casino looked clean CONS: Walk from lobby to Island Tower Staff was unhelpful Unorganized and understaffed No fridge", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ystrad Mynach", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "Orland0belle", "ReviewID": "UR97212130", "Content": "Stayed for 6 nights during the Rugby 7s last week - chose the Tropicana as it was one of the 'partner' hotels for the Rugby and we got a very good deal.

Beds & pillows were super comfy but the constant sirens, road & advertising noise from outside were not conducive to a good night's sleep. Rooms were a nice size ,well decorated and functional. Bathroom area was adequate, tiles were not new which seemed a little strange against the rest of the refurb going on. Toilet had a habit of 'running' continually and on occasion the shower took ages to heat up. Room was only cleaned 2 days out of 5, only once was a card left outside indicating that our room had been 'missed' due to us being in. As there was only me - it wasn't an issue as I had plenty of towels & did not make a mess. Loved the tropical smell in the corridors, hated the cigar/cigarette smoke everywhere else. Casino was light and not at all intimidating for a first timer, though we never once saw a cocktail waitress whilst playing. Great place to people watch. Ambah Lounge had a great atmosphere too. My real bug bear was the dining. Firstly no coffee makers in the rooms. If you are not going to provide the facility PLEASE provide somewhere to grab a cup in the morning!? Five times I trekked to the Island Tower coffee stand, only once was it open. No opening times posted, no 'back in 5 minutes' just the lights on but nobody home - very disappointing. Cafe Nikki - ate breakfast there one morning & were not made aware there was a breakfast buffet by hostess or server. Same thing happened at dinner, we overheard the server at the next table making reference to it after we had ordered. Aside from the restaurant the staff here were excellent, doormen, gift shop, even just walking around - everyone was friendly and approachable. Not particularly happy about the resort fee for no facilities either. We had 2 rooms and it cost us almost $130 for no pool, did not use phone or internet or fitness center or need boarding cards printed (which we mentioned at check in). Would I stay here again?

The \"long walk\" that everyone seems to complain about is not really that bad. My opinion is that elderly persons and persons with disabilities should get first shot at the Paradise Tower. Seriously, after all the walking a person does in Vegas, the walk back to the Island Tower is nothing to complain about. The room was great. It was nice to have so much \"new\" and the bed was very comfortable. The room wasn't anything fancy, just very nice. The bathroom, while not remodeled, was also something that wasn't worth complaining about. It was large, clean, and had good hot water. I had to fix the chain in my toilet to keep it from running all night, but again no biggie. All of the (hotel) staff went out of their way to be helpful. Housekeeping/ room service/ front desk/ doormen-- all of these contacts were extremely positive. As for the tropical odorant-- I was really looking forward to this as it is one of my favorite scents. I'm not sure it is going to work, though. I think it is because of it mixing with the odor of smoke in the casino, but every time I walked in the door, it smelled like-- hate to say it, but, farts. The sports book-- I have to have a good sports book at my Vegas hotel-- was a complete catastrophe. I have probably visited 90% of the sports books in Vegas, and I am always my happiest when there. Now I know that Tropicana's is a brand new operation, but every single experience I had at this one was a mess! The people did not know what they were doing, they had terrible hours (don't want to hear about the construction, they have a remote station but didn't open this at the promised time, either). I could go on and on with the negatives, but I'm getting mad and I don't want to. My friend and I took most of our gaming business elsewhere because of this. Also, I contacted Nicole Marshall by e-mail prior to my visit to ask two simple questions.

No response. I mentioned in the email that I got her name from TripAdvisor, so I thought she would be motivated to respond. Because so many people on here sing her praises, I would say that my biggest disappointment in the Tropicana would be that she didn't respond to my simple questions.

Not just a little bit - hair all over the floor, countertop, in the tub. When you see that, you wonder about what you don't see.

I found the Tropicana to be a real oasis, initially I was disappointed that I had not booked a 'themed' hotel however after traipsing through other hotels I appreciated that generally the Tropicana had guests and not just tourists hanging around it which I preferred. I also liked the fact that I did not have to spend 20 minutes walking from the car park, through shops and casinos get to my room. It was perfect. We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food. During a week stay there are likely to be a few problems wherever you stay and we encountered a couple which were quickly rectified. During our first night and exhausted from travelling we had problems with noise from our neighbouring room. It sounded like high spirits but it was late, I couldn't sleep through it so contacted the front desk Within 5 minutes security attended and the late night revellers quietened down. After a few days the air con did not seem to be working as well as it had . A call to the front desk had this quickly sorted out. I really would recommend staying at the Tropicana. It's a great location and as it was not high season the roads were not too busy and we were able to drive around really easily. There is self parking available in all the hotels and we found this the easiest way to get around in the evening if we were heading to the north Strip or freemont. During the day we tended to walk, good exercise! Our trip coincided with the Super bowl and the hotel was extremely busy. Not only did this make it an exciting weekend for us it was also very busy, everywhere! Unlike some places I have stayed in the numbers of people had little effect on the efficiency of the hotel.

I stayed at the Trop my first trip to Vegas 17 years ago and it was a dump and i swore never to stay there again. However i was impressed by the changes and decided to give them a shot. it was a mixed bag. I made my reservation 6 weeks in advance and approximately one week after I sent Nicole Marshall an e-mail. Never heard from her, not even a thank you for your e-mail. I was ensured I would have a paradise tower room when i made my reservation. Check in: Arrived 7 PM on a Friday evening and was greeted by a somewhat stand offish reservation clerk. She checked me in and when I seen I was in the Island tower i voiced my displeasure. She stated rather coldly that is the room that was reserved for you. When I asked if i could be switched she said sorry we are sold out.( I booked directly with the hotel not some third party sight). After shlepping all the way to the island tower I realized the room would not work due to the airport noise. I called the front desk and asked to speak to a manager. they gave me the supervisor who was an extremely nice young man. He explained I was given the Island Tower because I requested a king and he could put me in the Paradise in a double Queen if that was acceptable. I stated yes and schlepped all the way back to the front desk. I will say it was a quick transfer as he had the key waiting and just handed it to me. The Room: Very nice, extremely clean and comfortable. Quiet also. rooms are pretty sound proof here. Could of used an additional lamp but no biggie. Cafe Nikki, had the Buffet one morning and the Oatmeal and Eggs were cold. I offered feedback to the Manager Justin and made it very clear i was not complaining just passing along some observations. He comped my Buffet despite my insisting to pay. I returned the next morning and had the Breakfast from the Menu. Excellent. I will say the Buffett has one of the absolute best fruit selections i have ever seen. Each morning I would make the long walk to the coffee stand in the Island tower until I learned on my last day you can buy coffee in cafe Nikki. They have a walk up station at the front of the bar. Will Definitely do that next time. Aside from the check in lady all the employees at the Trop are extremely friendly and helpful without being intrusive. The dealers are great as are Door men Steve and Dean. Each morning I would stand out front with my coffee and chat with them. Sportsbook: Very nice, except for the vendor selling sports memorabilia at the entrance. Tacky Overall: I would absolutely stay at the Trop again. It is the best value for the money. I think once they get the kinks worked out it will be a contender on the Strip. I just can't figure out the personality of the place, I hope they do soon.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "wayne38", "ReviewID": "UR96347757", "Content": "we were guests for 4 nights and we feel that the stong points for this hotel is the staff, they were second to none,the best we have encountered to date.

After reading some reviews on this site I emailed Nicole Marshall who is the hotel experience manager and explained that it was my wife\u2019s birthday and it was a surprise holiday for her and it was going to be our first time away and first time away without any kids. In the email I explained that I was a little disappointed that the pool was closed whilst we were there. Nicole quickly sent a reply explaining that the pool was closed due to it being winter but because of my disappointment she would waiver the resort fee. I felt that this in itself was a great gesture, but the email continued to say that due to it being my wife\u2019s birthday she would throw in 2 tickets free of charge to see Brad Garrets comedy club. (Which was an excellent show as I laughed from start to finish). When we arrived at the hotel there was a package for my wife which was a small birthday present which included the tickets for the show and also a las vegas photo frame and a pack of playing cards. Again what a nice gesture. After the first day me and my wife went back to the hotel for a shower, after she dried her hair she plugged in her hair strengtheners to find that they didn\u2019t work. We presumed that because they worked at home before we left that it must have been a problem with the electricity in the hotel so we contacted reception who said they would send an electrician. The electrician didn\u2019t turn up for a while so I said to my wife to go and get her hair straightened at the hotel salon whilst I waited for the electrician. When my wife came back she was furious as it cost her $45 just to straighten her hair. So we went down to reception to complain. The staff were great about it and gave us a $45 food and drinks voucher as a good will gesture. They then rang the electrician who stopped what he was doing and came to our room to see what the problem was. After checking every thing it was actually the hair strengtheners that didn\u2019t work. He took them away to try and fix them, but he didn't have the part to do so. He then rang the hotel manager to ask what he should do and the hotel actually went out and bought us some hair strengtheners for us to use whilst we stayed there. I\u2019ve never known a hotel to do so much to keep its customers happy. The room we stayed in was fantastic and I have never slept so well in any bed than I did in that one. The internet connection was extremely fast also. Also I have read a couple of reviews that said the cocktail waitresses never ask if you want a drink. In my experience that could not be further from the truth, I barely had sat down and they were there in a flash. We had the breakfast buffet in cafe nikki one morning and it was nice, but if you are going to eat there, please try Biscayne restaurant. The service and the food was excellent. I had the rib eye stake with mash potato of the moment and I can safely say it was the best meal I've ever had. My only regret was we ate there on the last night and I wish I tried it on the 1st. Overall it is the best hotel I've stayed in, especially for customer service and the for the cost of staying I would have still been as pleased if I\u2019d paid treble the price Thanks for an excellent experience Iain Gascoigne", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I expected!\u201d", "Author": "Love2Travel4931", "ReviewID": "UR95616067", "Content": "I stayed at the Trop during the SEMA Show.

We went for 5 days 4 nights with the thought he would be working two days and have two days to explore together. Well, he ended up working for all 5 days! When I read reviews of this hotel I was skeptical of what to expect with all the recent remodeling and the location on the strip. Some folks didn't like the fact that it was on one end of the strip. At the end near right next to the airport. The hotel sounded quite simple and nothing special. Our room was booked by his employer so obviously we stayed where they booked us. I have to say I was pleasantly suprised. This hotel was very clean and our room was wonderful. And the location turned out to be one of the better ones on the strip in my opinion. Yes, it was a bit noisy being so close to the airport, yet it was fun watching the planes take off and land all through the night and day. I enjoyed watching them. When we first checked in we requested a room with a king bed. The front desk gal, Victoria, was as nice and personable as she could be. However, after dragging our luggage the mile or so to our room (yes, we were too cheap to pay to have them brought to our room - I would recommend you have the bellman take your baggage up to your room as the walk to the north tower is quite a hike. Perhaps it is different if you are in the front tower where the elevators are next to the front door.) we entered to find two queen beds. So after a quick call to the front desk they told us to stay put and they would send up a bellman with a new key to another room which had a king bed. Not sure what we were getting ourselves into as the room we were in was nice and we hated to give it up, but we really wanted a king bed. We waited almost 45 minutes until finally a gentleman tapped on our door and gave us a new key card to another room up one floor. Yes, we dragged our luggage up to our new room not knowing what to expect. (the bellman did offer to help us, but we refused. ) Well, when we opened the door to our \"end of the hall ,corner unit\" room, we were both relieved to find an even better room then our first. This room, #1250 was a lovely room with a great view, in my opinion and perfect for our needs. It was a corner room with an extra sitting area with a panaramic view with 4 or 5 windows to look out. Our view was of different parking lots, a church, the airport with planes taking off and landing and a section of the strip and oh, did I mention parking lots? I suppose I would rather over look parking lots and a distance then a building directly infront of my window. The view was lovely at night looking across to the Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Exchaliber resorts across the strip or a.k.a. Route 15 North. Sunsets each night were to die for with the back drop of the mountains and the colors were amazing. Our room was perfect since I would be spending lot of time in it. Since my husband worked every day. I myself worked in the room for two days on my lap top and got quite a bit done. No problems hooking into the hotel's free wireless internet. And the reception was great in our room. The room was a lovely retreat to be confined to for two days. Their TV had a choice of music channels which were nice to utilize as I worked on my cell phone and computer. I enjoyed pampering myself and even ordered room service for lunch each day, The first time in my life and I have to say it was quite yummy, although I still have a hard time justifying my $38 and $59 lunch tabs. (Cesear salad with chicken, execellent black bean soup complete with two dinner rolls and two bottles of budweiser! ) I will say both times the waiters advised me that the tip was included. I appreciated their honesty and bringing this fact to my attention. The food was hot and arrived in a timely manner. The bed was quite comfortable and the pillows fluffy and fresh smelling. Our sheets were changed once during out stay. We had a rental car so loved the free parking. Which was included in the $9.99 daily resort fee. If you are a member of AAA , be sure to tell them so and this resort fee can be waived. Victoria waived ours once we mentioned that we were AAA members. The dissappointments were: The bathroom - Nothing to write home about. Simple corner type tub/shower combination. I would think for such a lovely room, the bathroom would have had a jetted tub or just been a bit more \"special\" or elegant looking. The hike to our room - Although our room was lovely, it was such a long walk out to the front door or casino. Only two dinner restaurants in the hotel, both are only open at night. No cheap easy places to get a quick bite to eat. Both inhouse specialty restaurants were expensive. Each had very few customers while we were staying. The 24 hour Cafe which we thought was less expensive was still pretty pricy for what you get and the food was not that good. ( Although I think this is the restaurant where my roomservice came from and that food was pretty good. hmm??) We tried the breakfast buffet our first morning and were very dissapointed. Oatmeal looked like wallpaper paste, eggs were cold, rubbery and tasteless, muffins and breads were stale and dry. No waffles or pancakes for my husband who doesn't eat anything with eggs in it. I think a bit over priced for what you get. At lease the coffee was tasty and our waiter was attentative. The high priced drinks and gift shop in the lobby. With all the interior smoking going on my allergies were acting up so I bought a small bottle of visine. Price wa $10.49! Also drinks were expensive - $6 for a bottle of budweiser. Cabs were very easy to obtain at each hotels main entrance there always seemed to be a supply waiting on hand. I felt the housekeeping staff was very pleasant. But other then those two women and my roomservice waiters, most other employees were not very friendly. This would included the front desk gals (with the exception of Victoria), the doormen and especially the bartenders. Bartenders didn't like giving you drinks for free whether you were playing the games or not. They also took their time to acknowledge your standing or sitting there. And they certainly didn't advise us of that Las Vegas tradition. We had to find out the\"Tricks\" in another hotel casino from a very friendly staff member there. Who explained the way the drinking and playing the games works in Vegas. Needless to say we gave that bartender a rather large tip for his helpful hints. The pool was closed as it was way too cold to swim during our visit. Still construction going on near the pool area and on the side of the resort where the two floor older resort stands. All in all I would recommend a stay here at the Tropicana. I took several walks down and up the strip and felt very comfortable walking around alone during the day and in the evening while my husband worked. I wondered for a couple of days by myself and worked in our room for a couple of days. I did a little shopping here and there and walked through several of the large lobbys of neighboring hotels by myself. I would say Las Vegas is definately a place everyone should see once in their life. Personallyl, not a place I would want to call home - but a fun place to visit just the same!

When I got to the room the air conditioning was broken the safe didn't work and I couldnt' access the internet. This was all taken care of the next morning however. In what was a good faith attempt to make up for the above, the hotel comped me breakfast one morning. I went to their Cafe Niki which was decidedly middle of the road. However, the interesting thing was that despite the fact the food was comped they did bring me a check. When I went to look it over I noticed that the prices on the check did not match at all the prices on their menu.

We could not find the fitness room to save our lives, so once again, we had to ask at the front desk.

Now, you enter a completely redecorated casino and the tropical scent of coconut embraces you first. Then you start to notice the plantation shutter accents and the updated decor. We checked in at the VIP / Breeze desk. The desk personnel was our first experience with the staff. They have clearly been through extensive customer service training, because she was very nice and attentive. This was consistent throughout our stay. We had a suite in the Paradise tower with a view of the Strip. The suite is about 900-1000 square feet and nicely laid out. The decor continues with the tropical theme, but not in a kitchy way. Think Bahamas / English tropical decor. Dark rattan furniture, sisel rugs, muted fabrics with punches of color. Loved it. The bed and linens are excellent. The noise from the street below was audible, but it did not prevent us from getting excellent nights of sleep.

My sister had stayed here 2 or 3 years ago and warned me about the hotel saying the rooms are old, and even the non-smoking rooms smell like smoke. However, Trip Advisor was telling me otherwise, and I read that the whole hotel had been renovated and completed August 2010. So, as Trip Advisor has been good to us (always use it before booking hotels and rarely been disappointed), we decided to go for it. Overall, it was a good, cheap place to stay while in Las Vegas. The room we had was renovated, spacious, and didn't really smell of any smoke. However, that might have been masked by the sunscreen smell of Tropicana which is all right I suppose (you'll smell that when you first walk into the lobby doors). The rooms were well furnished and clean. The location is sort of near the south end of the Strip. We found it to be no problem. The best thing about the room was the bed. It was probably the most comfortable bed we've ever slept on in a hotel or at home. If you're looking for a really comfortable bed and good sleep quality, you'll definitely want to stay here. We knew about the resort fee which is supposed to pay for free wifi internet. The internet was great, no problems with that... but honestly, the resort fee should just be built into the cost of the hotel. There is no reason that you should have to pay again when you get there... but maybe that's the standard in Vegas. A tip on transportation to and from the airport. I tried to search this specifically for Tropicana but I couldn't find anything. Since Tropicana is one of the closer hotels to the airport, should you take a shuttle or taxi service? We did both... the shuttle costs $6.50 per person... so $13~$15 depending if you tip the driver. When we left, we took a cab to the airport. It was early in the morning so traffic wasn't too bad, although the driver said it was more than usual at that time as people were probably going back home for Christmas. The trip turned out to be about $11 before a tip. The bonus at Tropicana when taking a cab is you don't even have to drive on the Strip to get there, so you might be able to avoid some traffic. If you have 2 people in your party I'll let you make the decision on which form of transportation to take. If I had to stay here again I would.

Upon entering the rooms we noticed our room had no towels and our friends room had only one dirty towel, a used bar of soap and trash in the ice bucket. We called for house keeping and the bathroom oversight was corrected in a timely manner. We also called and requested our luggage be brought up and were told it would take 20 minutes. Over an hour later, and only after placing a second request did our luggage finally arrive. This was after 10:00pm on a Friday evening, and very few people were checking in or out at that time so it seemed rather peculiar that our luggage would take so long, never-the-less we brushed it off. Trying to sleep that night was not easy. we were very tired from our long trip so we chose not to request that the bed be re-maid due to the fact that the bed was short sheeted. Also, because all the pillow cases were too small for the pillows a good portion of the pillows were exposed. Just imagine how many heads laid on those pillows without a clean, proper pillow case - gross! Sleep that night was fitful at best. The second night I got up at 3:00am to use the bathroom. Upon returning to the bedroom I noticed something on the bed and turned on the light. It was a bug so I grabbed a napkin that was on the nightstand and picked it up. This was a bed bug, and it was filled with fresh blood that left a very large stain on the napkin when I squished it. To say the least, my wife and I were in utter shock! What happened over the next three hours was almost surreal. The clerk at the front desk told me \"to be honest with you we've had many complaints like this in the past, before the remodel.\" The security supervisor said \"we can't control the bugs.\" and the security officer assigned to us couldn't get his camera to focus when he tried to take photos of the bug, so I took the photos for him! I was then told that the only way I could report this If I filled out an accident report, so, at 4:15am I filled out the report including describing the incident in \"my own words.\" We were then offered a new room and a reduction of one night off our 3 night stay. Wanting nothing more but to go home - but being exhausted, we accepted the new room. So - we then had to go back to the room pack up all our stuff and wait for the bellman. After the security man called a second time for the bellman he finally showed up - without a cart. Eventually by 6:00am, we left our 6th floor room with a view of the strip, and got settled in the first floor room with the roar of the ventilation fans just outside the window. This room also had pillows sticking out of the ill fitting cases - plus - the TV in this room would not bring in most the of the channels! The last night we just couldn't sleep because we kept on checking for bugs! Three nights at the Tropicana without sleep, without relaxation & without satisfaction from management! We were told by every employee whom we encountered that they have done everything they can for us and to talk to Heather Katz risk manager. When we checked out at 10:45am and asked for her we were told she was at lunch so we had to leave a phone message for her as nobody else was authorized to help us in her absence. Heather did call us at home the next day. she actually had the Gaul to request that we send her the bug! She clearly was not interested in putting our satisfaction first, her concern seemed only in analyzing the bug.

We found a tremendous deal on-line and couldn't NOT go. The Tropicana is a quick and cheap cab ride from the airport. Check in was a breeze; no line ups and pleasant employees. Our room was on the first floor (room 166 I think). It was a nice room, quite large, recently renovated, clean and confortable. We had no view at all, but honestly we spent hardly any time in the room anyway. Like previous reviewers mentioned, the rooms are a long walk from the main reception area; if you have limited mobility this could be quite an issue. I think we were in the Island tower. Overall we had a pleasant stay. We loved how close the Tropicana is to New York New York and the MGM. It's also a quick walk to the bus stop (the Deuce) which was convenient for us. The only downfall is the lack of casual restaurants in the hotel. We did try Cafe Nikki's lunch buffet, but it is certainly not worth the price ($17.99 I think). The service was also very slow and honestly they seemed quite uninterested in serving us at all. I know the restaurant has only been open for a few weeks, so perhaps it will improve with time. There was also an issue with charging our lunch to our room. We recieved a message from Cafe Nikki before we checked out indicating that we needed to come back down to the restaurant to pay our outstanding bill. When I checked out and tried to pay this outstanding lunch bill at reception I was advised that I needed to physically go back to the restaurant and pay it there. I was told (by the restaurant) that I didn't have a credit card number on my file so they could not charge the bill to my room (strange because I'm sure there are very few hotels in the world that would allow you to check in WITHOUT a credit card..). However, the lovely lady I spoke to when I checked out told me there was no indication that Cafe Nikki even tried to charge my room. It was confusing, weird and inconvenient for me to go back to the restaurant the next day to pay this bill, and it didn't really improve my overall impression of the restaurant. I did see a Starbucks stand in the hotel but it wasn't open while we were there.

There has been quite an improvement over our previous stay. The rooms have been updated to a nice modern fresh look and feel. Let's just say they are very spacious and comfortable. The flat screen tV's are big, the beds very comfortable and the bathrooms have been redone. The casino and restaurants have been updated with a modern look and feel. The variety of live shows and comedy is outstanding. On the positive, the staff has obviously gone through some extensive customer service training because everyone could not have been more helpful and friendly. Our entire reservation had to be changed due to our flight being cancelled because of the blizzard in the east. Everyone we spoke with went out of their way to accomodate our ever changing travels needs. We especially like the fact that a doorman holds the heavy glass doors for everyone walking in and out - very nice touch. The unfortunate part of the trip is that the renovations are still ongoing. Currently there are limited eating establishments,, so if you want a quick meal, we had to use the property accross the street for light meals. The buffet is very small, but good and has been incorporated into an existing restaurant where as it used to be on its own. Would love to see a large buffet on the property and maybe thats in the plans. The sports betting parlor is a 20 foot long desk with no seating. We were told that a new parlor was being constructed and that would be first class. There is only one row of table games, so when the casino gets crowded, we were forced to visit other properties on the surrounding corner (Trop Blvd. & Strip) to play table games. The pit boss said that an expanded table area was on the way. While the room was outstanding, there were some minor annoyances. The bathroom timer light switch was broke and the lock holding the suite window (yes the windows do open) was loose and our window kept rattling in the high winds. While these things are minor issues, a good quality review by the housekeeping staff before the next guest arrives could have caught these issues. My wife would have liked the room to have a fridge. You can rent one. On one occasion, the housekeeping person knocked on our door at 9:00 AM. We told her we were leaving in 5 minutes. We came back at 3:00 PM and the room had not been done. So what was the point in knocking on the door at 9:00 AM? A call to the housekeeping office and a housekeeper was at our door in 5 minutes and the room quickly and efficiently cleaned. As I have been to almost every large property in Vegas, one recommendation I have for this property is that as improvements are made, that the ventilation and air handling systems are updated. The smoke in the gaming area is much worse than in other properties. Hopefully one day Vegas will go non smoking with a smoking area like the rest of the country. I continue to recommend this property and believe it will be a great property when all of the improvements are finally completed.

I have visited the casino, since the renovations, but this was my first stay at the hotel since last November. While there are some nice changes, my overall impression was not so great. The room was very nice. Very comfortable beds, that are a vast improvement from the old ones. Considering the \"newness\" of it, I was upset to see the scratched night stand, and less than impeccably clean shower. The tiles were a bit moldy. The staff was much nicer than they had been in the past, and that is a plus. The construction was not much of an issue, except for the fact that much of the casino is blocked off. There is a major lack of dining options. If you just want a quick snack or sandwich, there are no options. The South Beach Deli that is advertised on their website is closed. There is a steakhouse, an Italian restaurant, and Cafe NIkki. The Steakhouse and Italian restaurant are not open during the day. Cafe Nikki is not a good choice if you just want, say, a BLT. It has a very \"club-like\" feel and is very Cuban influenced. That is not a bad thing, necessarily, if there had been other options. There was a small coffee stand that offered \"gas station\" style pre-packaged egg salad sandwiches ( no thanks), and excessively priced pastries. It was open on Sunday. It was closed Monday, and literally gone on Tuesday. If you don't mind leaving the hotel for coffee, and snacks, I guess this would be ok. I think that once all of the refurbishments are complete, this will be a nice place to stay. In my opinion, they should just close for 6 months, and get everything done. But as it is now, I don't think I could really recommend it. We ended up leaving a day early, as we just felt so \"blah\" about the whole thing. My final disappointment came after arriving home to find that my card had been charged, even though we presented a different one at check in(my husbands). They had done this to me before, and after a very unpleasant phone call to the front desk, I swore I wouldn't stay there again. That was last year. I thought with all of the changes, they wouldn't do this again, and yet they did. I did call, and the woman I spoke to was pleasant about it, but it left me with a bad feeling.

I would have thought they would have started with a lower price and because of that, we didnt eat one meal at the Trop. Overall, i liked the place. It seemed very small compared to other casinos and it seemed very tranquil compared to other casinos. We didnt eat here, didnt gamble much here (no paigow poker and no cocktail service after midnight while on the slots)and basically just used it as a place to sleep. The staff was good as everyone else here has indicated. They did make you feel welcomed and appreciated to an extent. Id stay again, but, only if they kept the price cheaper then everyone else. If they raised the price id stay probably at the flamingo or across the street at the excalibur.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CANADA", "Title": "\u201cSTAY HERE IF YOU CAN\u201d", "Author": "Cutesy", "ReviewID": "UR91358544", "Content": "Our family of 7 stayed at the Paradise Tower from Dec. 26 to Dec. 30 2010.

While the location was ideal for our trip to Vegas to visit family and friends (easy access away from the strip), the hotel itself was not ideal for our needs. The rooms were surprisingly spacious, however, we were surprised that we could hear street traffic on the 16th floor. We were unaware when we booked this hotel that because of the construction they did not have a front entrance ramp. Since we were traveling with my 90 year old grandmother, a ramp would have made the scooter we rented a little easier to maneuver. After three days at the hotel we were finally informed of the rear entrance that had a ramp, but it was in the bowels of the hotel. The fact that we had the scooter delivered to the hotel and that they had to retrieve it for us but never mentioned the rear entrance lends to our second concern which was general customer service. We found it lacking and a general sense of dissatisfication with the current ownership and its direction. My favorite incident was while approaching an information desk on the casino floor, I indicated that I had a question. The woman pulled out a mirror and began to check her makeup before she turned her attention to me. Housekeeping could never seem to get the towel situation right. The first day we left just the face towels on the floor to be replaced. When we returned later that night, all the towels had been taken (with no replacements). We called for towels and within 20 minutes we had our towels. On the second day, we repeated the same incident. So by the third day we got the hint and left the do not disturb sign on the door (although I was tipping daily). Overall, the hotel provided a convenient location for our stay, but the lack of a ramp, poor customer service, and uncertain housekeeping, I would be hesitant to stay at the Tropicana again. I will note that upon mentioning these issues to the front desk (Yolande who was great), apologized and waived our resort fees. Also worth noting is that on our final day, some of the outside construction barriers were removed and revealed the new front entrance ramp.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McDonalds Corners, ON", "Title": "\u201cTropicana delivers...\u201d", "Author": "Little_Atlas", "ReviewID": "UR91274427", "Content": "We stayed for a week to celebrate Christmas and my 50th birthday at the Tropicana.

The shutters also can be opened right up to have an unobstructed view. The iPod docking station and large flat screen television are also a nice touch if that is important to you. The front desk staff are wonderful (kudos to Doug for setting the tone for our stay); very helpful.

My wife and I learned this quickly and made sure we had everything with us for the day. Rooms were clean, quiet, and the bed was comfortable. We did not eat in the hotel. The restaurants looked good, but I thought they were a little too pricey. Instead, we walked to the Hooters Hotel and Casino and ate at their Mad Onion restaurant a couple of times. They have a 9.99 prime rib that was fantastic. Hooters is only about a five minute walk from the Tropicana. We did do most of our gambling at the Tropicana. The casino area is smaller than most others, but I enjoyed the atmosphere. It was neither too loud nor too quiet. If you don't want to gamble there, you can easily walk across the street to either New York, MGM, or Excaliber. While there, we rented a car for two days from the agency in the casino. No problems there and the parking was free and close to the hotels entrance. We will consider staying at the Tropicana again.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA bit of a find...\u201d", "Author": "Unusualname", "ReviewID": "UR89455091", "Content": "Moved here for 1 night after 3 nights in Excalibur and found it a very welocme step up.

BIG MISTAKE. The first \"new\" room my girlfriend and I got was in the Island Tower. The only thing new about the room was the furniture and the bedding. When we woke up in the morning to take a shower, we had to actually duck our heads to shampoo our hair, keep in mind I am only 5 foot eleven and my girl friend is 5 foot ten if your over 6 foot don't even bother trying to bathe on that side of the hotel. When we called the front desk, they did accomadate us by moving us to the Paradise Tower early in the morning on the second day of our stay. The room in the Paradise Tower was better, however, it wouldn't of taken much to beat the Island Tower room. The good thing about the Paradise Tower is that you can be out of the Hotel in under 2 mins. According to some reviews on here the vanilla smell that is piped into the casino and hotel is \"pleasant'; We did not find this to be the case. I would compare it to sitting in a car that has too strong of a vanilla airfreshener and after a few days that starts to wear on you. I would of liked to take my girlfriend to a spa, however, there is no active spa here due to the renovations. Also, we only ate once at the hotel at the \"South Beach Cafe\" this place is a total joke. We had two burgers and some cheese sticks for 40 dollars. In comparison, we had an a couple of sandwiches over at the sports bar of New York, New York and it was under 30 bucks. The good thing about the Tropicana is the location as it is right across the bridge from both MGM grand and Excalibur/Luxor/Mandalay Bay. I can't envision a scenario that would make me stay at the Tropicana Hotel again. The constant loop hyping the \"mob experience\" in the hotel elevators was enough to almost make me loose my cool. What a dumb idea for a vegas hotel, other hotels have cool themes like greek/roman gods iconic cites paris/new york but their idea to get hip is to try and capitalize on the Soprano's? That was popular like ten years ago way to get with the times! If you are looking for a hotel that is attached to a nice shopping center with great places to dine you are looking at the wrong place, spend more money and stay elsewhere. Further, the sportsbook was not even open I had to walk across the bridge to the MGM grand just to lay some sports bets.

We had a room on the ninth floor of the Paradise tower. The casino is a big improvement, with a light, open, clean feeling. When I visited a year ago, it felt a bit grim and grungy. The staff was unfailingly polite and pleasant to deal with, from Doug at checkin, Rose helping with boarding passes and the quick and polite response when I requested an additional luggage rack from housekeeping. Room Pros: Comfortable king size bed, very roomy, safe, big flat screen tv, new furnture. The look is understated tropical, I was expecting a few more bright splashes of color with the South Beach theme. The wall art was of Jazz musicians, and seemed to evoke New Orleans a bit more than South Beach, but it was fine. Plenty of hangers, an i-home clock radio with an i-pod dock. Bathroom was a good size with a nice layout. Room Cons: Window treatments were shutters rather than curtains, and they were difficult to close tightly to block light. This was a particular problem since we were right across from the MGM electronic sign, that flashed and blinked all night. They shutters look good, but really need to be paired with some sort of blackout curtains, after all, this is Vegas and there is a good chance you were up late. Also, the first night was very noisy. We discovered that one of the windows had not been closed properly. It is nice to have windows that open, but quick check to make sure that they are closed correctly when the room turns over seems like a no brainer. The bathroom had a nice updated marble counter, new sink and faucits. Unfortanatly, they stopped short of a complete re-do, and left the old tile. This would have been fine had they regrouted and replaced any broken tile, but in our room the floor grout was stained and there was a broken tub tile. It did not affect the functionality at all, but left an overall impression of old and dirty when compared to the rest of the room. if you are planning on using the fitness room, the new upgraded room will not be available till spring. The current room is small and light on cardio equipment. There was no exercise bike (bummer for me, I'm supposed to bike for physical therapy for a bad knee) 2 elipticals and a few treadmills. They are well equiped for free weights and weight machines, a bit ironic since most of the demand seems to be for cardio. I'm looking forward to checking out the new facility when it opens. The parking got a bit dicey as we approached the weekend, there is a very small parking garage, and half is dedicated to valet. We had one evening that it took us 20 minutes to find a spot. I believe that they are going to build a new garage over where they imploded the old tower, but parking will be a challenge during busier times untill then. The wifi included in the resort fee was fine, we never lost signal, and it was great to have. The business center is closed, and since printing of boarding passes was included as well, they took care of that at the front desk. A couple of (very) small quibbles with housekeeping, we did not have the disposible bag for the ice bucked replaced the entire week, and a wire coat hanger was left on the bathroom counter one day. Also, kudos to the social media team. I joined the facebook page, and posted a question before we left, and had a response promptly.

The Island Tower rooms are a bit of a hike to the casino floor but that just equates to a more peaceful retreat from the noise. The room is large and well lighted. The 42\" TV was nice. The wi-fi worked great. Large soaking tub. The towels leave alot to be desired. Also very convienient to the pool and gym. A little disappointing that the Spa is closed so a massage was not an option. I think it is being rennovated along with many areas of the casino. The sportsbook is closed and is also a work in progress. They anticipate opening the sportsbook in May 2011. It is a 5 minute walk to the MGM Grand Sportsbook. The pool area is also under construction but looks as though it will be very nice. The gaming area is small consisting of 2 roulette wheels 2 Craps tables and about a dozen or so Blackjack and assorted card games. Plenty of slots in a rather simple to navigate casino floor. You will never get lost or separated from your party. Very nice sports viewing lounge with plenty of TV sets. Purchased discounted tickets for the Yesterday Beatles Tribute show. Very entertaining. Cozy theater with great acoustics and very comfortable. They are advertising another interactive show called The Vegas Mob Experience which opens soon and looks quite fun and historically educational. The staff was very gracious. I only ate a sandwich and fries and a coke at the Cafe for $16. It was very good. They had a classy looking steakhouse and a pasta place as well. No buffet if that is important to you. Overall a great value and convienient walk to MGM, Excaliber and the free tram to Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Also the $5 monorail is easily accessed from MGM and will take you clear to the other end of the strip. Funny thing happened in the gym that I will share and I'm certain management will address it.

We also ate at Pampas which is located in the PH Mall area $5.99 for steak and eggs this was pretty decent.

I never had gone into the Tropicana during my previous Las Vegas visits, but I would hate to see what the old Tropicana was like if this is now the newly renovated version. Don't get me wrong, the hotel looks nice but I wasn't overly impressed. To me, it just seemed like an average hotel when you walked in. The casino was bright but not overly big and impressive. There were really no wow features at all to look at., The new rooms however are indeed nice and comfortable and we did enjoy our beds at night. They are renovated but I noticed that it appears it wasn't a full refit as the tiles in the bathroom still looked a bit dated so you could still see remnants of the old rooms. A lot of users commented on the staff. Again, not impressed. We had arrived at the hotel after 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon and was told we could not get a room until 4...when check in was supposed to begin at 3. I didn't feel like the woman was very accomodating and also felt that the bell hop was rude when asking about holding our bags. When we arrived around 4:30 (i was afraid to arrive any earlier with fear that the room would still not be ready), the only room they could give us was one facing a cement wall and roof area? Not thrilled, but I knew we wouldn't be in the room much anyway. The check in woman commented that check in was 3 so other rooms were already given away....I complained that why did the previous woman tell us to show up at 4 then! She didn't seem to care. Staff did open the doors for us almost each time we entered and exited the hotel, but other than that nothing to brag about. To sum it up, the hotel doesn't have any wow factor. There isn't much to do in the hotel as far as good restaurants and entertainment so don't expect the hotel to be a real happening place....perhpas this will change once they open Nikki Beach? We did visit the pool once and it's nice but again wouldn't say its the best pool in vegas like the hotel sometimes states. The location is on the south end but the Excalibur is across the street which has a tram to the Mandalay Bay and Luxor and Tropicana is also across the street from MGM which can connect you to the monorail system so you can still get around somewhat easy to most areas on the strip. Regardless, I would stay at the hotel again though for the value of it but at least next time I would know what to expect. So I would recommend the hotel if you want a comfortable place to sleep at an inexpensive price but I consider it to be more of a regular hotel than a casino resort.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay at the \"Trop\"\u201d", "Author": "billcop", "ReviewID": "UR86810655", "Content": "Just returned from our trip to Las Vegas, where we stayed at the Tropicana.

Everyone working in the hotel and casino were always smiling, everyone from dealers to waitresses to housekeeping, to floor supervisors would constantly being saying hello to all of the guests.

We were very reluctant to book at the Tropicana, as we have stayed at other hotels on the strip and loved them.

Not too smokey, except in the slots area heading up to the second floor. Our room was very clean, spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. We were in one of the newer rooms, and it was very nice. Our room faced the airport, which was a little bit of a drag, and we were not able to get it switched due to a very large convention in town. Our room was very quiet the entire stay. The only downsides was there was no tissue or tissue dispenser in the room, and I would have loved a coffee pot in the room. My husband did walk to the cafe the first morning and paid around $4 a piece per coffee, but we were able to refill the cups every morning. There are very minimal choice for food in the hotel. We did cross over to the MGM and went to the Food Court there, where almost all of the restaurants changed to breakfast in the morning, so lots of choices. The Tropicana did have a breakfast buffet on the weekends, and it was good. We did use the pool, and we would love to see the changes that are coming up to the hotel and to the pool. Best tips from us for your trip to Vegas....walk down the strip past MGM, to the tickets4tonight booth, they are next to the Coke Store. We got very reasonable prices on shows, and half price vouchers for food at a fabulous restaurant, we really enjoyed. In the same area, visit the ABC store. They are a chain from Hawaii, have great/cheap souveneirs, and have great prices on beverages, including beer and wine.

They had a few restaurants in house which were over priced. I got wings at the cafe (btw - also OUTRAGEOUSLY priced) and had numerous wings with no meat on them! It was the craziest thing I'd ever seen and after paying an arm and a leg for them I thought it would be better quality (at least have meat!). The casino has a nice ambiance and is clean but there were little to no waitresses to bring drinks (I hear free drinks at casinos are becoming a thing of the past anyway). To top it off, my husband and I were tired of spending all of our money on food/drinks and went to the store to bring a few things to our room to help cut cost. We had to pay $25 for a tiny refrigerator which looked like it had been thrown down the stairs and when we called to ask for it we were interrogated about why we needed one in the room...I was very offended that I was treated that way. The room was very nice but for some reason it was impossible to get the room cool enough despite putting the thermostat on 63 degrees, we were burning up.

The room was on the corner, and was one of the remodeled rooms. For the price paid (about $80/night), I'd say it's probably right at a good value for the money. There was nothing to hardcore complain about during the entire stay. I was a little hesitant to stay here at first, but one of the things that helped convince me it'd be okay was that I noticed that the hotel was fairly reactive to the comments left here, which indicated that they were paying attention to feedback, and reacting to it. For some reason, that helped reassure me. That being said, the staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs, the room was clean, spacious, and was very convienent to the south end of the Strip and neighboring hotels. BUT, be warned that the food/beverage offerings in this hotel are severly lacking. Only one option for breakfast, and a small grill at that. With literally countless options surrounding the general area, from expansive buffets to something as simple as Denny's, I felt disappointed by this lacking. Not anyone's there fault, as I really didn't see a lot of room anywhere in the hotel to put another restaurant - but this really should be addressed. Also, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of staffing at Bell Services and Valet outside the main entrance in the morning hours. The front canopy was getting fuller and fuller of people checking out, and only ONE person handling luggage outside? Of COURSE he's going to get overwhelmed, but come on, get the guy some help! Valet also seemed understaffed at this time, though the staff was extremely friendly, and will always offer great directions and/or suggestions for things to do that are sometimes off the beaten path.

We had originally planned to stay in the MGM for 1 wk and TI for the 2nd wk, but had seen pictures of the rooms refurbished and the prices were amazing so thought we would take a chance. First impression on entering the hotel was good as it was nice and bright. Although no ramp to get our heavy suitcases up :-( Only problem we had in the whole 2 wks was at check in. I paid $850 for the room upfront at check in. The next day in Abercrombie & Fitch I tried to use the same card for $300 at the check out and it was refused (very embarrassing) so i paid with a different card and contacted my card provider. They said that the Tropicana had taken 2 payments, $850 and a separate $700. I questionned this at reception who said that it was $50pn for incidentals. I was very annoyed that when i checked in and asked the amount being taken from my card I was told $850 and never said anything about the other $700. The whole transaction had to be cancelled and paid with a different card, but I had to wait 7 days to get the money from my my card issuer as they had to wait for the transaction to expire. Don't know if this is a common practise in US hotels, but i would have at least liked to have been told or asked if I required that service. Anyway, pleeeeaaasssseeee don't let that put you off as the rest of the 2 wks were perfect. Genuinely friendly staff, clean nice rooms with the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in, we stayed in the Paradise Tower 17th floor with great strip view, great location by MGM. NYNY & Excalibur, beautiful pool which will be even more amazing when Nikki Beach is finished. Didn't eat in restaurants so can't comment on them, but South Beach cafe was nice. My only worry is that the prices will rise a lot due to all the renovations putting prices similar to MGM, TI, Mirage, etc. I'm going back to Vegas twice next yr and if i can get anything near the price i paid this time then i won't even bother looking at other hotels.

I lost my ink pen and went to the Tropicana Hotel Store to purchase one and the cashier pulled out a can of pens and gave me one which again I thought was a nice touch.

Our room in the Island Tower was great - very large, the bed very comfortable, and with a nice view of the MGM and New York New York Casinos. The temperature indoors was perfect. Generally, the Tropicana has an aura of \"newness\" which is in stark contrast to some of the old, out-dated interiors that I saw at various locations on the Strip. Unfortunately, however, the Tropicana needs to improve in a number of areas before it can even come close to competing with some of the other establishments on the Strip. Our hotel room didn't have a services guide (the booklet you're used to finding in your hotel room that tells you of the resort's services and facilities). When I called housekeeping to request one they said they'd deliver one immediately; however, I got a phone call 5 minutes later saying they didn't have any spare, but that I should dial 0 on the phone if I needed anything - a bit rough considering that without the resort guide I didn't know what was on offer! So my husband and I decided to look up the Tropicana website for details of the services and facilities provided - only to find that the promised free wi-fi connection didn't make it to our hotel room. I would have really loved to know that there was a fitness centre before now..! Granted, when I found someone in the lobby who I could speak to about the lack of wi-fi access he offered to move us to another room, but as we only had 2 nights remaining we didn't want the inconvenience of moving all our belongings. The bed linens and towels in our room smelled of smoke, although I'd requested a non-smoking room. We carried our own bags on arrival and departure, with no offer of assistance from hotel porters. The casino lacks an exciting vibe that makes you want to actually stay there (we spent all of our time elsewhere, and returned to sleep). If there's one thing I dislike whilst on holiday, it's having to chase up the services and facilities you know you're already paying for - I just want to enjoy myself with a minimum of fuss! I do think the Tropicana has a lot of potential, but really during our US trip we stayed in some very basic hotels that were able to provide free wifi access/non smelly linens/attentive staff, so it's a shame the Tropicana couldn't deliver.

I was told that they would put a rush on house keeping to get our room ready and to check back in a hour or so, 2 hours later our room was still not ready. Tried back at 3pm which is normal check in time and our room was still not ready, got told once agian to try back in an hour or so or that they could put us in a smoking room with 2 beds. Went and played some games and tried back about 3:45 just hoping that our room would be ready and yet agian it wasnt, go the just another hour or so spill agian. Needless to say this was getting out of hand!! So I went and found the hotel manager, he went up to the desk and came back to tell me that the room was being cleaned and it usually takes about an hour to get the room clean. I had a few choice words with him and he went back to the desk once agian and came back with keys to the room. Bt the time this ordeal was over I was so peeved that I couldnt see strait. I did end up getting comps for $50 dining and the resort fee being waived for the duration of our trip to some that would be worth the aggravation but not for me. Comps are Vegas' way of trying to make you happy for their screw ups, frankly no comp could have made my initial expierence any better here at the Tropicana.

But due to the great deal we took a chance that they indeed are \"changing everything.\" First thing you'll notice when you walk in is that the hotel is bright compared to other hotels on the strip. This was refreshing. And when I checked in there was not a wait and the staff was friendly and quick. Also refreshing if you've ever waited in a long line at a Vegas hotel only to be greeted by a grumpy hotel clerk. The tower our room was in was a bit of a walk away but this is norm in Las Vegas. What was nice was the quick escape from the casino. And shortly after that you escape the second hand smoke due to the business area part of the hotel being smoke free. This was really nice. The rooms are indeed \"best in class.\" Much nicer than the room we had a few months early at a hotel just across the street. Nice and clean with a very bright and modern vibe. It was a great room to come back to after long days of conferences, shows, and casinos. Not to mention free wi-fi. Our room did not really have a good view though unless you like airports. And forget about looking out the windows after dark. Large spotlights pointing directly at the windows make that a blinding experience. Also the windows only had shutters which did not block 100% of the light from the spotlights at night. So it was impossible to make the completely dark. Tropicana please consider installing some shades guests could pull to completely cover the windows. Those of us that light it completely dark while sleeping would appreciate it. Over all it was a great place to stay. At every turn the staff was friendly and really helpful. In fact we found the dealers at Tropicana to be really good for us novice gamblers.

Rose at Front Desk went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations from a service standpoint. We went there to mail some cards and she asked a few questions, and before we knew it, she helped print out our boarding passes, escorted us to the Promotions booth and had our charges picked up based on our play.

While we were there (3 days) their current promotion changed twice, so be sure to inquire. Although they were busy with lots of customers, they were VERY patient and happy to help. This is not a big fancy hotel. It is one of the oldest properties in Las Vegas that has undergone some much needed renovations and face lifting that have made it great.

This time I stayed at the Tropicana from Oct 16 through Oct 19. The price was excellent (part of an Expedia fly-hotel package). The check-in was fast and the clerk was polite and friendly (as were all of the employees I ran across). I had to sign a waiver which stated that there was a $9.99 daily 'resort' fee (which I already knew about) and that I would have to pay for any damaged and 'missing' (i.e. stolen) items from the room. I haven't seen that waiver for years, and only in those hotels in my student years which were, how should I say, 'budget' hotels in the Tenderloin district. We last stayed at the Trop approximately 10 years ago, and our room at the time was in a 3 story '60s type motel near the pool. It was quite basic and badly in need of refurbishing. This time, we stayed at their advertised 'best-in-class' room in the Island tower. I assume it\u2019s called the island tower since it's approximately a long city block away from the check-in counter. You walk through the casino, past the pool (shortened by at least half due to construction) and the aforementioned motel rooms, past their convention area. Fortunately, there are water stops (cleverly disguised as restaurants) about half way along the trek. This tower is not for anyone who has difficulty in walking. Try to get a room in their other tower, the Paradise Tower, which is only 30 or so feet away from the registration area. As far as I could tell, the rooms in either tower were identical. The room itself was tastefully done with modern conveniences such as a LED flat panel TV and an alarm clock with IPOD and other MP3 player access. Mine was on the 6th floor with a view of the airport and employee parking lot (which I was told I couldn't use; that would have shortened my walk approximately 90%). The windows were covered by wooden louvers which unfortunately failed to block the light from the powerful spotlights which illuminated the towers. Fortunately, I was able to cover my head with one of the many pillows provided on the bed itself, thus blocking out most of the light. The room was very quiet (it was a long way from the main area, remember). The $9.99 daily resort fee included Internet access, fitness room (which I didn't use) and 2 for 1 cocktails (not too useful if you're a teetotaler) as well as a boarding pass printout. To their credit, management had previously stated on their web site and Expedia that this daily charge will be assessed. Unfortunately, the charge had mushroomed to $11.90 per day on my bill, which I assumed was from taxes and did not need to be stated in advance. I will refrain from proselytizing on my opinions of resort charges since this is a family web site. Just be aware that some (fewer and fewer) unrepentant hotels still impose this charge. There now is a $10.80 weekend hot breakfast buffet available in one of the watering stops (Bacio Pasta). Unfortunately, it is only available on the weekends.

No brad garrett..( left with Bruce Baum...not funny at all) 2. No life in casino floor at all 3. Bars have no atmosphere (crucial to the sucess of any bar...anywhere) 4. pool area not done It is understandable how hard it is to compete with the super casinos on the strip so i think with the changes (i.e. nikki beach) there may hold hope for the tropicana... nikki beach will instill life into the resort. I do think the general casino area should be redone. i dont think the white walls work its not a comfortable gaming colour. On the upside... i was considering squuzing every last pillow into my suitcase... unbelievable pillows and bed over all... the rooms are really nice. i stayed in the mirage before it had renov. work done in the rooms. and the tropicana's rooms are better. fantastic value on the rooms... Also check out the eggs or sandwiches in the south beach deli... fantastic...

The rooms are all new and the beds incredibly comfortable like all of the reviews say. Our bathroom had old, dated tile and was just very basic. The ceilings are low and the hallway decor mundane. We were in the Paradise Tower. From what I understand from other guests I spoke to the other tower is much nicer and more luxurious. Even the front desk just seemed basic and plain to me. My bathroom glasses were not cleaned or replaced in 3 of the days we were there and pretty much the only thing the cleaning staff did each day to the room was make the bed and replace the towels.

The table area of the casinos is very small and only 1/2 of the tables are open the entire time I was there which was Thursday - Monday of Columbus Day w/e. The bar in the casino is way too quiet ~ no entertainment ~ and boring and a couple of the bartenders were as slow as could be! Many of the other people staying in the hotel are 60+. The pool was nice and I'm sure will be GORGEOUS once the construction is done. If you are young and going to Vegas to party Vegas-style and/or looking for an above average hotel I would recommend staying some place else. If you are looking for a new room with comfortable bed in a quiet hotel than this is for you. I would pay the extra money to stay elsewhere next time. I'd also prefer a hotel that is more centrally located on the strip rather than all the way at then end.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Valley, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at Tropicana!\u201d", "Author": "PomegranateMan", "ReviewID": "UR83943588", "Content": "The Tropicana is doing it's remodel right. We checked in on a Saturday afternoon 2PM. Got to a registration clerk within 2 minutes. Requested a room with a view of the garden/ pool area and also quiet.

Of course it being Vegas we never turned on the TV. Room clean, Even staying at the back corner of the back Tower we were within a few minutes of the strip. (I hate the hotels that route you all around the casino and make it as hard as possible to get to the strip). All the staff we met were very helpful and friendly, even an old dumpy couple like us were treated as true guests. Thanks! Pool and garden area still in middle of renovation. But the 2/3 of the area open was great. As I am always the first up I enjoyed having the garden area to walk in while enjoying a cup of coffee. I hope the Nikki Beach club area has some tables open in the am for us early birds when it opens. I only ate breakfast there. It was a smaller buffet but fresh and tasty ($9 I think). Only gripe was it was not open the next morning (a Monday). Only a small coffee house with starbuck type fare. The \"Biscayne Steak house\" looked inviting (was running a special for a 4 course tasing menu). Maybe try it next time. There definitely will be a next time, great location, great service. If they keep that as they finish the renovation this will be a hotel on my short list. You sat in lounge Saturday night and enjoyed a nitecap and listened to a Jazz group (Dave Perrico group). Nice comfortable lounge. Only Negative: The buffet was not open the next morning (a Monday). Only a small coffee house with starbuck type fare. Also be aware that work is still being done and may impact your visit.

I recognize that, so I won't be too hard on them, nor will I pick them apart. The rooms were remodeled and I had a great corner suite overlooking the strip. Problem is that there are so many sirens throughout the night, you almost think you are sleeping (when you can) next to a fire station. Oh...you are...well that and an ambulance station too. The sitting/living room is huge! The bedroom is also a good size, but I hated that the bed was literally two steps from the bathroom door. The remodeled bathroom was not as nice as I thought it would be. Seems like they cut costs on showers and toilets....nothing special at all. Not sure I dig the tiki motif; sort of bland for me. Service was very good (dealers, front, other staff). Pool was nice, but there were no tables to eat lunch at. We had to sit on lounge chairs in our clothes. I understand they are opening a Nikki's Beach there...so that should be amazing. Casino is small....6:5 on blackjack is the worst. No poker or sports betting yet. The 24 hour deli is too small to deal with any kinds of crowds and there is no buffet. Biscayne was excellent and I did not get to try the Italian place. Brad Garrett bought the comedy shop and it was about half full. On a side note...haven't actually walked the strip in about 10 years (walked to Planet Hollywood for show), and if it is another 10 years before I do it again, I won't be sad. Streets are filthy, drunk people everyone spilling beer on you everywhere, and assaulted by no fewer than 20+ people banging pamphlets of naked women in my face. Really? Walking with my wife? The cards and pamphlets are everywhere on the street...a shame for what was once an exciting walk. I will evaluate it again when everything opens and the Trop reinvents itself next year.

I would highly recommend this newly renovated and classy hotel/casino to anyone! We had a beautiful room in Paradise Tower on the 2nd floor - very clean and we loved the color scheme. Also loved the shuttered windows, which allowed us to let in varied amounts of light. Housekeeping staff were very friendly and did an outstanding job! Tropicana's entrance is elegant and makes a beautiful first impression. The double set of glass doors is always clean and friendly staff are at-the-ready to welcome and get the doors for guests. Unlike many other hotels which are jammed with noisy slot machines from the front door inward, Tropicana has its beautiful gaming tables up front under a breathtaking stained glass ceiling. Slots are off to the side and spaced to allow room to manuever, which was a definite plus. The entrance and check-in areas are elegant, and lend an impression of class, not clutter. We were out and about in the evenings, but had lunch and a few early dinners at the South Beach Deli at Tropicana. The food was excellent - freshest sandwiches and salads we've had anywhere, and delicious french fries! The fresh breads and ingredients made these sandwiches and salads/fries a much better choice than some of the buffets and other dinner deals in Vegas - highly recommended! The portions were huge, so you won't go hungry after eating at South Beach. We couldn't finish all our food, but it was absolutely delicious! South Beach also offers morning coffee for a comparable price to other places, and refills are free. The pool at Tropicana is truly a gem - gorgeous, well-maintained grounds with plenty of pool deck space and elegant cabanas! One truly has the experience of being in a secluded resort while swimming and relaxing. Pool staff were very friendlyand welcoming, and wait staff there did an excellent job.

My advice: Visit now. The Tropicana's renovation is truly making the place altogether fresh, and it's sort of going counter to the recent Vegas trend. Many Strip hotels have been \"de-theming\" themselves for several years, and now a lot of them are getting a homogenized, chain-hotel atmosphere. One looks a lot like the other. Not the Trop: This place is aiming for unique. The casino is glistening white, utterly unlike anything else on the Strip. The hotel is a South Beach theme with lots of bamboo-style decor and wicker, plenty of whites and creams and soft colors throughout the building. It's both attractive and distinctive. The Paradise Tower is freshly remodeled, and - at least for now - the rates are a remarkable bargain. The scale of this property seems to work nicely; I didn't see the massive registration lines that are common in bigger hotels, and the casino and grounds all have a \"manageable\" feel - big enough to be interesting, but not so large that you can get lost. Nicole Marshall, who responds to many postings here, is serious about providing customer service. The staff throughout the hotel is notable for friendliness & concern for the guests; Barbara at check-in went out of her way to be sure I knew about the hotel's amenities, the dining options, etc. You could get the same information at a lot of hotels, but it would be a rushed, mechanical speech - with Barbara, I got the sense that she sincerely wanted my stay to be enjoyable. Several other employees provided that same feeling, and I never encountered anyone who appeared bored with the job or impatient with a guest. The location is way south on the Strip, but the MGM's monorail station isn't far ... and the walk to the center Strip from the Tropicana is both safe and interesting. (Unlike the Strip's northern end, which is neither). The pool area is extraordinary; the pool and main hot tub are both attractively designed, and the landscaping is gorgeous. Many Strip hotels, even a couple of the 5-star properties, provide nothing more than a rectangular pool surrounded by concerete; the Tropicana's is an entire experience. I'll hope it doesn't get too popular after the remodeling; at least as of October 2010, though, it's the pefect mix of lively but not overbearing. For long-time Vegas fans, this is a property you've got to see again. If your memory is about the Trop of the past 20 years, you'll be thinking of a once-terrific place that is long past its glory days (similar to the Sahara or the Riviera). But that's last year's news; this remodel is much more than just paint and carpet, and the Tropicana of 2010 is unlike anything before. My hope is that it doesn't become too trendy in the next year or two; for right now, I doubt you can get a better mix of quality and reasonable price anywhere in Vegas.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel to stay in\u201d", "Author": "4freemind", "ReviewID": "UR82788761", "Content": "Everything was great.

There were lots of plush towels in the bathroom and I was happy to see that in the cloest there was an electrical outlet to plug in the iron. Silly, but that impressed me! Also the size of the bathroom was impressive. The staff I encountered were all polite and helpful. We only ate at the snack bar type restaurant and the food there was very good and had huge portions. One night we were so tired, we split a sandwich and still had leftovers. We had fun in the casino and didn't find it crowded. Good for the guest, not for the hotel I guess. The pool area is very nice, extremely clean and again the staff around the pool very friendly. If I had to complain about something it would be the too loud music around the pool. But that is an age related thing (I'm 55, he's 66). I'm more Barry Manilow, and the music was more aimed at the younger party crowd. We did find that at night the room didn't get quite as dark as we would have liked, but that was a minor thing. We slept like babies once we got to sleep. This was our 15th Vegas vacation, but first time staying at the Trop.

Negatives: (1) The large screen television was on the dresser next to a stand for another television. When I turned on the TV, it didn't work. I called down and was told an engineer would be \"right up\". An hour later, a very friendly engineer came in and explained that the hotel ran out of plasma televisions, so the rest of the room just had flat screens. And those new TVs didn't work all the time. Fortunately, it was an easy fix. About 45 minutes into watching television, it turned off by itself. I knew the problem and fixed it this time myself. (2) The room only has shutters over its window (probably to keep with the tropical theme). However, at night, with the lights of the building shining up the sides of the tower, the room is very bright even with the shutters closed. You can get up and move around without a problem in the middle of the night and see everything in the room. If you are a light-sleeper (like myself), this is an issue. I was facing east, so when the sun came up in the morning, the room was lit up like a spot light! (3) The windows were in dire need of cleaning. Otherwise, not a bad room for one night in Vegas. If I go to this event again next year (I was there for a hockey game), I will most likely splurge and stay somewhere else. If you are short on cash and want to stay on the strip, this isn't a bad hotel. It's comperable to a Super 8 hotel or any other average hotel, room-wise. The room was clean and comfortable.

Reasonable rates, easily accessible, new and clean rooms, friendly staff, bright casino, and short walk to elevators to get to your room. My only negative comment was that they need a buffet to entice people to stay a little longer. Not to worry, combination buffet along with short menu restaurant (sandwiches, salads, etc.) opening soon! Nikki Beach opening in April 2011!

We stayed there September 19-23 Seems that resort will be wonderful after the remodeling will be finished in Spring 2011..until then...not so much. The pool time was very challenging. Let me guess if you are visiting Vegas in Fall, you probably are coming from cooler states and want to prolong your summer - lay in the sun by the pool, get some tan and swim. Well, that was pretty difficult because the pool was half closed for all 5 days we stayed there. Lots of work was done, we saw lots of construction workers walk around, construction fence separates the pool from other (possibly more pools?) areas, the noise sometimes was so loud, we couldn't hear the music at the pool area. Unfortunately if you are an early bird, there is NO sun at the pool area until 10.45am - the hotel building make a big shade that covers entire pools side. A few hotel guests, including us, were trying to find a sunny spot around the pool in the morning ( that was difficult too because the pool is surrounded by the construction fence) but we were kicked from different locations because we were interrupting remodeling. You would think that the hotel would do everything possible to make your stay there less inconvenient? Nope. Actually guests had to do everything possible to have their remodeling going smooth.. You will see lots of workers in the resort and lots of people in suits with clip boards in their hands who are supervising them. Every morning we woke up around 7am to a drilling sound or hammer or something else from remodeling. You will see their motto everywhere' We are changing everything\" Yes, they are, indeed, at your expense. The hotel has enough guts to charge you additional $9.99 per day fee even during that inconvenient time! Now, don't get the wrong idea - there is no construction dust. The hotel is actually very clean. It smells good, the room was very sunny and clean. Bed was incredibly soft, linens are higher quality. Nice big TV in the room ( if you went to Vegas to watch TV). Bathroom was spacious, clean with nice big bath tub. Our window was overview the pool and main strip. Room was very quiet, we didn't hear any noise from the strip at night. Food: The have South Beach cafe in the building that open 24/7. It serves decent breakfast for the cost of $7-10. Coffee, pastry, fruits, drinks are at additional cost. OR you can walk to your next door neighbors Hooter hotel, that is literally in 5 minutes walk, and get a buffet brunch at Mad Onion for $9.99. For the same price of one meal in South Beach cafe you can get all you can eat including fruits and pastries. On Sundays you can have brunch with bottomless champagne for $12.99 They have 2 restaurants - Bacio and Biscayne. We didn't go to Bacio but dined at Biscayne. It was ok. Don't plan to get any glass of wine under $12 there. We ordered a prime rib that was $30 and was just OK. Any side dish at that place is for additional cost. ( the Hooters offer prime rib dinner every day for $9.99. We never made it there but would love to hear some feedback on that) The restaurant is meant to be fine dinning but something is missing there. The idea was right but the ambiance just didn't work The hotel doesn't have bar in the gambling area so if you like to sip on your drink and watch people, that won't happen. They have Celebrity Lounge in the corner, nice bar but hardly any people there. One night there was band playing. The music was so loud, we had wait when a song is done before ordering our drinks. Service in the gambling area was incredibly slow. You will finish your game and still won't get your drink. We lost couple of ordered drinks because couldn't wait any longer. The service at the pool was very efficient - we got our drinks very fast and the waitress checked on us regularly if we need anything. Once again, it will be a very nice hotel next spring when remodeling will be done. Looks like they are opening more restaurants and more pool area.

As days went along, this was not a \"one-off\" all the Tropicana staff we encountered without question were friendly, helpful and had a \"nothing is too much trouble attitude.\" Our room was large, clean and bright. We had an amazing view of the strip, and could see the mountains in the distance. The only slight issue, was our room was situated next to a staff entrance/cupboard, and some mornings I was woken up by banging about, however this is such a small issue. The casino is quite small, we didn't play much there, as we prefered other casino's. However when we did play there, we didnt wait long for a drink, and again the staff were extremely friendly. We ate in the South Beach Cafe one night, this was really nice, just what we needed after a busy day at the Grand Canyon. The pool is fantastic, once the new area opens next year, it will be amazing. We had a few mornings at the pool, it never felt crowded or especially noisy. Excellent waitress service for drinks, or a decent bar if you could be bothered to get off your bum!! Didnt seem to matter what time of day or night we left or entered the hotel, there was always a smiling doorman to open the door for you, this was a lovely touch. We had a late flight on our last day, we checked out, and the bag service looked after our bags until we were due to leave around 8pm, this meant we had all day on the strip without having to worry about dragging our bags around, or sitting around the airport waiting for our flight. When the shuttle bus was late picking us up, one of the doormen offered to call for us, again service with a smile.

The front desk staff person was really personable and efficient. The room was spacious, the bed extremely comfortable with a clean, crisp white sheet over the bedding - instead of the usual comforter or bedspread that rarely gets changed! The windows had louvered shutters instead of dusty curtains, and were aesthetically more pleasing. Nice big HD-TV. The view was decent, and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Now, the not so great stuff...We were a bit disappointed to find we had been checked into a room that clearly had not been finished by housekeeping. Within a few minutes of getting into the room, a housekeeping staff member used her key to open the door unaware that we were in the room. She then asked US if the room had been cleaned, which was upsetting. The bed was made and the room appeared to be \"ready\" at first glance, however, after the encounter with the maid (who brought a bath mat), we took a closer look. I immediately noticed there were no washcloths, so I caught the maid on her way down the hall and explained we needed them. She stated she didn't have any, that she was leaving, but would send someone up with some. Getting back to the room, and looking further, it was obvious that the carpet had not been vacuumed and that the bathroom floor had not been wiped clean. There were black streaks and hairs present. Other issues with the bathroom were mold in the shower, the tub was not a tub you would dare to take a bath in (dirty no-slip strips) and dirty areas in the tile floor grout. When there is white grout on a tile floor, housekeeping had better be prepared to keep it white. In this room, it was not, and was really dirty looking at the sink area. Later that night, upon returning to the room, well after midnight, we still had to call for the washcloths. The response was prompt and the staff member was apologetic. We had a comfortable, quiet night's sleep. The next morning we were up and out of the room by 7:00 am. We returned to the room to get ready for the evening only to find it had not been made up which meant no new towels. Another call to housekeeping...they said rooms were cleaned anywhere between 9 am and 5 pm. It was 4:30. So we asked to have the room made up while we were out and were accommodated. The next day we called to state that we would be out until 3:30 and requested that the room be made up by then and had no problems. Our request for the maid to clean the bathroom floor and the tub were honored to the best of her abilities. She placed an extra bath mat on the floor to cover the dirty grout near the sink. Hopefully it was scrubbed clean after we left since we called it to their attention. Other annoyances were: the track of the closet's sliding doors was bent to the point that only one door slid easily, the other literally had to be lifted from the track to open it to gain access to that side of the closet, and there was a hole in the bathroom ceiling where the sprinkler system came through that was way bigger than it needed to be. Minor, but it added to the sloppiness of the bathroom in general, as did the misaligned tiles and mismatched grout in the shower stall. The hotel room did have lots of hangers, drawer space, nice, hot, soft water and a multi-setting shower head. The towels could have smelled fresher, though. The location of the hotel was decent, with easy access to a number of other casino hotels and a walkway to get across busy Las Vegas Blvd. We did not use any other hotel amenities. Late one night we went to take a stroll around the pool area, which we were told was open 24 hours, but the sprinkler system was on, so that was a no-go. Would have used the pool while my spouse was using the hotel's sports book room, but it was closed to begin construction on a new one which forced us to venture out to other hotels instead of spending more time here. What we liked best was the friendly staff, and what we liked least was obviously the condition of the bathroom.

This probably suits the older clientele that the Tropicana attracts (we were one of the few people under 50!), but for us it was a major let down. All in all though, the place was great. I'd like to see where the Tropicana heads with their new \"changing everything\" direction.. I purposefully chose not to go to one of the more \"party\" casinos, because I wasn't really interested in hanging out with \"the beautiful people\" and the associated posturing, but likewise I found the Tropicana a bit too much of a retirement home.

The only negative thing was when we arrived the room hadnt been cleaned and there was food all over the place, once we told a member of staff there was a whole team of cleaners up there immediately so this wasnt a problem.

My younger sister arrived at 9:30 am and had no problem checking into her room as she was the first to arrive. Once she got to her room an inspector was checking to make sure a spill was cleaned up and asked if they needed to clean it again which my sister didn't see anything so told them no. My husband and I arrived at 3:30 and had no problem with any lines to check in. My sister's room was in the Paradise Tower and was double, we were upgraded to a suite in the Paradise Tower that was absolutely AMAZING! I can not rave enough about our hotel stay at the Tropicana! I also had a friend get in at 9am the next day and was able to check in as well and the hotel accomodated us by placing us all on the same floor. I had no problem with the elevators which I thought were very neat inside. Yes, there might have been a few minute wait later in the evening but nothing you wouldn't get at any other hotel in Las Vegas on a weekend night. The rooms were so clean and the air worked completely fine. The TV's were great and in the rooms you just felt very comfortable. The beds were so fabulous and comfortable as well. The view from our room I absolutely loved as you could see right now the strip, it was like watching a movie with views of the strip. Gambling was one of the best parts of our stay, I am a roulette player so it was just awesome seeing a $5 minimum bet even on the weekends. Also, the casino floor may be smaller than some other casinos but in my opinion this is great if you want to get service. You are not sitting there long before someone walks over to ask you if you want a drink. All of the dealers as well as the cocktail services were so friendly. Moving on to the pool. It is a beautiful pool with lots of lounge chairs that are very nice and comfy. On Saturday the pool was pretty busy but we just asked a pool guy if we could get a couple of chairs and he had no problem going to get us a few extra so we could sit together. They also have a grill outside where they cook food. The best part about the pool is that there is a sushi restuarant that is set up serving their sushi and it was the BEST sushi I have ever tried. I recommend trying it to anyone. The cafe that is open 24 hours was a really good spot to get something to eat late night or anytime during the day. The breakfast was huge portions and at night it wasn't busy at all. Another plus is that if you order a drink you are allowed to go back and get refills throughout the day. There was always someone outside to direct you or help you with anything. We had 6 people in our group and the max allowed in a cab is 5 so the bellman suggested we take the Tropicana limo which was $60 and seeing as we were going down the strip pretty fair it actuallly made sense to take it as we would have probably spent $40 for two cabs. We had an enjoyable ride down the strip and had comp water to sip on. Instead of riding in a cab that we have to make go the back roads to keep the cost down. We also took advantage of the comedy buy 2 for the price of 1 tickets and the show was hilarious. I laughed so hard that I was crying. They really have a great comedy show at the hotel and it's a great size of room. Also make sure you sign up for a players card because I was really surprised at the end of my trip when I found out we had over $100 in comps to use however we wanted. All in all this was the best trip to VEGAS I have had and that is all thanks to the Tropicana as well as Nicole Marshall. Nicole really helped in making this trip the BEST and I really appreciated all she did for us. Don't think twice about the Tropicana, because it is the place to stay and they are continuing to make changes and listening to what the customer says. You will be very happy with what you get.

Their new marketing showcasing the much needed renovations is what changed my mind. The group: I think it's always helpful to know what kind of people are writing the review so you know what our expectations/needs were. We are laid-back late-20-something professionals from the midwest, somewhat low rollers (we like $5 blackjack). Four of us had just been in Vegas in February, staying at the Aria. One other had stayed at the Encore the last trip, and the other was a Vegas virgin. All of us understood that we were taking a step down staying at the Trop, so we had certainly adjusted our expectations. The hotel generally: the renovations look great. There was usually somenoe at the door to open the doors for you, always with a smile and a hello. Once you walk in through the newly done entrance, the airy, light casino floor opens up. After staying at the Aria my last trip (I know, quite a different type of resort!), the big thing I noticed was how bright everything is at the Trop. The renovations are ongoing but mostly out of sight - there are temporary walls erected around the casino so you don't have to see the men at work. There is a slight coconut scent in the entrance area - one out of the six of us did not like it, I liked it a lot, and the other four did not mind it much. Definitely not as overpowering and offensive as the scent in the Venetian. The rooms: We had three rooms - two in the Paradise tower and one in the Island tower. All the rooms we had were newly renovated. I'd say the rooms are solidly 3.5 star rooms. Everything is clean, and, like the hotel, airy and light. The 42\" plasma TVs have HD channels, which is not always the case for a lot of the 3 to 4 star hotels on the strip. Toiletries were adequate - your standard shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, lotion and soap. They were scented with a coconut scent to go with the general motif of the hotel - again, I found it very pleasant, but one friend thought it was tacky. The bed was very comfortable. I understand the complaints people have with the shutters. They definitely do not block out all the light. I personally didn't mind because I woke up around 7:30am anyway, but I can see that if you're a light sleeper, you might not like it. None of the people in my party seemed to have trouble sleeping well into late morning, however. One bonus was that you are able to open the windows just a crack, to let some fresh air in. Island Tower vs. Paradise Tower: The rooms are essentially identical, but I think if I were to go back, I would stay at the Paradise Tower - it's very close to the casino floor and the entrance. In fact, it's so close to the entrance that I realized that the MGM Grand casino floor is closer to get to for someone staying at the Tropicana Paradise Tower than for some of the folks staying at the MGM Grand! However, the Island Tower would be very nice for people who want to use the pool - the elevator takes you basically right up to the pool. Which brings us to... The pool: I read in a review that the Trop has the best resort rate to pool quality ratio, and I have to agree with that. The pool is relaxing and unassuming - an \"ultrapool\" it was not, and that's a good thing. About 1/3 or so of the pool area was closed for renovation, but we were always able to get 4 chairs together (2 of our friends weren't much for the pool) and they always kept the free water filled (one was cucumber infused, one was lime infused). Drinks were a little overpriced - we did not order drinks after the first day. The gym: there is a small gym near the pool area. It was hardly used but had all the basic equipment you need - treadmills, a few machines, a variety of freeweights. Not great but, hey, it's free. The casino: The casino was very small, although I didn't mind that much, since I only play at one table at any given time anyway! Plus it made it easy for us to say \"meet at the blackjack tables\". As of last week, there were about a dozen tables open and a bunch of slot machines, but I understand that another renovated section of the casino is opening soon. I appreciated the fact that there was 3:2 $5 blackjack basically all the time. Swim-up blackjack was also pretty fun - a little gimmicky (you basically just sit in about 3 ft of water while you play) but fun for an hour or two. The casino never felt super exciting, even when it got fairly busy, probably because it was so small. The restaurants: There were 4 restaurants when I visited, including the steakhouse which had just opened. We tried all but the steakhouse. Bacio is the mid-range Italian restaurant. We had pasta dishes, pizza and salad among us. The portions are huge (2 or 3 people could probably have split the spaghetti) and quality is decent enough for the price range ($11-16 entrees). The Havanna Cafe was a good cheap option - cheap but not poor quality, mind you. My girlfriend said the veggie reuben was probably the best that she's ever had. The South Beach deli is open 24 hours and very mediocre - I would not recommend it unless you just need a quick bite at late hour. We also had coffee from the Starbucks kiosk near the conference center area - the coffee was not burnt, so that's always a plus (I noticed that a lot of coffee kiosks on the Strip burn their coffee by keeping the coffee on too long). Complaints: I do have a couple of minor complaints. First, there was a timeshare scamster set up as an \"information\" desk right near the check-in on the casino floor. Very tacky. I walked away saying I just want to go to the room, so you would think they would've taken a hint, but when I came back down to the casino area they tried to talk to me again (\"all settled in?\" etc). Second, more minor complaint: there were two conventions while we stayed, some kind of kids' martial arts convention and a kids' dance competition. That filled the hotel up with a lot of families, some with unruly kids. I understand it might be good business to get those conventions in there but THE reason I don't stay at the Excalibur is because of all the unruly kids - it'd be nice to phase out the family events. Lastly: there was almost no shopping to be done. I understand that part of the renovations includes putting in new shopping, though, and it's certainly not a priority for me. Final words: I enjoyed the Trop immensely. I had low, low expectations, which were certainly exceeded and then some. For the price, I don't think you can get much better than the Trop right now on the strip, in terms of hotel/room/pool quality and location. And the renovations keep going! I'd be very curious to see what the Garden rooms look like after the renovations - it would be awesome if they were as nice as the Island and Paradise rooms, and they keep the balconies. I also would love to return when the Nikki Beach stuff is done.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbia, sc", "Title": "\u201cClassy and clean with a fabulous staff!\u201d", "Author": "webb2010", "ReviewID": "UR77583669", "Content": "When we pulled up to the Tropicana we were promply greeted by the bellman.

Declaring the place the old \"Tiffany's\" of the strip, we couldn't wait to stay in a place with such a neat history. When we walked in the front door, I was suprised by the look and feel of the casino. It was very bright! The clean white floor tiles and stained glass ceiling made the atmosphere feel fresh and clean. It is a very classy place to stay. It is very different from the mega resorts in vegas! The woman who checked us in was also very friendly and helpful. We felt like we were home! When the bellman brought our luggage to our room, he was very helpful. He made sure we had everything we needed; he even offered to fill our ice bucket! We stayed in a room in the newly refinished paradise tower. The room was very spacious and had a breathtaking view of the strip! The room had large flat screen TV's, free wireless internet access, and bathrobes! The bed was AWESOME! Very comfortable! We felt like we were sleeping on a cloud! The bathroom was very large and clean; the water pressure was great! They even had an iphone radio charger (we loved this little detail). There are a few places to eat at the tropicana. We loved the 24 hour cafe. They served boars head meat on their sandwiches (my favorite). Everything was priced very reasonably! The other cafe there was open in the morning....they served starbucks coffee and had krispy kremes! The pool area was amazing! I was so happy to see that they had grassy areas and trees for shade! The lounge chairs were lined with comfortable pads; the pool staff kept everything very clean and in pristine condition! There was even a man that went around drying the area around the pool to keep people from slipping in the puddles. They paid a lot of attention to detail! We can't wait to visit this place again next year! We were very happy with the atmosphere, the friendly staff, and the classy feel of this casino! The staff made this place so special.

Gone are the annoying vendors on the bridge between towers, the cheesy Miami Vice attire for staff, the '80s idea of \"tropical\" decor, and the general cheap look of the hotel. What stayed? The AMAZING staff, some of which have been there nearly (or over) 20 years. This is a major recipe for success as far as I am concerned, since those people who helped us--from Bellmen to front desk personnel and everyone in between--were incredibly sweet, helpful and totally seasoned. After spending the first night in a room with an airport view, I kindly requested to move to a more appealing room with a better view, since this was my husband's first time in Las Vegas. Kimberlee quickly obliged with a smile, reserving us a room which would be ready in the early afternoon in the Paradise tower with a much better view at no additional charge. That's right folks, free upgrade! When it was time for us to move, my husband was busy in a poker tournament and so Chuy came to move our things from one room to the other. He was super friendly, and his service level again, was out of this world, right down to setting up our suitcase on a luggage rack in the new room. While we were there, we decided to eat at the South Beach Cafe, which is open 24 hours for room service as well. A really nice staff member there let us in on a little secret that is the $8 coffee tumbler. This got us free coffee for the entire time we stayed there, which is a HUGE savings with the way we drink coffee! We ate there several times for a few reasons: 1. It's SUPER cheap, compared to the other options out there. 2. The portions are HUGE, so hubby & I were able to split our meals. 3. The food is AMAZING! 4. They're FAST. We made our way down to the pool a couple times to take a quick dip and cool off from the hot desert sun, but this isn't finished yet. The open pool was far less exciting than the old one, but I have to give them a break here since the remodel won't be complete until next year. I will say that it was fairly large, not crowded, good temperature & had REALLY comfy lounge chairs. The swim-up blackjack tables were closed both times we were there, which kind of bummed me out, but other than that, it definitely got the job done. The location of this hotel was also perfect for us, since we stayed primarily on the south end of the Strip anyway. Although, even if you plan to venture further north on the strip, transportation options are abundant and easily accessible. The monorail is quite close at the MGM next door, and the Deuce has a stop right out front of the hotel. Overall, the Tropicana WELL-exceeded any expectations I had going into this trip, as I was just hoping for a bargain hotel and wasn't expecting any great service or luxury experience. We chose the Trop simply because it was a cheap bed for the night that was close to the action. We got WAY more than I ever expected, and I was pleasantly surprised!

Cons: Check-In took way too long - about 20 minutes before we even reached the counter. The line was all the way down the lobby, and yet they only had 2 employees staffing the counter. Such an antiquated system \u2013 they still use adding machines to total your bill! The lady helping us had to redo her math 3 times! We believe the air-conditioner in our room was leaking condensation. There was a huge wet spot in the corner of the room. House-keeping said we could either have someone sent to assess the situation or we could opt for a new room (we didn\u2019t want to deal with the front desk again). We declined. While it was unsettling to step barefoot into a puddle of unknown substance, it wasn\u2019t ultimately bothersome. We had to call to get our room serviced. House-keeping somehow missed our room after the first night. We opted for the delivery of few towels, as we didn\u2019t want to leave and wait for housekeeping to show up and clean. While the room was nice, the tile in the bathroom was pretty worn (a relic from the room pre remodel?). It detracted from the overall appearance. Don\u2019t trust the advertising regarding the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Legends. They promote a $34.99 four course meal with wine pairing. Sounded great until we were seated and found that it\u2019s only a \u201ctasting\u201d menu (small portions) and the wine (not even full glasses) is not paired with the last course. If we had been aware of the bait-and-switch, we would have gone elsewhere. Because we were short on time, we had to stay. Service was terrible. Not exaggerating, we sat for 15 minutes with finished plates and empty glasses between EACH course before we were even acknowledged. Food wasn\u2019t great either.

However, the floors were a little dirty with tons of scuff marks. Other than that no complaints. The water pressure in the shower was awesome! The casino area was good. Everything was spread out a little due to the ongoing construction, but it wasn't bad. I didn't think there were that many table games, but am hoping once everything is completed there will be more. There were a nice assortment of slot machines. The service in the casino was a little slow, but not bad. We spent Saturday afternoon by the pool and had a good time. There were plenty of servers and Lifegaurds on duty. Our server, Cory, took great care of us. My only complaint is that it can get slippery by the pool, I was walking over to check in and slipped and fell. I wasn't hurt, but have a little bruise on my knee. Another woman slipped as well. Hopefully when the pool gets redone, they can put another kind of floor in. I think it gets slippery because its so smooth, maybe a more textured floor would be better. The pool area is great, lots of trees which provided nice shade. There was good music playing and people were having a blast. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night. It was ok. The penne I ate had lots of veggies in it, but didn't really have much of a sauce. My boyfriend had the chicken picatta, which was slightly overcooked and a bit dry. However, the clam chowder was amazing!! The best we'd ever had. We would probably try it again and order different things. Overall, we had a great time at the Tropicana.

Supposedly the a/c was working fine but I was not anymore comfortable the second night so I guess they just have an inefficient ac system and the temperature is as good as it gets. I would recommend this hotel if you can get it for around $50, but not in the summer months - too hot and rates are really competetive I would stay here in a heartbeat in cooler months. Mostly because I love the fresh rooms and it is a little smaller than other casinos.

It woke me up every day and it was tough to get back to sleep. I think they could easily install curtiains in front of the windows and blinds to correct this. The bathroom was nice, but I think with the upgrades they could have done more. The tub and shower were standard and I would have preferred a stall shower similar to what Mandalay Bay has. The sink area was great. The maids did a good job cleaning up but for some reason didn't like replacing our soap. Twice during our stay they took the bar of soap that we had just opened and didn't replace it. They also didn't replace our bath mat one day and we had to use a towel instead. I can't comment on the pool because we never used it. I wish we could have but it was over 110 degrees and the thought of lying out in that heat wasn't appealing to me. It looked great though, and the lounge chairs looked really nice as well. In visiting the other casinos on the strip you get the idea of how tiny the Trop is compared to everything else. This was both a good and bad thing. It was great because I literally had to walk a few feet to the elevators after checking in and when coming back from being out all day. The down side is that there really isn't anything going on at the Trop at this time. I know they're renovating but there are hardly any dining options or stores to check out. Other than the comedy club there aren't any shows, and the casino was tiny and due to the renovations it's kind of scattered. There are slots thrown here and there without any organization. The location of the Trop is ok, but be prepared to walk or take a cab to the heart of the strip. The walking was rough in the heat and cab prices added up very fast. As others have stated, the service is very friendly. We were greeted by everyone we passed and when we asked a maid in a hall for some soap, we were gladly given several bars. I think once the renovations are done and with a few tweaks of the rooms, it will be a great place to stay and an awesome value.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThe best sleep I have had in a very long time!!!\u201d", "Author": "mardigrasmama", "ReviewID": "UR75548693", "Content": "We got an awesome deal on LasVegas.com on this hotel.

The hotel was pretty nasty then but the pool was nice. In looking for a hotel for this summers visit, I looked into the Tropicana again. I noted that the Paradise tower had been completely remodeled in January of 2010. I noted the pictures of the renovated rooms and they looked pretty good. I decided to book a room for three nights. The end cost before resort fees was $160.00. Upon arriving the bellhop were nice and we tried to check in (9am) and unfortunately they sold out the night before so rooms would not be available until after noon or so which was not an issue as check in is at 3pm. Upon arriving to the room it looked new nice and fresh. The rooms, hallways and elevators were much nicer than last year. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. I am thinking of purchasing the same brand due to how nice it was. The AC was set to 60 degrees in the hotel and it stayed that way the whole time we were there. It was nice to come back to a comfortable hotel room after a days walking around. One day we arrived back at the hotel at 3am in the morning. I decided to go alone into the casino to see what was happening. There were a few people around a craps table having a great time and the staff was into it and laughing along with everyone. I watched the craps table for about an hour. The rest of the casino (which is ridiculously small as compared to other casinos) had maybe 10 people on machines 10-20 people in the table area. I noted that there was a woman walking around that looked out of place. She seemed to have no direction except eyeing people. She was very skinny and very tall black woman dressed with minimal clothing. After she wandered around for a while there was a very built black man and a very skinny tall black woman wandering around in the same manner. It appeared that they didn't know where they were going and looked out of place. The first thing that came to my mind was a pimp and a prostitute. Giving the people the benefit of the doubt I shrugged the thought off. I walked around the slot machines for a while and noticed a third skinny tall black woman that again looked out of place. This woman had her arms around two obviously drunken looking white men in their 20's sitting at a couple of machines. It was obvious that she did not know them and was propositioning them for something. I try to give the people the benefit of the doubt as to what this woman was up to but there were too many factors that this person was out of place and trying soliciting something. I didn't see anyone of the staff members or security approach these people and ask what they were doing. Besides that the only negatives were that one morning there were loud indistinguishable noises coming from the hallway or above floor like maintenance work. I think I would recommend this hotel for its price and value but I will personally be staying somewhere to get a little atmosphere change and be closer to the middle of the strip and a hotel with a decent casino.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201cnice new rooms....excellent service\u201d", "Author": "phoenixdeb", "ReviewID": "UR74777383", "Content": "after seeing so many good reviews of this hotel lately we decided to book a new room, as there are some really good deals out there for this hotel during the summer months. we were pleasantly suprised at the quality and cleanliness of the new rooms and we were very pleased with the excellent customer service we recieved form everybody. our check in was fast and courteous, all requests were graciously honored and early check in was not a problem. since the hotel is undergoing renovation, there isnt a big selection of places to eat, so if you are looking for a \"destination\" resort, look elsewhere...if walking across the street to other hotels to eat for a better selection of restaurants is ok with you, then this lack of selection will not be a problem. the steak house is open, but pricey and the coffee place is open and is very good for breakfast and quick sandwiches. gaming is ok.......table games were fun due to great dealers and low minimums for betting......slots were new and fairly plentiful. of course, there will be alot more gaming when all is done and from what i can tell, the casino will be beautiful. the pool is up and running, but there are even more plans to expand and renovate it. the pool is still surrounded by lush gardens, grass and trees that are still there from the original Trop (YEAH!!!!). i cant wait for end-of-renovation-day as i think this will be a beautiful, fun place to stay in a year or so. for those of us who are old enough to remember the original Trop this is a very welcome renovation. there wasnt a better place to stay and play than the old hotel, so i hope they get it right again. i cant wait!!!!!", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "mmarnimitchell", "ReviewID": "UR74767295", "Content": "I stayed at the Tropicana for 3 nights from the moment I walked in the door the service was outstanding and the pool was great.

I was completely wrong\u2026 I could hardly believe what I saw as I walked in to the Tropicana. I knew the property was undergoing a renovation, but this is complete transformation. If memory serves me correct, the hotel was dark, dingy and very smoky. I walked through the door and saw bright, crisp clean and new. Add to that, no trace of cigarette smoke (which is a HUGE bonus in my eyes) and I knew this stay would be nothing like the first time I had visited. That was just the beginning. When I got to my room the bedding and furnishings were also brand new, including new flat screen TV\u2019s. One of the most comfortable beds I've slept in while traveling. And, I travel for my job, frequently. Absolutely incredible! The guestrooms & bathrooms are both very spacious. The pool, which is where I spent the majority of my time was still wonderful.

However, the pool at the Tropicana has always been wonderful, so I\u2019ve got no complaints. Finally, I know construction was taking place during our stay, but I definitely did not hear any \"construction\" noises and I was completely impressed with what is complete so far.

After reading several positive reviews about the Tropicana, I decide to book a room and take advantage of their summer deal ( 3nights stay with the 3rd night free). We arrived ten minutes before check in so we toured the hotel. Although there were some construction going on, it was not distracting. The walk ways were well let. The hotel had a delicious but not over powering coconut smell to set a tropical mood. The pool was very clean and attractive for all ages. It was not overly crowed like other resorts and there were plenty of lounge chairs for guest. - Gerad checked us in quickly. He was very friendly and full of smiles. He went over all the hotel fees, attractions, and entertainment. He made us feel like VIP; Thank you Gerad. - We stayed in the new rooms in the Paradise Tower. BEAUTIFUL AND SPACIOUS. The rooms are a must stay. The decor was modern. The king size bed was very comfortable and supportive( especially after long walks on the strip). There were plenty of closet and bathroom space. We had a fabulous view of the strip. The blinds kept all the flashy lights out so we slept peacefully. -The pool staff was friendly. They always made sure there were clean towels. The life guards were aware, professional, and enforce pool rules when guest were being reckless. - The sandwiches at South Beach Cafe were delicious and quite big. Had to share a sandwich with my husband. The Questionable: - Right after we checked in we were approach by Peter from guest services. He explained about the Polo Tower hotel tour and wanted set up an appointment. I kindly thanked him for the offer but explained it's our first time in Vegas and decline the offer. I then asked him about the hotel's reward services and if he could direct me towards the reward center. He told me,\" It's my first day working at Tropicana so I don't know. You'll have to ask another staff.\" I just stared at him as he turned around, drank his coffee, and began a conversation with another staff. I was extremely shock by his rude and unprofessional behavior and attitude. Every time we think of the beautiful Tropicana we will always think of Peter's horrible service. - Check-out was complicated. Gwen checked us out but over charged us for an extra night. I had to pull out my first receipt and explained that I had book for the summer package. She apologize and corrected the situation. We spent quiet some time waiting for the mistake to be cleared; We waited a few days for the money to be returned into our account. - Housekeeping was okay. They were friendly and provided my husband and I with clean towels. However, on our last day we decided to sleep in until 11:30am (since we don't check out until 1pm). We put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door handle. However, house keeping knock on the door and woke us up so they could come in. Overall, the Tropicana is a beautiful hotel located perfectly on the strip (not too far but not too close to the traffic). Some staff provide great customer service and others need to be re-trained. I'm not sure if I will stay at the Tropicana again after my bad experience but I would suggest it to others who may have better luck and not experience what my husband and I went through.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWe had an excellent time at the Tropicana!\u201d", "Author": "chrisandbrent", "ReviewID": "UR74225876", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from 4 nights/5 days in Las Vegas. We were celebrating our 16th anniversary so it was important that this trip go well. We have only been on one other 'major' trip (to Mexico) and I managed to get 2nd degree sunburn on the 1st full day so we were confined to our hotel room because I couldn't walk. Needless to say, that trip was a wash............ I contacted the hotel via email a few days before we arrived to ask about setting up some type of surprise for my husband, maybe chocolate covered strawberries in the room or something (I wanted to make up for the last disaster). The person that I corresponded with was very pleasant and advised me that they would have 'amenities' in our room, compliments of the hotel staff . (I apologize if this seems long winded but if you want to know what the hotel is all about, read on.) We arrived at the hotel just after noon on Sunday and found the lobby to be quite busy with check in/check out. The line up was kind of long but one of the hotel staff asked anyone waiting in line if they would like a bottle of water. In speaking to the front desk clerk, we were advised that our room was not ready yet and that we should come back in roughly an hour or so. I had to ask if there was something that we could do about our luggage because we didn't really feel like dragging luggage around outside in 103 F temperature. The clerk suggested that we find the doorman. We did look for the doorman for about 20 minutes but I guess he was on his break so we decided to sit outside and wait it out. I am not going to fault the hotel for any wrongdoing because the check in time is 3:00 PM (I believe). The Room: We stayed in room 2025 which has been recently updated. Nice room, super comfortable bedding/linens, large flat screen tv and a nice day bed lounger in front of the window. The only things we found wrong with the room were 1) looks like someone left some dark clothing on the tiles in the bathroom, which unfortunately stained the tiles & 2) there is a cover on the glass of the windows that makes taking pictures of the view kind of difficult. It would have been nice if the covering on the windows had been plain instead of black with little holes. Other than that, room was great! Location: The Tropicana is located at the intersection of Tropicana & Las Vegas Blvd South. The other three hotels at the same intersection are the MGM Grand, The Excalibur & New York New York. There is tons of stuff to see so make sure you have good soled shoes because you will do plenty of walking. It would be nice if the hotel was a little further north down the strip but you still have access to take the monorail or the 'Deuce' (double decker bus) to go further north down the strip. For us, the only major drawback to the location of this hotel was the fact that all of the helicopters use Tropicana Avenue as their guide to get back to the airport. The helicopters are going all day long and it can get annoying after a while. Restaurants: We only ate at the South Beach Cafe here. Menu is somewhat limited but the food that we ordered was excellent. Really good chicken wings! One thing that really impressed me about this little restaurant was the staff. They were pleasant, friendly and always smiling. Menu prices were reasonable. Pool Area: When I originally checked out this hotel on the hotel's website, I found it to be lacking information & pictures. What little pictures and write ups there were lead me to expect something other than what was actually there. On the website, it offers 'swim up to your own private island ($50/day)'. I was expecting that you would swim to this little island but in fact, it is just part of the pool deck sectioned off....you're still at the main swimming pool. To me, it just seemed like you would be paying $50 to reserve a lounge chair at the pool. As for the pool itself, it's a nice large pool and you never felt like it was over-crowded. There were always lounge chairs available. One thing about the lounge chairs on the pool deck was that it reminded me of a cruise ship, with all the chairs lined up in rows which kind of sucks because you don't really have the option of moving them around too far. The pool deck seems to need a little bit of grit or something on it....my husband watched a kid slip on the deck and fell onto his head. Be careful when getting out of the pool and walk slow. The lifeguards are on duty and won't hesitate to blow the whistle at anyone running on the deck. They also use a squeegie type tool to push the pooled up water on the pool deck into the drains. There were a couple of drawbacks that we noted...1) as they are still renovating, they have a section fenced off and on the other side of the fence, it looks like there might have been a pool or lagoons or something. Every now and then, if the wind shifted the wrong way, you would get a strong smell of sewage. I am assuming that it was just the stagnant water on the other side of the fence but it was unpleasant at times...and 2) there is a sign in the hotel, at the doors leading to the pool, advising guests that there is to be no 'outside' food or drink beyond the sign. I can understand not having glass containers brought down onto the pool deck, but I still think you should be able to bring your own bottled water, juice or pop (as long as it is in a plastic bottle), as well as snacks. There is a bar at the pool offering beverages (kind of pricey) but they do have two containers offering super ice cold water (for FREE). One container has lemons/limes with the water and the other has sliced cucumbers. I was a little sketchy about the 'cucumber' water but you have to try it.....it was really good and refreshing! The Casino: I can't really comment too much about the casino, to me, they are pretty much all the same. This hotel does offer you to sign up to be a club member (as do most, I believe) and during our stay, there was also a promotion to scratch off an amount on a ticket. Both my husband and I both got the same amount ($10) but that $10 was loaded onto our member cards and gave us $10 in free play. I thought that was nice of them to give you money to play with. (We made our way to the Riviera and signed up as 'club members' there and they gave us a WHOLE DOLLAR!) Housekeeping/Cleanliness: The housekeeping staff member that I met was great. I had to run back up to the room for something and she was already in our room. I said hello and she was very friendly and very apologetic when she asked that I put my card 'key' into the door, for security purposes. I had no problem with that and thanked her for doing that. I appreciated the position she was in and doing that was fine with me! Our room was always clean and the little shampoo/conditioner/shower gel & lotion bottles were always replenished if they were getting low. Some hotels give you the token bottles but they never get replaced so that was also a nice touch. The rest of the hotel was always clean. The Staff: So remember earlier, I mentioned about the staff member that I corresponded with via email and was promised complimentary amenities in our room? We arrived Sunday, got up to the room and nothing was there. No problem, I figured that they were waiting for me to check in. Sunday evening, nothing. Monday and Tuesday go by with no contact by the staff member or the other four staff members that were also copied on the email. On Wednesday, I was a little annoyed and went to the front desk to ask that a message be left with that particular staff member to advise her that we had checked in on Sunday and would be checking out on Thursday. One of the front desk staff members, Gwen, overheard my conversation and pulled me into another area (away from my husband because it was supposed to be a surprise) and asked me to explain the situation. After explaining, Gwen was horrified that a staff member would do such a thing. I suggested that maybe there was just a communication error but she was still shaking her head saying that what happened was wrong. She sent my husband and I to the South Beach Cafe for a complimentary breakfast and when we returned to our room later that afternoon, there was a beautiful wine & cheese basket delivered to our room, along with chocolate covered strawberries and a card wishing us a happy anniversary, which was signed by all the Front Desk staff working that day. Gwen went out of her way to see that the error was corrected and I cannot stress enough how thoughtful that was as well as appreciated. So now to the pros & cons: PROS: 1) Cleanliness of the hotel, 2) The Staff, 3) Nice pool, 4) Relatively good location on the strip, 5) Our flight didn't leave until 7:55 PM but the Bell Desk stored our luggage until our airport shuttle arrived, 6) Ice makers on every floor, along with pop machine ($2/pop). CONS: 1) Helicopters use Tropicana Avenue as their guide to get back to the airport and these things are flying non-stop all day long so it can get annoying, 2) No fridge in room, 3) If you don't have a credit card, you have to have your phoneline 'turned on' in order to make a local call, 4) Resort fees.....if you have to pay the resort fees, the internet should be included. I did bring our laptop but it was $12.99 for 24 hours, which I certainly wasn't going to pay since I didn't plan on sitting on the computer long enough to get my money's worth. I just wanted to send our kids an email to advise them that we arrived safely but it was cheaper to text, 5) Telemarketers right in the hotel lobby, trying to sell you timeshares. We had never been to Vegas before so we had no idea what was really going on. We had only just arrived when we got cornered by two woman, which I thought were part of the hotel staff. We were offered a ride in the limo, free dinners and show tickets and we stood there listening to all of this until she mentioned '2 hour presentation'. STOP! We're on vacation.......not shopping for condos! (Just as a side note: these people are not limited to the hotel lobby, they are EVERYWHERE, in every hotel and I swear, on every street corner! Just learn to say 'no thank you'. Also, while I'm on the topic of street corners.....both men & women will be on the sidewalks, spread out along the strip. They have business cards that they 'snap' and 'click' and try and shove into your hands. These business cards are for 'escorts' (ya right). They even have a catalogue! Only in Vegas, LOL! To the women reading this, don't be offended if your husband is offered these cards, these people offer this stuff to EVERYONE, including kids, so if you plan on bringing your kids along (which I personally wouldn't recommend), have a pep talk with them BEFORE you start your journey. You will also find many, many vendors on the walkways/sidewalks offering you water for $1. If you go when it is as hot as it was for us, you will appreciate paying the $1/bottle, and the water is ICE COLD! Also, if you are in the mood to get a tattoo, we found a shop further north down the strip, Rockstar Tattoo, located between the Wynn & the Riviera. Shop rates $100/hour much better than the rates charged further south on the strip in hotels.) This hotel is in the middle of a major transformation. There were guests of all ages but it seemed like there were a lot of 'mature' adults. It looks to me like the Tropicana is trying to bring in a new group of guests and they are well on their way of achieving their goals. There is a new 'beach' concept that is scheduled for completion in 2011 which looks really cool. So would we recommend this hotel to others or stay there again?? Most definately!! Even though there were a few bumps along the way, we had an excellent time. We will definately be back because we didn't see half the stuff we wanted to and I am rather intrigued to see the completion of the renovations. Not to mention the staff, their kindness did not go unnoticed and they need to pat themselves on the back for a job well done!

I have been to Las Vegas numerous time and this was the best hotel so far. To start, upon check in we were given vouchers for free shows and drinks, not buy 1 get 1 or $ off the price, it was totally free. That was so great! To feel valued right from the moment you check in. Actually, come to think of it the doormen were also great even before we got into the hotel and help us to get our bags inside and up the steps. Our room was not the fanciest but still, it was clean and comfortable. We asked for a strip view and were given a room on the side looking out to the MGM and a part of the strip. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting for a view but still was beautiful. We were 3 floors up but there was no noise from the strip below. We had a television, safe, couch and table in our room with the king bed we requested. After leaving our room, we went to the bar near a little restaurant, I think it may have been a deli, the bar was in a corner with only a few machines and sort of away from the main crowd. The bartender was extremely nice and friendly and new we were Canadian by our drinks. He proceeded to tell us the origin of our drinks and how they related to Canadians. I thought it was very nice that he went out of his way to know facts about other countries and to share them with us. It made us feel special. The drinks he made were perfect, I don't always get my drink exactly as I want it but he got it bang on. We had a few drinks and then left. We had gone back later and each day after in hopes he would be there again but no luck. We ate at the deli/restaurant near the theater and elevators to our room, it was great. I tried several different items and all satisfied me quite nice. We also ate at the buffet, you can get a 24 hour pass for $30, not a 1 day pass but a 24 hour pass. We got ours early in the day so we could have breakfast, lunch, dinner and then breakfast again the next morning before it expired. LOVED IT!!! The food was good, great selection, and the wait staff were very friendly every time. There is a self serve drink station but a few times the wait staff would go and get our drinks for us. Very nice! There is a resort fee but I can't remember what it was or what it included. I have read alot of reviews complaining about this fee but it seems to be becoming popular among the hotels in Vegas, so get used to it. In general the stay was great and it was my first time going in \"winter\". Christmas in Vegas is beautiful and for anyone who hasn't seen it, you should check it out, very unique. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Big Lake, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cLOVE the new Tropicana!!\u201d", "Author": "family_of_four_mn", "ReviewID": "UR73724825", "Content": "We just got back from our stay at the new Tropicana. We went to Las Vegas to celebrate my 40th birthday and our 10th wedding anniversary. We booked our room from the hotels website and got a package deal which included a standard room in the Paradise tower. Before we left I contacted Nicole Marshall, the Guest Experience Manager. I explained to her the reason for our visit and asked if I could get a free upgrade or discount. I honestly did not expect to hear back from her but a few days after sending her the email she replied telling us she arranged for us to stay in one of their suites for no additional fees. We were very surprised and couldn't wait to get to Las Vegas. Our package included VIP check in. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and went to the VIP line. There was one other couple waiting to check in in this area and about 20 people trying to check in in the non VIP line. We waited only a few minutes and then we were greeted by Doug. Doug explained to us that our room was not ready yet and to come back around 1pm. He informed us that we could check our luggage at the bell desk, which we did. We went and had lunch and returned at 1pm. Doug explained to us that our room still was not ready and to come back at 2pm. It was a little frustrating but well worth the wait. They did not want to move us into another suite because the one we were booked in was a great suite. So at 2pm we finally were able to get into our room. All I can say is WOW - WOW - WOW! It was unbelievable. I have posted some pictures for you all to see as well. Two HUGE rooms and the view was outstanding. We were right on the corner of the strip and could see MGM, NYNY and all the way down the strip. We took a look around the room and everything was just perfect. I could still smell the fresh paint. The bed was so comfortable my husband even made a comment about it. He normally wakes up with a sore back but he said that with this bed he did not. There were only a few things that were not working right - the brand new TV in the living area would skip channels (so we just watched the TV that was in our bedroom) and the AC unit in the bedroom would make a terrible noise during the night. (On the last night my husband got up and tapped the unit a couple times and that made the noise go away). The hotel itself was still being remodeled but it was very clean, NO NOISE at all!! The pool was great, very clean and refreshing. The casino/hotel is much smaller than the ones close by but this is what we liked. It was easy to find your way around. The elevator to the Paradise tower was right by the front door. The elevators are not air conditioned but we did not have to wait for the elevator like others have mentioned in their reviews. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The people that work there were always very friendly and because of the upgrade that Nicole gave it made this vacation one to remember. My husband and I did not want to leave. I would highly recommend staying at the Tropicana!

There are signs that clearly state that Tropicana is not responsible for anything that happens to your car while parked there, however, it seems like security guards might notice someone attempting to break into a car with a crowbar. We understood the casino not being liable for the damage and when we noticed the damage we tried to file a report so the insurance company and rental car companywould know of the damage and attempted break in. This is where we had problems. We talked to a security guard who referred us inside to talk to a security supervisor named George Cardenas who was EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL.

She answered all my questions and was ready to help in any way she could. I hope the Trop knows what an asset she is to them! We were in our room about 10 minutes and the phone rang. It was room service, saying they had a surprise for us! It was champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries, and an anniversary card! We couldn't believe it! What a way to start our vacation! The room was awesome, beyond our expectations! We spent a lot of time at the pool, loved the music! The pool is one of the main reasons we stay at the Trop!

I was not sure what to expect but Nicole Marshall answered all of my questions and reassured me of whatever I was questioning. She is definitely an asset to the Tropicana and without her assistance I would have picked another place to stay while in Vegas, but I sure am glad I went with the Tropicana. I did tell one of the front desk staff to tell her I said thank you because we had a wonderful experience. This was our first time in Las Vegas and everyone at the hotel was extremely nice and helpful. I actually liked the size of the casino at the Tropicana because it was adequate and I didn't get lost like I did in some of the bigger hotels and casino's. Even though the Tropicana is at the end of the strip, it always had a lot of people in it. We stayed in the newly renovated Paradise Tower and it was absolutely beautiful. The beds were especially comfy and cozy and my fiance' certainly enjoyed the size of the T.V., when we did watch it. We had a wonderful view of the MGM and could see the beautiful lights at nighttime. The bathroom was nice as well and the room service was great. We always had fresh towels and our bed linens were changed about every day, even though we didn't request our bed linens to be changed everyday, clean linens are always great! When I showed pictures to my family, they all thought the hotel and bedrooms were beautiful. If I had a question the front desk answered it and they always were very helpful. Even though the Tropicana is at the end of the strip, there was transportation available in front of the hotel (across from Excalibur) or you could walk over pass the MGM and buy a $7 24 hour shuttle pass. I only had a couple of issues with the hotel. The first being the elevator's were extremely hot but I am pretty sure they were trying to fix that. The wait for the elevator to take you to your floor or to the main lobby/casino level took FOREVER and there was always crowds of people waiting. There is only four elevators and I didn't see any stairs to take. We were pretty much at the top of the hotel but I wouldn't have minded walking up them if it meant not waiting forever. The hotel is clean, but they always had cleaning ladies directly in front of the elevators or near the elevators mopping or what not, but oh well, at least the floor was clean! It was kind of annoying because there's really only one or two ways to get to the elevator's and it was blocked by the cleaning ladies, or the crowds of people trying to get on the elevator. There was also a pretty long line checking in, but probably not as bad as some other hotels, it didn't really bother me. They were extremely nice and thorough when they checked you in and very friendly, so that's all that matter's I guess. The one thing that did bother me is when we first checked into the hotel, the person at the front desk told us the pool was open until 7pm during the week and 8pm on the weekends. However, we rushed back on a Saturday from what we were doing to go enjoy the pool since it supposedly closed at eight. When we got down to the pool one of the staff members let us know that it was closing at seven, which was in 5 minutes from when we got down there, needless to say I was not pleased. I even looked at the brochure when we first checked in because I thought I misread what the person at the front desk wrote down, but it did say the pool closed at 8. This was another issue because I did not like the fact the pool closed so early. I have never heard of a pool closing at seven during the week, and especially on the weekends, and in Las Vegas no less?? I think they should definitely consider closing at a later time. The pool was nice and I would have liked to been able to lounge around pass seven. There needs to be better communication between the front desk and pool because when I questioned the pool staff girl, she automatically said, \"Oh, did the front desk tell you that it closed at eight?\", to which I responded, yes. So i knew there wasn't great communication there. The pool issue really bugged me, but oh well, I did enjoy the time I did get to spend there, none the less. Although the hotel is under construction, it didn't phase us at all. We did trying Bacio, the Italian restaurant at the Tropicana and it was very good. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anybody and I have recommended it to family and friends who regularly go to Vegas or want to go.

The Tropicana is currently promoting itself with the tag line, \"We're changing everything.\" Well, they might be changing everything, but the job isn't done yet. It will be a while before they truly can claim to be \"best in class.\" Right now, the Trop has good points, so-so points, and a few downright down points. That doesn't mean you should rule it out, but you should go in with an open mind to the idea that this is a hotel in transition, and there are still some warts around the edges. We stayed in the newly remodeled Paradise Tower. It is important for anyone staying at the Trop to understand that they are undergoing a remodelling that began with their Paradise Tower, and is moving through to the Island Tower now. The \"garden rooms\" have NOT been renovated at all as of this time. We had time to explore all areas of the hotel, and there are still vast differences between the newly remodelled tower and the other parts of the hotel. The overall effect is sort of schizophrenic as a result, which likely accounts for the wild disparity between reviews. First, the positive: The Trop is a very convenient place to stay if you want to be near all of the action on the strip. It is an easy walk across the walkways over Las Vegas Blvd. to MGM Grand, Luxor, NY-NY, and the tram to the Mandalay Bay. We liked the fact that the Tropicana is not as \"hustle and bustle\" as the other hotels and casinos nearby. A plus is that you do not have to walk through miles of casino space to get to the elevator to the Paradise Tower. Parking was ample and free. Our deal, booked through the hotel, was three nights for the price of two, $69 a night plus resort fee of $8.99. The deal included two free drinks in the bar (well only) for each night of our stay, as well as a free apetizer in Legends, the Trop's best restaurant. Check in was speedy (our deal included VIP check in). Our room in the Paradise Tower was nice. Everything was new, down to the wallpaper. Comfortable bed, spacious room and bath. A nice touch was the hand makeup mirror in the bathroom. Although our room was right by the elevator, we weren't bothered by any noise. Overall, it was very comparable to our room at the Bellagio where we stayed several years ago. Now, for so-so parts of the Trop. Construction is definitely occurring here. I am putting this in the \"so so\" part, because, honestly, it really wasn't all that obtrusive in most parts of the hotel. (See the section on the Garden View rooms below however). Yes, there are some large white screens in the lobby/casino, and, from time to time you might hear a bit of noise while walking through the public areas, but, overall, it was easy to ignore. The Trop's restaurants should also be classified as \"so so\" It does have several places to eat --- two of them are more coffee shop, order at the counter types of places. We had dinner at Legends, the Trop's \"upscale\" option our first night. NOTE: The Trop is currently advertising a $34 \"four course\" dinner with wine pairings at Legends. Sounds like a good deal, and that is why we decided to eat at Legends. However, our waiter immediately warned us that this is really to be considered a \"tasting menu\" not a DINNER. When we looked at the actual menu for what was being served, we both had a good laugh. The four courses were as follows: First course: One scallop Second course: One shrimp and two mussels Third course: One short rib Fourth course: cup of sorbet We couldn't help wondering if the wine would be served in a thimble. We felt that this was something of a \"bait and switch\" -- get you in the door for the \"price fixe\" then tell you that you will starve to death if you don't order something else. Still, our regular dinners were fine (nothing out of this world), although we would have probably given the experience a higher rating if the view had been a bit better (our window table overlooked a flat empty roof). There were also some aspects of the new rooms that we found lacking. For instance, the shutters in the rooms look nice - until you turn off the lights to go to bed and realize that all the lights of the Strip are shining directly between those shutter slats. They really need to have some sort of black out curtains! Also, the \"daybed\" that they show in all of the pictures looks great, until you realize that it is impossible to sit on because there is no back to it, and there is only ONE \"real\" chair in the room, a very hard desk chair. If you have more than one person in the room, the other person will end up having to sit on the bed. Finally, we couldn't remember the last time we'd stayed in a hotel where there was no coffee maker! These are the little things that really make you feel comfortable and at home, and they were just not quite up to snuff. I wonder whether the interior decorators actually spent a night or two in the rooms they designed. :) We also felt it was somewhat off-putting that there was a sign on the desk warning us not to damage or remove any of the furnishings. Made us wonder just what type of people the Trop thinks their customers are. Again, a small thing, but left a strange taste in our mouth. Internet access is $12.99 a day. When you're paying a \"resort fee\" one would expect free internet. Now, the Trop's real downsides. The Tropicana is one of the oldest hotels on the strip. While the renovations in the Paradise Tower have brought it up to modern standards, there are still many areas of the hotel where it is obvious upgrading still needs to be done. For instance, the hallway to the restroom in the casino is lined with mirrors. Several of the mirrors were broken and had been taped over with duct tape. Rather odd to see something like this in a hotel that is claiming to be \"best in class.\" The worst area of the hotel are the \"garden rooms\" which are the original parts of the hotel. We walked through here several times on our way to the parking area, and we had the opportunity to look into several of the rooms. At best, this area resembles a Motel 6 - dark hallways, doors with worn numbers on them. Furniture in the rooms resembles a Motel 6 as well. While we saw housecleaning in this part of the hotel, they don't appear to be really taking care of the public areas of this part of the hotel. The floor of one of the elevators was covered in big clods of dirt for our entire stay. I'm talking BIG hunks of dirt. While it is likely that this was dragged in by the construction workers, there really is no excuse for something like this not to be cleaned up immediately (how about putting some plastic down if the workers are going in and out of this elevator?). Also, we noticed that a lot of the construction equipment and supplies were stored directly outside many of the garden rooms, so it seems likely that there will be more noise there than we experienced in the Paradise Tower. DO NOT stay in the Garden rooms, unless you are on a severe budget! However, if you're staying in the Paradise Tower, you probably won't Other public areas of the hotel also aren't living up to the standard of \"best in class\" that Trop is advertising for its Paradise Towe rooms. For instance, the walkway from the parking garage to the front is literally a hot alley between a cement wall and the airconditioning unit. The lobby itself has not been renovated yet, and feels dark. Worse, you have to go up two flights of stairs to get to registration and there is no ramp for your bags. We found this an odd set up, and somewhat unwelcoming. So, should you stay at the Tropicana? If you can get a great deal like we did for the Paradise Tower, the answer is \"yes.\" While there are some warts around the edges, we enjoyed our stay overall. However, be sure you know exactly what you are signing up for - ask questions about whether you'll be staying in the Paradise Tower, and do consider whether you'd prefer to stay at a more \"happening\" place while in Vegas. In spite of the downsides, overall, we enjoyed our stay, and, if the price was right, would stay here again. But, by the same token, we could see how the Trop might not be right for others. If you're looking for \"best in class,\" it probably would be best to wait awhile to stay at the Trop. If you're OK with a few warts around the edges, and can book a good deal in the Paradise Tower, I would say you shouldn't have any worries about the Trop.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guam, Tamuning", "Title": "\u201cit was the most beautiful and special place in Vegas \" Tropicana Hotel\"\u201d", "Author": "yunibear", "ReviewID": "UR71695445", "Content": "it was the most beautiful and special place in Las Vegas.

A senior staff member assisted our group in obtaining an excellent group rate, for which we got a remarkable stay. While not as flashy (or expensive) as some of the gaudier hotels on the Strip, the Tropicana offers a truly high-class experience to guests who choose to stay there. I'll try to touch quickly on the rated categories above, in order. The Trop is kept quite spic and span, and the rooms are daily prepared to a state of comfort and beauty that recalls the hospitality of times past, when the customer was king. The bed was amongst the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The room was spacious and well-furnished. The service is wonderful. Employees at the Tropicana are amongst the most polite and accommodating I've encountered in a hotel. They hold doors open for you, they smile, and they generally try to ensure that your stay is worth your while and dollars. The location was, in my opinion, ideal. The Trop is situated just off of the Strip, which allows you to venture onto it during the day and enjoy the various hedonistic pleasures that Las Vegas has to offer, yet permits you to retreat to a place of relative calm in the evening after a show (though, of course, the gambler will not be disappointed by the Trop's casino). The value was excellent. It was easy and pleasant to negotiate a rate which was affordable for our group, and needless to say the experience was worth every penny. The rooms are, as i mentioned, splendid. They have dual large beds, comfortably outfitted with high-quality linens that ensure a good night's sleep after cavorting about the Strip. Each has a large flat-screen TV and cable. The bathrooms are spacious. I find it sort of odd that sleep quality is listed a separate category, but since it is, I'll put in a good word for it. I slept very well at the Tropicana. It was quiet and off the Strip. My one complaint is the high expense of the sandwiches (which, like everything else, were very good). Overall, five stars out of five.

This was a short 3-day vacation and a first to Las Vegas for all 4 couples. If we ever go back, we would definately check into staying at the Tropicana again. PROS: *It was a short ride from the airport. *The hotel room was WONDERFUL!! Clean, remodeled, had a great view of the city, and very worth the price. No COMPLAINTS about the rooms!! *The RTC (public bus system) has a stop right in front of the hotel. We bought the $7 passes to use for 24 hours while there and it was a life-saver. Consider doing this if you want to explore the area. It even goes to old Las Vegas (the Fremont Experience) and that alone is worth the cost of the ticket. *The pool area is nice...and it will be nicer when the renovations are over. Currently they are working on expanding it, so it will probably be spectacular when done. *There were parts of the hotel that were still original to the building and it was kind of neat to see. They may not be there after renovations are done, but we enjoyed the old and new atmosphere. *The location. Some may not like the location of this hotel, but we found it was exactly right for us. Our hotel was one of the very first stops on the bus going toward Fremont Street, so we found that being able to get on the bus and get a seat was a great advantage. It also has 4 overhead walking bridges to get to Excalibar/Luxor/Mandalay Bay, New York New York and MGM. No waiting for traffic lights to cross to these resorts, just take the pedestrian bridge. CONS: *The old rooms the (the pre-renovated ones) look really old and \"well-used\". I wouldn't want to stay in any of them and would have been upset if I got one of them. *There is construction going on with the renovations. Nothing to disturb you, but it does distract from everything. Outside, inside, the lobby, the casino...drywall and workers everywhere. *The casino wasn't as classy as most on the strip, but after renovations are done this may no longer be the case. We did play some slots in our casino, but found it to be lacking compared to the rest on the strip. It also wasn't very busy. This could be a PRO or a CON, depending on how you look at it.

My room was right next to the elevators and I had no problems with noise. This was only my second time in Vegas, my first hotel was TI. I'd say this hotel was on even playing ground for me, minus any shows like the Sirens of TI. For the price, you couldn't beat the location. The sports bar was pretty nice also.

I have never stayed anywhere that had over 100 T.V. stations in H.D. Now, that's service and on a 42\" T.V.! The casino and other areas are still very much under construction with stark white panels in place. When it's completed later this year it should be very nice. One big turn off in the table area was that it has very bright lighting - the brighest I have ever seen in a casino. It made it very unpleasant. They need to cut down the lights. I heard others complaining about it too. For that reason alone we did not play any table games there. We went to the MGM across the street to play table games. We would had preferred staying at the Trop to play but could not stand the bright overbaring lights. The pool area is great and I would rank it up there with some of the best in Las Vegas. I have been to just about every pool in town. The major complaint is that they seem to let in anyone and not just hotel guests. I saw people changing clothes in the bathrooms just inside the doors leading to the casino. They obviously were not hotel guests. Someone, I later found out it was an adult, made the pool their own bathroom so the pool had to be closed for awhile. I am sure it was not a hotel guest that did it. I think other L.V. hotels are allowing non guests to use the pool but that really is a policy that needs changing. One day it seemed that about 40% of the people there were not guests of the hotel.

We were shocked at how much it has improved since the last time we looked at it -- last time it was dirty & smelly! The renovations are still in progress, but are making the place beautiful! Our tower room was beautiful -- Fully renovated with white shutters on the windows... and the most comfortable bedding I have had at a hotel in a long time! Really beautiful & so comfortable! We took breakfast in room, and loved it! Fast room service, and the food was great! (The omelets are gigantic!) We had a blast at the table games, playing a lot of blackjack, and roulette. (Last time I was there, they had the stain glass overhead, and the rest of it was sort of dirty & old. Now, it is beautiful, redone in white. Really sharp & inviting!) We didn't do great, but we had a great time. The table games staff that we had contact with was so much fun -- and they were funny! Also love the music playing throughout the casino.. Felt like a party! You have to check out the pool area... BEAUTIFUL... and the food & drink service was great! Had dinner in the Legends Steakhouse... The steaks were great, as was the Sushi App. Special... Really good coffee & key lime pie too! (We didn't get to try the italian restaurant, but heard good things about that too... they were closed the night we were there.) Also convenient for food was the Deli... Good food, big portions (almost too big) We were most impressed with the service. Anyone we stopped to ask for directions or help were really helpful & friendly. One person just cleaning in the casino stopped what she was doing, and walked us part way to our destination. You don't get that kind of friendly attention at the bigger casinos. We had a great one night staycation, and would highly recommend the Tropicana. It is so much different than it used to be! Check it out!

We plan our trip around lounging and relaxing by the pool. We have stayed at different resorts over the years, but have found that the pool at the Tropicana is our favorite. This year as we were planning our trip we learned that the pool at the Tropicana was under major construction and we could not be guaranteed that it would be open at the time of our vacation, so sadly we booked at another resort. We chose a resort close to the Tropicana so we could easily visit the casino and other attractions the Tropicana has to offer. We love everything about the Tropicana, but a huge thing we love is the people who work there. We remember from year to year the same employees, coctail waitresses, dealers, pit bosses, among many others. We know they all see thousand upon thousand of guests every year and couldn't possible remember us, but they always great us warmly and sincerely. It is because of the atmosphere, the employees, the pool, and everything else the Tropicana has to offer that make it such a great place for us. When we arrived for our vacation we found out that the pool at the Tropicana had opened earlier than the expected. We were so disappointed not to be staying on this resort, and now to find that the pool was actually open was an even bigger disappointment. Each night as we made our way back to the Tropicana for our usual evening of fun at the BlackJack table we would find ourselves in convesations with the dealers, the cocktail waitresses, the pit bosses about how we loved their resort. One night as we were about to head out for some much needed rest we were presented with the most beautiful and delicious cocktail. We were being told of the amazing rennovations that were occuring not only at the pool, but with the entire resort from the fabulous resturants, the gorgeous rooms....everything. At this point we were surprised with the most amazing gesture. We were graciously given a beautiful room for us to spend our last night in Las Vegas. Along with that wonderful gift, they allowed us an early check in so we could spend the entire day lounging at the pool. We could not have been more surprised or blown away by their gererousity. It truly made our entire trip, and we can't wait to come visit again. Each and every person at the Tropicana from check in- to check out is truly excited about everything new at the Tropicana and are excited to share with each and every guest. The proof of that is how the went above and beyond sharing everything new with us in such a special way. We tell anyone and everyone who is planning a trip to Vegas about our experience. We can't wait for our trip next year to see everything complete, everything changing!! One thing we know that will not change is the people of the Tropicana....they are the absolute best.

Wanted to see how the renovations are coming along. There aren\u2019t a lot of places on the strip where you can stay on a Friday night for under $100. My three nights, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday went for $238.50 resort fees and taxes included, not a bad deal at all. The standard room in the Paradise tower seems to be larger than the other standard rooms I have stayed in on the strip. I really loved the daybed/couch or whatever you call it. The shutters are a great idea and add a lot to the \u201cambiance\u201d, and the fact that you can open the windows, priceless. My room had no noticeable noise from the strip. The orange color accent was a refreshing change from the rest of the strip. I really liked it because it was not overdone. The furniture was not cheap, but rather solidly built. The wooden ice bucket was a nice touch. The noise from the room next door was noticeable. A group of women checked in the next night and they all congregated in the room next to mine with lots of laughter and screaming as girls on vacation will do. Guys do the same, only differently, so no offense intended. This went on for a half hour at about 11:30PM. On the brighter side, I did not hear anything from the hallway. The television worked, but the remote did not. I know I could have gone and had it fixed (or perhaps the batteries replaced), but I don\u2019t like to do things like that, so I just went and used the buttons on the TV. The selection of channels on the TV was very limited. I do watch TV when I go to Vegas and I like to purchase a movie or two as well. The remodeled bathroom was nice, but basic. However, there is a fan over the toilet that is connected to the light. It is a very loud fan and not something I expect to find in the better hotels. Subtract for the noise. I absolutely loved the Kohler sink. I do not remember turning on a water faucet so easily. I don\u2019t know why I was so fascinated. Guess it doesn\u2019t take much to amuse me. The hotel has a beautiful garden area that provides an escape from the outside world. I happen to think this area rivals the Flamingo\u2019s garden area for it\u2019s beauty, but it doesn\u2019t have the size or animals. I know next year they are planning to rev up the place and make it exciting, but for now, it seemed to be rather quiet and stress-free. After they redo the Garden Rooms in the fall, I think it will be really nice with your own balcony overlooking the Garden and pool. The pool looks great. I would imagine when the hotel is at capacity, the pool will be really busy. I did not see the swim-up blackjack they promote, but I was only there on Thursday at 6:30 AM and 2 PM. They still have work to do, but what is open does look great and there will be more. The casino is pretty small and I don\u2019t think you can get lost in it like some others. The one pit they have looks nice, but there\u2019s still more to do in that casino. The Sports Book is a tiny room stuck in the back of everything. Very sad. But, it is scheduled to be moved to new digs in the front in about 6 months, at least that\u2019s what the guy working there said. He was very much looking forward to the move. Drink service was very good. I know that not many use the hotel laundry, but I always do since I only bring carry-on and bypass all the lines at the airport. Here\u2019s an example of the attention to detail I think they are trying to achieve; I had written a note on the laundry ticket that a shirt put in the bag was missing a button for the collar. The Tropicana\u2019s service actually found a button similar to the one that was missing and sewed it onto my shirt. Give \u2018em extra points for that. That shirt still has one more season left in it. I did get my haircut here. Barber was nice and small talk was enjoyable. Good job with all the usual amenities. Cut was $40, no shampoo. I only ate at the Tropicana once, for breakfast. Had three eggs over easy. It was quick. Nothing special, nothing bad. Pretty underwhelming. Very pleased with the improvements. Glad I stayed and will definitely stay here in the future. Really looking forward to the Island Tower Spa rooms and Garden rooms being completed in the fall.

Since I've seen the ads for the remodel decided I'd like to stay there again since the price is still the best for a true Strip Hotel. Wow... The pictures don't show the depth of change the place is going through. They aren't just throwing a new coat of paint on the walls and calling it a remodel like a few other hotels have done. The Paradise tower room we stayed in was clean, roomy and had a very nice view up the strip. However what set the place apart was the staff. Everyone was genuinely concerned about our experience and what we thought of the renovations so far. We had stayed in one of the newer hotels on the strip that runs 4 x the price and we couldn't even get an ashtray sent to our smoking room in a timely manner (after 3 requests over an 8 hour period finally gave up). At the Trop we had a problem with the AC and within 30 min of contacting the front desk someone was there to work on it. Additionally, my mother went on the trip with us. She had a problem getting around as Vegas has changed considerably from when she traveled there in the 70s. Kimberlee, the front desk clerk who had checked her in, was leaving for the day when she saw my mother having difficulty, instead of doing like most people who are no longer on the clock and ignoring the situation, she stopped, discovered the problem and offered solutions. There are currently some inconveniences caused by the remodel but overall you won't find a better value near the strip much less in such a nice location as the Trop. My only recommendation is that if you plan on sleeping in after a long night and light bothers you bring an eye mask. The windows are shuttered but a lot of early morning light still comes through.

I stayed in the newly renovated Paradise Tower(room 1225) and it was very well done and smelled new also. Initially I wasn't too happy with the layout of the bathroom but I got used to it. The rest of the room was very nice, shutters on the windows instead of drapes was a nice and unique touch and I had a nice strip view looking toward the MGM. About the only fault I could find and it was hard to find one, was that there may not have been too much soundproofing around the room as I could hear the couple in the next room(they were loud, though) and I could also hear music playing from some outdoor party going on nearby on my first night there. The 24 hour South Beach Deli had a good selection on the menu and seemed reasonably priced. It came in handy after some very late night poker sessions across the street at the MGM Poker room. Very friendly staff right from the front desk to the housekeeping crew. I didn't spend time in the somewhat small casino because I'm not a regular blackjack or craps player anymore. In the Las Vegas magazine for May 2010 that was in the room, a daily poker tourney was advertised. After a few trips around the casino I couldn't find the poker room. I finally asked the front desk about it and was informed that the poker room was closed due to layoffs but that they hoped it would open again soon. I had dinner at both the italion restaurant and the steakhouse and both were excellent and well priced. Just watch which days you go because there's 2 nights where the steakhouse is closed and then there are 2 nights where the itallion restaurant is closed. The itallion restaurant did offer a steak dinner special on the 2 nights where the steakhouse was closed. They are still doing further reno's to the Tropicana although I'm not quite sure when they will be completed. Tropicana is very well located and near the MGM(across the street) and it's across the street the other way from Excalibur and kitty corner to New York New York. Walgreens and CVS pharmacy are not too far away either for any personal needs. Overall I had most pleasant experience staying at the Tropicana and I would definantly stay there again on my next trip to Vegas.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Noida", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT LOCATION GOOD VIEW\u201d", "Author": "noidakaran", "ReviewID": "UR67157749", "Content": "I stayed in hotel alongwith my colleagues and friend during Visit To Bauma trade fair,hotel is centrally located and all around good view .

Because our friends were getting married of course! :D we needed to do the trip on a budget and so when looking online at the various hotels along the strip, the Tropicana seemed like the best option in terms of price, location and quality of rooms. I emailed Nicole directly and she was very very helpful. Got a great rate on one of the newly rennovated Paradise Tower rooms....Thanks Nicole! :) Got to the hotel and checked in nice and quick....no queues! awesome! the casino and bar areas were busy and everyone was having a good time and there was a great buzzing vibe! got up to the room and my girlfriend was very impressed.....and so was i! for the money, it definitely is best-in-class without a doubt. friends of ours who stayed in the MGM Grand said our room was bigger and nicer than theirs and they paid a lot more!! On the second night, we went out with all our friends around the various hotels along the strip. The Bellagio, Vencian, Ceasers Palace etc were all fantastic and very grand......but after a while, all our friends wanted to go back with us to the Tropicana even though some were staying right at the other end of the strip!! So we all went back, had a gamble, had some drinks and generally had a good time. All the staff we dealt with were very helpful and friendly (bar staff, casino dealers etc). In terms of location, you can't get better for the money. Only a short 5min walk over a bridge and you're in the MGM Grand. A further 15min walk through the hotel's maze of a casino and you're at the monorail which for $12 get's you an all-day ticket and you can go up and down the strip as many times as you like. Perfect! Our hotel room was cleaned thoroughly everyday....my compliments to the maids! we ordered room service one morning which took a little while to arrive (45mins) but was lovely food. the expedia local travel experts in the main lobby area were very helpful with helping us book tickets for various things. they gave us lots of info and helped us book tickets for cirque du soleil at the whynn hotel (which was amazing!) and also managed to get us on a helicopter tour of the grand canyon at very short notice. we rang them at 8am and they got us picked up in a limo at 1pm. very efficient!! gambling at the trop was brilliant.....all the dealers at the tables were very professional and friendly and the waitresses were always on hand to bring complimentary drinks. on the first night, 3 of my friends won over $200 each and i even i managed to win $100 and I don't gamble! if you're a non-smoker and new to vegas, then be warned.....smoking is allowed in ALL casinos in vegas. dont be put off at the tropicana if it smells smokey as you walk through the casino....it's like that in every hotel! me and my girlfriend hit the pool a few times during our stay and found it to be very nice indeed. not too big, not too small. cocktail bar with waitress service which was great. there were some private cabannas which could be hired at a cost. my only recommendation would be that the jacuzzi/spa be made to look a little nicer and maybe be upgraded. it was warm and relaxing, but their wasn't much in the surrounding area around the jacuzzi. a few palm trees, plants etc would make it feel a bit more luxurious. so to conclude....our stay at the tropicana was excellent. staff were great, gambling was good, the room was spacious and tastefully decorated with all new modern fittings, the location of the hotel is great. what more can I say? If you're looking for an intimate feel hotel, on a budget...but getting a lot of bang for your buck, then stay at the tropicana and you won't be dissapointed.

I found a very good rate online, and a 3 night stay at the newly upgraded Paradise Tower came out to the same price at a \u201cstandard\u201d room at other casinos, so I figured the decision was a no-brainer. Arrival: We took a cab in from the airport. Since this is a southern strip hotel, you should ask the cabbie not to take \u201cthe tunnel\u201d to the hotel, since this way is longer and more expensive. We checked in with no problem; no major lines. The lobby was somewhat small but the process went by pretty quickly. Rooms: We stayed in the recently renovated Paradise Tower on the 18th floor; the room had great views of the Strip (Mandalay Bay, Luxor, NY NY, Excalibur). Bathroom was large w/ a tub; ample closet space; flat screen LG television. No fridge though, which was only a minor drawback. Overall the room was great, although not as luxurious as some of the Harrahs property rooms I\u2019ve stayed at in Atlantic City (Caesars and Harrahs). Still, for the price paid, this was a great value. Casino: The casino was definitely a lot smaller than some of the other casinos I visited in Las Vegas. I\u2019m not a big slot player so I don\u2019t know how loose or tight they are. I found the casino to be adequate, with mostly $5 and up tables. Food: I only ate at the casino once, very late at night. There is a deli that\u2019s open 24 hours which had $7 sandwiches; pretty filling and convenient. I believe this was the only late night option inside the casino. Pool: The pool appears to have been renovated recently. The outdoor area is very nice, and is filled with flowers and trees that provide a nice atmosphere. The pool itself is fairly large, and there were definitely plenty of seats available by the pool (contrasted with some other pools I visited in LV, which had almost no seats available). Water was kind of cold, though. Also the hot tub was separated from the main area, so it wasn\u2019t as appealing to jump in. There was music blasting from the speakers, so if you\u2019re expecting a nice dip or lounge by the pool, this wouldn\u2019t be a good fit. Servers walked by regularly so you could order drinks without having to get up. There was an entire section walled off where more renovations were (I think) taking place. They didn\u2019t affect the quality of our stay, however. Final thoughts: I\u2019m not sure what the Trop was like before, although from some of the older reviews, it appears it was a pretty beaten up place. The Paradise Tower rooms are a huge step up, then, but no one will confuse these rooms with high end rooms at other locations. Similarly, the Trop itself pales in comparison to other LV casinos. However, at the right price, the Trop has a good option for large, clean and recently remodeled rooms. The remaining will be renovated by the end of the summer, giving you more options to stay at the Trop.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, MD", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great time!\u201d", "Author": "saintWoodstock_MD", "ReviewID": "UR65948843", "Content": "The Tropicana has gone through a great many renovations in the past year.

That could only benefit this property. We were issued a suite in the Garden Tower. Evidently no work has been done there. The room was dingy, and had a smell of mold or mildew. All furnishings were worn. The second bathroom was not clean and had a handprint stain (of some variety of DNA) on the rear of the door. The patio had pigeon droppings on it, and the cobwebs abound. We went off to the concert. On our return I walked past my vehicle in the lot. I didn't feel good after seeing the kooky teeners doing drugs parked next to me. Forget security, we were able to let ourselves in through the pool area with impedence. The elevator now sported two broken coctail glasses.

Pulling into the construction zone, the bell staff waived us through and \"around the corner\" to park.

While the suite was very large, clean, and new - it lacked the amenites the reservationist spoke of. The minibar was an empty refrigerator, and there was no local information of any kind in the room including a map or phonebook. Other unpleasant surprises: The construction trucks backing up each morning at 6am-we could only laugh because they managed to quit at 8am...doesn't anyone manage these sites? The swimming pool was pretty bad-filled with sand from their construction site just adjacent. No one mentioned this when we asked about their pool facilities. When we called down to the Front Desk and Concierege staff for general information how to gain internet access, and basic directions, both departments were rude and obnoxious. One male concierge actually hung up on us in the middle of a question. (Guess they were tired of being asked similar questions as the information wasn't available in the guestrooms.) The room service menu was extremely limited-folded in half piece of paper, and honestly, the living room furniture appeared to be missing cushions-no back on the sofa.

I tried ordering room service and it took probably close to 20-25 minutes just for someone to pick up the phone and when someone FINALLY answered...was hung up on! I tried calling back a few more times but to no avail and gave up. I tried calling the front desk to make a complaint and that in itself took another 20-25 minutes before a manager answered. At that point, I told the manager to check me out of the hotel. I had two night complimentary there for the nights of 5/8 and 5/9. I've stayed at many of the hotels along the Strip and am tolerant to simple mistakes and/or misunderstandings, but my experience with them was completely unacceptable! Even though my room in their new tower was \"free\" I checked out after the first night because of this experience and ended up staying at the Palazzo hotel for the duration of my trip. I have standards and expectations in how I expect to be treated and their level of customer service was so far below standards.

Sports book has no racing options but a new SB will start construction very soon.

I went crazy looking at reviews for where would be a cheap but clean and safe place to stay. Well I was very pleased that on arriving at the Tropicana I was not dissapointed. When we arrived we were given a room that wasnt really what we had in mind (they are in the process of fixing up some of the rooms etc) so we called the front desk and with no problem at all they were understanding and upgraded us to a jacuzzi suite. They could have just turned around and said thats the room you paid for - but they didnt! The service they provided was really amazing, everyone who worked there is very polite and helpful. We did not encounter 1 person who was rude or unhelpful. I would like to point out we didnt pay much at all for the 3 nights we were in Vegas - so really we were not expecting much - but the Tropicana really did more than I ever expected, their hotel is clean (apart from what I assume is the old building which does smell of smoke - but like I said it is all being re-done - so next time I go it will look even better). When we booked it did say that they were doing works on the hotel and that the swimming pool would not be in use. But I believe it will be or probably is already because when we left the pool area looked amazing. And apart from this it just has a nice atmosphere - from the front desk to the ladies who clean the rooms are so helpful, polite and just really friendly - what more could you want from a hotel? This hotel is very close to the aiport - we paid about $10 for the cab. And it is right next to the MGM Grand, a few mins walk away from Luxor etc where you could go and have buffets. My advice is if you are on a budget you will need to bring some good walking shoes because the strip is really long, and theres so much to see and do. Catch a bus to Fremont if you want to see the light show- definetly worth it!

The only kicker was that on our last night there, we really wanted to play blackjack but all 3 $5 blackjack tables were all full. We were busy doing so many other things throughout the week that we didn't really have time to play on any other night. There was another couple also looking to play $5 blackjack that night, and a man from the pit declined their request to open another table for all of us to play. There were a few stragglers wandering around asking if anybody knew where there were more tables to play at. Maybe the dealers were short-staffed, who knows? We all thought that the hotel would want to open another table and let us all play, but oh well. My wife and I stood and waited at one table for more than an hour (it was fun to watch the particular table we were watching win as much as they were) but we finally had to call it a night. We were tempted to go next door to Hooter's for $3 blackjack, but were just too exhausted! Overall, this hotel is well-worth the trip! They have some of the closest rooms to the strip in the Paradise Tower. The day we left is when they were just putting the Tropicana sign up strip-side, as well as remodeling where the valet parking check-in area is. It looks like some of the glass and artwork (outdated) is being pulled from the ceiling. We can't express enough how much we love and always will enjoy the Tropicana hotel.

We arrived and found a nice lobby, still under renovations and were told that the room would be $70. I had just hung up w/them not 10 minutes before so they honored the quote of $50 which was nice. We drove around trying to find our entrance for a good 15 mins. The signs were not posted, possibly because of the renovations? Finally found our room located on the ground floor. It smelled musty & it looked like it had not been redecorated since 1950. It certainly was not the room the advertised in the picture on-line, not even close! But we figured for $50 we couldn't complain. So we changed clothes & headed out for dinner. When arriving back in our room we found a cockroach on the wall. I called the front desk & was told they would send someone over to kill the bug! NO thanks - if there is one there are probably many more so they offered to upgrade our room to a \"suite\" in the new building at no charge. So we packed up & headed to the newer building. This was not a suite however, just a typical hotel room. It still smelled like paint so we were hoping that the cockroaches had not found this building yet. This room was definitely much nicer but still not nearly as nice as other places in Vegas. Their was hair in the bathroom, both on the floor and in the shower when we first arrived. The decor was a step up from our basement room but still not very modernized. The bed was comfortable however and that was all we really needed. Just a decent place to rest for the night & then head over to the Signature MGM which was exactly what we were looking for. I would not recommend the Tropicana with all the other choices you have in Vegas. It does have a good location for walking around to see all the sights.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDishonest Policy\u201d", "Author": "redhand", "ReviewID": "UR62138623", "Content": "We booked here through Travelzoo which promised a room in the remodeled Paradise Tower, \"subject to availability\".

We told her it was my father in law's 50th birthday and she gave us a few free drink tickets which was a nice touch. All of the staff I came into contact with was by far some of the friendliest most helpful people I have ever met. Now the bad. The room was exactly how most descrive on here, on it's last leg. The air didn't work, the tub did not drain, the tile was pretty gross with mold. The room smelled and just was over all unpleasant. With that said, with the price I got what do you expect. The casino only had maybe seven or so table games open at a time, so finding a seat was tough. We ended up gambling elsewhere for this reason so the Trop definitely lost out on some easy cash. So to summarize, if you are not going to be in your room for long (only to sleep and shower) and want to be on the strip I would say go for it. However, I will never stay again because I feel the extra money would be worth it to have a room that functions better.

It's been three weeks and still haven't recieved anything. I was travelling with my family (mum, dad, teenage brother, and older brother) and booked two rooms for three nights. We chose the Tropicana for the location and the price. We were checked in my Gerard and advised that there were no adjoining rooms; but were given room next door to each other. Made our way to our rooms and found them to be outdated and tired. The bathroom looked very old and had mould around the tub/shower. However, the linen and towels were clean. We decided to have lunch at the buffet (which for the price was very disappointing and had very little selection). On the way through, we realised that the place was being renovated which meant that the pool; business centre; and outdoor courtyard area was not available (so why am I paying the \"resort fee?\", I thought). We were later to find out that there WiFi was only available from the courtyard (which was closed for renovations) and the tower rooms; that the poker room was closed; that I had to pay to use the computer and for printing at the \"business centre\" (which was a computer in the VIP room as the original business centre was closed); and that the concierge is outsourced and knows not much about Las Vegas. We were also sent on a wild goose chase for a Bank of America. Gerard at the reception desk informed us that it was one mile away, by the time we had walked to the airport we realised that he might be wrong...in fact the bank was about four miles away. All this on the first day. To add to our woes, we were unable to make local or long-distance phone calls without going through the front desk because Gerard had not entered my credit card details into the computer despite the card being swiped twice when we checked in, and it being already charged the \"resort fee\". I found out late on the second day that three x 3-minute phone calls that we had made to LA, had cost us more than USD$30. By this stage, my patience had worn thin and I approached the front desk and spoke with the supervisor, Richard. I explained all the problems to Richard and the \"best he could do\" was to refund the \"resort fee\" on both rooms; he also used his computer to print out our boarding passes for our flights. With regards to the phone calls; not being made aware of renovations; and not being able to use the business centre he could only apologise. Furthermore, he suggested that I go and buy a phone card from the casino gift store if I \"didn't want to incur excessive phone charges\". Not suprisingly, the gift store hadn't sold phone cards for the past year. On our departure, we had to use the elevator to get all our bags to the car, and as luck would have it, the elevator was not working. We had to haul our bags down two flights of stairs at 5:30am. I was going to opt for an express check out but instead I went to the front desk to once again speak with a manager about her unsatisfactory stay at the Tropicana. I was told that a manager was unavailable until 7am, however Rose at the front desk was very understanding; wrote down all my complaints and assured me that a manager would contact me; or a letter would be sent to me with a response regarding my complaints. I'm still waiting. We were on a six week holiday through Canada and the USA; and I had been to Las Vegas and visited about 35 states in the USA and I can say without hesitation, that this is the WORST hotel experience I've ever had. I will never stay at the Tropicana again and I will never recommend the Tropicana to friends, families, colleagues or aquaintences. In fact, when I hear that someone is going to Las Vegas, I always warn them to stay away from the Tropicana.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "linton, indiana", "Title": "\u201cLove-Hate relationship\u201d", "Author": "recondo1019", "ReviewID": "UR55212103", "Content": "To the new owners, When we stay at the Tropicana it's like coming home.

The bed was comfortable, but who knows when the bedspread was cleaned last! It was cold and rainy while we were there, but the heat worked very well. Maybe all the casino motels are the same in Vegas, but there was no coffee pot, fridge or microwave in the room. At least put a coffee maker in the room! To buy a cup of coffee is very expensive!

It would of been nice if Pool area would have been open, but it was flagged off as a construction area. They have one of the top 5 pools in Las Vegas. Go in the summer, what a place.

All rooms are being remodeled now.Their location on the strip can't be beat, The staff is super friendly and helpful. Nicole was a real gem and treated us really special. The Magic show was Great since it came free with the room. We are looking forward to our next trip to Las Vegas to stay at the Tropicana. If they don't raise the room rates much, It is going to be the best deal on the strip for the dollar. P.S. For what it is worth, I like the Miami theme that they are remodeling to.

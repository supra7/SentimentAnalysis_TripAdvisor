This hotel couldn't be more beautifully situated. We had an oceanfront room that overlooked the walking trails and surf. If I had a concern it is the size of this resort. We were in building 7 and from the lobby, it was probably a quarter mile to our room. Would suggest trying to get as close to the main pool as possible to try and avoid this unless you don't mind walking. The rooms were nice but not overly large/bath products were nice. There is a grille and bar open pool side during the day and for breakfast and dinner, Ma'la is open (same as the one in Lahaina). In summary, this is a lovely hotel and is right next to a shopping center with restaurants and shops and has great walking trails along the beach.

We were not that impressed with this property. It does have a great location but that's about it. When we checked in our room was not ready so we had to store our bags and wait hours until the room was ready. The lady at checkin was quite rude, we are Elitd Marriott members and we felt like she belittled us. The room was ok, all tile floors, low uncomfortable bed, no plugs anywhere, weird places for light switches, only good thing was great view from our balcony. Pools were small and very cold. One day I was at the pool and waited 45 minutes for a 15 dollar pi\u00c3\u00b1a coloda!!! I went up to bar twice to ask for a waitress so I could order a drink. Finally they took my order then told me to come back in ten minutes to get the drinks and food! What horrible customer service, it cost 68 dollars for two pi\u00c3\u00b1a colodas, fish sandwich and a greasy quesadilla. My recommendation is to get sandwiches at the General Store right next to the hotel at Wailea Shops. The food was good and a lot cheaper. You can also get snacks, alchohol, and just about anything you need at thd ABC store which is a less than 5 minute walk from the resort. From the Marriott you can walk to the Grand Wailea which is where we spent most of our time and had a great time at the luau. For a little more money stay at thd Grand Wailea, the property is absolutely gorgeous and stunning pools and outdoor area. By far one of our favorite hotels, with a gorgeous beach! Marriott had a small beach to the side of the hotel. Overall we were really disappointed with the horrible customer service at Marriott.

We were upgraded to a partial ocean-view room, which was nice for free but probably not worth paying extra for as it also overlooked the service entrance. The bed was soft, but not uncomfortable. Tile floors were nice. There was a large seating area in the room as well as a mini-fridge, which was a nice touch. The bathroom had a large counter around the sink, and the toilet and shower were separated from the sink area by a door, so more than one person could use the bathroom at a time. We didn't hear any noise from other guest rooms. The property has three separate pool areas, including an adults-only infinity pool facing the ocean which was amazing; I would stay here again just for this pool. There were always chairs available, and the staff do ensure that children are politely directed to one of the two other more appropriate pool areas. There is a full Starbucks on site, and a well-equipped fitness centre; I never had to wait for a machine. The Ma La Restaurant is expensive, but worth it - we had great meals there. There is also a poolside grill that serves more casual food during the day, and which was also very good. Location is excellent, less than a 5 minute walk to the Shops at Wailea, and a short drive to Kihei restaurants and shops.

The mattress was so soft that we did not sleep well and woke with achy hips and shoulders. After days full with swimming and hiking, it was extremely disappointing to not get a good night's sleep. We stayed on the fifth floor of Haleakala Hale with a distant view of the ocean. The hotel's open lobby/registration area was right below us, so it helped to keep the fan on to keep annoying sounds at bay. Preferring an ocean swim, I only spent one afternoon at the serenity pool. It lived up to its name and has a gorgeous view to the ocean. The other pools were busier with families. It was convenient to hit up the on-site Starbucks each morning and then take a walk on the Wailea Beach beachwalk - a bit of a 'super-highway' of early morning walkers and joggers. We were surprised to find you had to rent ($10 each) a chaise lounge and umbrella on the Wailea Beach. We loved the gentle waves on the beach and the temperature was perfect and the water clear. Whales were visible each day from the shore, as were a number of sea turtles. You need to get to the shore early (about 5:30 pm) in order to get a chaise to view the sunset (about 6:30 pm) which is spectacular - nice to see that so many people share the same delight in watching the sunset over the ocean. We rented a car at the airport and that came in handy for trips on the island (including the ride up Haleakala National Park). We used the car to visit a small, but very nice, famer's market where we picked up some fantastic native fruit. Parking was $25.00 per night. The $18.00 per person buffet was probably the best meal we had at the resort. The Shops at Wailea (3 minute walk) had a nice convenience store (liquor available) where you could purchase supplies for the in-room refrigerator.

They also had \"specials\" for each night of room service, which was also appreciated. The food was good, the portions were excellent. The pools at this resort are salt water type, not chlorine, which I also enjoyed. We reserved two casabellas at the pool ahead of time for only $25 each, which is a steal. The resort was not over crowded while we were there, but I could see the weekend quickly filling seats at the pool. For beach access, you'll need to travel a short walk down the path (5 minutes) toward the Grand Wailea resort. The beach was nice, clean, and had ample chairs. There are also chairs located near the grass overlooking the ocean if you prefer to soak in the sun and views. Just a short walk away is a mall with several eating options, in case you crave something other than the hotel dining. There is also a paved path near the ocean that runs next to three of the hotels for all the runners out there. Our family stayed 2 nights at this resort, and 4 nights at the Grand Wailea next door.

I was a little iffy about this Marriott hotel because of the reviews I read before, but I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, it's Maui and it's paradise. The check-in was quick and efficient (they had a special line for Marriott Elite members. The room: We got a room with an ocean view and it was absolutely amazing. I read some reviews with complaints about the tile floors -- it's off a beach and there we certainly brought in our share of sand--the only way to get the floors clean is to have the tile! The room has a little refrigerator and we used it to store water, soda and snacks we bought from Wal-mart. There is internet, but only available via a cable and for a $ (If I recall correctly) and there is no wi-fi. The resort: The resort is beautiful--there are hammocks in random places where you can settle and watch the sunset or close your eyes and listen to the water. The resort provides you with beach towels you can use and trade at your leisure. We actually went to two of the pools (1 was the adult-only, salt water endless view pool) and they were both nice. Also if you go on the path to the right there is a public beach that is wonderful for snorkeling. We saw many fish, octupus, turtles and more! There is a restaurant on the grounds which is excellent--get the kobe beef burger--absolutely the best burger we have ever had!! The resort is within walking distance to the shops of wailea where you can do some shopping eat at other restaurants or grab some ice creams or even food.

It's worth going to, it tells the story of the Hawaiian people through dance and song, the food is good and the fire guy is crazy :) Its good fun, especially for a group. The hotel is easy to find and not a long drive from the airport. It is a great location for exploring Maui, nothing felt like too far of a drive. Since the little, charming mall is next door, you can walk over for some fun shopping, or for Breakfast, lunch or dinner. Longhi's has the BEST breakfast, once we found it we didn't go anywhere else. The Tommy Bahama Cafe is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at, it's a must go, especially for the loki loki tuna poki. mhhhhh still dreaming about it. Best part you can enjoy drinks and stroll back over to your room afterwards, no driving ;) The 'scheduling staff' can help you book great activities. The \"ultra lite\" experience from the Hana airport was one of our favorite things. Also the HANG GLIDING off of Volcano Haleakala was so cool. Heads upp: you have to get up early to make it to the \"flight destination\" as they do their flight eary morning before the weather rolls in. I think we got up at 5 am to make the drive up the volcano. But soooo worth it :) The hands down BEST ACTIVITY that we did in Maui was the stargazing from Haleakala. I did this with my husband and my sister. You drive up Haleakala about 2 hours to the top from hotel. Schedule to be there just before sunset, BRING YOUR CAMERA AND DRESS WARM. You will not believe the colors you will see in that sunset, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the altitude that makes the colors so intense but it was breathtaking. The guy who you book with Tom (I think was his name) he brings big comfy jackets and he brings dinner, pasta salad and sandwiches, they were really delicious. We ate our dinner sitting on our car watching the sunset. Then when the night fell the stargazing began, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even explain all of the awesome things we saw, we saw 2 planets, star clusters, supernovas etc. Tom explains everything to you, he gave us so much information and he is very nice. There are restrooms up there and they are open that late. The drive back down is interesting it is pitch black up there and obviously it was very late, but it was worth it. Lahaina is a cute fishing village which is fun to visit and grab some lunch out there. We did the submarine tour from there which I don't think is worth it at all. You take a boat out to a submarine board the sub and go down for maybe 1 hour. Maybe I am spoiled from living in the Bahama waters but the sealife and corals that we saw were not worth the money or time spend for this activity. A fun water activity is to go on a snorkel tour of molokini (a small crescent shaped island which is a partially submerged volcanic crater) there was more to see there than on the submarine, be sure to book the tour that also stops at turtle town. Turtle Town is where sea turtles tend to gather, when we went there must have been about 12-15 in the water and they were huge. We swam with them although you are not allowed to touch them. The water wasn't to deep so this is a good activity for everyone. Road to Hana is a must do, leave a lot of time for the stops along the way because they are amazing, and don't stop at Hana keep driving until you get to the Seven Sacred Pools. It's quite a sight. Pack a lunch unless you're adventurous and feel like trying some of the roadside food out there, its not bad but its also not great ;) We also did an ATV tour on Haleakala which was just okay.

They have a nice (basic) fitness center as well. The staff was fantastic and very friendly. Our room was cleaned well every day and very comfortable. We had a mini fridge in the room for cold drinks and snacks during the day which was nice. Our eleven year old daughter loved the hotel as well. They have a great childrens pool with something fun for all kids. They have water slides and a tube slide and a great snack bar for kids. You can rent snorkel gear and boogie boards...whatever you need. The Location in Wailea is great. So beautiful and also close to the \"Shops at Wailea\" mall, a 5 minute or less walk. There are restaurants and a ABC convenience store for all the little things. Wailea is a very quiet and upscale spot on south Maui away from the craziness so very relaxing. We rented a care so that we could see the Island and every afternoon we went to different places. We love Wailea and would definitely stay here again. Thank you to the lovely staff at the Wailea Beach Marriot!", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomfield, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAn Ideal Waterfront Resort in Maui\u201d", "Author": "ycart0616", "ReviewID": "UR123860009", "Content": "This Marriott Resort locates at waterfront in the quiet side of Maui.

Everything in Wailea is expensive and we were usually slightly disappointed with the quality of the food in relation to the prices.

She took the time to get to know a bit about each of her guests and made everyone feel welcome. The resort is oceanfront, but there is no beach directly in front of the resort. We fealt that was a plus as we still enjoyed the view and sounds of the ocean without the noise from the beach activies. The beach is within a close walk and we enjoyed snorkeling several times at the beach directly north of the resort.

The catalyst for the trip was an awesome TravelZoo (like groupon) promotion for the Mandara Spa. I was able to get a room here on 3-weeks notice using AAdvantage miles (53,800 miles for 2 nights off peak in the most budget room). That deal didn't require the resort fee ($30/day), but the rental car needed to be parked and they milked me for $25/day for self parking (add another $30/day for someone to park it for you). This kind of irked me since there is plenty of space and the parking lot has small spaces and was not the most pristine. The check-in was fast and we did get an early check in (at about 1:00pm vice the 4:00pm check in). Service from the bell and reception were great, no delays, and courteous. The property is pretty expansive though and there are a lot of small hills and stairs if your mobility is less than perfect... hence, bring your segway... Rooms were nice and clean, but the view and amenities are lacking for the cheaper rooms. Our room had a mini fridge that wasn't stocked (I prefer it unstocked so I can put stuff in there). There were no bathrobes which was a bummer, but the TV was nice and modern and the beds were clean and comfy. There are about 10 buildings on the property, most of them 2-3 stories, with one or two 8-story buildings. The property butts-up to the beach, and they've done a nice job of manicuring the walk ways and strewing some hammocks and beach chairs right by the water. The beach adjacent to the property is mostly rocky, so you'll need to stroll to the North or South about 300 meters to get to a sandy beach. You can rent kayaks, snorkel gear and such at one of the pool concierges and the rates are reasonable. If you have a car though, I'd recommend checking out the gear from one of the many aquatic shops out in Kihei and travel the island to some of the better snorkel/dive/kayak spots. If you want to keep it low-stress though, it's reasonable and you can bill it to your parents' room, haha. There are more pools than I could count (I think 5), one of which is an adults-only infinity pool that was just gorgeous. You can rent one of the \"islands\" or cabanas that they seem quite proud of and adorning most of the marketing materials... The dinner at the cabana looks awesome, but I heard it was like $400, so I will not be reviewing that.... The drink-girls at the pools are friendly and efficient. Stick with the beers though since they are $5.50 and the cocktails are north of $12. Besides a side of fries at the pool and a coffee cake at starbucks, I didn't eat much at the hotel since I didn't hear great things about MaLa. But the hotel is within walking distance of Shops at Wailea that has some familiar names (i.e. Ruth's and Tommy Bahama's). If you've got a ride, I would recommend heading into Kihei though for some more reasonable prices and local grinds. If you're into good sushi, check out Koiso by Chef Kudo in Kihei, that was easily the best meal on this trip. Even as a Marriott Rewards Member, all I got were some coupons and they wanted $15 for hard-line internet in the rooms... Since I think internet these days is no-more a luxury than tap water and extra towels, I can't give any $200+/night hotel 5 stars that doesn't have free internet. If you have status, I think it's free. Overall, if you like the resort feeling without splurging for some of the pricier neighbor hotels, I recommend this place. Without a rental car, it's got everything you need on site or within walking distance, if you've got a car, it's a good home base, but consider Lahaina as well.

As mentioned by others there is no beach in front of the resort but the walk to the beach on both sides is minimal. I never used the pools as the ocean water is of such high quality. My only observation from walking through the other resorts (especially the Grand Wailea) was that the pools are superior at the other resorts both in terms of size and quality. It really depends on how important pool facilities are in choosing a resort. The grounds of the resort are expansive and well looked after, and in that regard its a relaxing place to be and walk around. The Wailea shops are a 5 minute walk away which has an array of restaurants and shops to explore. Wailea is not a budget travellers destination and you have to accept that everything is expensive. If staying for more than a few days renting a car is essential to explore more of the area as public transport is minimal. Whilst I enjoyed my stay it doesn't appear to be of the same standard as the other resorts in Wailea which seemed more modern and appeared to offer more amenities. I concur with other comments that the breakfast at the restaurant is disappointing and not worth the price. You would expect a far higher quality buffet breakfast than what was offered. It does feel like everything has a fee attached at this resort, and whilst I understand the resort is a business, it still destracted slightly from the experience. I thought the room was very good.

As a Platinum Marriott member, I was not impressed. They finally found the reservation and could not explain why they could not find it earlier.

The Hotel is on a hill with lots of stairs and steep grades which can be a burden for mobility challenged individuals.

The Marriott itself is the oldest hotel in this stretch of beach and the rooms may not be as luxurious as some of the competition, but the grounds are great and the hotel has a Starbucks, poolside cafe and a very nice dining room. There is a very nice adult infinity pool, a couple of family pools and beach access to about 4 different beach spots. One highlight is the concrete path that goes beside the beach offering great views and it is also nice for evening strolls and light jogging. The path is a good 20-25 minute walk one way....it is nice. The Marriott has great views from the many outdoor sitting areas. The shops at Wailea is an open air mall with many nice stores. You can find snack and picnic items if needed. Clothing stores, art and several nice places to eat make it a daily destination and it is right next door to the Marriott. My wife and I love tennis and we walked each of the 5 days of our stay to the Wailea Tennis Club for our daily match. The pros there will try and set you up a match or you can rent court time on your own. The fees are around $16.00 per person, but we really enjoyed playing there. There is also a nice looking golf course meandering through the area. Since we were repeat visitors to Maui and had seen Hana, Haleakala and many other must see destinations, we chose not to rent a car and to enjoy all this location had to offer.

At check-in they told me that i received an upgrade and still ended up in the main building with crappy views of the sea. After some complaining i got a better room. The rooms are fine. Toilet not to big but its ok. We had issues with the cleaning of the tile floors. That was the only area the cleaning could have improved. The pools are fairly small for the amount of people the hotel can hold. One very important thing to note is that this hotel has NO BEACH!!!!! while all the others do. One other item that i found very concerning is that you will find nice cabanas and beach beds along side the pools, but those you are not allowed to use only if you dish out 50 or a 100 dollars a day just to use it. When somebody ends up paying 300 to 400 dollars a night for this Marriott....i think charging extra for the nicer beds is just plane wrong. We only had breakfast once in the Mala restaurant. All i can say that this breakfast is a DISGRACE to the Marriott chain (sadly i had the same experience on Waikiki) As a result we ended up taking an early morning walk along the coast (absolutely gorgeous) to the four seasons and had breakfast there. It was only 10 dollars more but a 100 times better. In the mentioned Mala restaurant they have a cocktail bar that served the most awful cocktails we ever tasted. Sad. Just a minute walk from the Marriott Wailea is a very elegant outdoor shopping mall. This complex has good options to dine. We ended up dining there every night. Not cheap but nothing is cheap in Maui. ......and good news is Starbucks has a big outlet next to the lobby. Since most people will rent a car the hotel sees a steady revenue stream coming from the parking business. The parking fee is 30USD per night. We parked our car in the shopping malls parking lot FOR FREE and as a result saved 150 dollars. At check-in they tried to pressure us into buying parking and they even told us that cars left overnight at the mall will be towed. Nobody towed us. My opinion is that this hotel even with its gorgeous landscape and nice serenity pool is a let down when you compare it to the other hotels located next door. On this trip i used my points but based on the prices i found on the web there was only around 130USD difference per night in comparison to the four seasons. Its a no brainer that i would choose the four seasons over the Wailea Marriott if the difference is not bigger. I could not tell if the problems with the hotel stems from financial issues or bad managment but clearly there is a lot to improve especially on the food and beverage side.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cCockroaches and Bad Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "LM2134", "ReviewID": "UR122603782", "Content": "Our first room had cockroaches.

The grounds are beautifully scaped with a lot of pools, spas, a large relaxation pool, beaches to either side and places to just sit and enjoy the wonderful views. I think I liked the grounds most of all. The hotel room was fine for us. It was spacious and quiet. We stayed in a double queen bed room, terrace view. The only disappointment for me was the food in the main restaurant. I am sure that many people would find the food to be of good quality. I had a reaction to some of the chili dip and tortillas or possibly the coconut shrimp. There is some oil used in cooking called-- I think -rapeseed oil, especially in China, that may be included in some recipes served in US restaurants. That bothers me but there could also have been some other ingredients that I don't know about. I thought maybe there was a high oil content in some dishes that we tried. We were able to walk to the nearby and very lovely shopping mall where plenty of restaurants are located. However this may be my particular allergies and tastes. The buffets had plenty to choose from. I did not find them to be the lavash affair of a 5 star hotel, however offering a good variety of dishes. I have to say that the restaurant service was excellent and the views from the restauant terrace were stunning. We saw whales! This is the start of the migration and I was told in January there are a lot of whales in the area near Maui. There are two beaches by the hotel where you can see colorful fish by the rocks. The snorkeling was fine and we went to a few places by boat. The Alli Nui boating operation was just excellent. I have seen more sea life in other places such as Isla Mujeres in Mexico. However there were a good variety of fish to see both swimming from shore and from the boat trips. There was a lot of wind which may be seasonal. We hired a driver to take us to Hana which was a good decision. The drive is taxing and rains can come down hard. The water falls were flowing from recent rains and were beautiful. Hana is not a destination. It is the route that offers beautiful scenery but it is long. We also drove up to the lavender farm and got there too late for entry but that drive was beautiful. The hotel concierge arranged all our trips before we departed for Maui so all was easy. The concierges are very competent. A last word about the spa - very nice, good service, clean, fairly expensive and a tip of 20% is added to your bill. However I liked the massage.

The beds are very soft and very comfortable, despite the fact I usually prefer a firmer mattress. The Serenity pool is an adults only pool and in a totally separate area from the other pool. The pool was quiet, relaxing, and had beautiful views of the ocean. It was great to have a separate pool for adults and families and it gave the resort a very romantic feel. The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous with finely cut, golf course-like lawns spanning the oceanfront. There are hammocks hung between palm trees that were great for laying in under the stars at night or while looking at the beautiful sunset. The beach is technically next door but is very close. It is not a huge beach but it is nice and there's a nice reef for snorkeling/scuba diving right off the beach towards the right side. We saw a whole bunch of huge sea turtles right off the shore. We did not eat at the restaurant (Mala) on the property but we did eat at Mala's other location in Lahaina and the meal was fantastic. Definitely get the Ahi bruschetta. The hotel is also within walking distance to the Shops at Wailea Shopping Center which has some nice shops and restaurants. Overall we thought the hotel was great. Its a huge property but the layout makes the hotel not feel crowded. The adults only pool is great and makes this hotel good for couples looking for a quiet romantic getaway. The other kid-friendly pool and beach make this resort good for families as well. Its not a fancy resort but it feels very clean, comfortable, and the grounds are beautiful.

Although i had mostly bad experience, i tried to stay objective. Location Wailea is a pleasant place - nice resorts and condos, clean beaches(no lifeguards), very expensive mall, several good restaurants, \u00c2\u00a0nice people. I just have to warn you - the area is not cheap, so if you do come here and have a budget, I suggest getting a rental at the airport, buying groceries(fruits, water, etc) on your way here. Average plate around here is $40/person, bottle of water goes for $5, car rentals are twice as expensive at the hotels. One important factor to point out - Marriott doesn't have its own beach, it's not a huge deal since the beaches are walking distance but you don't have a seat waiting for you like other hotels provide you with, so you need to get towels at the pool and carry them to the beach . Area is good for runners and walkers: \u00c2\u00a0people from other resorts enjoyed coming to Marriott for a walk or even swim at the pool - there are no gates and nobody ever asks for a pass. Rooms I got a deluxe ocean view room away from the pools and it was spacious, clean with nice furniture. I think most rooms have some kind of view of the ocean. If you have a choice, don't get rooms overlooking the pool / since the pools are always crowded you would be tempted to stay inside. Room service was good. Pools Unfortunately the pools turned out to be a big disappointment so if pool is important part of your vacation - you should check elsewhere. Pools are fairly small, water colder than in ocean, crowded and roughly a third of sits you have to pay for - \u00c2\u00a0be prepared to get up early and fight for free sits or pay between $25 and $100 for a spot - those seats are nicer but this is my first time at the hotel where some spots you have to pay for. \u00c2\u00a0The picture that you see - the front cover is an optical illusion, the pools are\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0good 100 feet away from the ocean. Lastly, without any warning during my stay - administration shut down adult pool for a week- should I have known that I would have stayed somewhere else - paradoxically I called a few days prior to arrival to ask if the pool will be open and was told that it would only be closed for 2 days - I thought 2 days - that's not a big deal, how silly I was. The property is going through renovations so this happen again I suspect. Other public areas Nice lobby, laundry is available(don't use it though - we had to throw away some cloth after using it) and they tend shut down laundry room at random - one time we couldn't get out cloth out during normal hours, breakfast area is nice and buffet price is reasonable, lots of showers and bathrooms around the property.

The Starbucks gets really crowded early in the AM so keep that in mind, but the friendly staff makes up for the long wait. As for the rooms, the rooms are clean but pretty bare bones. We had an ocean view, which was nice, but we were positioned pretty far back from the water so a lot of our view was the roof of the lobby overhang below.

If any of you are familiar with Waikiki and are thinking about Maui, here is what to expect if you stay in Wailea ... 1. Don't expect to be pestered by timeshare or activity sales people in Wailea 2. Don't expect to have all the conveniences of inexpensive options for food like in Waikiki ... that isn't the case in Wailea. If peace and quiet are what you want .... Wailea is it. As for the Wailea Marriott Resort and Spa, many people have written about things that some take as positives and some as negatives. I'm a pretty straight forward guy who is pretty indifferent to most things so here's my person view. The rooms are all the same. Beds are soft and they are low (no box springs) & yes the floors are all tile. Both of these things my wife and I liked. There is no wi-fi in the room .. so what you are on vacation - take a vacation and forget about facebook for a week. If you can't live without it, there is free wi-fi up at the Starbucks. No direct beach in front of the hotel, yes, but you are oceanfront. The beach is rocky. You want sand? walk 5 minutes in either direction and you got it. The property is big and your room may not be a short walk from the lobby. So what ... tip the bell hop a buck and have him ride you in the golf cart (they'll do that). There are about 4 or 5 pools on the property. The infinity pool is adults only. Most pools do NOT have a lot of lounge seating so be prepared to get to a pool early or wing it with finding a lounge chair. The water (in all the pools) is cold, so be prepared for that. Room service is very expensive. Two 8\" pizzas and a cup of onion soup was about $58 ... that was the one and only time we ate room service. There is a resort fee of $30 per day. if you have a rental car (you should - you really should) - the parking is included in the daily fee. People have complained about the parking. I never had a problem. Even if you park on the far end of the parking structure, it's a 3 minute walk. No big deal brah. The shops at Wailea (an outdoor mall if you will) are open daily from about 9 to 9 & a 5 minute walk... bring your wallet - the shopping in Wailea is pricey as well. If you did rent a car, Kihei is only 5 miles up the road where you can buy groceries, or alcohol for beach drinks in your room that won't cost you $12 each like they do at the resort. Hey, I don't blame the resort ... they can charge whatever they want. This is America .... we have options. Pay $12 for a drink, or buy your own booze and mix your own in your room. My wife and I stayed in room 2324 in Hale 2 which was top floor (3rd floor) deluxe ocean view. Full sweeping views of the ocean. One review stated the bottom floor near the ocean & the people walking on the path which wasn't too private for them.. that is true ... if you can, ask for a 2nd or 3rd floor room ..... you can leave the glass door open at night and listen to the waves. Some reviews talked about sugar ants. We had a few & they were always in the bathroom sink. These things were needle point small, and we saw a few a day in the bathroom sink ... not a big deal to us, we just rinsed them down the drain. We were careful not to leave pop cans or beer cans anywhere near the bathroom sink. There are some public beaches within a 5 to 10 minute drive from the property over in Makena. Very swank area, but these are public beaches and our time spent there, the beaches were practically deserted. All in all we loved our stay. Very relaxing. We did miss some of the conveniences of Waikiki, but we certainly didn't miss the constant pestering of activity salespeople. This was pure relaxation. The staff was very nice. I am platinum Marriott rewards member, so I don't know if that is the reason, but we asked for a late check out since we had a red-eye back to the mainland, they couldn't let us stay in our room we were in all week, but they moved us to a more modest room and let us check out at 7pm. This was really cool of them. They didn't charge us a penny to do it either. We were able to relax in an air conditioned room before our long flight home. We would stay there again. It's not inexpensive ... but it sure is relaxing.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, great hotel, alright service\u201d", "Author": "Dan C", "ReviewID": "UR121218673", "Content": "Note: I stayed here when I *was* a Marriott reservations employee.

I did not rent a car, but I did take the local bus to Lahaina because I had stayed there previously on a family vacation. The bus was only $2 for a day pass and totally worthwhile. Took the tour to Hana that goes fully around the south coast (bring an airsickness bag for the road TO Hana, and an extra cushion for the rough trip back).

The Marriott occupies an expansive piece of rocky coastline in gorgeous Wailea. The property is very long and the rooms are widespread. There is no beach per se - just little stretches of sand amongst all of the rocks. The Marriott has hundreds of rooms on various parts of the property. We were first given a room in the Tower. It is NOT a place you want to be. It is a very tall building that feels more like a holiday inn from the 80's then a Hawaiian beachfront hotel. Many of the rooms have views of the parking lot. While the rooms are nice inside, the Tower Rooms are not fit for a beachside vacation. Upon agreeing to pay $50 more per night, we were upgraded to a ground level beachfront room with expansive ocean views. This room was exactly the same inside as the Tower room, but had a wonderful ocean view. The down side, however, is that the public walkway that goes through the entire hotel was right outside our room so there was no privacy from dawn to dask. As a result, we couldn't keep our blinds or sliding glass door open to hear the ocean as we slept because people would be able to see in our room very easily! One issue was that although the hotel charges a $30/day resort fee, this fee doesn't give you anything you want. It grants you free phone usage and faxes - who wants faxes on vacation? It also DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERNET ACCESS. If you want to access the internet from your room, you only have one option - TO PAY FOR WIRED INTERNET! So even though we paid $30/day for a resort fee, we had to pay another $20/day to get in room wired internet. And the wire only extended a few feet so we had to sit at the in room desk to use our computer. The only wireless internet on the property is located at the Starbucks on site, but it closes at 5:30 p.m. and it was packed with people using the free wireless so seating was tough to get. Another issue is the tile floors in the rooms. They felt dirty and not luxurious at all. I know this hotel was just renovated, and I'm shocked that they didn't do something better to the floors. Also, room service is not available at all hours - shocking for a major hotel of this size. However, the hotel is a short walk to the Shops at Wailea so you can easily walk over there to get food. This was a nice feature. The main pool has not been renovated, although there is a swanky adult only pool that looks great. If you have kids, this is a decent place to stay because they have a nice kid pool with toys, etc. But if you are an adult looking for a romantic vacation, I highly suggest the Fairmont or Four Seasons instead - both far superior to this property.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Argyle, Texas, United States", "Title": "\u201cHawaii Wedding - Michael and Kay\u201d", "Author": "KoziolMichael", "ReviewID": "UR121009481", "Content": "This was a beautiful resort.

Children are not allowed there so it's a peaceful place for adults (nothing against kids....we just like a quiet place to hang out).

One week prior to our departure, Costco informed us of the unexpected commencement of major renovations to some of the common areas at that resort, so we moved our accomodations to the Wailea Beach Marriott Resort & Spa for the week. The resort was very nice and our room was spacious and very clean. Compared to the other resorts in Wailea, the grounds and amenities were somewhat ordinary. For example, the other resorts had lush and interesting landscaping and pools, while the Marriott's pool area was very underwhelming. The week prior to our stay in Maui, we had stayed for 5 days at the Grand Hyatt in Poipu on Kauai and had spent a considerable amount of time lounging around their pool area. We never felt compelled to do the same at the Marriott. We were charged a $30 resort fee per day. We did not have a problem with the charge, as we had been charged $25 per day at the Hyatt and realize that resort fees are commonplace in Hawaii. At the Hyatt, the fee included free parking, discounts on all kinds on services and amenities, free internet usage, free laundry facilities and 2 bottles of water left in our room each day. At the Marriott, the parking was free but, other than some token non-useful discounts, they charged for the internet and for the laundry services. When we first arrived, we asked for a lunch recommendation. Of course, they referred us to their poolside grill. Their lunch was extremely expensive for the quantity and quality of the food we were served. If you wanted to substitute salad, fries or onion rings for the potato chips served with the sandwich, the upcharge was $5-$6. Then, we found out later that we were entitled to a discount card (Aloha Card) that would give us discounts at certain restaurants, including the lunch place. When we told the concierge that we had already eaten there, unbeknowst to us that there could be a discount of 20%, he refused to make any adjustment, even though we had charged the meal to our room. Moral of our story: if you are staying at the Marriott, be sure to ask for the discount card before you eat anything there. Our room was very clean, so no complaint there. One day we were shorted the usual supply of bath towels, so the next morning we asked housekeeping to provide a couple of extra towels. By the next day, our request had been forgotten and our towels were shorted again. At the Hyatt, when we had a minor probem in the room, not only did they fix it, but, they sent us a food basket and a handwritten apology. On the positive side, the breakfast buffet, included in our package, was ample and delicious. I am sure that, had we stayed at the Marriott first, we would have found it to be expensive, yet very comfortable, despite the lapses in their curstomer service. However, we were treated so well at the Hyatt in Kauai, I guess our expectations were raised by that experience. Next time, we will likely try the renovated Hyatt Regency, as we were orignally supposed to do, with the expectation that we will be treated as well as we were in Kauai.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cRenovated rooms, nice decor but the front deck service and parking are lacking\u201d", "Author": "veloche", "ReviewID": "UR120707704", "Content": "The place is well designed, bewly rennovated.

Very nice resort in quiet Wailea, located away from the condo-madness of Kiehi and the tourist trap that is Lahaina. You're greeted by well-manicured landscaping and clean streets on the drive that drops you down into Wailea. Make note of the restaurant 'Monkeypod' as you make your way down the hill. You should go there -- a lot. We went four times in seven days. Great happy hour, good food, 32 beers that are on tap. The resort is nice,clean and laid out pretty well. I'm Platinum so we received an oceanfront room. Can't complain at all there. Room was nice, spacious. Bed, as noted elsewhere, was soft, very soft. The bath towels were a little rough. Yes, these are about my only complaints. Again, the room was free. There's a small fridge in the room. Make sure you stop at a real grocery store (Safeway and Foodland are in Kiehi) to get a case of water, booze, beer, whatever. You can thank me later. Resort food/drink, expensive, as you might guess. Full-service Starbucks in the hotel, opens at 5:30 a.m. Free Wi-Fi there (not in room). The shops at Wailea, within walking distance, is great for anything you forgot, ice cream at Lappert's and that's about it. Longhi's has a decent happy hour. Avoid the Cheeseburger place and Tommy Bahama. Get downtown Kiehi to Kiehi Caffe (yes, two F's) or Sansei for sushi. Tip:There's a small pool out back behind the south end of the resort, above the kid pool. It's very quiet there in the morning. You can swim and get sun and not be bothered much. Had the breakfast buffet a few times. It was good and $17 for Marriott Rewards members instead of $28. Had drinks at the lower bar, Kumu, once. You can catch a game there on TV if that's your thing but if you HAVE TO watch a game, head down the road to Mulligan's, which has DirectTV and a good happy hour. There's a great walking trail along the water that stretches about 1.3 miles, most of it going south. That was a great walk for us after breakfast each day.

'10. we opted for an ocean facing view room at the marriott and it was definitely worth it (pricey though - $600+/night). i am not sure i would rate the hotel as high with a room not facing the ocean, but the cost would have been less so maybe its worth it. 'ocean facing view' means you are guaranteed a room in one of the buildings closest to the water, not the highrise in the back of the property. our room was on the ground floor and you literally walked right out to the water. there is no sand in front of hotel, but the view is still gorgeous. we actually enjoyed it more without the beach in front of hotel because it was less crowded directly outside our room. the property is not as luxurious as the 4 seasons, but our room view definitely out shined it and we would definitely return and request the same room! there is a path that runs along the water and connects the hotels in wailea. you can easily walk to have dinner at the 4 seasons or grand wailea. we did not eat at any of the restaurants on the marriott property - so i cant rate them - but we did spend a couple days at the infinity pool and the service there was great for a low key lunch by the pool. the pool is small and can get crowded, but its an adults only pool. the hotel is walking distance to shops where you can get lunch or a cheaper dinner. i do recommend renting a car (there is a self parking garage on the property - $25/day) and exploring the island. travel to the beaches (big beach is gorgeous!), eat dinner at mamas fish house!! - reservation required - request to sit so you can view the ocean. take a surf lesson in kihei and chat with the locals who are so nice and will give you recommendations on where to have a \"locals lunch.\" the staff was extremely friendly and met every need.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona, United States", "Title": "\u201cSo Convenient and Nice!\u201d", "Author": "Alberto N", "ReviewID": "UR119947695", "Content": "Absolutely coming back.

Wish the bathroom were a bit bigger (a full-size tub would have been appreciated). Slightly disappointed by the view; reserved a \"partial ocean-view\" - which we received...however, the part that was NOT ocean view as, in fact, a parking lot (boo). Pictures of the infinity pool do it justice. The lovely beach-walk that stretches the 1.3 miles in front of the Wailea hotel properties leads you (obviously) to two immaculate, beautiful beaches (do not worry that the hotel isn't immediately in front of a swimmable beach). Only two serious complaints: I find the $30 per day resort fee outrageous, particularly because it does not include internet services.

This was our third trip to Maui and the first to Wailea. This resort seemed more reasonably priced than nearby hotels and the beach is just steps away. The ocean views were great. We booked an oceanview room and were given an oceanview room, although at check in, I had to ask for a better view. Our anniversary was not acknowledged and we were not upgraded at all. We normally are but I understand points, and the hotel seemed jam-packed to me, so perhaps one was not available. I did not get a vibe of \"lets wow the customer\" here. Some aspects of the hotel were very good. When we requested extra coffee, towels, etc. they complied right away. I missed having turndown service but you get what you pay for. They do have a \"freshen up\" service upon request to bring clean towels and remove your trash which they remembered to do every night but once. We mostly ate at the Cheeseburger Island for breakfast. They have a $6 special for eggs, hashbrowns, toast, coffee, although they had other items too, and mimosas for $5. We had an early tee time one day and ate at the hotel buffet b/c they were open at 630 AM. (Cheeseburger opened at 8). If you are a Marriott Rewards member you get a discount on breakfast so sign up before you go if you are not already one. The buffet was plentiful and included an omlette station. The internet was not good, and we had to call their technical support people to get the wired highspeed to work in the room. They have wifi only in the lobby and also at Starbucks. For the price they charge for internet, it should at least be wifi property-wide. We opted for the valet at $30 daily instead of the resort fee for $25 since I had foot surgery and limited my walking. The valets were prompt although they felt a little robotic. The do have a shuttle service to other Wailea resorts if you are having dinner at another property. We appreciated that so we did not have to worry about driving back, although most other resorts are a lovely beach walk away. The adults only serenity infinity pool was anything but serene with folks getting up at 630 to claim their spaces for the day. If you waited until 9 to get a chair you were out of luck. It was annoying and we watched this happen every morning from our balcony overlooking the pool. There was bar service at the pool and folks thought nothing of yelling back and forth. We went to another pool in the afternoon and were given an oval-shaped cushion with a shade that normally goes for $25 a day. We got drinks from the bar so they comped our cushion. it was late in the day and this pool was quieter than the adults only pool. Poolside drink service from Lori was great. There is a separate pool for children, which was great as we were traveling without. I think they have 4 pools total. The infinity pool is freezing cold. We saw one couple who had bought the $500+ private dinner for two in the cabana over the pool and I would recommend a later dinner hour than they had, which was before sunset as there were still people splashing and hollering around in the pool. It could not have been romantic at that time. There are 2 hammocks on the property in case you love swaying to them by the coean, although they are both near guest rooms, so if you are lucky, you get that room :). The hotel has a pretty good happy hour and they have some food specials as well. The room exceeded my expectations as I had read some negative reviews here. Our room was very large, with a flat-screen tv we never turned on. There was a sofabed and another large chair in addition to the desk. We had ample storage space and I liked the tile floors. Their AC system does not work with the patio door open, which is common and better for the environment. The hair dryer was 1600 watt but surprisingly powerful. The bathroom area was clean and nice. The decor was also pleasant with muted, calm, pastel colors. The bed was comfortable but we own a Marriott bed so it was exactly what we expected. The linens were nice and very snuggly too. The self laundry was a nice touch and not too expensive. We ate at Mala and I will review that separately as we had a rather unusual experience, although the food was good and the views were great. Matteo's pizza just up the road was terrific and their casual environment made a nice antidote to the fancy tropical dinners that got to be a bit much after 8 days. Their pizza is really really good. They were also a great value. We ate lunch once at Bistro Molokini at the Grand Wailea as part of a spa package from the Grand Wailea and it was pretty good too with portions large enough for sharing. We ate at Nick's Fish Market at the Fairmont and it was incredible. Some staff members at the Marriott were very cheerful and helpful. Some were not. Part of our problem is that we came here after the Koa Kea in Kauai and the service levels are not on the same parallel at all.

The grounds are very green and well kept. There are 2 beaches to choose from and they are both good choices. The ocean water was perfect; clear, calm and not freezing. They have 2 pools, which were decent, but if i had to choose between the beach and a pool, i pick beach. You can book all your activities and rent a car at the hotel, which was fast and easy. We rented a car, which i recommend and toured the island. They have Luaus and other activities so you dont have to leave. The Restaurant Mala, was alright.

That being said, I would rate this hotel as average. We stayed in the Haleakala villa, on the 5th floor. Our room was right at the elevator but we were not bothered by noise. The elevators smelled like crap all 4 days that we stayed there. The carpet was disgusting and probably the cause of the stink. It was actually awful. Our room was just average, we were lucky enough to have one of the rooms w/ the flat screen lcd tvs...we noticed that many of the ocean/pool view rooms had the older box TVs which would have been a big disappointment for us. When we got to the room, there was a dead fly on the ground. Did housecleaning forget to sweep? We also saw little ants all around the room - in the bathroom, on the dresser, everywhere. It was to the point that I had to keep my luggage zipped up the whole time, and I was actually concerned about ants in the bed and checked the bed before sleeping. This made the stay pretty uncomfortable. There were ants all over the resort which is understandable as it is lush and green - but I would expect that for what you're paying the rooms would be ant free. We also saw ants in the hospitality room we used. The hotel's saving grace is the adults only infinity pool - it is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. The many other pools at the hotel were nothing to write home about. As mentioned, we were able to use a hospitality room to shower before our 10pm flight back to Canada...we were really glad that it was available for our use. The hotel is next to the Shops at Wailea which has some pretty decent shopping. Not as good as Waikiki though ;) There are two beaches on either side of the hotel, the one to the right has great snorkeling though the beach is really small. The one to the left (wailea beach) also had some snorkeling but for the most part the waves were too strong to snorkel. The beaches are ok - not white sand but the sand is soft... the water is okay as well though there are nicer beaches around Maui to visit if you have a car. Also, there is a $25 resort fee per day. It does include self parking though so I don't think it's unreasonable since some hotels would charge for parking anyway - but just be aware of this. The service at this hotel is ok - I didn't think housecleaning was that great but the woman that checked us out was awesome - she was the one who told us about the hospitality room and also updated our key cards so that we could have access to the parking garage until our flight (otherwise our in out privileges would have terminated).

Wailea is a lovely area - lush and green and upscale, next to several very high-brow resorts - but it is far from Lahaina, which a lot of people feel is synonymous with Maui, so keep this in mind.

The faucet in our tub wasn't securely fastened behind the wall, so it would vibrate loudly as we tried to take a shower (only at certain water temperatures...weird). As most resorts in this locale, prices for meals and activities can get expensive, but they weren't out of line with similar properties. I have a big shout-out to the pool concierges who were extremely friendly and helpful in recommending our snorkel, dining and driving excursions. The Marriott hosts a lovely luau, with all the expected food and activities. The public beaches are within a few minutes' walk from the compound, and you can rent umbrellas, chairs, boogeyboards and more. It would be nice if the beach was part of the compound - considering the price. But there's only so much beach to go around, I guess. Shopping is super convenient but you might want to rent a car to venture a bit farther away. The Shops at Wailea are on the expensive side.

Major renovations inside and out have created a lovely esthetic to both rooms and grounds. Front staff and concierge service are top notch. Many rooms and pool areas have a million dollar view of the ocean. The ocean front suites are separate from the main hotel and are worth the splurge. It is reasonably geared for families with a dedicated pool site. The infinity pool area is adults only - a plus for guests seeking a serene setting. Pool-side servers are friendly and attentive, and the pool menu for drinks and food is predictable but very good. Dining options are limited at the Marriott. Mala Restaurant is on site, and our couple of meals there found it lacking the \"Wow\" factor that the original location in Lahaina has. There's an excellent morning breakfast buffet. It comes with serious sticker shock, but that's true at every other resort too. Other fine dining options are available at nearby resorts; with Pacific Grill at the Four Seasons and Nicks Fish Market at the Fairmont topping our list. Wailea in general lends itself to couples with relaxation or golf as prime objectives. The Shops at Wailea next door cater to high end shopping (Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Tiffany & Co, Fendi, etc) for the Fairmont/Four Seasons crowd down the road, as well as a nice selection of stores for mere mortals. Restaurant choices there include Cheeseburger in Paradise and Longi's. While good they lack the charm of their Lahaina locations. To explore outside of Wailea you'll need a rental car. Kihei to the north is a great spot for family eating and hanging out, with wide beaches at public parks and assorted recreation opportunities (surfing, scuba, snorkeling, swimming, paddle-boarding). Family dining in Kihei won't break the budget at Senor Frogs, Kihei Caffe, or a number of other moderately priced restaurants. Families will love Kalama Village Marketplace for Island 'stuff' (Don't be shy - bargain with vendors! If you go early you'll hear \"You're my first customer today so I give you special price\". They will!) You'll find the Wailea Marriott a lovely vacation home base, nice resort amenities, and lots to do and see in surrounding areas as long as your have your trusty car rental.

The first experience five years ago was wonderful, and it definitely left a favorable impression. Unfortunately, my latest visit left a lot to be desired, service-wise. The staff seemed to have difficulty understanding the needs of their guests. Checking into the hotel was probably the only time we did not encounter poor service. Our first morning there, we went down for the breakfast buffet, and when we went up to get food, we would come back to find the table had been cleared of everything, even though personal items had been left on the table. Our waitress apologized and said it was due to new bus and clean up staff. OK, everyone is entitled to a mistake, and it is nice that the restaurant is kept clean. Our second morning, the same tthing occurred, this time with a \"seasoned\" busboy. We got profuse apologies and were told that it was \"unacceptable\" that our table had been cleared early. When I told him the same thing had happened the day before, he was rather embarassed. What was worse was that our table was near the bus/cleaning station, and we could hear the bus staff loudly discussing how much they \"F-ing hated this job\". Probably the last thing a customer wants to hear when being served food is that they have a disgruntled staff waiting on them. I approached the manager with my concerns, and was basically given lip service. She was very nice, but stated that she only worked two mornings a week, which apparently translated to the concept that nothing would be done. That was the last time we ate at the hotel. We were on the island for a family event, and would often return to the hotel between 10 and 11 PM. Generally, Self Parking would be closed at that time, and all hotel guests would have to go to Valet to gain admittance to the parking area. Late one evening we returned to find no one available at Valet, and no one to assist in gaining access to park the car. After 15 minutes, someone from the front desk wandered by, and told us that \"someone will be with you shortly\". When I stated that it had already been a 15 minute wait, she proceeded to basically offer excuses but no assistance. When she finally decided to help, she gave the excuse that she couldn't see us waiting from the front desk, and they weren't really checking that closely. The final problem was on check out. The bill included several charges that didn't belong on my bill, including meals and movies that were listed to another room number on the bill. When I brought this to the attention of the clerk, she asked if I had changed rooms, because the system had me in several rooms during my stay. When I told her that we hadn't moved, it took some research before we could resolve the incorrect charges, and the only explanation I received was that the system showed I had been in several rooms during our stay. Overall, it just basically seemed that the staff always had an excuse for bad service, but did nothing to improve. Physically the hotel is beautiful and relaxing.

We stayed in a lovely beachfront studio condo in West Maui, where we were scheduled to check out at 11:00am on Saturday and then have to occupy ourselves and our luggage until our 10:30pm redeye took off. We have been to Maui many times and have had this problem before - one which makes the last day on the island rather antclimatic. This trip, my wife found a great room rate for Friday night at the Wailea Beach Marriott Resort and Spa, so we left the condo early on Friday to spend our last Maui night at the Marriott. What an incredibly great choice! My wife had negotiated a 2pm checkout Saturday and we were able to check our bags with the bellhops until we were ready to leave around six. We spent the rest of the afternoon snorkeling at the beach to the right of the resort (5-10 minute walk) and lounging around the infiniti pool and hot tub. We had been told that the hotel had courtesy rooms where we could shower late in the day and change clothes for the flight. A wonderful young woman named Toni at the desk provided us an even better plan. She informed us that we could get a $5 a person day pass to the lovely spa in the hotel and could have access to a secure locker, steam room and shower before we left for the airport. The spa facilites were fabulous, and my wife and I were the only ones in our respective locker rooms during the period we used them. The showers and dressing area had high-end amenities - rich shampoo, conditioner and body wash, an abundance of clean fluffy towells, individual robes and shaving supplies, etc. Our room was clean and spacious, with a nice patio; we passed on the $75 dollar upgrade to ocean view. The bathroom and bed were both excellent. We had had dinner earlier in our stay at the Four Season in Wailea, and the public areas in the Marriott were, if not quite as high-end, quite open, comfortable and breezy. The guests at the Marriott also seemed a bit more mainstream (at least to us). Besides Toni at the front desk, we had great service from Larry and Trent in the bell area. We got on that redeye refreshed and comfortable, thanks to our experience at the Wailea Marriott.

We had such fond memories and wanted to return during our second trip to Hawaii. We booked it again and were hoping that the hotel would live up to our memories. It not only lived up to our fantastic memories, it exceeded them! We stayed for 9 nights with our 2 children, ages 8 and 10. We were in the Hale building with a view of the ocean, West Maui mountains, and a distant view of Mt. Haleakala. The room was large, decorated in an Asian motif, with a large balcony. Everything was in working condition and the beds were dreamy. The hotel grounds are exceptionally maintained. Landscaping is beautiful, everything is clean, and the hotel staff definitely have the aloha spirit. There are 5 pools here and we visited 4. The 2 children's pools were great - wonderful ocean views, lots of slides to keep the kids busy, lots of sun and shade and views to keep the parents busy. The other 2 pools were good as well. One is average, by the bar and not too crowded. The other is the infinity pool with two hot tubs that has unbeatable views. The last pool is the adults only pool that we did not visit but it looked very nice with great views also. There are 2 beaches nearby - Ulua and Wailea. Both are a short walk from the hotel. I have read mixed reviews about the walk to the beach(es) and I can tell you that the walk is not strenuous, long, or inconvenient in the least. There is a paved path along the ocean to both beaches. You can make Wailea beach in about 2 minutes and Ulua beach in about 3 minutes. I have stayed at beachfront resorts that took a longer walk to reach the beach. The Wailea beach has chairs, golden sands, and a nice swimming cove. The beach is shared with the hotel next door, so can be a bit crowded, but relaxing and a great beach nonetheless. The Ulua beach does not have chairs, so you'll have to bring some towels and \"rough it\" on the sand. The bonus here though is the coral reef within swimming distance. We went out multiple times (morning is the best since winds kick up in the afternoon in the winter) and saw lots of fish and coral. We ran into many snorkelers that saw sea turtles. It may not be the best coral reef in Hawaii, but it is nice and right in front of the hotel. The water is calm and the reef was within a short swimming distance even for kids. We ate in the hotel restaurant (separate review) a few times and visited the hotel gift shop many times. We couldn't have asked for more from this hotel. The pools, beaches, rooms, and aloha spirit were all top-notch. I know there are lots of hotels in Maui, but we haven't experienced any except this one.

The beach to the right and the left are wonderful and my daughter enjoyed the rocky shore line and little tide pools right in front of the hotel.

Some of the technology in the room was a bit dated - the phones in particular seemed old, and the wireless connectivity was only available from the lobby.

The facility's open architecture features manicured gardens, koi ponds, swimming pools, terraces and staircases with unobstructed views of the ocean and surrounding islands, all swept by the afternoon Trade Winds. Public beaches are a short barefoot walk to the North or South and are calm enough for kids - but keep an eye on them! No life guards! Snorkeling among the fish and turtles is great on the reef jutting from the northern beach. The hotel has several pools, including one for adults only. The hotel staff is exemplary and friendly to boot. The breakfast buffet ($25!) came with our package but was worth it to us - breakfast each morning on the terrace overlooking Lana'i and the Pacific, planning the day. Poolside drink & food service is first rate. The pool concierge helped us navigate the island, inking our map to indicate shortcuts to Upcountry Maui and recommended several stopping points along the back way to Hana. The staff was always eager to help us and we never heard an unkind word. The nearby luau is a must for first-time visitors. The food is better than average, including the imu pit roasted pork. The show is very well done - live music, graceful dancing and Cliff's story-telling. Eating and drinking at the hotel is fine, but too much of a good thing is too much. Try the local fare around the island, like Mambo's in Paia. We also went to Foodland (grocery store) in Kihei to stock up on snacks and drinks for our hotel room, then did the guilty-walk-of-shame through the lobby with our soggy paper grocery bags. Later, we noticed other couples doing the same thing. The hotel's $12 cocktails are tasty and exotic but one can buy a six pack of guava nectar and a pint o' rum for the same price. You'll pay a $22/day resort fee and, if you like, $30/day for valet parking. Self-parking in a secured lot is included in the resort fee. The hotel rents snorkeling gear for $18/day and some days they won't rent the equipment because of ocean swells. Tired of being refused the rental, I bought my own mask & snorkel and didn't have any problems snorkeling the reef. Our hotel stay was very relaxing and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch stay on the islands.

First of all, the infinity pool is the very definition of relaxing. It is an adult only pool with an infinity edge that blends in with a beautiful view of the ocean. Servers come around often to bring you food and drinks. The drinks are delicious and they don't skimp on the alcohol. I highly recommend the Mai Tai!

We did have a nice little patio, which we took advantage of every single morning as the sun came up and slept with the door open to hear the waves all night. Bliss! This is a really beautifully kept property, which had some of the most amazing landscaping I've ever seen, with hammocks interspersed between trees which we definitely took advantage of. The pool area had an infinity pool and was nice, but I never swam, the beach is RIGHT THERE! Boo chlorine, Yay salty ocean! My favorite part, which I did take part in about 25 times in a row after the I Do's (have a knack for injuring myself on vacation, figured this had better wait), are some kick butt water slides on the end of the property! I may have been rushing up the stairs to push past some kids but hey, I wanted some fun too! If you walk north to the next beach over, there is an amazing reef for snorkeling. We tried to do that as much as possible, almost each morning (well, not the hungover mornings...) Also, this property doesn't have an actual sandy beach. This didn't bother us, as a bit of a walk in either direction fixed that. Plus, I liked the sound of the waves hitting the rocks just below us. A couple of things which made this not a 5 star review: -The hotel keys would always stop working! It was getting really annoying, as we were really far from the front desk and had to keep taking the 10 - 15 minute hike back to get a new key. This happened about 10 times, which is way too many in my book. -Everything closed so early! The pool area, the restaurant, and the bar! It made us a bit disappointed that we didn't stay at one of the neighboring properties, as that was where we had to go to find anything open. -Variety. Not many places to grab a bite or drink (considering the bar was hardly ever open), luckily, there is the Wailea Mall right behind, and they had several restaurants as well.

The best thing was the amazing view of sunset, ocean, and moon from the luau ground and the beautiful lei (garland) that they gave us.

The hotel itself was very nice and well kept. The grounds are beautiful and also very well maintained. It is true that the Marriott doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a beach on the property but the neighboring beaches are a short walk away if you would like some beach time. We were more than satisfied with lounging around the Marriott pools, particularly the Infinity pool. The Marriott was perfect for us as we were looking for a relaxing get away for our Honeymoon. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re traveling to Wailea with children, the Marriott probably isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the ideal place for you. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cater to children like other hotels in the area seem to do. The Grand Wailea for example has a large water park and kids area which would better accommodate families with younger children. We noticed because we have 5 kids in our house, but we were happy to be at the quieter Marriott this trip. We did eat breakfast at the Marriott most of the days we were there and the $30/person is accurate for the buffet. You could save some money not eating at the Marriott, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind. The hotel has a handful of shops on the property and The Shops at Wailea are right across the street, easy accessible for those wanting to do some additional shopping during their visit. There were a few things about the Marriott that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleased with however. The first thing was that our Honeymoon wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognized by the hotel. Upon checking in I mentioned that we were there for our Honeymoon and got a friendly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153congratulations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the desk. We had heard that mentioning the Honeymoon may get us a bottle of wine, a room upgrade, something\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but we received nothing. My wife is a former Marriott GM and mentioned her disappointment later during our stay when we stopped by the desk to request a late check-out as our return flight was at 10:30pm. At that time we were told that we could get a room upgrade for the remainder of our stay, but that we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a late check-out in the upgraded room. In order to have the later check-out we had to stay in the original room. We were also charged an additional $100 for the half extra day, for the late check-out. I think we would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been happy if the hotel had at least waived that additional half day fee for our Honeymoon, but they did not. The second thing we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy with was the daily resort fee of $30. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been mentioned here before but it does add up. An additional $180 for our six night stay at the Marriott. I think it would be better for the Marriott to simply add that to their daily room rates and not have the additional charge to quests. The third thing is that the in room internet access wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included. The desk did advise me that if I went to the on property Starbucks, that I could get 2 hours (per day) of net access for free and I did. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at the Marriott and need to access the net, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the additional fee for in room unless you need it for a long period of time. Just walk down to the Starbucks and log on for free. Overall, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a relaxing stay in Wailea the Marriott is a good choice. The hotel is in great shape and the property is beautiful. Although we felt somewhat slighted by the Marriott, we did enjoy the quieter atmosphere and the location.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for romance and fun!\u201d", "Author": "zip773", "ReviewID": "UR109373988", "Content": "The room was amazing and the location was perfect!

We used Marriott Rewards points to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for our room and then decided to use dollars to upgrade to an ocean front room. Rachel DeCoite, in the concierge department, arranged for a wonderful room for us with a full ocean view, even from the bed! Our room was #4616 and was on the same level as the reception and lobby. It was very convenient and yet very quiet, being on the top floor of building (Hale) #4. The view from our balcony was great, directly facing the setting sun. The resort is beautiful and very well maintained. Our room was spotless on checking in and was kept that way by the housekeeper. The hallways were clean and I never saw a single piece of trash anywhere. The resort does not have its own beach. The ocean in front of the Marriott is all lava rocks. But, there are beautiful public beaches just a short walk on both sides of the Marriott. Ulua beach is to the north in front of the Ekahi Village and Wailea beach is to the south in front of the Grand Wailea Resort. The Marriot has five pools, I think. We used the Maluhia Serenity pool which is for adults only and my wife and I appreciated that. Our room was very comfortable with a king size platform bed. The TV was a flat-screen tube type, which kind of surprised me. This is the only Marriott that I have been to in several years that did not have a flat screen HD TV. There were 40 channels, not counting the various hotel info channels. There were also pay-per-view movies, but we did not look at what was available. Besides the bed, there was a queen size sofa bed, a coffee table and on the opposite side of the room a comfortable chair. Lighting in the room was very good. The desk had a wired high-speed internet connection that was $14.95 per day if you are not a Marriott Rewards gold or platinum member. Internet speed was very good at just under 5 MBS download and about 1.75 MBS upload clocked using the Speakeasy Speed Test. The room had a small refrigerator which we used extensively and a four-pot drip-type coffee maker. There were two phones; a cordless one on the desk and another on one of the night stands. Except for a single outlet on the desk, the other electrical outlets were behind furniture. The room had a large double-door closet with plenty of wooden hangers. A save large enough to hold a laptop was in the closet as well as iron and ironing board. There were three drawers under the TV and two more in each night stand. There was plenty of storage. The vanity area had a single sink with good lighting, a magnifying mirror and a full length mirror. Bath amenities included shampoo, conditioner, lotion and two kinds of soap. There were four good-size bath towels. The bath area had a large soaking tub and the toilet. Water pressure was great. Balconies at the resort have glass panels so the view is virtually unobstructed. Our balcony had two chairs, a table and a side table. I spent most mornings drinking coffee and enjoying the view. The sun did not hit the balcony for our room until late afternoon. Facing west, the sunsets were beautiful. I was somewhat surprised that there was no nightly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turn down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd service. We did not need our beds turned down or mints on the pillows, but missed having our room freshened-up and towels changed each evening. After some initial confusion, we accepted the $30 per day resort fee. Self parking is $25 per day so the resort fee wound up being only $5 more than parking. The resort fee gives a variety of discounts, include 20% discount at Mala, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant and for the cabana rentals. Parking and the discounts saved us way more than the cost of the resort fee. The resort fee also includes two Mai Tais at Kuma which are $12 each and our server said we were not limited to Mai Tais. When we checked in we received four \u00e2\u20ac\u0153towel cards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Each card can be exchanged for a blue and white stripped pool towel. When you turn in a towel, you get either a fresh towel or get a towel card back. During our stay, to get a lounge under an umbrella at the adult pool meant that you needed to stake out your spot by about 8:30 by putting your pool towels on one or more lounges. When all of the lounges with shade are taken you have the option of renting either a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Casabella\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd covered lounge for two ($25 per day) or one of the six \u00e2\u20ac\u0153floating cabanas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ($100). The floating cabanas do not float, but have two well shaded lounges on part of the deck that sticks out into the pool. Prices are discounted 20% if you opt in for the daily resort fee. We had lunch two days at the resort, once sitting in the Kumu Bar and Grill and once poolside. Service was excellent and the food was very good. The Marriott Burger with Maui potato chips was $15.50. Most of the tropical drinks were $12. We used self parking which was included as part of the resort fee. Room keys allow entry and exit to the two-level parking structure which is just steps from the front of the hotel. We never had a problem finding a parking space. We had the breakfast buffet in the Mala Wailea restaurant. As a Marriott Rewards member the buffet was discounted to $17 per adult which seemed like an excellent value. Besides an omelet station, the buffet offered just about anything else you might want, including eggs Benedict. Everything about our stay was wonderful!

The Luau got rained out and they moved us inside without compensating us with something extra for the letdown. It just was not worth the money to be put indoors and also smelling the fuel from the fire dancer's torches. The hotel has a parking structure that a compact car would barely fit in one of the stalls...that was tough when it got crowded. The suggestions that worked great for us were to pick up breakfast and snack items at the ABC store or Whalers General Store in the next door shopping center \"the Shops at Wailea\", which by the way, is a great outdoor mall! There is an empty small refridgerator in each hotel room. We ate at the mall's Hamburger Islander restaurant a few times, which was good and also north of us in Kehei, Fred's Mexican Cafe who has a great Taco Tuesday.

JT was a great instructor and the fee was reasonable. Our room was nice and the bed was comfortable. There is a nice walking/jogging path, too. We also went snorkeling right outside the hotel at the beach. We didn't go to the luau at the hotel but instead went to Old Lahaina, which was excellent, though about 45 minutes away. Also, we went to the Four Seasons for a couples massage, which was nice, but I don't think it was worth the price and we regretted not going to the Madera Spa at the Marriott instead. Finally, we were also close to Kai Kanani Sailing and took the morning express trip to Molokini Crater for some great snorkeling. We highly recommend them as well. The concierge was helpful in directing us to a Haleakala bike tour after the one we had sign up with cancelled on us the day before (we went with Bike Maui - great - on your own bike ride after crater tour). Finally, we left at 7 am and drive to Hana. We had no problems with to many people on the road. The road is not nearly as bad as we were expecting!

We had 3 lanai and they were all large so we spent time there when we were in our room. The Marriott is much more spread out than the 4S or Kea Lani and was much quieter and less crowded than the other hotels, which you walk by on the path.

Booked two room using points. One room we upgraded with cash to ensure an ocean view, the second one we did not. A week before leaving, I contacted the hotel and requested the two rooms be connecting or at least opposite each other. After researching the resort, I requested Hale 2. Upon arrival, we were told to go to the concierge desk not the check in. Our check in envelope was all ready for us, both rooms. We had rooms 2-308 and 2-307 in the requested building. Our second room, which was for my mother, my 22 yr old daughter and my 14 year old daughter did have an ocean view, albeit from only 1/3 of the balcony, but still very nice. y room, which was hubbie, myself and our 23 yr old son overlooked the main pool and had an incredible view of the ocean. It doesn't get any better than this. We quickly unpacked and tried to take a tour of the resort before it got too dark. Checked out the beach we would be going to. When facing the ocean, to the right. The walkway, the different pools, etc. I think we were all in bed by 9 pm. Of course, with the time change from Chicago, I was up the next morning at 3 am. lol. After picking up our van from Enterprise, which was completely uneventful, we did stop at Safeway to buy pop, water, wine, breakfast and lunch making. With a party of six, we figured to cut some costs. I was shocked, SHOCKED (LOL) at the prices in the store. Except for one thing. Pineapple's were $.47. Picked one up, the only problem was how to cut it? Should I buy the knife at the store for $12 or try and get a knife later? We did borrow a knife later :) We wanted to stop at a recommended restaurant before shopping (mamma's) but it wasn't open, so we stopped into another small place in the same, a little mexican place that was very good. The first morning I went and sat on chairs by the lava rocks and walkway as the sun was coming up and saw HUGE turtles right off the rocks, three of them, and then as the sun got higher, I could see whales. Watching whales all week is a mystical experience. I hope to witness that again. We ate dinner at several of the restaurants at the shopping center, all were great. Starbucks at the Marriott was very good in the morning! Drink service around the pool was speradic, but not sure how they could fix that, either there were a million people or just a few and there was usually just one waitress. It was easier to just go and get your drinks from the bar. We did have breakfast at the restaurant overlooking the pool, which was fine, expensive at $17pp for the buffet, but fine. We did a Trilogy tour which was the highlight of our trip. I can't recommend them highly enough! Hubbie and the kids did a ziplining tour which they had a great time at. We spent a day sightseeing and ended up in Lahaina for shopping and dinner. All in all, this trip was incredible. However, I think the Marriott in Kaui is much nicer than the one in Wialea. There are just so many stairs in Wailea. Two flights down to our room, another flight down to the pool, another flight down to the beach, etc. ALOT of walking to get anywhere, whereas in Kuai the pool is right along the beach which is awesome. We did spend half our time at the beach and half at the pool, so while that was nice, I would much rather prefer an oceanfront swimmable beach right there instead of even a short walk away.

I was there for 5 days and never once saw a waitress move anybody's stuff. In fact they were way too busy to know who left when and for long. I complained to the manager who apologized, said it was their policy, but also admitted that maybe it doesn't get followed and which I said that unless they can track and do that regulary, then they can't single out a guest, which this waitress did and the policy is worthless.

I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. With that said this also was not the first time at this resort. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been there many years ago when it was an intercontinental and have been back since its changed hands. I wish prior to this trip I would have taken the TA reviews more serious. Sadly it appears that the current management really doesn't care about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guest experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Most of my issues deal with the staff and it started with check in. This is a resort with over 500 rooms and had only 2 people working the front desk. Once reaching Daniel (who was very welcoming) he could not find out reservation. I provided him with a printout with the confirmation number yet he still couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it. We stood at the front desk for over 35 min while he called, talked with other employees then got on the phone again and was put on hold ( after a 10 hour flight it wasn't much fun standing there) I told Daniel that I had called the hotel the day prior and explained we were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to make sure there was a request for a king bed and if available a ocean view. The woman on the phone also friendly said she would add the request to my reservation and she was happy I was a return guest. Well come to find out the person was just humoring me because no request was ever added and we ended up with 2 queen beds facing the road on the ground floor. I think overall the guest was not put first. If we were just going to assigned one of the worst rooms why didnt he just give us the room after 10 min and sort out the reservation issues later? Why make the guest stand waiting and it wasn't until I called on the reservation that we got someone on the phone who gave him permission to give us a room.. As stated in the end we were given our bad room and an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The resort itself is in good shape. It is older (70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s - ish) but updated in 2007 I believe. Being updated isnt the same as being clean, the shower head was covered in calcium deposits and the overall clean was not there. We even found a caprisun in the other bed. The beds are by far the most uncomfortable beds I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve encountered in my travels (and that includes europe) The linens were very nice and it was great having a fridge in the room. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any issues with the walls being thin (it may depend on the building / floor but we could hear people screaming in the halls very early in the morning . As I said this was not our first time to Maui and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done the major Tourist things in past visits. This trip was to lay by the pool and listen to the waves.... The new adult only pool is nice but very few chairs and they cant be moved to stay in the shade. So we were at the main pool the entire time and there weren't many children. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also sorry to say they allow guests to play the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153towel game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never encounter in a real 4 / 5 star hotel. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unaware of how its played its when a guest gets up at dawn to put towels on chairs. We basically were always in the same area and I take no issue if I find a chair with towels and no person / book / evidence they are really there to move the towels so I can take advantage of the resort I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paying for. We on advantage would lay by the pool from 10am - 5 pm (5 out of 7 days) and there was not a day that there weren't MANY chairs saved by people that would come and put a beach bag on the chair and lay by the pool or would sit in the chair for 20 min to then just leave. Yet the entire day that chair was unavailable to other guests. There is a pool concierge that could very much monitor the towels on chairs situation. But she just sat under her little hut. (also the pool cards are a total joke, you can put one card in the basket and take 10 if you wanted) There was pool service and it was just ok. The women working the pool seemed spread very thin. Many times we would just get our own drinks. Lori is nice but service was slow and you always had to flag her down. Rebecca kicked butt she really is a true gem but as I said she was spread far to thin but always made sure we were very well taken care of. The bartender Carl was one of the rudest people I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve encountered in customer service. He refused to honor the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy hour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd specials and was just out and out rude. For that reason I then refused to spend another dime in that bar my entire trip. The food prices within the resort are outrageous (yes its Maui and expensive) but crazy. After seeing a menu we didn't eat more than one breakfast. We went to Stella Blues every other morning its OUTSTANDING and much more reasonably priced. We happened to be guests during the Tsunami scare. We felt the hotel handled the situation very well and kept all the guests informed. Luckily we weren't one of the rooms that had to be evacuated but we heard they accommodated the guests well. Check out was almost as painful as check in. Again not nearly enough staff and we had to wait over 15 while the front desk clerks give the rundown of the entire resort to guest checking in. Yes thats nice but they should somehow streamline this process or having an area for guests checking out. Our intentions for this trip to Maui was to listen to the ocean at night and get some sun and celebrate our anniversary. Its a shame they were unable to make this trip special in any way. But its still Maui and hey if you get the chance to go to Maui..... GO!!! All in all would I stay here again..

I was told it was included then charge. I was also under the assumption that there was free internet at the hotel (I called ahead of time to ask this). But they wanted to charge $14+ a day to use it (and only in the lobby!). The room was supposed to be an Ocean View but the only view you could see was when you stood all the way out on the balcony. Late at night we could hear the waves but all the rest of the time we heard delivery trucks idoling and the \"beep, beep, beep\" of them backing up. I also spilled some lotion while there and when I use the towel to clean it up I also cleaned up a lot of dirt from the floor. I was wondering how often the mopped the rooms and it made me concerned about the rest of the room's cleanliness. The last night we went to the bar to use some coupons for complimentary mai tai coupons but we were \"greeted\" by a rude obnoxious bartender. We had misunderstood that the hotel coupons for drinks were not redeemable at this bar and the bartender never bothered to make eye contact and muttered something unintelligible before walking off. It was only when another customer at the bar explained what he had said, that we realized the issue. It's too bad because we would have stayed for drinks regardless of the coupons, but the bartender's obnoxious behavior motivated us to leave.

Visit Kihei [10mn away driving] and Paia [about 30mn away] - those were the best little towns on the island, outside of Wailea.

Connie noticed that I was looking at sunglasses and that my Maui Jim's were in a state of disrepair. Instead of selling me a new pair, she directed me to the Maui Jim corporate office for repair or a replacement credit. She was confident that they would take care of me, and they did; it saved me $250. I asked Connie to line me up for a snorkeling trip. The big catamaran was almost empty (only 30 passengers; capacity for 80) and we were the first to dive into the early dawn water on Molokini. The water was crystal clear and the sea life was brilliant on the reef: we were in an aquarium.

They do have a couple of pools and jacuzzis, including a nice looking infinity pool (although the water there was terribly cold, I could only tolerate it for a few seconds to take pictures and then had to run out), and everything is overlooking the ocean, but then there are just rocks... In order to get to the Wailea beach you have to walk to the neighboring Grand Wailea resort. It is about a 5-7 min walk, you take a walking path that actually runs a couple of miles along the oceanfront, and is very nice for walking/running. Although not a long walk to the beach, getting beach beds and umbrellas will cost you (about $40 per day to rent those), while they are free for Grand Wailea guests. So you do feel like a stepchild going there. And after seeing the beauty and grandeur of Grand Wailea, going back to the Marriott is tough. Of course, Grand Wailea is more expensive, so you get what you pay for... Wailea beach was also disappointing, despite great reviews in all the travel books. The sand was brown (very far from white), and the waves made it uncomfortable to go in, people even tried surfing there. So, at least when we were there, it did not seem like a great beach for leisurely swimming. Of course, we did have some stormy weather a few days prior, so that could've been a factor... If you walk the other way from the Marriott, there is a small beach called Ulua beach which is less croweded and has some decent snorkeling next to the rocks at the end of the beach. Otherwise, the hotel was ok, decent lobby, restaurant, bar. They also had a few gift shops and a conference hall. Parking is extra (you can get a resort passport for $20 a day which includes self parking). Parking garage was not very convenient (have to take stairs to upper levels) but there was always some space available. They also have a luau on the front lawn, I only had a glance at it, so can't comment on the quality of the show, but overall environment did not feel special at all - they just put up plastic chairs on the lawn. The quality of the building came to the test when we got stormy weather. Although we were on the second floor only, this was the highest floor in our building, so we got some major flooding from the roof. The water came dripping down from everywhere - walls, spotlights on the ceiling, etc. The entire bathroom and half of the room were flooded, and we barely had enough time to save our belongings. When we called for help, we were told that this was a problem with the entire hotel and they are working on it. Basically, a few hours later someone came to \"estimate the damage\" and said that we should move to a different room. They did offer us another room about 3-4 hours later. By that time the rain had stopped, and we opted to stay in the same room after it was cleaned. The rest of the hotel was flooded, too, including parts of the lobby, hallways, etc. It was surprising that a rain can do some much damage. I guess, a testament to the age of the building...

The physical setting is beautiful, as it's located on Wailea Beach on the Island of Maui in Hawaii. The lobby is also very impressive, as it overlooks the beautiful Hawaiian scene.

Stayed on points so can't speak really to the rates but did pay for upgrade to ocean view. Got a room where you could only see the ocean if you cranked your head around the corner, so we complained. They found us another room - with two queens instead of the one king we had asked for but no worries. We were ultimately quite happy with our room! The grounds are gorgeous - whether you choose to hang by the infinity pool or the family pools or the beach. We started to register for the Luau on the Marriott property and the concierge suggested instead the Luau next door at the Grand Wailea, which turned out to be fantastic (although the Cirque-du-Soliel-ish stunts from coconut trees seemed a bit of stretch for a luau...). The Grand Wailea luau even had some booths with local jewelry for shopping. (One of our party liked a necklace but it was too long; the jeweler shortened it and used the extra pieces to make earrings and we picked it up a couple days later!) The Starbucks on the Marriott property is open EARLY (5:30 am) which was nice for those of us with \"four-hours-ahead\" mental clocks. If you wanted a pretty cheap quick bite for breakfast, they had a breakfast egg sandwich, bagel or oatmeal with dried fruit which certainly worked for us. If you wanted a bigger breakfast and have a car, recommend driving down to Stella Blues. Sat outside on the patio there and it was quite lovely. We had a couple folks who had trouble with stairs and the property was very helpful with this - e.g. a cart ride to the Luau, elevators to get down to pool level. The business room with available computers was pricey (at least in my book) at 65 cents per minute. If you have a computer, you can get the hotel code and sit either in the lobby or in Starbucks for free. I believe it cost to use the internet from your hotel room. The long path by the beach was fantastic for jogging, fast walking or even strolling, tho it does get a bit crowded if you are out there past, say, 8:30 am. The shops within walking distance include some very nice (read: pricey) stores - Coach, Tiffany's, Louis Vuitton - but there are a handful of more reasonably priced stores as well - Chico's, GAP, Banana Republic, and even an \"ABC\" store (you find them everywhere!) where you can find the basics.

We rented a cabana for one day and although it provided some sun coverage, it was not enough and I got badly sunburned. The pool itself is beautiful however it is not heated and the water is ICE COLD! Too cold to enjoy. Each patio or lanai is equipped with a table and two wicker chairs which are extremely uncomfortable. There are no lounge chairs. For lounge chairs, you have to lay in the sun by the pool, or get up very early and grab the few lounge chairs placed under several trees by the waterfront. We asked if two longe chairs could be broughto our room and at first we were told \"no\". After pushing the issue and speaking to a manager, the manager conceded to having one chair delivered to our room but not two. This was better than nothing I guess, although there were two of us in the room. The bed in the room is too soft so if you have back problems, beware. The onsite restaurant is excellent!

You may need to walk a bit to reach the beach depending on where your room is located. The pool was nice and not over-crowded. You could also relax on the lounge chairs which are located at the top of the small cliffs and watch the sunset and ocean. iThe shopping center including Whaler's General Store was within walking-distance.

Beautiful to look at but seriously, they need to heat that pool a little! 3) Because we booked on priceline we didn't get any kind of an ocean view.

The Wailea Marriott provided all of this. The grounds were beautiful, with 2 main adult pools and one children's area. The resort fronts on a rocky shoreline, which is very beautiful and allows for a pleasant lounging experience, on a deck chair overlooking the rocks and water. Some have complained that the resort is not right on the beach, but I didn't see this as a problem since the beach was just a few minutes' walk in either direction. I think it made the resort seem a bit more secluded than the ones that front the beach. There is excellent snorkeling and body surfing/boogie boarding at both beaches. I reserved an ocean-view room and believe I got a nice deal for the money. I was at the beach end of Hale 2, facing north, and because of the way the building is angled it was more like an ocean-front room. The furnishings in the room were minimalist, with a slight Asian influence. If you like a lot of goop in your room, this is not the hotel for you, but if you like a bright, airy space without a lot of clutter, it's perfect. The only complaints I had about the room were; the sofa wasn't comfortable as configured because the seat cushions wanted to sink down into the sleeper mechanism, and the shower was dark because there was no light in the shower and the shower curtain blocked the light from the overhead fixture. I fixed the sofa problem by putting a throw pillow under the seat cushion and it was fine. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and there was a fridge provided. The service at the hotel was attentive without being intrusive. Check in and check out went smoothly; the one time I ordered room service it was fast, friendly and of good quality. I ate in the restaurant once and while it was overpriced (it was Hawaii) the food was pretty good and the service was excellent. I also used the spa for a mani-pedi and arm wax and had a good time - skilled staff, clean and beautiful facilities and a small discount with the resort coupons you get for your $25 resort fee. The spa charges were not cheap but were on par with other resort spas. There is a shopping center just next door to the resort - I rented good-quality snorkel gear from Maui Dive Shop and was able to stock up on yogurt, fruit and cheese at the Whalers' General Store, which saved me from crazy restaurant breakfast prices. I came to Maui to relax, read books by the water, go for walks in beautiful surroundings and have a home base for a couple of motorcycle adventures. Wailea Marriott was perfect in all regards. Regarding the resort fee - it's annoying but most of the resorts charge it, or factor it in by charging more for their rooms. I would prefer to just pay it upfront in the room price, but it is what it is and even with it added to my room rate, the Marriott was a good value. Also with the two free Mai Tais (I got both since I was traveling solo) and the discount on my pedicure, one day of the extra fee was paid for. I wish the resort fee had included free internet, but alas, WIRED internet was another $15 a day. Since it was wired, it wasn't even that useful because it didn't allow for watching a movie in bed or any other relaxing scenario. I paid for it for one day to do some research and then put my laptop in the safe for the rest of the trip. The Starbucks in the lobby has free 2-hour internet with purchase, which I would have used it I had known about it before I paid my $15 for the one day. And, lastly, I got a car/hotel package on Expedia. I actually paid $17 a night LESS for the car/hotel than I would have paid for the hotel by itself.

We didn't rent the cabana more than twice because the free chairs were so great as well. it is nice to have so much selection around the hotel as well with the childrens pool and water slides hidden off around the side of the hotel it keeps any screaming kids at a minimum.

We were unsure of what to expect due to the mixed reviews, but we both enjoyed our stay here very much. Rooms: We booked an \"ocean front room\" thru Expedia, and our first room was in Hale 3. It was a beautiful room, with an amazing view. Our only complaint was it was on the 2nd floor, right next to the walkway to the pool and sports bar. The location of this room was nice as it was very close to both pools, restaurants, and lobby. We would have just prefered a bit more privacy. We called the next day to see if we were able to switch rooms, and they said it may take a day due to the hotel being at full capacity. They called us back later that night, with an option to take a room in the tower. We switched to a room on the 6th floor, which seemed a bit smaller, but still with an amazing view. We felt more comfortable sleeping with our window open there. However, the housekeeping seemed a little lax in the tower. We had to ask for new soap/toiltries, and our floor was not swept. This was not the case with our first room. Beds: Yes, they are very soft, and by the end of the week we started to get achy, but not terribly uncomfortable. Pillows were super soft, so if that's something you don't prefer, I'd look into bringing your own pillow. Service: Great. Our check in was smooth, which is what we wanted after a 9 hour flight, and complications @ the airport. (delayed, luggage on different flight..) Concierge was helpful in dealing with my husbands golf club rental, and also local restaurant advice. Pool service was friendly, along with the service @ the pool cafe. Pools: Both pools were very nice, and both had amazing views! We spent most of our time at the adult pool. Had no issues getting chairs, and the waitresses were super friendly. Service was a tad slow here, but we were in no rush. Restaurants: We only ate at the pool cafe and Starbucks. Pool cafe is a bit pricey, but not unreasonable. We did not eat @ Mala. If you drive up to Kihei (5-10min), there is a great breakfast joint called the Kihei Cafe. Total dive, but great food! We also ate at Fred's Mexican Cafe and Cafe O'lei which were very good and had drinks @ Moose McGillycuddys. Stay away from Spices. It's a breakfast/lunch restaruant on that main strip (I believe part of the Maui Coast Hotel)... Terrible food!!! We went for breakfast and although service was ok, the food was almost unedible. We drove up to Kapaula one night to have dinner at the Pinapple Grill. Great food. Our last night we had dinner @ Ferraro's in the Four Seasons. Amazing! Tips: We did pay the $25/day resort fee. It includes 2 free mai tais, or Starbucks drinks and parking. We also received an \"aloha card\". This card allowed discounts at certain restaurants @ the hotel and throughout the island. The employees at the pool/restaurant do not ask if you have this card, so you must give it to them for your discount, but it definitely helped out with the bill! Although this hotel is not \"beachfront\", it still has amazing views of the ocean, west Maui, and Lanai. There is a small beach to the north of the hotel, and another one just to the south. It is not a long walk at all, so do not let the negative comments of \"no beachfront\" deter you. We did not experience a lot of kids during our stay. There is a \"kid pool\" toward the south end of the resort which was nice that they had their own space. The resort was very serene, and had a mellow vibe. We enjoyed our stay here. Unlike some of the other people who left reviews, we realize we were not staying at the Four Seasons, therefore did not expect 5 star quality.

No kids.... Hotel (Marriott Beach Resort, Wailea) We loved this hotel. I read the reviews where people complained it was too quiet but that actually appealed to us. The place is pretty quiet after 9 PM and they do not play music by the pool during the day. We stayed in Hale 2 which was close to one of the pools, bar, parking lot and a beach with great snorkeling. The room was nice, the bed a little too soft but probably my only complaint. At first we were disappointed we were on the first floor because of the view, but actually we had a sliding glass door that was perfect for us since our room had a fridge and we were able to get beer, drinks, snacks, etc. Other traveler reviews said the staff at this hotel was rude but we were extremely impressed. Make sure you reach out to the staff for suggestions because they were dead on with every one. Joe the bartender loaned us a Maui Guidebook which we used at great length. Car rental I am starting here as to me this is critical. If you are doing the Road to Hana I suggest the 4 door Jeep, especially if there are four of you and your passengers want to see. This Jeep was great and we had plenty of room. Get the soft top too as the hard top is only T-tops. Rental Warnings: If you book through Travelocity they show you a picture of a 4 door jeep but they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have them. I cancelled when my confirmation noted \"2 door Jeep or like vehicle.\" I stumbled upon a company called HawaiiDrive-O through google. They have a facebook page also and they were $200 cheaper than anywhere else and guaranteed I got the 4 door jeep. They are a third party vendor that have deals through other rental companies, but I used them to book in Maui and Kauai and it was easy. Gas Offer --- though I booked with Hawaii Drive O, my contract was through Budget. Budget will offer you to fill up with them at .20 cents cheaper than the outside rate. Sounds great, but they hit you up for a full tank charge in advance and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t refund what you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t point this out as I was so amped to get out of there it sounded like a great deal, but I found it later in the fine print. Fill up at an outside service station and only get what you need. Most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insurance will cover their car rental so you can probably decline that also. Supplies Stop by a grocery store or wherever and load up on adult beverages, snack and even a cooler. Your room has a fridge so we drank what we brought in. You could probably buy a cheap cooler and use that. Meals --- We like to eat and I will spend whatever to enjoy a good meal. Keep in mind we also enjoy some adult cocktails during dinner too. Fortunately, we were there during restaurant week and got some deals. We never ate at our hotel other than lunch by the pool/ocean. Advice: If you eat at a hotel restaurant expect to pay twice as much for the food. Meals with drinks elsewhere were around $140 per couple and same type meal was $240 at hotel restaurant. Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Shops at Wailea -- beside our hotel and readers had raved about it. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the dinner was that great but I made a bad menu choice. My wife ordered a lobster pasta dish that was excellent. We did go to Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for breakfast one day and it was pretty good. It is convenient to the hotel and you can walk there. Kihei Caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.best breakfast I have ever had and we ate there three or four days. Seems like a hole in the wall but food was awesome --- Do not miss this place!!!. 5 minute drive from hotel. Mai Tai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ( Lahaina) --- We heard about Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and should have stuck with that. But we were hungry and the sign said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best New restaurant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The meal wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very good but we were seated waterfront and the server did a good job so not a terrible experience, just not worth the 45 minute drive. Sansei (Kihei) --- We had read about the 5-6 PM Sushi half price special on Sundays and Monday. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to get there later than 4:45 to take advantage of this because both days we never made it in the door. One day there was no seating and the other day there was a line out the door so we passed. Kai Sushi in Shops at Wailea --- The food was pretty good and in walking distance to our hotel. Spago (Four Seasons hotel) --- this was probably one of our best meals. The staff was awesome and so good we remember them by name (Josh bartender and Tim our server). The food was excellent and the servers are probably the best i have ever seen in action. Place was pricey though and we spent $240 per couple at discounted prices due to restaurant week. Hotel Wailea --- We wanted to eat here but they had a wedding that booked the whole place. It sits on a hill and the views looked unreal so it may be worth checking out. Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (Grand Wailea) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The restaurant week special was Filet and lobster so we all got that. The bill was $250 per couple so for that I probably expect to be wowed and instead to me it was okay. Luau (Marriott) --- Luaus are not our thing but we debated it and passed. We were able to observe a few minutes of the show from the beach but looked like a luau. Go figure! Marco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian (next to airport) --- We had a layover and went here based on reviews. The place is a little pricey but my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ravioli was amazing. Resort Fees We kept reading about this $25 per day mandatory fee but it is Not mandatory. Self parking is also free and from all the whining by reviewers it was a 2 minute walk from our room. I imagine if i was in one of the other Hales the walk would be more but too many whiners. Suck it up and move on. Snorkeling We booked a trip on the Kai Kanani Catamaran to Molokini Crater and also swim with turtles. The crew was great and a good experience for $49. The winds pick up in the afternoon so the best dives are in the morning. We had to be there by 6:30 AM but that wasnt so bad. Best value: the next day we paid $6 at a dive shop to rent snorkel gear and snorkeled at our hotel and we swam with turtles each time. Glad we did the first but enjoyed the second more. Hotel Pool --- We kept reading about $100 cabana rentals from reviewers at the adult pool. We walked by the adult pool and the cabanas are more like big sofas with a cover, not a cabana. We never hung out at the adult pool or any pool and i never got in a pool. Instead we found lounge chairs along the ocean on this little nook and hung out there several days. It was awesome! Road to Hana (our best photos came from this day trip) Do not pass this up ---- but understand it takes a whole day to do this trip. We left at 6:30 Am which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us since we were still on East Coast time. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get home until 5:30 PM. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tour all the stops but this little trek is awesome. Buy the CD that tells you what you are seeing. The views from one side of the island (Jungle) to the other side (dessert/lava rock) are pretty amazing. If it rains at all I recommend the jeep.

It is simple yet a luxury. It is not tacky or overdone like neighboring hotels. Its simple and elegant decor makes you focus on the elements of the nature there which makes it so much more beautiful than any other hotel in Wailea. The rooms are perfect, with lanais and comfortable beds. I would specifically ask for a room with privacy. The front desk let us check 3 different rooms before we picked ours which was with a view of the end of the hotel's ocean area rather than a room right off the luau grounds which was more busy and more appropriate for a family with kids in my opinion. It was private and so beautiful to look at as well as to hear the ocean every morning. The sunset is stunning especially when sitting at the adult infinity pool. The best time of day at the pool is between 5-6 pm in my opinion. This brings me to the best feature of the hotel which is the adult infinity pool. It is great to rent a cabana right on the pool for the whole day ($100 with 20 % off) and comes with a fruit platter and water. Or you can get a blue soft cabana for $25 or the lounge chairs are just a perfect and free. There is amazing waiter service at every seat by this pool. They will wait on you all day long and are not pushy yet can always be easily seen if you want something from them. This was my husband's and my honeymoon and we spent a bunch of days just lounging by this pool. Food and Drinks were all great and the pool itself is serene and stunning The days that we didn't lounge by the pool we traveled to Kihei which is a little bohemian and fun, seemed local to us. We also went on Road to Hana, (halfway anyway which made it easier and worth it to us.) This way there was no pressure and we could go back to our lovely hotel and enjoy ourselves there most of the day. We ordered room service that night and other nights which was always delicious, well-portioned and quick. One thing I will warn you about hawaii is if you are a new yorker like me and are used to ordering food all the time, any time -- you can not order delivery in hawaii. You have to pick up, which is why we utilized room service often. We were lucky the room service was very good quality. The restaurant was incredible. We are vegetarians and the chef specifically altered some of the menu items for us i.e. he made the coconut shrimp into coconut tofu for us. They were so accommodating. This was our favorite restaurant in Wailea. We also had the breakfast buffet included in our package every morning which was superb. Eggs, omlettes, fresh fruit, baked goods, waffles, etc. it was also a little different each morning which was kept it interesting. If you want a drink \"to go\" after your meal the waiter will bring it to you in a plastic cup with a straw. I would usually get an iced tea or water to go. The best way to buy water is actually at the gift shop which sells liter bottles of 99 cent water. We felt that this hotel was even nicer than the more expensive ones nearby and that it is well worth its price which is not high compared to most hawaii prices. This is a perfect honeymoon spot or family spot. It all depends on the location of your room and what you want to do. The beach \"not being on the property\" as some have said is really a silly complaint since it is only maybe 10 steps away form the edge of the hotel and feels like it is on the hotel property. There is one to you left which is by the grand wailea and you can rent chairs from (it is annoying to pay for chairs, but it is hawaii) and that water is calm which is very nice. The beach area to the right is more of a local beach and much more rough. There was a pretty strong current when my husband and I went in and had to get out of there. It was okay though because we just went back to our infinity pool. Most of the beaches in Hawaii have pretty strong currents unless they are in a cove which is why I would rather be at a more public beach that is a little more calm like the one to the left of the hotel. You can see the water from most of the hotel and it is so blue and beautiful. You can see the island of Lanai across the water and also part of Maui (Lahaina area) in the distance. Actually, one night we drove to Lahaina and ate at \"The Maui Brewing Company\" which had great beer and very good food. They have a bar with a strip of ice to put your beer down on. Overall our service in Hawaii was very nice. I am someone who is from a big city and doesn't like to drive but driving around Hawaii is very nice and beautiful and was actually a relaxing and special part of our trip. We enjoyed navigating around the island together and taking in the scenery. We went to Kauai after Maui and while Kauai was beautiful I like Wailea in Maui because it wasn't as populated as Lahaina but was more central than Kauai. It had a feeling of remoteness by the resort area but you could still go to stop n shop or a shopping center if you needed one. The gym was nice and so was the spa. The spa was expensive but for our honeymoon was worth the splurge. We did the couples lomi lomi massage in a room with a view of the ocean and the hot tub in it for after the massages. It was very relaxing and the spa was very tranquil with everything you could need. It was funny because we actually exercised every morning here (which is not like us when on vacation) because the grounds are so beautiful and the trail to run on is so breathtaking. I ran more than I had run a long time just because i was so thankful for being able to run while enjoying such a great view, breathing clean air/watery scents and seeing people smiling all around. I would run starting from the condominiums to the right of the hotel to a little ways past the four seasons which gets a little steep but has a good path. I wouldn't run up there at night though because it gets dark and you'd want to see where you are going since you are so close to the rocks and water. Walking and lounging by the water at night though was fine. My husband and I actually got food \"to go\" one night from the restaurant and had a picnic under the big banyan tree by the water under the stars which was super romantic. By the way, the stars are incredible. We could see Mercury so clearly from our room every night! All in all, the hotel was incredible. best vacation ever and we have been to places like Atlantis in the bahamas, etc. I hope to come back to this resort again sometime soon.

We probably spend 50,000 a year on business travel with Marriott hotels, year after year, and are definitely loyal customers. We have a family of 5, and we were guaranteed a rollaway bed on arrival. However, when we arrived after a long trip (flight problems delayed our arrival by one day, that is a whole other story) to check in, we were given a hard time by the front desk staff about the rollaway bed. They refused to give us one, and told us that we would have to upgrade our room to a suite (which still really sleeps 4) at cost to us of over 100 a night. However, the mandatory upgrade would not be available until the following day, so for the first night we slept three on one queen bed, sideways so as to fit but our feet were hanging off, and two on the other. this was hardly what we expected for our first night in such a pricey hotel. The following day we were awake by 3am and decided to pack all of our stuff and check it at the front desk and drive to Hana. When we returned around 4pm the mandatory upgraded room was still not available. When we finally moved in, we were not thrilled that the new room had a view of a large hedge, period. And there were grounds maintenance workers out early in the morning to trim those hedges, as well as trucks driving an unseen service road on the other side of the hedge. Bad news is that trucks beep loudly when backing, and we were regularly subjected to this noise. The suite had one King bed and one full size pullout sofa. we have teenage boys so sleeping in the bed with mom and dad was not their idea of fun, so two crammed onto the pullout and one made a makeshift bed on the floor with couch cushions. SERIOUSLY!!! To make matters worse, while looking through the guest services folder it clearly stated \"Rollaway bed provided upon request\". My husband complained to Marriott corporate directly and only then did management call to try to make things right. No other suites were available, of course, so we were stuck with the noise and hedge. Fortunately we found other places to be most of the time so we spent little time in the room. Housekeeping was adequate but they were never done with the room before late afternoon. Extra towels and linens provided on request, there were none in the room to make the sofa bed with. Resort fee was excessive, 25 dollars a day, and the only real benefit was parking and a bottle of water every day. we got a coupon for two free drinks, total value 20 dollars. at eight nights and 200 dollars, the two drinks were not really free...and the resort fee doesnt provide internet, that is extra. If you purchase anything at Starbucks they will give you two hours free internet, but you have to be in their business to get the signal. Concierge booked our family for dinner at Mala, the hotel restaurant, and we waited 20 minutes and the only person that acknowledged us at the table was the water boy. If we are going to spend nearly 300 dollars on a meal we don't expect to be ignored by the wait staff. We walked out and went to a different restaurant. The hotel did notice our departure and offered us a breakfast buffet to make things right. Rooms are decorated in earth tones and white, king bed was comfortable but the kids on the sofa bed said it was not. the one on the floor said it was better than sleeping with us. the floor was tile, slippery when wet. We ordered room service breakfast for one of the kids that was not feeling well and \"hard fried eggs, cooked all the way\" somehow translated to \"over easy\". Nearly forty dollars for two uncooked eggs, two strips of bacon, half a cup of hashbrowns, a piece of soggy toast, and a glass of chocolate milk. I would skip room service unless necessary. I did see a small cockroach on our last full day. On checkout day one of the kids opened the door to the adjoining room (closed on the other side) and found a large, two inch long cockroach inbetween the doors. yikes. Overall, the resort gets points for a comfy bed and awesome location. The grounds and pools were beautiful.

It was felt very quiet during our stay, despite there being a large conference being held. On several occassions we had a pool all to ourselves! The location also can't be beaten - I can't believe that some other reviewers have grumbled about not having a beach, when there are 2 fantastic beaches either side of the property - depending on where your room is it will only take 1 minute to walk to! After our stay here we moved on to 3 nights at the Grand Wailea next door, which has a beach. It took us longer to get to the hotel's beach there than at the Marriott (although please note, still only a few minutes walk which I cannot believe anybody would complain about!). Comparing the Marriott and the Grand Wailea, I prefered my stay at the Marriott - staff were far more friendly, the hotel seemed quieter and generally I got a far more chilled out vibe from the Marriott. Please note that I used hotel points for both stays, but if I had paid the premium to stay at the Grand Wailea, I would have been quite disappointed after the Marriott. If you are paying for your stay, definately go for the Marriott!Having the shops of Wailea on your doorstep was also a great bonus for the location. One tip though - if you are thinking to rent a stand up paddle board, mask and snorkle or kayak, go to the Grand Wailea's beach club (open to non residents) - you can get 7 days unlimited rental of any \"toy\" for $99, playing around with whatever may take your fancy that day. Other places, including the Marriott, charge $49 for 2 hours rental of a standup so if you are thinking of going out more than once the Grand Wailea Beach club is a much better option (they also have the better equipment!).

The property was formerly owned by Outrigger prior to Marriott. I go to Maui withy my spouse who attends a yearly conference at this hotel. Since Marriott took over ownership the hotel has gone down hill. With the exception of the renovations to rooms and the addition of a pool area several years ago nothing changes from year to year, except to say we get less amenities. We are Marriott reward members and out of all of our group we were the only ones who were. Everyone else had ocean front rooms (I am guessing the hotel was not full so they gave these rather than the garden view which was the conference rate) with flat panel TV's. We got a garden view with an ancient box tv. Make up smeared the the bathroom wall which could have been wiped up. Even the budget Marriotts have flat panel tv's now. They used to supply robes, slippers, cotton balls etc., not now. We didn't even have a pen in our room to write housekeeping a note asking for a sufficient number of towels. They used to give you a free drink daily as part of your resort fee benefits. Now you get one bottle of water per room, and one drink per person for the entire stay even though you still pay the same fee. No beach chairs provided any longer. We were wondering if next year there would be a fee for the pool or to look at the ocean. The bottom line is this hotel is in the Beverly Hills section of Maui next to the Grand Wailea and The Four Seasons. To compete they need to stop cutting corners and step up their game. The satff was nice and helpful, but I would bet housekeeping is given very strict guidelines about getting rooms done fast and at a minimum. They sweep with a broom and replace towels that's it. I had to ask that they use a vacume. The bed sheets are only changed every third day unless you ask. I repeatedly had to ask for enough towels. This is a place where people are going to shower twice a day once in thenorning before breakfast and again in the evening after being out in the ocean and pool before dinner. There is one towel bar so you can't nicely hang up your towels and they repeatedly only gave us three towels even though my Marriott profile asks for more. I don't think they even look at that or care. The bathroom counter was never wiped during our stay. FYI the other hotels in the area give the conference rate and we will be staying at the Grand Wailea next year. Some of the attendees actually switched half way through the week. If anyone can tell you this place has consistently gone down hill it is someone who has stayed there so many times. Even the bath products that are provides seem to be a very low quality. You would expect some very tropical spa like products in Maui. You won't get that here. The food is also very pricey. Around the pool Terri was the only bright spot! They charge 4.50 extra if you choose fries instead of the chips. God help you if you choose the fruit. That was 6 bucks extra and it was a small amount. The food is so pricey in fact that you are better off to go next door to the shops of Wailea and eat breakfast at the best breakfast place in Maui Longhi's.

There are several pools (none particularly large) and one infinity pool reserved for adults only. We stayed on points, but were upgraded to an ocean view room. As stated in other reviews, there are really no \"oceanfront\" rooms here in the traditional sense, in that there is no beach right by this hotel. The ocean is some distance away, and it is a rocky coast right around the hotel. You have to walk 4 or 5 minutes up or down the beach path that runs along the coast to get to either Wailea beach or the other beach (Ulea sp.) - both of which are quite small. The rooms were fine, although the bathroom was somewhat small. We ate at one of the Marriott restaurants one night (Mala), which had gotten good reviews. The food was good, but as is typical for Hawaii, and a hotel, way overpriced. Also annoying is the fact that they charge you a $25 per day resort fee at this hotel - that DOES NOT include internet. If you are a Platinum member of Marriott's rewards program, you get free internet. The rest of you have to pay extra on top of the resort fee. A word to the wise - if you are looking for any action, this is not the place to stay. Although it is beautiful, there is nothing around this hotel at all (except for other hotels/condos/golf courses, and the Shops at Wailea that are a 5 minute walk through the parking lots). We ended up going into the next town over (Kihei) to eat every night, go to shops, go to the 3 very pretty beaches along the road in Kihei, and to get a better sense of true Maui. The entire Wailea area is extremely \"upscale\" and country club/exclusive feeling. If you want to just lay by the pool and do nothing, great. If you need something more, I would recommend staying along the west coast of Maui or another town. Even the activities/water sports desk at this Marriott essentially sends you up the west coast to actually do any parasailing, jet skiing, snorkeling, etc. If you do stay here, there is a Whaler's General Store and ABC Store (which is not a liquor store) in the Shops at Wailea where you can get basic breakfast items, sandwiches, water, soda, snacks, coffee and other items so you can save a ton of money over food at the hotels.

However 2 out of 3 is scary. They said they had no other complaints, don't know why, maybe people think they have mosquito bites? We were not taking any chances. Seriously, maids need to know how to spot them and hotels need to invest in bug proof mattress covers. Also, guests need to learn to look for them...PLEASE check the mattress when you get to any hotel room. If you see what looks like bad flea dust in the mattress seams (can be mix of blackish-brown and/or red spots, like dirt, and in bad cases what looks like old skin-their old shells) this is evidence of bedbugs. They feed on you late at night then run down the seems and poop out your blood on the way back to their homes inside the mattress. Also, infestations that have been \"cleaned up\" may look like smudged black spots, kind of like old mold or mildew stains. Our second room had this. Beware as you don't want to take these home with you, it will cost you your sanity and thousands of dollars to get rid of them. Please be smart, if people know how to recognize them hotels will be forced to deal with them. FYI-Bites are itchy and get red and bumpy like mosquito bites, I think this is why people don't recognize it. If you get such bites 2 or 3 in in a line, this is most likely bedbugs. No, we did not get bitten, because we moved immediately. By the time we got to our \"clean \" room, we were so paranoid we could not sleep. So basically, check before you sleep, the surfaces of this hotel are very clean, but beware the mattresses. Hopefully Marriott will address the affected rooms as it is a nice place otherwise.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel, even better location\u201d", "Author": "LaughingLab", "ReviewID": "UR76700029", "Content": "First off, congratulations. If you are reading this, that means you are likely doing your homework and researching things for you vacation. Like many others (I suspect) I also read the reviews frequently for this Marriot, and while they mostly trend positive, a few negative reviews had me a tad concerned. I can confidently say there was nothing at all for me and my family to be concerned about, this was a great place to stay and a great location. So, about those negative reviews then?? Well, I think the best review I can give is to both combine my overall review, with what I see as the majority of issues that result in negative reviews. Hopefully this will provide you, the reader of this review, with the information you need to make a good decision if this hotel is right for you. So here we go.. 1) The resort is not on a beach. Technically this is correct. If you walk directly west from anywhere on the resort you run into lava rock, then ocean. However, consider 2 things here: A) the resort is located between 2 fantastic beaches, both a short walk (distance depends greatly on your room location, as it is a big place). To the north is Ulua beach, a nice quiet beach (good snorkeling on north end of it) and to south is the far more crowded/happening beach of Wailea. Both are great, but definitely different vibe at each B) the lava rock area this beach fronts is actually pretty awesome, and there are several areas with lounge chairs where you can sit and relax, and listen to waves crashing. I truly find this complaint to be the most amusing and honestly the most sad... do we really live in a world were a 5 minute walk is too much?? Obviously if you have physical limitations that makes walking a challenge, you may want to consider somewhere else. Otherwise, if this is an issue, then honestly I'm just gonna call you out as being lazy. 2) There is a $20 or $25 daily fee. Yes there is a fee, if this is news to you then you didn't read the fine print. I have no sympathy for anyone who complains about this. Sorry if that's harsh, but it drives me nuts when people act like this is a surprise. 3) I'm on my honeymoon and they didn't shower me with rose petals and carry me around the resort on a chariot. Bridezillas.... yeah, they exist, they also like to join tripadvisor just to complain about the hotel, restaurant, etc. that failed to worship them (look how many negative reviews are from posters of only say 1-2 contributions) 4) It's expensive. Yes, it is pretty expensive. You are staying in one of the most upscale areas of one of the most upscale islands (I'd say only Lanai could be considered higher end). It's going to be expensive, be ready for that. Also, just because it's expensive doesn't always mean you get your moneys worth (you usually don't, but that's the price for staying in a \"captive\" resort area like Wailea). I think those are the 4 things I most commonly see on negative reviews, all 4 are non-issues in my opinion. Other tips/notes about the Marriot: 1) You can watch the Luau show w/o paying, you just don't get food. 2) the beachfront path in Wailea is amazing, definitely do the full path at least 1x 3) Onsite Mala place is good, views are incredible 4) Whalers general store in the Shops nearby has $4 take and go sandwhichs, decent sandwhich and good value for lunch 5) Cheeseburger Island Style place is about the cheapest walkable place to eat. The cheeseburgers are... not memorable (this seems to be a common theme on Maui from what I've seen). They did have a $5.99 breakfast special though (eggs, toast, hashbrowns, coffee) that I think is a pretty solid deal for the area. Also decent beer prices during happy hour, and they did have good fries. 6) As mentioned, we called the Wailea Beach the \"happening\" beach. it's crowded, but is a very nice beach. Norther Ulua beach was more \"private\" as crowds were low. Later in the day you stayed the less people, so we packed a lunch and ate on beach. 7) rent chairs, umbrella, cooler from Snorkel bobs 8) Infinity pool is awesome. yes you do have to pay for cabanas.. but there are plenty of chairs all around (and they aren't on top of each other like at the Grand Wailea... what an abomination that place is). 9) You can check in early, but your room won't be ready until close to 4. You can get a key to hospitality room to change in. Just head to pool or beach for a few hours and relax off that airport funk. 10) You can check out late, but you won't get any later than 1pm w/o paying.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "sherrie212", "ReviewID": "UR76682659", "Content": "The flight, hotel, weather, everything was perfect.

The guys above were screaming and shouting and swearing, ...so we called the front desk, they said they would deal with the issue and will call us back with an update, they never did...... - Next day we changed our room, - We went to the serenity pool....really really nice place. We sat down in one of those Cabanas you can see on the hotel's website and after a little while the server with an unpleasant message, \"please move, this Cabana is reserved. They are to be reserved for $100 a day...\" there were no signs, what so ever on this particular cabana, there was a few with a reserved sign, but this one didn't have anything on it...when i complained, she replied, they have already \" KICKED OUT other guests from other cabanas\", this was enough for me to blow the fuse and really get upset, after raising this to the duty manager, they offered us a complementary Cabana, but too little, too late, too rude. Not cool...the apology was not enough i'm afraid...we paid A LOT for this trip and they failed to provide the very basics of customer service. I was surprised to have to pay to sit by the pool in such an expensive hotel and when there is no beachfront (just lava rock) at this resort (despite all other hotels nearby having beaches) - We asked for a late check out on our last day, they confirmed it was fine to leave at 13:00, but when we went back to our room to pack at 12:00, within the agreed extended time, our room keys didn't work anymore. We contacted the front desk and they said they would send the security person to unlock the door, this was fine...BUT...it took them exactly 20 minutes (yes, you read it right, 20 minutes waiting outside our rooms in our swimwear - we'd just come back from a last swim in the pool). My wife went to the lobby in her bikini and asked for the key eventually, standing in front of guests at the reception in what is tatamount to her underwear) There were a few other problems worth mentioning below: - mattress was too soft, if you have a sensitive back, you will pay back the next day - room was dirty on a couple of occasions, but they addressed it and problem didn't happen again (although was not great overall). Throughout the stay we loved the scenery and view and landscaping of our hotel, there is no beach in front at this hotel, but you can walk to the Grand Wailea beach resort, which is a few minutes walking to the south of Marriott and another smaller beach to the north. They charge for everything, internet is around $15 a day, or get a 2 hour voucher from Starbucks with any purchase. Long story short, Guests are nice big greenbacks to the eyes of Marriott staff, i felt lots of Aloha's and Mahala's were fake and only for your tip....I have no problem paying and tipping but I demand a service, which Marriott Wailea failed to deliver....", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cy91clone", "ReviewID": "UR76377185", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant of my selection of this hotel; however, it turned out to be terrific.

Old alcoholics, people with kids, and boring couples. This place completely shuts down about an hour before sunset. There is absolutely nothing to do. There's one bar that stays open until around 11 and I never saw more than four people there. The rooms are moderately nice, the service is fine, and the resort is well-maintained. People complaining about the distance to the beach completely shock me because no one here is in a hurry to do anything--including smile or laugh. It's like a morgue. The property is absolutely gorgeous, but after 24 hours the awe is gone and you're left in the middle of nowhere with nothing to do after the sun goes down. They will even kick you out of the pools. There is an extra $25 resort fee PER DAY in addition to whatever you paid to book on Orbitz, Travelocity, etc, but that basically pays for the parking. You also get a discount on food at one of the restaurants, but watch it. They won't tell you about the discount so we had to go back and get the card reimbursed. The way they reacted when we walked up with our credit card receipt it's obvious that it's just the way they do business. We stayed here because we thought there would be things to do a little south and we could save a little money on lodging, but unless you booked activities weeks before coming to Maui there isn't. Lanai is a 40-minute drive away and that's the closest thing resembling civilization. We were soooo bored and found ourselves back in the room by 9PM and then the room has the oddest selection of TV stations and no wireless internet. It doesn't even have ESPN. It's like it's trapped in the '70s. This place also nickels and dimes you for everything, except the nickel is $50 and the dime is $100. Basically nothing worth having/doing is included. If you're a smoker do not stay here. There are three designated places to smoke on the entire resort and they're puny. You literally have to walk half a mile to get to any of them. It makes you feel like you're in quarantine with leprosy. You aren't even allowed to smoke on your private deck outside your room. It's insane. I felt like I was in some kind of military state. If you're in your 20s or 30s and enjoy any semblance of nitelife or socializing with other fun human beings stay far away. If you're one of the three types of people I mentioned in the first sentence you've just found heaven.

I arrived in Wailea with my parents and older sister to prepare for my wedding. Later my husband's family came in right before the wedding. The hotel was very kind to help us prepare for the wedding, especially since my husband and I are deaf. They helped my mother plan a Spa Day at the Mandara, a luncheon at the Kumu's Bar and Grill, and a small reception in the Buddha room at the Mala restaurant. The staff was wonderful and very informative. I especially loved the hotel room and their tile flooring! It was very cool to walk on. I would've like the keepers to spend more time washing the flooring, since it wasn't clean enough. Also our view of the oceanfront was gorgeous and we even saw a sunset while enjoying our champagne on the balcony. It was also so nice to enjoy the breeze and the view of other islands while having room service breakfast out there one morning. I wish the oceanfront room wasn't too expensive though. I would save money next time and get a garden view. My parents had a garden view and they still had a great view of the two mountains! My husband said he was really happy to have the oceanfront view regardless of the price for our two nights of honeymoon there before going to another island. What my husband loved about the hotel was its space, architecture design, and the infinity pool. The infinity pool has a list of strict rules and doesn't allow kids. The hotel has plenty other pools for kids to dip into though. The infinity pool has some cabana style docks which is for reservation only. My husband's brother rented one for $100 and got some free snacks and drinks. Once in a while, the pool may close at 6pm for special dinner for two (reservation only). One night I saw a couple eating out in the middle of the pool on their wedding night- how romantic! The hotel also has two nearby beaches for people to go to. I didn't spend a day at the beach but my sister did and she enjoyed it very much. She raved about how she saw some sea turtles and a frog (or toad). Right by the hotel, you can see all the lava rocks and ocean waves, which is an unique view. That's where I had my wedding- right out on the lawn with ocean waves crashing into the lava rocks and the sun setting down. The hotel also has some nice breakfasts but I wish bagels were more available since I'm not big on having expensive big breakfast. However, my husband's family are big on breakfast and they enjoyed their meal at the Mala in the hotel. I wish the business room had free internet for the guests to use. That part was pretty disappointing for me. I would have liked to check something on an internet and be allowed to do so for a time limit (say maybe up to 15 minutes). Beside that, we also had to pay for using the internet in our room or through wifi. It would be nice if it was free like some other Marriott hotels I've stayed at in other states. Across the hall from the 24 hours business/mailing center, there is a 24 hours fitness center. They have really nice equipments. My husband said that he wants to come back to Maui (maybe in five to ten years) and stay at this very hotel. It may be expensive but we prefer this hotel over other much more expensive hotels on the coast. This is because the design of the hotel fits our taste. It's also very quiet and peaceful, which we love! There is one more thing that guests should be aware of, the parking is free with the resort fee. You should ask the staff what the resort fee includes (such as two mai tais or coffee, parking, etc).

At best, this is a 3 Star Resort NOT a 4 Star Resort, contrary to whatever claim they may make. I've had similar problems at other Marriotts. The staff is super nice and tries really hard but it's like they don't have enough resources or something. First problem: at check-in. Not enough employees. I had to wait 15 minutes. Compare this to the Grand Hyatt (walk right up to counter - no wait whatsoever). After checking into room, we discovered the bed was broken (platform squeeked) and we had to move to another room in the middle of the night (absolutely frustrating) courtesy of the manager. In the second room, there were clothes left in the drawers and dust in the bathroom, suggesting poor maid service. We also saw moldy strawberries outside the room next door (gross). Also, the property does not have a beach/water sports. You need to walk down about 100 yards to reach it. The pools were also kinda small and crowded with kids. These things just DO NOT happen at similar Four Diamond AAA Resorts like the Grand Hyatt. The Spa was super nice as was the restaraunt, Mala. We used our Marriott Points so we only paid about 50% of the rate of $299. In the future, I don't think I would stay here.

He loaded our bags, drove us around the property explaining the available facilities and what options were close by for shopping, dining, etc. He personally showed us to our oceanfront room, brought our bags inside, filled our ice bucket, and asked if we needed any additional assistance before leaving.

We ordered drinks, seared ahi tuna, lettuce wraps and just chilled to watch the sunset. My husband enjoyed the Maui drafts and the price was reasonable, but the Maui Tai was a bit pricey at 12.50.

Now mind you I traveled with my wife and 16 mo. old so my perspective might be different than most. I practically live in Marriott Hotels for work so I have a certain expectation when I travel to a so called full service Marriott. I had the lucky notion of booking my room with points so I can't complain all that much about a free stay. When you check in the front entrance to the hotel and reception area is first rate, what I expect from Marriott. Little note that the $25 resort fee is optional if you book with points. We were offered the free internet for my Gold Status again expected when you travel like i do. After check in you are taken to your room which is where we learned how confusing this place can be. We stayed in building 3 which is right in the center which worked to our benefit due to the size of this hotel and the walking that is required. We had a stroller most of the time which was kinda a burden since this hotel is not really meant for that or great wheelchair access. Ramps were very few and far between so quite a challenge for us. We found ourselves all over the property just trying to find access back to our room. Beware that the property is more that 30 years old and Marriott just took it over a few years back. I hope to see that Marriott adds its own touches since the majority of it is quite run down. I have to say that for location and views not many hotels will compare to it outstanding location right between two great beaches. The pictures on the website really don't do it justice especially at dusk. The rooms are quite roomy but dated, the beds are very comfortable but very cushy not the best if you have a bad back. We did not mind the dated room since we look at it as a place to sleep and change. Again the rooms were not of Marriott standard way off the mark, but I was okay since not spending a lot of time in the room. Tile floors were a nice change from carpet cool on the feet after a long day in the sun, but beware slippery when wet. Rooms have mini fridges good for drinks from the store, we are used to paying for drinks at the pool but soon after got sticker shock from the Marriott their happy hour prices were where the Westin's regular prices are stayed there earlier in the week. Also found out the Marriott did not have cribs like the Westin but very dated low pack in plays so our little one kept climbing out kinda annoying don't promote cribs if you do not have them. The sofa was a pull out in the room so that was our alternate. The Adult infinity pool is first rate but we just walked by since we were not allowed with our baby. I will say the kids area probably the best I have ever seen at a hotel, for both the little ones like we had and the older ones. Two great slides and a water playground feature with a mini beach access for the kids. One slide plunged into a 9 foot pool not for the faint heart and a regular double swirl slide. The other pools are quite old nothing fancy at all almost like they are old apartment style pools. Two of them are 8 foot deep good to know for the kids running around there. The restaurants MALA and the pool bar could not be more different. The pool bar don't waste your money and time. Very slow service and prices are almost laughable for what you get. Quality terrible and kids menu start at $10. My wife and I are not very picky for food but at least we want to not be ripped off. Spent more on lunch than dinner. Now for MALA we had eaten there before up in Lahina area and enjoyed it but again it had mixed reviews so felt inclined to give it a whirl. If you are not used to paying for good food then this may not be for you but we like are food so we did not mind. Combination's of flavors were quite good. They claim to have the best Kobe burger so I felt inclined worth the money yes, the best I have had that is arguable. My son enjoyed his pasta dish and the staff was great with him, My wife had pizza and coconut shrimp which she enjoyed as well. They're desserts were out of this world. Needless to say we ate there more than once. Would I stay here again yes but only on points or a really good rate. If I am to pay $200-$300 a night I expect way more.

We found this little \"extra\" was a bit strange for a resort. She should have called over to the valet desk with our luggage numbers or we could have walked the 20 feet by ourselves. It felt like you were being escorted to the desk and being watched. The room was immaculate, as was the bathroom, although the shower head needed some serious mildew cleaning. While we were there they were doing regular pest control on a Friday sometime as per the note that was left in our room. It would have been nice to see a coupon or discount from the hotel to one of their restaurants for this unsightly maintenance letter. We never saw them do our room however as we opted to stay out most of the day because of this. The downside to this hotel is that there needs to be signs posted in the hallways reminding parents with children that other guests are looking for peace and quiet vacations. At 8am our hallway sounded like a daycare centre . This plus the lobby music (which sounded like elevator music) that was extremely loud woke us up on several occasions. For the price of this hotel parking should be included and should not cost $20 for self parking. Internet should also be included and not cost. The serenity pool was very nice and no children were allowed there which made for a peaceful environment. The drinks were $10 for a small plastic cup mostly filled with ice. The hotel is definately upscale and the restaurants reflected this. There was nowhere in the hotel, or in the nearby mall, to get a quick cheap eat. The mall is a mixture of high and low end stores; everything from Tiffany's to the Whaler General Store. We ended up going into town to the Outback Steakhouse for a nice meal.

No one waits in line for a beach chair here (I saw people start lining up for a beach chair at 6 am at the Grand Wailea!) Even at 100% capacity, the hotel does not feel crowded. No problems getting a chair at the pool. There are five pools and none of them feel crowded. The hotel is located between two great beaches that have fantastic snorkeling - a five minute walk in either direction. The restaurant for breakfast is fantastic. Yes, the $27 buffet is expensive, but if you order off the menu the prices are good and the view is great. I think the best part of the hotel is the service and the people. They even have a button on the phone \"at your service.\" When you push it, someone at the front desk calls you by name and asks how they can serve you. Nice.

We were okay but expected problems. Pools were great! One was an infinity pool with changing depths. Another a normal pool again with changing depths. Both located in front of main bldg with access to bar drinks and food. Average food item from bar was from 10 to 17 bucks. Bring a soft side cooler and buy canned or bottled drinks that can be chilled in frig, ice machine available. Works well. Favorite pools for my family were on the south side of property. Another pool that went form 3 feet to 9 feet in depth. Nice size and very warm. Also in this area are two water slides that are independent of pools. One is the normal curvy slide, the other is a short and drop into a deep 10 foot pool that my kids called the bullet. Rode it many times. Very unique. The large pool where most pictures are supplied from is the adults only infinity pool. No kids under 18, fyi. Property is on the ocean, but has rocky waterfront. Must walk north or south to beach areas. North is to Ulua Beach which is great for snorkeling. Many fish to view. Go in morning, wind gets up in afternoon and water gets rough. South is the beach in front of Grand Wailea. Crowded, but nicer beach. Very clear water.

But it's all about getting the right room. The 1st 2 nites we were in 813 - view of service area and truck. After 2 nites there they moved us to Hale #2 with a pool ocean view - much better. Although I shouldn't complain either way as I was staying free on points. Here are some tips: 1) Check in: It's standard procedure that when you check in early they tell you your rooms not ready til 4pm- so have a bathing suit handy - and don't complain too much or they give you a lousy room. like 813. But if they do, ask to move until they do, and they will! 2) Best breakfast is a 20 mintue walk up the beach (Right North)to 5 palms. It's a beachfront gem, kinda retro, $4 bloody Mary's or Mimosas. Went there twice, great service. 3) Best lunch is Ferraros at the 4 Seasons - a 15 minute walk left, south - Gr8 views of beach - Pizza for $20, fantastic salads with fresh fish for $22- beers for $6, Kid meno and teen menu - something for everyone including the view. 4) Choice of Luau. The Marriott and the Hyatt both have Luaus on their properties, you really don't need a ticket to watch the shows, (you can get so close) but you do to eat the food and drink the rum. The Marriott uses Hana Bay rum, the Hyatt, Whalers. The Mai Tia's suck. The Marriott stage faces the ocean, the Hyatt faces the stone wall. All the dancers are good and the fire dancers, awards not withstanding, are equals. The pork and Mahi Mahi is better at the Marriott. 5) Best Beach - the southern Hyatt Wailea beach is a zoo and the snorkling sucks there. You can rent a lounge chair, but why bother, its too crowded and not the south of France. The northern beach has better snorkling, better Boogie boarding. less crowded and is full of turtles. If you walk further north the beaches are desserted, empty - no one there and close to $4 Bloody Mary's. You decide. 6) Best Pool: That depends if your a kid or adult, the infinity pool is spectacular after dark, just you the stars and a few discerning adults. The kids pool water slide is fun regardless of age. The pools in between are never crowded even when the hotel is sold out. But the drinks are a rip, Bring a bottle of good rum and POG save your dough for food. 7) Starbucks is a savior. Reasonable Coffee and regular Starbucks fair with a 20% premium, but that's cheap by Maui standards.

Wailea was a great place to do just that! First of all, my husband is a platinum member and we used points for our stay. Upon arrival we were immediately upgraded to an ocean front room that over looked the serenity pool and the ocean. We saw gorgeous sunsets and had little noise to deal with. There was one night when a particularly rowdy group decided to take a late night swim, but they were quieted down quickly. We also had a smoker staying near us making our deck a little smelly once in a while. Also, parking was $20 per day in the ramp. This didn't bother us because we knew it was coming after reading people's information on this site. But my complaints stop there. The serentiy pool was awesome because no kids were allowed and cell phones were prohibited. As a couple without children, we really enjoyed the peace and quiet of an adults only pool. For those complaining about the kids pool area, I don't think Maui is the ideal vacation destination for young children... think Disney World. In the afternoon we walked down the path to the beach to enjoy the ocean. Tip: Go down after lunch 1-2:00 and you can get chairs from people who have bought them and then left instead of paying $30. It worked for us every day! We knew that many restaurants were expensive in the area (typical of Hawaii, no surprise) so we decided to save on breakfast and lunch. The Shops located just behind the hotel have a general store where we purchased many breakfast items very cheap and several bottles of wine for a great price. We also visited Safeway (short drive down the road) and bought food for lunch. This saved us a lot of money and we went out for some nice dinners throughout the week. The hotel restaurant, Mala, was good! We also liked eating at many places located in the shops. Ask the hotel staff for tips on where to go as well as other guests. We always went to eat around 6:30 so that we could see the sunset at 7:15. I went surfing in Lahaina one morning and LOVED it! Highly recommend this! We also went on a boat excursion one day to Molokini and snorkeled. They provided breakfast and lunch and an experience we'll always remember. On our last full day, we decided to do the Road to Hana which we enjoyed, but said we probably wouldn't do again. There were great views, but the road was tight and windy making me a little queazy. Be sure you get out and see as much of Maui as possible to get the full experience. Finally, go to the hotel luau. I had heard mixed reviews but was very happy with it. Take advantage of the open bar and enjoy every morsel of the declicious pig. It was worth the money and so convenient to walk right up to our room following the event instead of driving down winding roads. We had such a great trip to Maui and loved our stay at the Marriott. The staff was kind and other guests were just as friendly. The views were amazing and we had no problems. To those who have written horrible reviews about this hotel, I'm sorry that you missed a once in a lifetime experience.

Mala restaurant has a fabulous breakfast(don't leave your fod unattended or the birds will swipe it-seriously-we saw it happen more than once). The kids pool is small and doesn't really seem like much of a kids pool since there is very little shallow space. But our kids are a little older and this was not a problem. We all loved the water slides and the kids really enjoyed the water play area. This area of Maui got extremely windy in the afternoon and the other pools were almost unusable-the wind is extreme. However the kids area felt a little more protected from the wind. It seems as if there used to be a snack shop right at the kids pool, but it was closed the entire time we were there-how nice it'd be if it were in operation and if there were some type of pool service offering food and drinks. The walking trail is fabulous and we used it every morning. What a view! Also looks like a wonderful luau although we did not attend. All in all we would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Our room was not ready when we arrived but we were ok with waiting until 4pm when we were told our room would be ready. We indicated to the front desk that this was our second time at the hotel. She immediately told us our room number from our last stay and noticed that I was a Marriott gold elite member. None of this should've been a surprise since I had called the hotel to request an upgrade or at least stay in the same building as last time. Once 4pm rolled around I returned to the front desk to get our room key. After a 20 minute wait I was told the room was not yet ready. However they did give me the keys and asked dat I wait another 10 minutes. We waited 15 minutes before we went to the room and it still was not ready. By the time we did get to the room (5pm) we saw that the room was right over the hotel's delivery entrance. Needless to say we returned to the front desk for a room change. During my initial 2 visits to the front desk I was told the hotel was sold out and there were no upgrades available. Nevertheless on my third visit to the front desk we somehow were upgraded to oceanfront. Once in our room I noticed that the room seemed dirty. The white grout was more like brown, there was mildew in the bathroom, etc. Our visit two years ago was great. This time they made me questioned why I was there at all. The staff just did their job nothing more. I didn't feel welcomed at any point and service was sporadic at best. The only exception was Anita at the pool. She made sure we were ok the entire time. I've worked in the hotel business for many years and as a rule of thumb staff is trained to greet guests and make eye contact. This is not the case at the Marriott. Employees not once ackowledged us as we walked throughout the property. Before arriving at the Marriott we had stayed at the Hyatt Regency. This was a first time stay for me. I'm both a gold elite marriott member and a platinum member and I must say the Hyatt did a much better job. At the Marriott you only get an option to pay $20 for parking or a $25 resort fee. A the Hyatt you are exempt from any fees and you still have access to the regency club with continental bkfst, appetizers in the afternoon and desserts and after dinner drinks in the evening. Guess where Ill be staying next time? By the way the Marriott now has a Starbucks in the lobby but don't bother. We gave them several tries in the mornings but they never had bagels, yogurt parfaits, etc. They seemed to have more items that cater to lunch rather than breakfast. Just drive to Kihei (10 minutes) to a true Starbucks and you'll find what you are looking for. The best thing the Marriott has going is the location. There are some great restaurants such as Cuatro or Bistro 808 located just 10 minutes away.

But the kids pool area and the service was more of a 3 star. The pools are all pretty separated from each other. The kids pool is more like a small waterpark for the kids. They do have 2 really cool big slides that my older one loved. The kids of course wanted to play in the kids pool, so the adults are stuck around the 1 and 1/2 foot pool area. There is no pool side service in the kids pool. There is a separate pool up from the kids pool but the snack bar was closed the whole week we were there. I am not sure if it was ever open. The kids pool and the slides close at 4:45pm sharp. The service was not that great. We had a problem with our fridge in the room and had to call twice before they did something about it. There are only 2 restaurants. There are also not that many activities for kids. No kids club. They've eliminated the lei greeting upon arrival. I am assuming it's due to the economy.

However after returning I felt compelled to share my experience. First I travel a LOT so I believe I'm pretty discerning (some say a travel bigot...but I won't go that far), but I feel I have a pretty fair perspective to draw from. My family and I just returned from 10 nights at the Marriott in Wailea and we had an AWESOME time. Now we did get upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite in HALE 7 and it was great. Three (yes Three) balconies all ocean front. I could toss a baseball underhanded into the ocean if I wanted. The room itself is fine - nothing super special but a great location, comfortable, clean and the views were spectacular. Our location was close to the beach, close to the shops at Waliea and close to the pools - what more could you want??? I'm not sure how someone could complain about the location, the grounds or the pools. The sunsets from the balconies were awesome as were my sunrise jogs along the path that runs between the resorts. As with Maui, everything is expensive - drinks and food by the pool was fine - expensive but again, you're in Maui. I can't comment on the value of the resort itself as I used Marriot rewards points for our entire stay (I did say I travel a lot, right?). The resort fee is pretty standard today and I guess our timing was perfect as we had no problem with parking like others apparently have. The hotel staff couldn't have been more helpful or more friendly including the folks at check-in; the gentlemen who handled our luggage; the wonderful waitresses at the pool along with the lovely lady who serviced our room. Particularly noteworthy was the concierge (Sarah) who bent over backwards helping us plan our time there - and she was spot on. For those golfers reading this - I played the Plantation course at Kapalua and the Gold course at Wailea. Both had million dollar views, were player friendly, was first class and a great time. My only complaint is they're putting in an irrigation system at Kapaula so it wasn't in very good shape. Next time I'll definitely play the Wailea courses as they are on par (no pun intended) with any I've played. Overall, we love the Wailea area. The shops at Wailea were very convenient for shopping or eating, most nights we just walked to dinner. The beaches, grounds and people all met or exceeded our expectations and this will definitely be one of our first options upon returning.", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "goddess2230", "ReviewID": "UR69232837", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon in June 2010 for a week. For a highly rated resort, it was not worth the price. It took us three times to check in and get our room, the first time it wasn't ready. The next try we were put in a ground floor room right outside the pool. When you're on your honeymoon, a little privacy is expected and we didn't appreciate anyone at the pool being able to walk onto our patio. We finally got a room on try #3, but it was nothing extraordinary and somewhat dated. We were given a room upgrade from city to partial ocean view, which seemed like a nice gesture at the time. However, we were redeeming a night of our stay with Marriott points and were charged more points for the room. The staff at the hotel were not the friendliest people by any means and most of them seemed unhappy, which projected when interacting with them. They are at a complete disconnect with the people at the Marriott Rewards department so they will both tell you conflicting things until you become irritated and waste your vacation trying to sort it out for a few hours. For a widely known hotel chain, they should get their act together on this. Our biggest complaint overall was feeling nickel and dimed for everything at the hotel. They picture comfy lounge chairs and cabanas near the pools in their promotional pictures, but even though you pay a resort fee of $25 per day plus tax, you still had to pay extra to rent the chairs if you wanted to use them. The regular chairs didn't even have cushions on them by the pools, which is a pretty standard thing. And when ordering a drink at Ruth's Chris is cheaper than the hotel, you know something is wrong. Also, there is no ocean front at the hotel, it is either to the left or to the right of the hotel in front of other hotels/condos. Want a beach chair instead of laying on the sand? Yep, you're paying again to rent it from another hotel. The location is nowhere near markets or restaurants too, so best to rent a car. Overall, its a decent place, nothing spectacular.

They have nickeled and dimed us from the moment we stepped onto the resort. In addition, the hotel isn't even on the beach and the pools are sub par. The serenity pool is nice but that gets old after a while. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU HAVE KIDS! The nicest pool only allows guest 18 and up. The other pools are small and dated. The kids pool is cute but small. We also had a couples message which we spent $400 on, thinking it was a 75 minute message. No... actually it was a 45 minute message with 30 minutes of sitting in a bath tub (which we could have done for free in our room). On top of that, they charged us 20% gratuity and an extra $20 because we upgraded our message oil. We had the choice of choosing the house oils, which all smelled terrible, or spending extra to get a better smelling oil. You would think when you spend $400 on a 45 minute message, everything would be included. Then upon paying for the message, they told us if we wanted to leave additional gratuity, we could do so. I had to laugh at that one! The restaurants were way over priced, the luau was overpriced, internet was not free, even the upgrade for a ocean view room was overpriced. FYI on the luau, if you get premium seating, you will be one of about half the other people attending the luau, don't waste your money.

The bell staff was very welcoming and held our luggage while we self-parked the car and checked-in. The front desk staff were very friendly and explained everything to us and showed us a map of the grounds to get us situated. The bellman who helped us to our room was very informative, giving us information about the hotel, restaurants, and the Wailea area in general. I was a little concerned from reading other reviews about the mandatory resort fee, however, we were asked if we wanted to add this fee on to the already $20 Self-Parking fee to include some extra perks. The resort fee was only an extra $5 more and we received 2 free drinks at the Kumu Bar & Grill or 2 drinks at Starbucks. Now already that's a savings because 1 Mai Tai at the bar is $11!! So 1 drink equated to 2 days of the resort fee! We also recieved 20% off at the Mala restaruant where we dined twice and had the most wonderful waiter, thanks Kimo! He was awesome. We also received a discount at the Spa and several other perks that we did not use such as a discount on snorkel equiptment rental. There was also a 1 litter bottle of water delievered to our room each day, which was nice because it was very hot! Our room was great, we had an Ocean View, so it was not direct, however there were only a few palm trees in our way, which I think enhanced the view of the ocean and the West Maui mountains. Our Hale (building) was situated between the adults only infinity pool and the two general pools, also where the Kumu Bar & Grill is located. For you beach lovers, the hotel is situated between two beautiful beaches. One on each side of the property, just a short walk. We like to look at the beach and maybe take a walk on it, but I'm not a huge fan of sand, so we mostly stuck with the pools. They were never crowded, you could always get a chair and of course at the pools there was food and drink service. All of the pools were nice, but the adult only infinity pool was beautiful. Wailea seems to be a less crowded in general and a bit less touristy than the Lahaina /Kaanapali Area. We appreciated the more serene feeling we had in this area of the island. Plus the views from the lush hotel grounds were spectacular. We had views of west Maui, the island of Lanai and the crater Molikini, which is a popular snorkel spot. There were many restaurants in the area to choose from and like another reviewer mentioned it is close to Kihei, which has a ton of shopping and restaurants at every price point. Plus, the Mala restaurant at this hotel is wonderful and of course the other resorts just up the beach path have several restaruants to choose from as well. We did use Marriott rewards points for our stay, but did pay for the upgrade to ocean view. We did feel that if we had paid full price for our stay that it would have been well worth the price.

Our only complaint is the rooms. If you are looking for plush or fancy, these are not the rooms for you. We stayed in a Deluxe Oceanfront Room, and while the view was wonderful, the room left much to be desired. The tile floors are cold and hard - carpet would have been nice. The beds are comfortable, but the linens are not soft. The bathroom is tiny!! Hard marble tub/shower combo that is so tall you whack your knees on it each time you get in. The concierge is not the best, either - they seemed bothered by requests for restaurant suggestions. The poolside restaurant/bar staff are great - Terry by the pool is a fantastic waitress!! Food is overpriced, but good. I would say that the hotel is very nice, in a great area, but the rooms are not up to Marriott standards. If you want luxury, you need to stay down the road just a bit at the Grand Wailea. We enjoyed our stay here and loved the pool and grounds, but it would be nice if the rooms were are nice as the rest of the property. I would recommend this hotel, but go into it knowing that the rooms are not the nicest. We did ask to see the \"suites\" for a possible upgrade, but once we toured them, we realized that it was not worth the extra $$$ because the suites were not much nicer than the regular Deluxe rooms. We had breakfast included in our package - make sure you do this - the buffet is $50 for 2 people if it's not included in your room! Only 2 restaurants on the property - the poolside bar/grill and the MaLa restaurant. Wish there had been more options. The Deluxe oceanfront rooms have the best views - fantastic and close to the beach. Just make sure to ask for a 3rd floor room!

There is a path that from the the hotel that goes for 2 miles, which takes you to other luxurious resorts such as Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, and Fairmont. We made a bid on Priceline and got a pretty good deal. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to ocean front for an additional $75 a night. The Ocean front rooms on the ground floor are optimal with a small baby because you can leave the hotel room through the balcony door (without waking a sleeping baby!) The ocean is literally within walking distance (takes about 1 minute to WALK there). We were located right in front of the luau area, and a short distance to their baby pool. The baby pool is wonderful! Shallow water, with a TON of stimulating activity for your little ones. There is also an \"adult\" infinity pool - gorgeous views! Even though it's not as glam as the Four Seasons or the Grand Wailea, this hotel is actually the closest you can get to the beach, and in my opinion, the best hotel to stay if you have little ones. There is a lot to do, including fish-feeding, arts and crafts, luau, etc. (The LUAU here was great, btw! Food and entertainment were awesome). The food here is a bit pricey, but expected for an all-inclusive resort. We ended up eating a lot at the Shops at Wailea (again, walking distance). The Tommy Bahamas Cafe there has the BEST food and great happy hour drinks. There is a Hertz on-site - great for rentals for trips to Lahaina and the Aquarium, etc. Oh one thing - the Wi-Fi sucks here, so just leave your laptop at home. Enjoy your vacation!

The hotel is right on the water too - you get better waterfront access than the other higher-priced hotels in the same area. Seriously - the lounge chairs are set up right on the absolute EDGE! It doesn't get closer than that- not at the Ritz, not at the Four Seasons. The snorkeling is outstanding - I saw plenty of fish, coral sponges and even turtles every time I went, right off the hotel. There is a shopping mall right next door, again, a VERY short walk away. We have a 9 month old baby, so we got a suite, and that was a life-saver, because we could put him to bed, then still be up and eat dinner and talk and stuff in the other room.

Our room was beautiful - understated designs and a comfortable big bed, flat screen TV, which we hardly turned on, and very nice sheets and towels. Nice big bathroom with a marble tub and separate shower, and an extra half bath. For the money, this hotel is definitely a gem!

We always stay in Kaanapali, so this was new for us. A GREAT new! Wailea is very calm and relaxing with not much to do, which is what we love. Check in was fast and easy. When we pulled up, we were mauled by bell boys, who were either very friendly and helpful, or all wanting tips, not too sure. Either way, nice. Our room was in the tower to the right, Haleakale, floor 3. We won our stay on priceline, so we weren't surprised to have a view to the back of the hotel where deliveries are done and staff goes to work through there. If you leaned, you could see the ocean, and definently hear it. If this is the worst set of rooms, there aren't any bad rooms! The room itself was pretty spacious, king bed and sleeper couch. Loved that the toilet and shower were separate from the vanity, which had drawers! So nice to kinda feel at home, putting stuff away. Stock up your fridge from Costco and Walmart by the airport and save BIG BUCKS! And the beds...if I could pack that up and bring it home! Wow...you will sleep well. The facility was very nice. All open air, friendly, friendly staff who always say hello and good morning and go out of their way to let you step by, use the elevator. We even had a few ask if it was okay if they rode with us on the elevator! It is VERY spread out, so you'll get your walking done for the day! The pools are amazing. We would play at the beach in the morning, then go to the lower pool for awhile, then to the kid area. The lower pool, which has a lip around the outer ledge of the pool that my 5 year old loved to walk around on, has a serenity pool side, and 2 hot tubs. The upper pool is deeper, and a plain normal pool. The adult only pool is amazing looking, but being we have 2 young kids, didn't get to use that. We did, however, walk through to get to the kid area, only to get scowls and glares from the other guests because we had our very well mannered/quiet children with us to walk through...we are paying guests too. Get real. The kid's area was AMAZING! It kept our kids busy for hours each day! The sand/rocks aren't too hard on the feet, as I've previously read. The kids have fun rolling on the 'beach' and then jumping in the water. There is a hot tub there also. And then the 3 slides which were actually VERY fun. And above the kid's area is yet ANOTHER kind of forgotten pool that not many use - it is also a deep pool, just for swimming. And I will tell you, there will never ever be a shortage of pool chairs at all of these pools. The kid's area has the least of chairs offered, so you may not get one there, but you could with the upper area, and still use the kid's area. This hotel is not beach accessible, but to the right, you can walk, 2 minutes to the beach. To the left, Grand Wailea Hotel, is a 5 minute walk to the beach. The right beach has crabs, which didn't bother us, but they are there, and harmless. The other beach, to the left is pretty packed during the day. An amazing place to eat is Mixed Plate next to the Old Lahaina Luau - whole plates of food for $7! Great, honest, original Hawaiian food...yum! We never ate at the hotel, so no comments there.

The hotel is conveniently located across from the Shops at Wailea with a wide range of boutiques, restaurants and a place for groceries and sundries. Our favorite aspect of the Marriott Wailea was the hotel restaurant, Mala. We did the breakfast buffet most morning, and while delicious, Mala always surprised with amazing dinners. The restaurant manager, Mary Anne, was absolutely fantastic--always attentive to all of the tables, surprising guests with special treats from the chef, and incredibly knowledgable about the impressive wine selection. We ate two dinners elsewhere at more expensive resorts nearby, butthe food at Mala was far superior!

I have been to Wailea before and I think it combines the best of all elements - nice beaches, shops if you want them, easy access to Kihei for groceries, restaurants, shops etc. Some of the other reviews seem to have overly petty criticisms. The Shops At Wailea next door is a very nice mall with high end boutiques, to trendy t-shirt shops, to a good general store where you can buy sandwiches and drinks. I don't know why people complain about it, as it's a benefit to have it within 2 minutes walking distance from the hotel. The hotel itself is very large and as Marriott's go it is one of the nicest ones that I have ever stayed at (I travel extensively on a global basis). If you are looking for over-the-top service then you should stay at a Ritz or Four Seasons, but if you are looking for a world-class resort with plenty of pools (5 of them) and a great kids pool area with two really good water slides, then this is a great choice. The views from the resort out over the ocean are remarkable at any time of day or night. The two beaches, one to the left and one to the right, are very nice and the walk from the hotel to either of them is 2 minutes, whereas the walk from the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea (next door) is about the same as these properties are set back from the ocean anyhow. The spa and gym are both very good by hotel standards. Parking is $20 per day, but I consider this reasonable given that you are going to pay to park directly or indirectly and for those that feel that they are being nickel and dimed, then you are probably over your budget or you should go for it and use priceline.com and feel good about whatever you score. My kids had plenty to do - swiming in the pools, on the water slides constantly, in the ocean, necklace and lei making classes etc. For grown ups if you want to bring you own sandwiches and cocktails then you can go next door to the Shops at Wailea and buy what you want and bring it poolside and avoid the pricey menu / drink list.

I highly recommend upgrading to ocean view and asking for this building, especially if you don't have kids with you. It overlooks the adult pool and the ocean and the view is spectacular. We watched whales and sunsets from our lanai. The only thing we didn't like about the room is that it was a handicap room, and the shower was very low and handheld. My sister is tall, and had some difficulty with it. The adult pool is wonderful. We did cancell our floating cabana reservation after sitting on the lounges,they're really hard. The egg shaped lounges are very comfortable and hold 2 people, and only cost $25 per day. The pool staff does a pretty good job of enforcing the adults only rule. It amazed me how many people would stop to read the rules, then still try to settle in with toddlers and infants. There is a really nice pool for younger children on the property, so there is no excuse. There isn't a hot tub at the adult pool, but there are 2 at the main pool. The pool service is good, and staff really friendly. There are a lot of charges such as resort fees. The fee includes parking, so there isn't a separate fee for that. Parking does get a little tight when the hotel is full. But if the self park is full, the valets just let you park yourself in the valet area for no charge. Be aware that the hotel charges a daily $3 fee for housekeeping gratuity. We always leave money every day for the cleaning staff, so this was unexpected. I called to ask about it, and the front desk staff offered to take it off the bill. There is also an automatic porter fee, so use them. We didn't know and the porter actually tried to turn down our tip. One negative is that not all the buildings have elevator service to the uppermost floors. There is an elevator in Hale 4 and in the newer taller tower. If you don't want to walk steps all the time, let the concierge know that you need elevator access. Getting to the beaches was easy. There is good snorkeling at either end. There is a little coffee place on the Grand Wailea end with good coffee,smoothies and breakfast sandwiches. There are some really attractive home decor items in the gift shop. Other posters have compared the Marriott negatively to the Grand Wailea. I was so glad we weren't staying there. Both hotels were full for spring break, and when I walked by the Grand Wailea many mornings at 6 am, there were people already lined up to get a beach chair when they pools opened at 7:30.

The Marriott is smaller than some of the other Wailea resorts and never felt crowded. You're a quick walk away from the restaurants and shopping at the Shops at Wailea as well as the other resorts in the area. Like all the other resorts, there's a daily 'resort fee' - the Marriott's is $25/day and covers your parking and a liter of bottled water in your room each day. Not sure why they don't all just roll it into the room rate and be done with it, but that's the way they all seem to do it. Room: We had an oceanfront room (7302) that looked out over the lawn between two other 'wings' of the buildings. Because of the location, it was very quiet and we had a wonderful view of the ocean both from our lanai and in the room. If you had kids, the kids pool was just outside our building, but on the other side so it would be convenient without getting all the noise. The room itself was very nice. It may sound a little odd, but one of my favorite things was the bathroom vanity. Like in many hotels, the toilet and bathtub were in a separate room and the vanity itself was basically in the hotel room. But the way the room was set up, the bathroom and closet were inbetween the beds and the vanity area so it was like having a dressing area that gave a little more privacy. But the absolute BEST thing was that the vanity was a freestanding piece of furniture and had two deep drawers - one on either side of the sink. For 2 women traveling together, it was great for each of us to have a space to stash all of our toiletries, cosmetics, etc. instead of having everything all over the countertop. Pool: The infinity pool (for adults only) was fabulous. All of the lounge chairs face the ocean and you look out over the edge of the pool which just seems to run into the ocean and listen to the sound of the waves. We were always able to get a chair no matter when we went to the pool. There's an oceanfront path that we walked on in the morning and when we'd go past the Grand Wailea at 7am, it seemed like 90% of the chairs already had towels on them with people staking out their chairs. At the Marriott, if there are towels on a chair but no one's been there for 30 minutes or more and someone is looking for a chair, the staff will remove the towels and tell you to take the chair. Marriott Restaurant - Mala: We had sandwiches and snacks poolside several times from the Kula Grill, but only ate at the hotel restaurant the first night I got there - not because of any issue with the food but because there are too many other restaurants in the area to try. Unless your room rate includes breakfast, you're not going to want to eat at the hotel restaurant for breakfast - you'll be looking at $20+ per person. There was a restaurant over in the Shops at Wailea that's only a 5 minute walk away (might have been Cheeseburger in Paradise) that had a reasonable priced breakfast (around $6 or $7), but we just bought cereal, milk, bagels and cream cheese and ate breakfast out on our lanai each morning (there's a small refrigerator in the room). Parking: There is self-parking available in a parking garage (the daily rate of $20 is included in your resort fee). In other reviews of various hotels I saw that a number of people commented on how small parking spaces were ... they're not kidding. The spaces are really narrow and as a result, if one person doesn't park perfectly, you end up with spots that can't be used. One day we went to our car to find someone had parked so close to us that I couldn't get in the driver's side door - I had to get in on the passenger side and climb over the center console to get behind the wheel! A few nights we got back later in the evening to find the structure was full - they then allow you to park in the area normally reserved for valet parking (valet parking is available for an additional $25/day). Spa: They have a spa on the property - rather pricey, but in line with spas at other resorts in the area. Could probably find bettter prices in Kihei or Lahaina. They were offering a discounted price for a massage and facial that we took advantage of. Had an amazing massage with Mike - wasn't as impressed with the facial I had (can't remember her name). Other restaurants: We had several great dinners while we were there: Tommy Bahama's (at the Shops in Wailea), Joe's (next to the Wailea tennis courts), Hali'imaile General Store (off Haleakala Highway on the way to Makawao), Humuhumunukunukuapua'a (at the Grand Wailea), and Capishe? (at the Hotel Wailea). If you're up on the north shore near Paia, I'd highly recommend stopping at Flatbread for either lunch or dinner. As usual, the trip was over entirely too soon - can't wait for the next trip back!

We usually stay in Kaanapali, this time we decided to stay in Wailea because of a wedding. It took us a day to get used to the absolute quiet of this side of the island. Now we aren't sure we want to return to Kaanapali! We checked in early and were assigned a tower room above the lobby. The room was spacious and clean, however, no view and very loud with arriving guests. I asked politely if we could be moved to a more quiet area. Fortunately, they had a room that would be available in a couple of hours that was very far from the lobby. This was what we were looking for! Being far away from the lobby and parking lot was perfect for us. A bellman drove us to our room in a golf cart. Pointing out various sites along the way. The childrens pool was teaming with children, it was spring break for some. We ended up in a far away \"hale\", a building 2-3 stories high, near the adults only infinity pool. Our room looked out on the resort grassy lawn, the trees, and the ocean. We had a room on the ground floor with a nice lanai, with 2 chairs and a table, where we had coffee every morning. There is a coffee maker in the room. 4 packets of coffee are restocked daily. There is also a mini refridgerator where you can store fruit, water, milk, wine, beer, etc. Right behind the Marriott is a mall, where you can buy what you need for drinks and snacks. There are also many high end shops located there, as well as a few dining options. There is a path along the water's edge, we went walking every morning. You will see all kinds of people doing this, serious joggers, sightseers, people pushing baby strollers and folks like us, going for a brisk morning walk. The path is about 2 miles along the beach. This is one of the most relaxing vacations we had. Although we were in Wailea for a wedding, we had a few days to sit by the waters edge, read a book, take a nap, or look through our binoculars for whales spouting off in the distance. We saw large sea turtle grazing on the lava rocks right in front of us. There are 2 beaches on both sides of the hotel, none right in front. It is very close to walk to either of these beaches. We preferred the grassy lawn outside our room. The sunsets are spectacular. There is a $20 daily fee for self parking your car in a small parking lot, with even smaller parking spaces! Watch out if you rent a large car, or better yet, have the valet park it for you, they have larger spaces! Internet connection in the room is around $15 per 24 hours. We used it twice. I would return to this hotel in a minute. The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable, the setting amazing.

We used Marriott points for our stay and paid an extra $175 a night for the ocean view upgrade. We loved our room location in the Haleakala Tower (room 508) right near the lobby. Tile floors- no carpetting. Low beds, almost too soft. Our view was over the next door condos and nearby beach. (see photos) Nice room set up with storage in the vanity area so you don't have to leave stuff piled next to the sink. We could not see the sunset from our room, but enjoyed them from the hotel bar/restaurant. They have 4 pools to choose from, 3 adult and 1 kid pool with slides, etc. We spent early morning in the sun and went sightseeing the rest of the day, so it was never crowded. You may want to keep your towel from the day before and put it on a chair with a book to reserve it early the following am. There were always empty chairs available when we were there. The beach is adjacent to the property with a reef if you like to snorkel. If you like to walk, there is a terrific public ocean walkway in front of all the resorts that is almost 2 miles long. It sometimes gets a bit busy mid morning, You may want to bring a flashlight at night. We ate at the main restaurant several times and was never disappointed. They serve a great Kobe Burger, that is really reasonable. My husband loved the lamb. There are 4 great restaurants in the Shops of Wailea- a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Hamburgers in Paradise serves a great $5.99 breakfast! There is also a General Store in the shops with a Deli, soda, etc. but expensive. Even has a Red Box DVD rental. If you have a car it is worth the trip to the Safeway, less than a 10 min. drive off the main highway and Pi'Ikea road. There are empty refrigerators you can use in every room. We brought our Garmin GPS with us and used it a lot! We were also glad we rented a smaller SUV because the parking spaces were so small. If you want a lei- sign up for the free lei-making class right when you check in. It fills up fast. This was a perfect location and always sunny even with rain in the forecast. You can take boat trips out of Ma'alaea Harbor. We recommend the catamaran \" Alii Nui\" for a snorkel or sunset cruise. Book it yourself and save the concierge extra fee. This is more expensive than the Eco tours but it is a much newer boat and you don't have to stay in your seat. Compare boats online. We actually spent the first 5 days here and the next 5 days at the Grand Wailea right down the road.

I too would have preferred the $25/day resort fee to be included but we knew it was coming so weren't that upset about it. Again I find having to pay for internet access in hotels in this day & age a bit of a shocker so I didn't bother doing it. Overall the rooms were very clean, spacious and quite likely the most comfy I've had in a hotel in years. We overlooked the adult only infinity pool with an ocean view room. It was quite and the view was nice. I didn't spend much time at the adult pool but the one afternoon I did was very good. Can't complain about the waitress service and the 2 Corona's for $12.50.

I would disagee with most posters of the expenses & nickle & diming. Other than breakfast, I found the drinks and dinners were no more than what I have to pay living in Calgary. The other thing to keep in mind is this is a \"high end\" resort in the ritziest area of the island - they charge for services accordingly as most hotels do. Staff was friendly & very efficient in a hotel of almost 600 rooms. They weren't intrusive but when we asked for help they were exceptional. The only real negative I see with this property is you have to walk to another hotel or condo complex on either side of the Marriott to get to a beach but the walk is only 5-10 minutes with a toddler - less if I was on my own.

Wailea is our favorite area to stay in Maui because of the better chance of sunshine when other parts of the island are getting rain. The scenery is breathtaking and there is plenty to do without ever leaving Wailea if you are so-inclined. (However, the whole island is worth seeing at least once.) We used to stay at the Renaissance, but since it is now closed we had to look elsewhere. We always enjoy Marriott hotels, so this time we tried Wailea Beach Marriott Resort and Spa and were NOT disappointed! We had always been hesitant to stay there because it did not have a beach fronting the property, but we found out that it was no big deal to walk a block or two in either direction for some fantastic beaches! (We also like to visit Big Beach, which is only about a mile's drive south of Wailea.) The pools were fabulous, especially the new infinity pool. We enjoyed walking up to the edge of it and watching for whales out in the ocean! The location for us was perfect. We could walk to the Shops at Wailea (just behind this hotel) and eat and shop to our heart's content. Also, the Maalea Harbor is close-by to catch a boat for snorkeling or whale-watching. Marriott always has excellent service, in our opinion, and this hotel was no exception.

It used to be an Outrigger and was built prior to restrictions on proximity to the \"beach.\" Some rooms are within 60 feet of the ocean. There is no beach here, but there are two on either side within a 5 minute walk along the ocean walkway that links all the Wailea resorts. Rooms are very nice and housekeeping is excellent. The best feature we found is the infinity pool. Just veg out there all day. No children under 18 are allowed --- they have there own pools. Anita or Susan (your're gonna get a hug) will start coming by at 10:30 for drink orders and they will also bring you lunch from the nearby Kumu grill. You can rent a cabana (they have 6) for a full ($100) or half day. These desparately need new THICKER cushiors for their wooden recliners which become very hard on the backside after only a short time. If you don't do the cabana there are many regular chairs, some with umbrella shade, that are first come first serve. These are spoken for by about 9:30. Additionally there are several lounges-for-two for $25. Get the resort pass which gets you free self parking, bottled water, and some discounts (although you don't come here to save money). Finding the place can be a little tricky to the new visitor. Take the 31 highway all the way down to Wailea until it ends at a right 90 degree bend. Go all the way down to the left-or-right traffic light. Go right but don't turn at the first chance. That's the Wailea shops. The next left is Marriott and the sign doesn't jump out at you. The hotel restaurant is very good, and there are many good places to eat in the area. Our favorites were Nick's at the Fairmont and Gannon's (formerly SeaWatch) on the gold golf course. A Starbuck's is coming to the hotel proper, but there is a little ocean walk shack that does some Starbuck's basics on the south end of the property. It's a hike for most island activities. Most of them originate out of Lahaina or Kaanapali area on the upper west side. Lahaina traffic is a nightmare and will take you an hour from the Marriott to get through to Kaanapali. If your tour runs out of Kaanapali park in the Whalers Village facility off Kaanapali Parkway and get your ticket validated at any shop or restaurant (Hula Girl is good).

We found out later it was probably due to the fact that there were a couple weddings and a big conference going on that weekend. We checked in a little before 3pm and it took forever to even find our room! The whole design of the different Hales in this place is so crazy that we had to ask several different people how to find ou room. It just didn't make sense, but after about 10 minutes of walking up and down stairs, rolling our luggage everywhere, we finally found it. I had called to request a king bed but we find out that not only did they give us two queen beds but they gave us a handicapped room! That means it's a low shower head and my 6'2 husband literally had to get on his knees to wash his hair every morning. We asked the front desk for a king bed and they said they were totally booked up and could put us on a waiting list. We checked in before the standard check-in time! Did they not have any available king beds for anyone who checked in that day? Also, our TV wasn't even working properly. Sure, we don't go to Hawaii to watch TV but at night, we did watch TV only to find out that every 15 minutes, the station would automatically switch to their menu of Pay-Per-View movies available for purchase. Sooooo annoying... It's disappointing that after paying so much at this place, the Wailea Marriott doesn't even have their own beach! We had to walk to the Grand Wailea, where we were told that we couldn't have any chairs and to rent an umbrella it would be $20. We just hung out at the pool back at the Marriott intsead. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants on site because after spending $51 for some greasy nachos, a basket of sweet potato fries and two alcoholic drinks (which were so weak, that they might as well have been $11 smoothies) at the pool, we were done eating at the Marriott. The service at this place was not up to par with a resort. My husband asked the \"pool concierge\" if they rented goggles and he was answered with a short \"no\". You would think the \"pool concierge\" would've been able to direct my husband to a place he could've rented goggles. That's not going above and beyond. The waitress at the Infinity Pool was very nice and friendly but the Front Desk was borderline annoying. Whenever I called to ask something, they asked for my room number, looked it up in their system and always started with \"oh, you're Priceline. Hold on\". We were treated like second class people because we booked our hotel through Priceline. You would think they'd treat us all the same since we're STILL a paying customer and I'm sure they're making major profit off each guest! We used the spa just for the steam room and I was disappointed to find that they didn't even have a sauna or some whirlpools! Luckily we were able to bypass the $25/night resort fee, since they asked us at check-in, but we ended up paying the $15/night fee for self-parking anyways. What a rip!

The Fairmont had better service, gorgeous suites, housekeeping at the Fairmont moved furniture to vacuum & twice thanked us for their tips, the ambience is luxurious/ welcoming, CLEAN, hospitable, the buffet was terrific value! But the nicest beach for swimming & strolling is still Kaanaapali beach where we stayed on a prior visit. Letters/e-mails to the GM of the Wailea Marriott for which no reply was ever received during our stay (got a call from a Front Desk Manager 2 days AFTER checkout!): Dear Mr. Countryman/ Mr. Kenui & Ms. Cortez, After Michelle, Housekeeping Manager, had our room cleaned thoroughly yesterday, I opened a night table drawer this morning only to find a one-inch long, live cockroach running around in it!!! This is in addition to the ones we left for you last Friday!

You may not have received our earlier e-mail below because Michelle in Housekeeping gave us the wrong e-mail address. Further to my husband's note to you the other day with the \"unauthorized\" room guests (2 small cockroaches caught after housekeeping had supposedly cleaned our room on Jan.14/10), I want to make you aware of other issues that we feel are not appropriate for a 4-star hotel such as yours, @ the price we are paying per night for a suite + 1 room: 1) Day 1: Requested extra clean, oceanfront room on top floor. Only got a very dusty room with sticky floor areas, patio doors that have animal feces residue dried on the inside! We requested that housekeeping damp wipe all tabletops, vacuum floors & wash tile floors with bleach since I found sticky residue on the kids' bathroom floor the night we arrived. They took the $5. tip I left them but only did the bare minimum: beds, fresh towels. 2) We find this location extremely noisy due to all the service vehicles coming in/out of the service bays below. 3) Jan. 15/10: found a live silverfish @ 4 pm in our ensuite bath. Found another crawling bug on our bed. Once again after housekeeping had supposedly cleaned. 4) Day 3, Jan.15/10: left another tip, asked housekeeping to damp wipe tabletops/ bath countertops, vacuum floors & mop tiles with bleach/ soap/ water solution (sticky residue was still on kids' bath floor since check-in). Once again, they took the tip & did not do as I requested. I finally took a facecloth & soap & washed all the tabletops & bath counters myself. Had to dust TV's, lamps, etc. myself. They also did not clean the kids' bathtub which had sand in it still. 5) Jan.15/10 turndown service was missed on kids' room # 530. They do sooo little around here! 6) At every buffet we've been to here, staff start closing up 30 min. Before the buffet's scheduled end time! 7) Breakfast buffet is so mediocre. Rubber eggs. 8) Our kids got scrapes on their noses, arms & legs from rubbing against the rough walls & floors of the pools! 9) Ear infections -- all 3 kids got ear infections. Are they not using enough 'chlorine' (for a saltwater pool)? We were staying @ the Fairmont Kea Lani for 5 nights prior to coming here for a conference & the Fairmont room/ service/ food/ ambience was heaven. For only $396./ night, all 5 of us were very comfortable in a deluxe oceanview top floor, with only 1 luxurious extra large bath & 28 s.f. shower, double-sinks, fantastic housekeeping staff who vacuumed daily (even moving furniture to do so), cleaned bathroom thoroughly, helpful, personable staff all over armed with a \"can-do\" attitude, anticipating your needs before u have to ask (like true hosts would), impeccably manicured clean grounds, a very comfortable atmosphere. Here @ the Marriott we are paying 75% more & getting much less: minimal housekeeping service, no beach, only 1 mediocre restaurant, dirty floors even in the restaurant, live bugs in our room daily, self-clean your own room, insufficient fresh towels. It's no wonder my husband prefers staying @ Fairmont properties. If you want to be competitive, stay @ the competition's properties, then stay @ yours. Even our children have been asking to return to the Fairmont or switch to the Hyatt @ Kaanaapali beach for the rest of our stay in Maui.

Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "SterlingLatte", "ReviewID": "UR56936333", "Content": "Stayed at this Marriott for the first time 1/27-2/2/10. Absolutely awesome location. Didn't rent a car this time, just stayed at the hotel because we had points. Room was clean and we had a great view. The pools are nice and the 5 minute walk to the Shops At Wailea is the best. We had every intention to enjoy the restaurants at the hotel. However, upon our first morning walk to the little coffee shack for some Starbucks we got hit with a bowel moving $4.00 a cup drip coffee. Are you kidding? At the pool, we sat on a comfy wicker poolside lounge only to be told those are rented for $25.00. Uh Oh, the nickel and diming starts. We never ate at the restaurant or ordered room service. The bedding wasn't as good as the basic Marriott, Courtyard or Residence Inn. The Wicker furniture in the room isn't very comfortable. If you enjoy relaxing on the standard Courtyard or Residence Inn couch, don't expect that here. But hey, go out and enjoy the view, ocean, grassy areas and whale watching. Or walk to the Grand Wailea for a good dinner and great lobby. The rest of the hotel is very plain, nothing really special, which is why it feels like a Courtyard or Fairfield Inn. Parking valets are about the only staff you see. We called to get a few extra towels and got nothing. So I walked to the front desk and was told they were very busy and it will be there shortly. No smile and no \"I'm sorry\". 1 hour from the first phone call the towels arrived. Stay at the hotel for the location and view. You will love it, but don't expect much more. Plan to walk 5 minutes to the Shops At Wailea and enjoy happy hour at Tommy Bahama's. Stock up on food/drinks at the Whaler Market. Great sandwiches, breakfast, beer, wine, bottled water. Everything you need at a fraction of the price. Good large coffee for $1.50. Hotels should really carefully pick and choose how they nickel and dime the guests. $4.00 for a drip coffee is a really bad way to start out. That is in such poor taste that we never looked twice at the other food options at the hotel. Lord knows what lunch must cost. Ironically every other Marriott in the system has coffee in the lobby. And the biggest gripe of all: USE FITTED SHEETS!! For Pete's sake, the flat sheets on the bottom DON'T WORK. I stay in Marriott's all the time and they use fitted sheets which stay on the mattress. Every stinking' morning I woke up sleeping on the actual mattress. Does management with their hospitality degrees understand that a flat sheet on the bottom doesn't work? If it did, we would all have flat sheets at home. Sheet sets would come with two flat sheets. Martha Stewart would sell flat sheet sets at Macy's, it would be all the rage. But they don't and there's good reason for this. Stop! Please note we aren't cheap people. Last year we stayed at the Four Seasons Wailea and paid $400 a night. But meals were reasonable. Cabana's were free. Water sport equipment was free and while sitting in the cabana, they came around with ice water, cold slices of fruit and Evian mist. Had we not had the 100,000+ points, we would have gone back to the Four Seasons or Grand. So if your looking for a Fairfield Inn next to the beach with overpriced coffee, this is your place. Work it to your advantage, use the Shops At Wailea and enjoy the Marriott's beautiful location. We had a great time.

The property is absolutely beautiful. Beautiful grounds, beautiful pools, and fantastic staff. There were several beaches within a short walk from the resort, although we spent most of our time at the infinity pool. The rooms are spacious and comfortable - not that you spend much time in them anyway. Our room was oceanview, yet still overlooked where the luau took place several times a week. We had \"happy hour\" on the balcony and took in the sights and sounds of the luau for free. The location is great - just a few minute walk from the Shops, where you can grab an inexpensive and fast lunch at the deli or have your choice of several dinner restaurants. Mala, the restaurant at the resort, was one of the best places we had dinner all week - and not all that much more expensive than other places we visited. That said, we didn't have a bad dinner the entire time we were here (Buzz's Wharf, Cafe Ole and Mulligan's were a few of the places we ate). But be prepared to drop a minimum of $100 a dinner at almost any restaurant you go to (with a drink per person). Our only complaint about the resort were the drink prices at the pool. $13 for a strawberry daquiri seems a little extreme, but we realized that is just the price you pay on this side of the island. If you are looking for a cheaper, hipper experience, I would recommend Lahaina. The restaurants and hotels seem much more reasonable, but you trade off the peace and quiet that Wailea offers. The Grand Wailea next door does have a happy hour from 5-6 pm and has some reasonable drink specials. They also have what looks to be a fabulous spa. We ended up finding a local day spa in Kihei that had prices about 1/3 of the cost of massages at the resort and the experience was just as great (if you are okay with jumping the car to drive to your massage or facial). It was worth the $45/person savings for us. The clientel at the Marriott seemed to be a bit on the older side...if you are looking for people to throw back drinks with at the pool during the day, this is not the place to stay. I'm not sure anywhere in Wailea would give you that experience. All that said, we would still highly recommend this resort if you are looking for a high quality resort at a reasonable price on the side of the island that is a little more low key. We were hoping for something just a little more upbeat and will opt for Lahaina the next time we visit.

The hotel was a little hard to locate in the dark...we did need to phone to make sure we were headed in the right direction and finally found it. The check-in takes place in the open air...very nice touch but it takes an incredibly long time to complete checkin, perhaps because you do receive a more personal-type of service. I had written a letter to the hotel weeks prior to let them know we were celebrating our anniversary with them and I requested a nice room with a view. We were on a Costco pkg and that included a cheaper room. They were very accommodating and upgraded us to a room overlooking the Serenity pool. We were driven via golf cart to the room which was a fun touch! The room was quite large with what looked to be teak wood trim. My only complaint was the tile floor. I realize that it allows you to keep it much cleaner....especially when people are dragging in sand from the outside...but it's tough on the feet. That said, we loved our time in this hotel. Our pkg included the buffet breakfast which would be WAY too expensive to buy on your own each day. We searched for happy hours and found a good one at the Shoppes, next door to the hotel. It was across from Cheeseburger and it was called Longhi's. It has outdoor seating and the happy hour food is very reasonable. The individual pizzas were good as was the fish and chips. We also ate at Ruth's Chris because they have a Prime Time special...3 courses for $39 each if you come in before 6 pm. All that said and done, the serenity pool is gorgeous and the main reason we chose to stay here. The grounds are lovely and truly make you feel relaxed. If you need to hit a Walmart or Costco, they are right in Kahalui, about a 20 minute drive from Wailea...much more accessible than the Ka'anapali or Honokowai areas. Lahaina is as cute as ever but a driving and parking nightmare. Oh, btw, if you have a handicap plaque, you can use it at the hotel to park in their lot....much closer than you would without it.

This past year, we had the opportunity to stay at this property twice and each time had an excellent experience. We'll likely try and fit in another long weekend stay again this year. Location: Located a mere half hour from Kahalui Airport (OGG), the Wailea Marriott offers the BEST value for money in Wailea. I'm a fan of Fairmont, but cannot pass-up the price difference and value offered at the Wailea Marriott. Located on one of the nicest plots of land in Wailea, the Marriott has something for everyone. If you want a quiet experience head to the never-ending, Serenity pool (and make sure to taste a happy-hour drink) or cozy up on one of the dispersed beach chairs along the shoreline. Families can soak in some sun at the main pool or beaches flanking either side of the property, while young ones can splash in the shade at the kids play area and pool. Another huge plus of this hotel is its proximity to the Shops at Wailea--only 2-min walk away. If you don't always feel like eating out, you can grab a coffee and snack in the shops, or a bottle champagne at the ABC store for a sunset toast. Staff: Each time I've deal with housekeeping, concierge, front desk or wait staff, they are very courteous, friendly and helpful. The pool servers are genuine and try to get to know guests. Each time I requested something from housekeeping they would exceed my expectations by bringing 2-3 times what I'd asked for. Note some rooms don't automatically get slippers and dressing gowns, so you have to request these upon arrival. Rooms: The rooms were renovated in the past 3 years, so their design is fresh. One stand-out item is the rooms' size. They are large in comparison with other hotels. Most rooms have full or partial ocean views. The first time we stayed our room did not, but we got the hotel for such a good rate, we didn't even care. Booking the Marriott: Some Marriott hotels can be cheesy, but this one is not. The experience provided by the staff and location in Wailea is unmatched. The reno undertaken a few years helps too. We are not part of Marriott's loyalty program, so we booked the property via priceline. Both times we got an excellent rate which amounted to 1/4 - 1/3 what you'd pay at other hotels in Wailea. Note that if you book via priceline or hotwire, the font desk must ask you whether you want to pay the $20 daily resort fee. If you opt not to and have a car, then parking is $20/day. Restaurants: Getting to and from restaurants in Wailea is simple and most are in walking distance. The Fairmont, Four Seasons, Grand Wailea and Marriott each have nice restaurants. Our faves are humu humu at the Grand Wailea, Ferrero's at the Four Seasons and Seawatch at the Wailea Golf Club (try to crab cakes). Outside of Wailea we like the casual Hula Grill in Ka'anapali and the picturesque Mama's Fish House in Paia.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Wailea\u201d", "Author": "Luv2travel123Usa", "ReviewID": "UR53233154", "Content": "Awesome, A#1 time in Wailea and Marriott is gorgeous.

We were in the Haleakala Hale, which is essentially an 8 story hotel building. Although older, it is in fairly good condition. I thought the bed was very comfortable, complete with lots of pillows. We were using Marriott points acquired via business travel. This location was recently down-graded from level 7 to level 6, which means it requires 30K points per night. We had an excellent ocean view. The location of this resort is truly wonderful; it is between the Wailea and Ulua beaches, 2 of the best in Maui, and very close to other great beaches, accessible along a walking path. The snorkeling was great, and included numerous turtle sightings. The adult-only infinity pool was beautiful and relaxing. The excursions staff (Rick and Sarah) were terrific, very knowledgeable and helpful. We took excursions from Blue Water Rafting (excellent for active types), Atlantis submarines in Lahaina (pretty good), Valley Isle Excursions all-day Hana tour (the best way to see the island), Ekahi tours Sunrise at Haleakala (dress warmly and bring a blanket!). Of course food is expensive, but the on-site grill and restaurant are good, and for variety we went next-store to the 4 seasons (Duo and Ferraros) and the shops at Wailea (Longhi, Tommy Bahamas, Cheeseburgers, Ruth Chris). We didn't bother with a rental car, we just used cabs (Oli's) as necessary and that worked fine. We rented scooters from Island Riders; they are not recommended, in spite of Austin's attempts to salvage their business. Next time we would ask the hotel for a recommendation (we had contacted Island Riders directly).

Things I didn't like: 1) Although right by the ocean you have to walk quite a ways to get to a beach. Before arriving on Maui a 5-10 minute walk to the beach didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like a big deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once we were there it seemed like a bigger deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we only went to the beach once the entire time we were there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we went to lots of other beaches though. 2) The walk to the car was a good 5-10 minutes. This wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like a big deal, but it got annoying by the time we/I walked to the car 4 or so times a day usually carrying something heavy and in a swimsuit and flip-flops. If we would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just hung out at the resort this wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, but we more used it as a pit-stop. (Note: We were in building 6 right by the ocean, our friends were in the tower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they had a 30 second walk to the car but were really far from the ocean - the place is too big to get the best of both worlds.) 3) Spending that much for a hotel automatically makes me enjoy myself less. I just never felt truly at home and relaxed. Maybe part of it was that the white tile floors, etc. felt too hospital like. Maybe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just not into the fancy stuff. For me I was just never quite relaxed here, but that is just a personal preference - the place was just too big, too impersonal, too fancy-schmanzy for my style. 4) The rail on the balcony was just the wrong height so that it blocked the view of the ocean 5) The nickel & dime junk that Marriott and other hotels in that class do is annoying. I don't understand why $60 a night hotels can provide free internet, free parking & free breakfast while expensive charge $25 a day for parking/resort fee and $14 a day for Internet access, etc. I guess at least they lumped the resort fee and parking together into a single fee. Things I liked: But those are my only complaints - there was nothing really wrong with it. It really is a nice place. The ocean view was fantastic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the balcony on our room was great. The lawn with chairs right by the ocean was great. The Wailea location was fantastic especially for snorkeling. The rooms were clean and nice. The bed was very comfortable - as long as you like a soft bed. You can bring sand into the room with reckless abandon and count on housekeeping to magically whisk it away every day. The grounds and building were great. The complimentary pineapple ice water was fantastic. The staff was friendly, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crowded. The pools and hot-tubs were awesome. The check-in/check-out service was great.

The lobby/reception area is all outdoors and gorgeous - what a great welcome to new visitors. We were excited. We were told that they have 22 acres of land and they sure made good use of it. The grounds are landscaped with ponds, trees, flowers...you name it. It is beautiful to walk around and certainly made for weddings. Of course, taking a walk further south through the Grand Wailea or the Fairmont, you'll see they are all large hotels designed for weddings. The rooms/hales are all tied in together and you can get lost, but it's kind of fun. Our room was great - looked onto the adult serenity pool - and had all the amenities we could need. The bed was cozy, the washrooms were great and the help staff were great at keeping it all clean (ie. swept and mopped for the sand we kept bringing in). The only two issues I had was the random millipede that would show up especially since we were on the ground floor and the difficulty we had getting any of our clothes to dry on our patio. Of course both of those issues are due to the dampness that surrounds the area and it probably could have been appeased if we turned on the air conditioning (not something we wanted when the breeze from off the ocean was so refreshing). Even room service was great accommodating a random request of ours to order something off the children's menu even though we had no children. The pools are very pleasant and always staff coming by to wait on you to bring you another of their super strong drinks while you sunbathe. There's a lunch restaurant that is pretty good, a little pricey but should satisfy what you need. There's a dinner restaurant called Mala which was also very good, very pricey. They have a little coffee kiosk where you can get Starbucks coffee and pastries. My problem with the food was being locked into the hotel options because we had no car (and we were not aware of the shopping mall just next door until our last day there). We woke up one day late and wanted breakfast from room service because the coffee kiosk closed at 10:30am. We called room service at 11am and couldn't get anymore breakfast because they stopped that right at 11am. Starved, we still had to wait for the lunch restaurant by one of the pools to open because 11am was too early for us to get lunch-type food. It was truly frustrating so we grabbed a taxi that evening into Wailea town and picked up food from the Foodland store for our next few breakfasts/snacks. The gym was nice - completely up to par for what we needed (weight-lifting-wise, and we are heavy into weightlifting - it was far too hot for us to manage any cardio). The activities staff guys were great and helpful with tips we needed for snorkelling. The Marriott is located right in what they call Turtle Town. The coral reef right in front of the hotel is where many turtles come every morning to feed and snorkelling at 9am definitely gave us a great show of five turtles, lots of fish (the florescent kind), rays and sea snakes. There were a couple of hammocks on the property that I only took advantage of once, but nice that they are there. There is a luau on four nights a week, but it's a ghastly $94 per person ($104 if you want to reserve a seat!) to attend for all you can eat/drink plus show. Neither of us could possible consume enough food or drink to satisfy that price from our wallets - taking a cab into town and having dinner was less. The only thing that really bothered me with this hotel was the resort fee card. You have to pay a $25/day resort fee on top of your room and taxes. We received a message in our room from the concierge the first day that we had a package to pick up from them - a welcome package. Well, in all our enjoyment, we did not pick it up until halfway through our stay. There was a \"passport\" in there that would give us discounts on all kinds of things in the hotel plus restaurants in town. I was first annoyed that we had to go to the concierge to pick this up rather than the reception desk giving it to us right from the moment we checked in. Then I was annoyed that we could have received discounts from the hotel restaurants with this card - 20% off Mala, the very expensive restaurant and that would have been quite a discount if we had known. But what was the worst part, no one from the hotel staff ever mentioned it. They just handed you the bill and you signed for it - if we had ever remembered to show the \"passport\" we really could have saved a few bucks. All in all, the place is great. We would definitely return to this hotel remembering the little things that would make it just that much better.

Each \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is at odd angles to the beach front. Therefore, the views are greatly varied WITHIN each building. In our case, from our ocean front units we were unable to see the actual sunset due to the next building jutting out, while the units down the hall had a clear view, yet a more limited view to the north. Also, keep in mind that the property has ocean front, and deluxe ocean front categories. With the deluxe version actually offering fully unobstructed views. Additionally, the property is quite spread out. Luckily we had small children, and were close to the kids pool. It would have been quite inconvenient had we been at the other end of the property. Although as a side note, there is no food service at this pool so you have to pack in snacks, or walk to the other pool to eat. Alternatively, those on a couples vacation might want to overlook the adults only serenity pool. It truly is spectacular, and is the only part of the property that feels five star. I would highly recommend giving the desk your preference on check in. Positives: Good value for the Wailea area Excellent expansive grounds Multiple pool options (segregated kids pool !!) Close walking distance to The Shops at Wailea Negatives: No food/beverage service at the kid pool Small rooms (for the area) No suites available close to the water. For some reason they are all in the tower building off the lobby, and offer limited views. Few food options on site No beach support.

Overall, I was satisfied. If this is your first time at Maui, stay in the Kaanapali area in West Maui, rather than the South Maui area. West Maui is much much more full of life.

There are 4 nice beaches within walking distance of the hotel. Wailea beach really is first class, and you won't be disappointed. The price of the cheapest room seems to be reasonable for Maui, although it seems the view from these rooms must suck. There are 4 pools..a kid pool, serenity pool, and 2 others. I liked the pools and found them clean, and generally empty. The housekeeping staff was great. The Bad: The hotel room was nice, but not comparable to other resorts in other locations. The room had some small bugs (nothing major, and understandable since I'm sure the previous guests left the balcony door open), and the balcony was dirty, with a white substance all over the place. The restaurant choices on site are extremely limited. Mala has good but limited food, arrogant staff, and insane prices. The poolside grill was insanely priced and had tasteless food. They need more restaurants. The hotel charges a resort fee of $25 for the privilege of parking there, getting some water each day, and a minor discount at the restaurant. Overall, the hotel lacked the energy and life that other hotels on Maui have. I found this place completely lifeless. You can't use the internet unless you pay 65 cents a minute. Some of the hotel staff at the desk and elsewhere are arrogant. At check in and out I had the same individual who I couldn't stand. Very arrogant guy, and remember I'm a Platinum member, so I can't imagine how he treats other guests. (Many of the staff were friendly though). The Bad: The hotel recommends using SpeediShuttle (which I also recommend), but then when Speedi Shuttle pulled up to take us to the airport, they had to pull off to the side in the parking lot, away from the other guests, making us feel second class.

Nice choice of other pools including kid's pool with a water slide. --we found the staff friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was fine for us. --room is good size. Bathroom had one sink and not large, but clean and nice soaking tub. Towels were large and substantial. No name lotion, shampoo, conditioner were fine. --location near shopping which is a major plus. --we found the cards for beach towels swap (they give you 2 per person) worked well. --grounds are tropical.

Fortunately, our experience was that fellow guests were very quiet. --They have a gnat problem at the moment at the serenity pool.

Memo to HDQ - a down comforter? would have appreciated a thin blanket instead, but maybe that's just us) --beaches are nearby, but carrying the snorkle gear, towels, water, sunblock, etc etc gets boring and by the end, you do wish the beach was at the hotel, rather than a walk. Again, not a deal breaker. Major negatives for us: --Foam beds. Front desk appears to think they are incredible, we found them sunken in where other guests have slept and awkwardly soft. --Motion detector thermostats. Lot of hotels have them, too bad they cause you to wake up hot every couple of hours, then you have cold air blowing on you (keeping you awake) until the room gets the right temperature.

First the positives: the hotel lobby and grounds are nice - open and attractive; the adult infinity pool (salt, no chlorine) at sunset is incredible; restaurant dinners were fantastic; room service was excellent the two meals we had; the price for our room was less expensive than the other hotels in Wailea. We enjoyed our stay! The rooms were pretty basic with tile floors, good bed and more spacious than other Hawaii Marriotts I've stayed in. The activities folks at the infinity pool were very helpful. The pool waitresses were very friendly but definitely understaffed and overworked - an extra waitress during peak hours is necessary. We were disappointed by the location of our room - we had requested and supposedly received an ocean front room. To me this usually means a full ocean view- not here. We were on the third floor in Hale 3 and our room essentially overlooked the family pool and had the typical noise associated with that location. Most vacations I wouldn't quibble but it was our honeymoon and we wanted more quiet. We were told that ocean front means you can see the ocean from the bed, which we could...but only a sliver. We asked for a different room not overlooking the family pool but none was available unless we wanted to upgrade to a deluxe ocean front for 75 more a night. We chose to stay. Note that if you have a lot of bags or if you have difficulty with stairs that this hotel is full of stairs - rooms are on lots of different levels. Spend the few dollars and use the bellmen - they were fast on checkin and checkout. Locations aren't marked real well and it can be confusing to get around...we had trouble finding the lobby the first day! They do nickel and dime you to death as many resorts in this price range do - $25 per day resort fee (covers 1 bottle of water per day, free self-parking). My biggest issue with the fee is that it doesn't cover internet access (extra fee) or pool towels. They give you 2 pool towel cards per person that you exchange for towels at the pool - if you don't give the cards back at checkout, you're charged extra - who wants to deal with keeping track of MORE electronic cards on vacation?

Once in our room, we found that we were on the ground level with no view at all, even though we paid extra for oceanfront. We were facing the ocean, but it might as well have been Lake Erie! The room was dark, damp and loud. The hallways outside the room were made of slate, and everything echoed. If anyone came down the hall speaking in a normal voice, it sounded like a party was going on. And the service carts sounded like trains coming down the hall. Needless to say after one night we asked that our room be switched, we were then placed in a very nice room overlooking the infinity pool. Great view, carpeted hallway (quiet), close to the front desk and workout room. I couldn't help but think that the girl who checked us in had a chip on her shoulder that afternoon and she stuck us out there on purpose!

I am Marriott Platinum, and it was a great upgrade. Room was fine, after a week there, I like the soft bedding and now see why they tile their rooms....we tracked in quite a bit of sand and other stuff from the beach. We didn't spend much time in the room, there was too much else to do. The primary problem Marriott has with this resort is that it borders a Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, Fairmont, etc. All of these are considerably more expensive and the Marriott facility compares well with all of them (except perhaps the Grand Wailea, which is really over the top). The service at the pool was slow at times, and Marriott could do itself a favor by increasing the staffing. The staff seemed to work well, there just weren't enough of them. There is NO free internet access, I traveled with an air card and found it the only reliable service anywhere...you can rent them before you go. We only had one meal at the restaurant, which was outstanding. Great food a good service. We walked to the mall each day (about 10 minutes) to get water, food for the beach, etc. I don't understand the folks who bash the prices that the Marriott charges in Hawaii...it is expensive everywhere. You pay a price for paradise, and this isn't the island or the area to pinch pennies. The Marriott provides the greatest value in Wailea, I believe. The upgrades to the pools since our last visit are outstanding, and the children's play area is really great with two good waterslides. If you are traveling with you children (mine were 8 and 9 at the time) make sure you see the Luau from the Children's pool one evening (my kids still talk about the fire dancer) and head to Cheeseburger in paradise at the Mall.

First, I must say that the location is beautiful, the resort is set up perfectly and from appearances, you almost think that you have died and gone to heaven. However, that is where the wonder ends. First, the concierge desk staff was horrid. They tell you nothing about all the hidden fees, and then they hit you with it at the end of your stay. Perhaps this is something that is true of most hotels, but until now, I have not experienced it. The staff at the Marriot Wailea look at those people staying at their hotel not as guests, but as potential customers. Everything there is a possible sale, and if you do not purchase it (whatever little thing it may be) they do not treat you as even a person after. They don't talk with you, offer you anything; they don't even smile at you. To them, everything is a sale, and they will sell you anything that they can. There is no complimentary internet service, which is practically standard at any other hotel on the planet. The cleaning service forgets one important thing every day, and that is to actually clean the room. They are so busy trying to nail each guest on drinking bottled water or any other possible purchases, that for two days the staff actually DID NOT CLEAN THE ROOM. We didn't get fresh towels, even after asking the front desk to send some down for us. Also, if you don't want to be killing bugs every night in your room, you might not want to stay here. I spent every night killing one form of insect infestation after another. The Mala restaurant has wonderful food, but the staff is atrocious. They push the most expensive items on the menu, and if you don't order that item, they do not offer you any basic hospitality from then on out for the rest of the night. The food that we ordered was spectacular, but the waitress was so snotty, we actually did not want to dine there again. As I said, the location is beautiful, the resort looks great, and the Serenity pool is just that, serene. The idea of not allowing children into an adult pool was so nice, and watching the sunset from the Serenity pool is amazing. If the only thing that you are interested in is sitting in a beautiful location and spending money, then the Marriot Wailea is for you. However, if you want to be treated like a guest and not a dollar sign; if you want at least the basic hospitalilty that you would get elsewhere, if not better; and if you want to have a truly leisure filled experience, there are other places to stay. DO NOT STAY AT THE MARRIOT WAILEA!!!!! It's not worth the money. I recommend The Four Seasons Resort down the road. I wasn't even a guest there, just having dinner one night, and they treated me better in two hours than the Marriot did in three days.

My wife and I were married there 10 years ago when it was the Outrigger Wailea. The fist trip was spectacular, with service that you would expect from a place that expensive. The second (5 yrs after being married there) was very good. The third (7 years after marriage) was not so great due to ongoing construction that was \"suppose to have been finished\". The hotel was just not up to par, but with the construction I felt that they were doing the best that they could. Now on to our recent trip October 09. We spent the first five days in Hawaii at a condo. No restaurant, no bars, no frills. It was fine but we were looking forward to the Marriott experience. After a day at the Marriott, we were wishing for the condo (at $99 a night!) The breakfast buffet that was so awesome in years past (included with room) was a HUGE disappointment. In the past it was something different every day and spectacular at that, this year was the same thing every day! How many days can you have pancakes? COME ON! The rooms had \"boat anchor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tube TV's, not even wall mounted flat screens you can get at the Best Western. The floors in the rooms are tile now, and NOT clean. After the first night walking around bare foot, we ended up wearing flip-flops because our feet were black. Even after twice requesting that they floors be cleaned, they were not. The \"upgraded\" ocean front room was nice, but we've had better rooms there. I think that the \"upgrade\" was a farce. We paid for oceanfront, and supposedly got \"Deluxe Ocean Front\". I question the upgrade, the pictures on the front desk of the deluxe room was not what we had. Still, a beautiful view of the spot that we were married right out our rooms sliding glass door. The serenity pool was nice, but a bit stuffy. The retable cabanas were more like displays for all to see. No privacy AT ALL. Poor design for sure. The nicest pool was above the water slide, there was almost no one ever there. The pools were very cold, no heating whatsoever. The poolside restaurant and workers were great, from the bar tenders to wait staff. These are the people and service that I remember. That being said, they close at 7:30 PM now. No drinks by the pool in to the night, which was always a great place to be after dark. Are you kidding me? The Marriott is missing a big money maker here. The restaurant upstairs is open but does not service the pool area and a swimsuit and t-shirt are not correct attire. This was a big disappointment. With the additional resort fees and parking charges I feel that we did not get our moneys worth. I may stay again because of the sentimental thing, but it will be for a few days, certainly not 8 like this time. With all the above being said, the bright spot at the hotel was an employee named Frank Hill. This man from New York now living on Maui exudes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aloha Spirit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Some locals that work at the hotel could learn from this guy, he knows how to treat guests. This guy needs to be in charge of the hotel. Are you listening Marriott Wailea? Frank and the workers at the poolside bar saved this trip from being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to being a decent trip. Nice area, average service.

Service was friendly and the bed was very comfortable. Four stars are an appropriate rating for this hotel. Recommend a stop to Safeway to make fresh sandwiches in the room, as even the food trucks are pricey in Maui. A mahi mahi burrito was $9. If you go into Kihei to eat, recommend Thailand Cuisine. Do not eat at Aroma D'Italia Ristorante! We had low expectations for Italian food in Maui, but when both our pasta dishes came served in a watery soup broth, we were disappointed.

But the second visit we were in a room one floor down and over and we heard EVERYTHING in the rooms to ether side, above and below. It was very strange to have such a difference with such a small location change. The serenity pool is very nice, but it was impossible to get a chair with any shade in the afternoon unless you rented a cabana or camped out there all day. There are a total of four pools, including a kid's pool and one with a water slide. The little beach has amazing snorkeling and easy swimming. We had dinner in the restaurant, which was good, but not really an inspired menu. We attended the luau and it had surprisingly good food at the buffet and the show was quite good. I recommend it. Our last night of the first visit was marred by a party held on the lawn in front of our room with the WORST, LOUDEST cover band on the isle of Maui. Every crappy song ever stuck in your memory was hauled out and mangled. They had it cranked so you could hear it up at the shopping center. I was initially told by the front desk the amplified music would be over by 9 pm. When it was going strong (sweet home Alabama, anyone?) at 9:15 I was told security was going to head over there and it should end at 9:30. Finally, at 10, the band was unplugged. It was so loud that we could not talk to each other in the room with the doors closed and the curtains drawn. I fault the hotel for not managing the issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we have stayed at other hotels with similar situations and never had to deal with the volume level or missing time deadlines.

We had an oceanfront deluxe room on the ground floor. WHAT WE LIKED... ROOM SIZE: The size of the room product worked quite well for us. We had a king size bed and a sofa with a pull out (probably about a double bed). There was a fridge in the room that was empty (no mini bar--which was perfect for us). The empty fridge allowed us to buy drinks and keep them cool without maneuvering around various minibar items. The closet was also a nice size. The vanity area was fine in size, but I have other concerns about that (see below). The lanais and balconies on the rooms are also a good size--perfect for a couple to do a meal facing the ocean. LOCATION: This is a great place in Wailea. It sits at the end of the coastal walking path that goes from the Marriott to the Fairmont Kei Lani, so it's great access to the other resorts but there aren't masses of people walking through the Marriott. It's also a great walking/running path for those who want to do a bit of exercise...the view up and down the path is great as well. ATMOSPHERE/RESTAURANT: Mala, the hotel's restaurant (operated by an outside restaurant company with a sister restaurant in Lahaina) was reasonable as resorts on Maui go. The full breakfast buffet was about $26 and the continental buffet was about $18. At home that would be outrageous, but on Maui that's not bad. They also have a la carte options for breakfast that are decently priced. Dinner there was satisfying, not \"rave-able\" but satisfying. The overall grounds of the hotel are also quite nice. It's not grandiose or over the top (a la Grand Wailea) and it's quieter than the other resorts in the area. It also seems to be quieter than the busy resorts in Kaanapali. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER... LACK OF BEACH SERVICES: While the hotel has close access to two beaches, it is not precisely beachfront. Therefore, the hotel doesn't provide any beach services. They do not set up chairs or umbrellas like the Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons. This would have been a nice service to have given it is Hawaii. The beach services of the other hotels are only available to the guests of those hotels, so if you're at the Marriott, you bring your towel and expect no more. BEACH TOWEL RATIONING: Speaking of beach towels, the rationing system is inconvenient. While I understand the hotel wanting to keep account of their towels, every time we wanted a new towel we had to trek over to the pool and exchange them. There is a card system where you will be issued one card per person. You trade the cards for towels at the one and only towel station by the pool. Then you can trade the towels back in for new ones when necessary. This was not the best system for us as we were in a far Hale and we had to walk away from the beach to go get a towel. This won't be as much of an issue for pool users, but why would I go all the way to Hawaii to sit by a pool all the time? I can trek to Vegas for that and it will be a lot cheaper. ROOM BATHROOM: The bathroom area could use some improvements. The vanity, while a nice sized area, could have used a dual sink vanity instead of the single sink. The shower/toilet area was also quite small. Also, because the air conditioning is on the other side of the room pointing the opposite direction, the bathroom could get quite warm. NO CEILING FAN: Considering the rooms were recently redone, I think it is a huge miss that there was no ceiling fan in the room. Your choices were air conditioning or leave the sliding door open and pray for air movement. We would have loved to open our sliding door and had the ceiling fan on rather than living in the AC all night. Unfortunately, that was not an option. LIGHTING: While I do like to do my part to save mother earth, there are right and wrong places for CFL lights. Dimming lamps and light fixtures are not the right places for them. Our desk lamp sounded like it was going to bring Frankenstein back to life. The other \"dimming\" light fixtures didn't so much dim as just go out. I can understand the CFLs in the bathroom and in some of the light fixtures (e.g. floor lamp), but it wasn't working for me in the other lights in the room. Further, the lanais and balconies have no lighting at all. If you want to sit on your balcony/lanai in the evening to read and listen to the surf, or even for dinner, you have to pull your floor lamp from the room out onto the lanai. We didn't do this, but as we walked around the resort, we could see that several people did. Another miss on the lighting. OVERALL... While my criticisms above may seem harsh, I will say that this is a recommendable hotel. Service was good and things were clean, at the end of the day, when you're in Hawaii you don't really care about much more than that. NOTE: Many resorts charge a \"resort fee\" which, in most cases, is a bogus way of nickle-and-diming you for stuff you don't want or need. In Marriott Wailea's case; however, the resort fee is useful! Their fee includes parking fees (in and out privileges of course), daily liter of water, two complimentary cups of coffee from their little quick serve shack, 20% off dinner at Mala (which nearly pays for a day right there), and a percentage off the Mandara Spa services (which we didn't use). As resort fees go, I think this one is much easier to stomach than most.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Wales, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExtra fees add up!\u201d", "Author": "marco123", "ReviewID": "UR37996233", "Content": "Just checked out of the Marriott.

We (2 adults, 2 teenage kids) arrived around 6pm and were upgraded due to my Platinum status to a suite on the 8th floor facing the beach. The suite was spectacular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one room was a standard room with two queens, fridge, bath and lanai with the second room being an oversized living room. It had a pull out couch, another bathroom, 2nd fridge, a large dining room table with chairs and a second oversized lanai. Most suites are two standards rooms converted into a suite but this was like two and a half rooms equivalent. The two kids stayed on the sofa bed, which gave us adults our privacy. The staff was helpful and friendly 100% of the time. We did not eat in the restaurants, but did get a smoothie poolside and it was good. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Safeway about 5 miles from the hotel so we bought most of breakfast and lunch stuff there and used the two refrigerators to store everything. There is an ABC store and Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next door at the shopping center but the Safeway had much better selection and prices. We also had dinner our first night at the Cheeseburger place in the mall next door and thought the food was both tasty and reasonably priced. Service was a bit slow but we were in no big hurry. For dinner, we went out each night to various places. I know that Lahaina gets all the press and is certainly worth a visit, but we found Kihei to have a nice selection of moderately priced restaurants and nice shopping to boot. Kihei is only about 10 minutes away vs. 35-40 minutes away for Lahaina and has no issue with parking and traffic like Lahaina. The best meal we had was Fred\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mexican in Kihei and also had a great time at Life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Beach (Tuesdays has $1 tacos and live music too!!). We had great pizza at Shaka (much better than Matteos, which is very close to the hotel but very average food.) Hotel pools were OK, nothing spectacular, the best being the adult pool. Someone else compared the Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pools to the Grand Wailea next door or the Four Seasons two hotels down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c give me a break! Those hotels are at least twice the cost per night! Another reviewed mentioned spotty internet service and I agree. It would work in the morning but not in the afternoon or visa versa. And they don't offer wireless in the rooms, just the lobby. At $14 a day, the internet service should be world class and it stunk. The location is outstanding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the two beaches on either side of the property are superb \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you like snorkeling at all, try it at either beach and you will pleased. If you go to the beach on your right, keep walking past the lava rocks and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find another quarter mile of beach that is mostly deserted. Yes, the parking spots on the first level are a joke as they are too small unless you have a Smartcar. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a problem if you use the second level of parking. We had a Ford Escape SUV and never had a problem finding a spot on the second level where we fit. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the Spa but we did walk around the locker room and steam shower and was happy to know that we could use them for free on our last day of checkout when our flight left at 8pm. Turns out though, that when I asked for a late checkout (2pm) on our last day, they offered to move us to a standard room on the first floor for our use until 6pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice! We moved out of our room at noon and left the second room at around 6pm for the airport. Having a shower after a day at beach is a must before a 9 hour treck home. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if that was done because of our Platinum status but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth asking for it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think they called it a hospitality room.

Resort Location: The r(esort is located in the 2nd largest tourist area on Maui. While the Lahina/Kanapalli area is more widely known if you are travelling to Maui to relax, without kids and have done the whole shopping thing and Maui before I would strongly recommend Wailea. If it is your first time to Maui and you like to get out and shop or have kids you may want to consider the Kanapalli area for more activity and location of supporting venues. Wailea offers a more relaxed atmosphere where one can go to relax and enjoy the Hawaiian warmth and sun. Resort Area: While Lahina is the main shopping area which is about 30-45 minutes away by car, Wailea has a beautiful shopping mall, great beaches and very nice golf courses with a couple of high end dinner locations. The shopping mall is about 400 yards away from the hotel and segregated by terrain to still remain quiet and private. It is very nice to walk to the shopping area and have a nice dinner and just relax and have an easy 5 min stroll back to the hotel. At the mall you can find restaurants: Tommy Bahama (very good, but pricey), Ruth Chris steak house (excellent & expensive), the burger shack and a lot of other smaller places to grab a more mid-day type of snack. There is a Safeway grocery store about 10 minutes drive down the road but you can usually buy a lot of hotel room items at the malls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whaler Stores\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marriott Resort: The resort is very nice and set into different sections. We had an ocean/pool view room and the room was very nice with a nice little balcony to have breakfast on in the morning and drinks in the afternoon. Inside the King bed room we also had seating for 4 with a nice table for afternoon snacks with the family. There are 2 main pool areas. The adult pool is very quiet with a beautiful infinity pool with lots of room to move around and is only for adults. You can even rent cosy futons for $35 per day or go all out and rent the on the pool cabanas for $100. Personally, the free open seating is fine, but with all American resorts you should go reserve a place early to get the view/place you want. The other pool area contains 2 pools for families and kids and while we stayed there twice (with no kids) it was fine. The kids enjoyed themselves without being a bother to others just relaxing around. Of course both locations offer full food and beverage service at your chairs. Finally, there are 2 beautiful beaches to walk down to (2 min) that you can play in the Ocean and relax. Marriott Mana Restaurant: We only ate at this restaurant and both nights we ate there we were happy with the quantity and quality of food compared to price. As the resort is slower due to the economy we had great outdoor seats and we were able to watch the sunset while eating some very fresh Hawaiian fish dishes. Overall, if you have been to Maui or are a Marriott member this is a very relaxing enjoyable place to stay and would highly recommend it.

We had a AAA rate of 224.00 per night (parking lot view) but were offered to upgrade at check-in for $100 per night to an ocean-front room, which we did. What made the view so great was the fact that the room was very close to the ocean compared to two upscale hotels in Wailea (i.e. Grand Wailea, Four Seasons). The sunset views from the room were spectacular. I would say that the rooms, while newly renovated, were typical Marriott. The bed was too soft for my liking as other reviewers have said. This is due to the fact that they do not have a typical box spring and mattress combo but instead a very deep mattress on top of a platform. If you have a bad lower back, you should not stay here. My boyfriend and I love snorkeling and have snorkeled Hawaii many times. We have also been to Belize, Australia, and the Carribean to snorkel. I thought that I would be less than impressed with the snorkeling at the Marriott but to my surprise, it was impressive. You only have about 3 hours in the morning (8-10am) to snorkel in calm waters, but it is well worth it. We first tried Ulua beach (right side), which has lots of healthy coral and is simply beautiful. The problem with Ulua is that the reef gets very crowded since the beach is shared with other properties. Plus, it is a bit of a hike to the beach if you are on the other side of the resort. The left side of Ulua can be choppy and cloudy until you get out to the point and circle around toward the Marriott. You should actually go around the point closer to where the Marriott's outside massage tent is to see the most amount of coral. However, for the most spectacular snorkeling, you should enter in at the other beach (by the Starbucks shack at the Marriott) and snorkel right in front of the hotel. You will see very dense healthy coral...not a ton of fish but turtles do frequent that area. The best coral is about 25 feet from the rocky shore line, so you do not need to be that close to the rocks (or waves). It is SO much better than any snorkel trip we have ever taken on boats in Hawaii especially better than Molokini. Also, the Starbucks shack opens at 6:30am and serves egg mc muffin type sandwiches for $6.00. We would grab a sandwich before our snorkel every morning- very convenient. The Marriott is within walking distance to the Shoppes of Wailea, which feature several restaurants for dining out. We ate at Tommy Bahamas there and ordered the fixe price tasting menu where you get appetizer, entre, and dessert in smaller portions. The portions were not as small as I expected so we thought it was a good deal and the seafood quality was superb. We ate at Longhis for lunch, which was really good as well. One of the lady's at the Activity Warehouse recommended a place in Kihei called Cafe o Lei. It doesn't look that nice from the outside but inside it is a very nice place with excellent food. Prices are like US prices, very reasonable for Hawaii standards. Need reservations becuase it gets crowded. Also in Kihei is a 24-hour Denny's. Its a bit of a dump but if you have to be on a boat or other excursion real early, you can grab a very early breakfast there. Lastly, we were told by a waiter that the Marriott used to have a torch lighting/hula ceremony at dusk by the upper pool, which offered a Hawaiian feel, which is definitely missing at this resort. That alone, would add a nice touch and they certainly have the location and property to do this.

We researched various hotels in Maui and just about all resorts have some type of fees associated with their \"amenities\". Either you will pay it a la carte (i.e. parking, internet charges) or you will pay it all a resort fee which will be around $25-$35 per day. We stayed in the Wailea Marriot and the Sheraton in Kaanapali during our stay in Maui. I would say if you are a couple with no kids and looking for a peaceful and beautiful atmosphere, then the Marriott is for you. It is a gorgeous environment. They have an adult infinity pool overlooking the ocean that is gorgeous. The hotel is on the water, but not on the beach. It is a short walk in either direction to a private beach (which has good snorkeling) or Wailea beach. Neither beach will get nearly as crowded as the Kaanapali beaches. There are not too many food options especially if you do not want to opt for the $50 per person dinner. We think that this by design. Wailea is not, nor does it aspire to be Lahaina or Kaanapali. It has more of a country club type of feel. If you want more reasonable priced food you can go to the adjacent town of Kihei (5 mins) or take a trip to Lahaina (40 mins). We stayed away from the hotel food other than ordering wings on the poolside (delicious). The food and drinks and are overpriced on all resorts. The rooms were very clean and well decorated. We appreciated the tiled floors in lieu of carpet. Our ocean view room contained a real \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The workout room at the Marriott is mediocre, but there is a great walk/jog path along the water. You are a very short walk from the shops at Wailea which has high end shops (Gucci, Louis Vuitton) and typical stores such as the gap and Banana Republic.

Overall it was a great location and property for my wife, our two kids (10 and 7) and I. We had booked a regular ocean view room using points, but then asked about available upgrades to a one-bedroom when we checked in. We decided to splurge on the additional $150 per night for the one-bedroom ocean facing room. I highly recommend room 7236 (or something on 3rd floor with similar layout/view). Our room was on the 2nd floor of the 3-story \"7\" building with lanais and ocean views on 3 sides. It also was just a few yards down one flight of stairs and across the walkway to the rocks/tide pools in front of the resort. My wife and I could sit on one of the lanais and watch the kids play in the rocks or on the hammock/lawn. Since we have kids we didn't spend time at the infinity pool, but we liked the set of pools right in front of the lunch cafe. We watched a couple of sunsets from the pool area over appetizers and drinks. We spent most of our time out of the room snorkeling, swimming, along with trips to Hana and Lahaina. Pros - Great room, views and just a few steps from the ocean. We listened to the surf every night. The kids slept on the fold-out sofa in the living area. - Except one tower, the hotel is comprised of low-slung buildings spread around the grounds --- gives a much more garden and open feel to the resort. We actually liked this better than the overpowering resort and tall towers feel of some of the other more famous Wailia properties. The Marriott seemed to fit better into the overall enviornment and it was more about the gardens, ponds, ocean than the structure. - The hotel in general sits much closer to the ocean than many of the other new resorts and you feel more connected to the surrounding ocean and rocks - Wailea and Ulua beaches - while right in front of the hotel are some rocks and tide pool areas (rather than a sand beach), there are two great beaches on both sides of the hotel - each only a 3 to 5 minute walk. We actually liked not having a crowd of beach goers right in front of the hotel -- this also makes it possible for the hotel to be that much closer to the ocean. - The kids pool and slides area, including the salt water pool that sits above the kid pool area. - The koi pond by the front desk - kids enjoyed feeding them and watching them every time we came down in the lobby area - The views from the main restaurant at sunset - Mala - The views from the pool area restaurant all day and at sunset - The overall grounds - The coffee, muffin and breakfast sandwich place right before Wailea Beach - an economical breakfast choice just a few hundred yeards away from our room. - Matteos across the street from the Wailea shops --- good food, decent prices, family friendly pizza and italian food. - Resort fee was optional - we didn't take it. Cons - Pool area restaurant closes at 7.30pm and only serves a few appetizers and sandwiches. Waitress said there is a non-compete with the fancier hotel restaurant (Mala). Would have been nice to have one more dinner option at the hotel, but we still enjoyed a nice meal of appetizers and sunset and swimming one evening at the pool area restaurant. - Lack of mid-priced eating options nearby -- except a few places and some chains in the Wailiea Shops area. As near as we could tell there was only upscale dining choices in any of the surrounding hotels. We had breakfast a Cheeseburger in Wailea Shops one day which was okay. We also ate at Mala, the more upscale hotel restaurant -- great views and the food was decent if a little pricey. - Parking spaces are small and it is $15 a day for self park.

The property is beautifully landscaped from the moment you arrive at the open-air lobby. The pool areas overlooking the ocean are gorgeous (in my opinion better than the more expensive neighboring hotels), but we spent most of our time at the beaches :) There are tons of nooks and crannies with beach chairs and trails overlooking the ocean. The hotel seemed very family friendly with quite a few kids around. We were pleasantly surprised that our non-ocean view room actually had a nice view of the ocean from the balcony. The room was nice with a super soft bed, but overall wasn't spectacular. The bathroom was a bit cramped. In my opinion the location is one of the best in Maui. To the reviewer who said that the beach adjacent to the hotel sucked, I have no idea what planet they are from. Wailea beach is on one side of the property and has been rated as one of the best beaches in Maui. Since it is directly in front of the Wailea Grand and Four Seasons it may get a little crowded. We preferred Ulua beach on the other side of the property, which is smaller and has a more secluded feel, plus there is a HUGE reef with excellent snorkeling just a few feet offshore. I would rank Ulua beach as one of the nicest I have ever been to. And if that's not good enough, there are literally dozens of beaches within 5-10 minute driving distance (Big Beach, Kihei beaches, etc), none of which are as crowded as the ones in West Maui. We had lunch at the bar at an off-peak hour and the service was poor, but the service was generally good when getting drinks poolside. The $11 cocktails add up fast, but we found that to be the price pretty much everywhere on the island. I agree with the posts that felt the hotel nickel and dimed a lot for a luxury property. Charging for internet is silly in this day and age, and I was hoping for free snorkel gear. The snorkel rental rates are outrageous, so just drive 5 minutes into Kihei and pick up some gear from Snorkel Bob's for less than $10 a day. As noted in other posts, we were also slightly disappointed that we didn't receive flower leis upon arrival, though we didn't get them at the airport either... The restuarants were underwhelming compared to other options. We ended up heading into town to the Kihei Caffe every morning, and we had an amazing meal at Ferraro's at the Four Seasons on our last night. Overall, the property was beautiful, in a great location next to fantastic beaches. The pool areas directly overlooking the ocean are a highlight. The room was clean and very comfortable, but not spectacular. The choice of restaurants is limited, but the restaurants at the Shops of Wailea and the Four Seasons are a short walk away. Not quite 5 stars based on the quality of the room and restaurants, but the hotel doesn't charge 5 star rates. I would definitely stay here again.

Well, from the time we arrived until the time we (sadly) had to leave, we were delighted to be at this hotel. First, I had stopped at the reservation desk to check in (knowing we would not get a room since we arrived around 10:30 am on Friday).

We are glad we chose the Marriott and this location (Wailea). The resorts in the Wailea area are more secluded and away from traffice and noise. I cannot say enough good things about this place. The staff is what makes this resort special. Terri one of the pool service waitresses is superb. Our room was in Hale 2 overlooking two of the pools and the ocean to our right.

This mall also has an ice cream shop along with a Ruth Chris steak house, Tommy Bahama's, a coffee shop, Cheeseburger in Paradise which has some excellent buffalo wings.

In addition, wireless internet is not offered for free in the rooms despite a $25 dollar resort fee which is a bit ridiculous...don't pay for it!...I got a signal on the balcony of my hotel room from a nearby condo.

We knew the Marriott Wailea was not a 5 star and we were also aware of the $25 / day resort fee - but weighed the pros and the cons and decided to book nonetheless - we were not sorry. First of all the resort is an almost 4 star - our standards are high - what makes it an almost 4 star are the minor minor issues we had with the resort which I will get into at the end of my positive notes. We had what they called an ocean front but advertised as a partial ocean front on Expedia (which we booked through) - we had no problems with our room - it was HUGE - king size bed, love seat, chair , desk, tv, fridge...... large bathroom - we loved the fact that there was no carpeting in the room - it was modern (looked nothing like the photo on tripadvisor). Our room overlooked a lawn and the hedge separating the resort from the private condos - our view was lush - and if you sat in the right half of the balcony you saw the ocean - heard the crashing waves - there was no noise from other guests - it was perfect! We also knew that the resort did not have a beach directly in front - that did not bother us - given the proximity of our room it was a 2 mins stroll to the beach - the beach is great - fantastic snorkeling - some of the best available - we took a catamaran sail to snorkle at Malokini (the boat that departs from Prince Hotel .... so glad we didn't book a room at the Prince - a dive!) the snorkling was far superior at the Marriott - however the sail was wonderful nonetheless. The beach was never 'packed' , it's always clean.... we thoroughly enjoyed it. We never ate in the hotel - we ate at Cheeseburgers in the Shops at Wailea when we first arrived because it was late and we were famished - it was HORRIBLE - worst burger we've ever had - the food is all processed - it's bad food for a lot of money - avoid it if you can. The General Store offers good food options - we bought a loaf of bread and a jar of PB for snacks - we bought bananas and pineapple from the farmers market and often had breakfast on our balcony - it was great. We ate in Kihei a lot - we liked Alexander's and Cafe Ole - great fresh food - Cafe Ole had some of the best sushi we have ever had! We enjoyed the organic grocers that are trickled throughout the Island - Mana foods in Paia was great - many others as well - Lonely Planet reviews many of them and they are all good. We often went to an organic grocer - purchased food to go and then ate in a park or by the shore - it was heaven. We packed a lot into a short trip - we did the drive to HANA - loved it - we did the crater - extreme wind that day made it a little uncomfortable but breathtaking nonetheless - we hiked for about 90mins into the crater - what an experience - although with the altitude, wind and 30 degree weather it took about 2.5 hours to hike back...... the crater is a photographers dream! Next time we will be sure to do the hike on horseback and go deeper into the crater. The time of year we travelled (May) was considered low season - however the locals told us tourism has been affected by the current economic climate and that it is slower than usual - we had no problems with that - we had a lot of things to ourselves - it was great. We decided on the Old Lahaina Luau - it was worth the money - it was packed - sold out - but very entertaining and well organized. Some of the things that weren't quite up to par - but didn't greatly impact our trip to put a damper on our time - was the housekeeping services - housekeeping wasn't quite at a standard we would have liked it to be - it was just average - they did what they had to do and that was that - never mopped or swept the floor - or not as often as we would have liked - forgot to leave our $25 bottle of water (that's how much the resort fee is and really , aside from parking you don't get anything more....) We left a tip for the housekeeping staff every 2 days - were only left a thank you note once and nothing xtra was ever done for leaving a tip. The $25 resort fee is highway robbery as far as we're concerned - the only way to wrap your head around it is to just tell yourself the room is $25 more per night than what you're quoted - don't look at it as a fee because that will only anger you - You get nothing for the $25 - they leave a bottle of water in your room every day - big deal, they don't charge you for parking - again, big deal - most of the other hotels don't charge (probably included in room rate), they say you get discounts and a free welcome drink - hardly justifies $25 / day - it's steep and it really burns..... oh well..... Staff isn't all that into their job - especially the women we dealt with at the activities counter - they were sour - not very excited - only offered info you asked for - didn't really give you more - maybe they were having bad days??? Check-in was easy - many reviews mentioned being offered free upgrades - we were offered an upgrade at $80 more per night - we had included in our booking that it was a special occasion (40th bday celebration) but this did not prompt an upgrade of any sort. Luggage service was never offered to us - not at check in or check out - we always had to deal with our own luggage. Didn't bother us - saved us tipping. Shell lei's are given at check - in , they forgot to give us ours.... again, no big deal --- really minor things. Little details that you don't expect from a 4 star. We were told (and it's written in the in-room literature) that towels can be exchanged at reception 24 hours / day. When I went at 7am (cabana services were closed) the person at reception told me \"I'll get you them this one time but just so you know there is no one here until after 12 to get towels\" - When I read that it's open 24 hours I called reception to confirm and the woman I spoke with infact confirmed that it's 24 hours - I told her I was told otherwise and she told me that 's not so - you can come anytime for fresh towels..... Staff friendliness was hit and miss - we didn't spend that much time at the hotel so we didn't really care that much.... We only swam in the adult only infinity pool once - it was really loud - I thought it was supposed to be the serenity pool - but clearly I was wrong - people were yelling and horsing around for the 2 hours we were there and no one asked them to be quiet.... The lounge chairs are always saved by 6:30 - 7am in the morning even though there are signs saying not to do so - no one monitors it so if you get to the pool by 8am you won't find a free lounge chair under an umbrella - they will all have towels on them - but no people.... go back at 9am and there's still no one on them - only the towel - not really fair for others - but the staff aren't enforcing their rules so that's the way it is.... it's really ok though - the pools were often cloudy by the evening..... like I said - we swam in one of the pools once. Our room keys became inactive - we arrived at around 8pm - exhausted from a day of day tripping and couldn't get into our room - we went to front desk (because the hall phone was not working) - they did something with the keys and said it would work - it didn't work - we had to go back - We went back 3 times - the 3rd time my husband became upset and refused to go back to the room without a staff in case it didn't work again - which it didn't - it's a long story - we had to leave the hotel for a bit so they could call engineering and get it fixed - no one ever called us or addressed this issue with us to offer their appologies - the least the manager could have done would have been to call us and say sorry for the technical problems..... again, the details. There is no attention to detail paid at the hotel - housekeeping is average - staff isn't very attentive - no extras - .... these are the things that make this a low 4 star hotel - We had a nice looking room and we were in a secluded part of the hotel - I couldn't imagine having a room overlooking the pools or being in the taller tower. I could see how someone could easily have a bad experience at this hotel - we were very, very fortunate. We've stayed in Marriotts before and have never had a problem - and really, we didn't have a problem at the Wailea Marriott..... We enjoyed it a lot - mostly because we knew what we were walking into and we didn't have high expectations. I would recommend this hotel to people providing they know what they are getting into. We loved Maui - we had the best time ever - we've been to many carribean destinations and Maui is by far the best tropical vacation we've ever taken - we would return to Hawaii in a heart beat - in fact we would return to the Marriott Wailea in a heartbeat as long as we knew we could have the same room in the same building. One last thing - separate from the hotel review - we rented a car when we booked with Expedia - our insurance (because we are Canadian) costed us an extra $500 on top of what we'd already paid for the rental - that was a lot and I wish I'd done more research before I left - although we used our car daily - $500 is a lot to pay for insurance - especially since it was a low end subaru - not even a convertable or jeep - they had sold out - so for all you canadians renting a car - check into the fees and additional insurance before hand.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, tired rooms/resort\u201d", "Author": "Goober818", "ReviewID": "UR31098704", "Content": "I understand that this resort was updated not too long ago but there's little evidence of it.

The best thing about the resort is by far the staff, incredibly friendly and eager to please. I also have to say you need to be part Billy Goat to stay at this resort, everything is a trek from one spot to the next (we were down in Hale 6) and getting to your car is like climbing a mountain.

(Moreover: it is not worthy the Marriott brand; oh, did we say that some of their signs still say \"Wailea Beach Outrigger\" reminding us all about it's unflattering ancestry?) We have traveled to Hawaii numerous times in the past. We have stayed at condominiums, 5-star resorts, B&Bs, and small town establishments. There is plenty to choose from to suit anyone's budget. While Wailea prides itself to be more class than the rest of Maui, Wailea Beach Marriott Resort & Spa does not belong there. We decided to summarize our experience below into several paragraphs. This is the worst review we have ever posted anywhere as most places with flaws at least try. This one does even fake trying and takes the guests for granted. We will see and wait if it survives these tough economic times. We think not as too much investment would be needed, in our opinion, to make it what it should be. Staff and Service: we found the front staff grumpy, tired and unhappy. Their willingness to help and assist was non-existent with exception of a few blindly dedicated individuals. Booking: we booked on line and found our Ocean Front in Hale 3 to be actually a total PARTIAL ocean view but Pool FRONT with the full view of the restaurant and the noisy pools. When we requested a true Ocean Front, we were told it would take an extra $80 per night. Only then could we be placed in their Ocean Front DELUXE (we should have known better, I suppose, as this is a common trick in Hawaii). Room: plainly, FILTHY. Nothing to add nothing to take away: no carpets, just tile with dust and sand. Dead bugs and spilled ice cream under the beds on day 1, filthy room corners, tired room appearance, noisy central A/C, noisy balcony door that slam with a good deal of fortitude. The room was cleaned 2.5 hours after our request for a room service. Bell service: they charged us an involuntary fee of $36 for the luggage delivery whether we like it or not, whether we used the service or not. So we used it... The bell boy still asked for a tip even though the front desk stated the $36 fee is the tip for using the service and is applied to all customers (we checked; it is in fact not applied to all customers). Pool: nearly always crowded and noisy. Water is cold. There is another pool which is quiet but for adults only. Also not heated and mostly cold. The slides for children are two, quite frankly, not worth mentioning either. We did not understand the need for a forearm band as it was not enforced anyway. Luau: we did not go but watched from a distance: totally ridiculous experience even compared to the indoor luau at the Kauai Hyatt. Skip this one (or actually, both). Did we say Marriott asks the luau guests to use smelly porta-potties we noticed were used by construction workers during the day? Food: skip it... Internet: in the room for $14 /24 hours I think. Wi-Fi at the lobby for $$$. Beach: you have to walk to one. The Marriott has only coral and rocks. There were turtles there to watch, probably the only positive and memorable experience. Overall: if you want a truly romantic (and clean) experience in Maui, skip Kihei and Wailea altogether and consider more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off the beaten path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd areas, or something closer to Lahaina.

We were surprised by the addition of a \"resort fee\" (plus tax) to our bill (about $27 a night), when we were told by both travelocity and the woman checking us in that this was included. After the 2nd night, we checked our room charges, and this fee was on the bill. We got that adjusted without too much grief, but on checkout, the charge appeared for the next 5 nights of our 7 night stay. The woman at the desk was very reluctant to remove the charge, but after about a 5 minute heated exchange she did remove the charge, and comped us the other $60 in charges for our trouble. Not a great way to encourage repeat business. Other: internet access is wired, and $15 a day. The restaurant \"Cheeseburgers\" in the shops at wailea (5 minute walk) offers free wifi, fairly priced drinks, solid diner-food, friendly service, so we used them for internet access. Also, the general store in the shops at wailea has a good deli and OK prices on food / booze for when resort pricing gets old.

All of the staff were filled to the brim with the aloha spirit (except two people). The room was very nice with beds so comfortable we didn't want to get out of them. We had a regular room with a lanai which looked over a dumpster but past the dumpster was a beautiful view of the island so I enjoyed it very much. The adult pool was nice but had that annoying tourist music playing. We spent most of our pool time at the lower pool by Kulu. Two days in a row we got beach chairs overlooking the ocean. It was great. Speaking of Kulu, their barbecue pork nachos with queso were super yummy. I had them the first night and one other time and thought about them the rest of the trip. The haupia drinks (order with chocolate syrup on the bottom) at Kulu and available poolside were delicious and refreshing. The sweet potato fries were pretty good, too. I did not like the build-your-own lettuce wraps, but my friend did. The gift shop was very nice and filled with pretty much everything I needed snackwise--get the Cookwees, tasty!

It was nice to have the option of washing our own clothes. When we checked out, they held our bags for us.

I'm not a big fan of large resorts, but this was a fun experience. Our ocean view room had a clear view of Ulua beach. We enjoyed strolling with our little one every morning along the walking path. We would often stop at the other resorts to compare, and in the end we felt like the Marriott was the best choice for location and value. If you want the best on Wilea, I would recommend the Four Seasons. It is beautiful, and the service is superb. They offer free/included coffee and tea, flvored water, and sunscreen, sunglass cleaning, and other stuff I'm sure. The lobby and fitness center are beyond compare. If you like Vegas, you'll like the Grande Wailea. It's a circus over there. The Fairmont was also classy, and from what I understand, it's rooms are all suites. But it was a little harder to get a good view of the ocean from its public areas, including its pools. For breakfast I would brew Kona coffee in the room and eat papaya and pineapple. My wife got a bagel from Whaler's general store. We ate sandwiches at Whaler's general store for lunch, $6 for freshly made Boar's Head deli sandwiches. We would always go out for dinner. Longhi's was expensive - $120 for 2 for fish of the day and a shrimp dish with a glass of wine. Cheeseburger is alright. Sorrento's on the Beach near Kihei had good food, but was pretentious for being \"on the beach\". San Diego has better beach-side dining options that that. Our best dining experience was Cafe Ole in Kihei - highly recommended. It doesn't have a view, but the food is superb, I especially liked the Maui onion soup and grilled Mahi Mahi. We had one lunch at the Marriott and we were presently surprised to find the price was reasonable and the food was excellent. Nick's Fish Market at the Fairmont is suppose to be great too, but we never had a chance to try it. The pools are plenty at the Marriott. The serenity pool is so nice compared to everything else that it stands out like a sore thumb. It's made of beautifully laid lava stone and granite. The rest of the property looks like 1970s stucco. I think they will eventually have to to blend it in a bit better. But the serenity pool is unmatched by any of the other resorts, and it looks like that's where the bulk of the budget went. Snorkeling off the Ulua beach and swimming South in front of the Marriott is good. There are two turtles living there and plenty of fish.

We checked out April 7 and we really liked the place. It's our second time in Maui and first time in Wailea. We stayed in the other side of the island (Kapalua) before. We both liked the hotel. Negatives: (only minor stuff) - This resort is huge. It was NOT easy finding our room. Especially after a looooong flight from Chicago. We were really tired, maybe that didn't help (finding our room a little more easily). - they have blocked the aux ports on the TV, so we couldn't watch the stuff we recorded.. (whales, luau, etc.. ). Even though it shows as active in the channels listing, it is blocked. But, who is going to Maui to watch movies anyways? \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 - Bed tends to slide/move quite easily.

Not a big deal, since wailea and ulua beaches are right next to the hotel. We were in building 5, which is really close to the beach, third floor, room 5305. \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 We could see the Luau from our room. So, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdistance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was not an issue for us, unfortunately we had to walk 30 seconds to go to the beach next door, bummer. Marriott does not have umbrellas, or cabanas at the beach. If you have an ocean front room, you will have a GREAT view of the ocean, you only won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the sandy beach right in front of your room, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big deal. Buildings 4, 5, 6, 7 are closer to wailea beach. Haleakala hale, buildings 2 and 3 are closer to Ulua beach. Building 3 is right in the middle, so it is a little further from either beach, maybe instead of walking 30 seconds to the beach you will have to walk 45 seconds. Not too bad. \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 - The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Polinesyan Luau\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd grounds do not look good during the day (not during luau). They leave all the chairs laying around, etc.. which kinds of take away the beauty of the place. Not a big deal either. Now the good stuff: - rooms are very spacious - clean. The first day, we left a note to the house cleaning lady, and she attended our request and we were very happy with how the room was being cleaned. - We got a renovated room, I really like the bathroom. - beds are VERY, VERY comfortable - the mini refrigerator is definitely a huge plus. - love the ocean front walking path. My wife and I took our morning walk every day. It was awesome!! - pools are EXCELLENT. The serenity pool is great, there are many other pools tool as well. - Concierge staff helpful. You can book any activity right at the hotel, and apply the charges to the room. - I liked the open lobby as well. - Check-in person (Moses) was VERY nice. He went above and beyond to get us an ungraded room. - LOTS of snorkeling places at Wailea beach, either on south or north sides. I took my own snorkel.. lots of fish, corals, turtles, all right there by the hotel. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to go on a boat for that. I even talked to someone who did the both and she said that there was NOT a big difference, not worth paying close to 100 bucks per person to be on a boat then do the Molokini snorkeling if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to try different places around the area. Makena beach (by Prince hotel), wailea beach, etc.. - different shops and restaurants right at the hotel - I could keep on adding stuff here. Additional comments: Parking: I heard a LOT of BAD comments about poor parking etc.. I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find that to be a big problem. Yes, parking is a little smaller than what we have here, but if the space I found was not big enough, I would simply look for a bigger space. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems with this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AT ALL. Restaurants: Longhis and Cheesburger Paradise (next to the hotel in the mall) are both very good, a little pricey for dinner but so is EVERYTHING else in Maui. We went to Walmart and bought groceries which we used for at least 1 daily meal, usually breakfast. I was very surprised to see the price of groceries, in some cases more than double. There are other affordable restaurants in Kihei \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Greek Bistro, Fredys, Maui Tacos, and others. Beaches: There are plenty of beaches nearby. One morning I decided to jog all the way down to big beach and stopped by all the beaches on my way there. Very COOL experience. Polo beach park, Poolenalena, Makena, turtle town, little beach and Big beach. Big beach is fantastic, so is little beach. Wailea Mall: Very nice mall, everything there is very expensive though. My wife and I were simply walking by and enjoying our window shopping experience. Internet: Do not use the internet at the hotel. Waaay too much money. I used an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 at Kihei, for 1/3 of the price. Marriott business center charges 65 cents per minute, minimum of 15 minutes, we paid 20 cents in Kihei, 2 minute drive from the hotel. Kihei town: Kihei has a very different feel compared to Lahaina. I like both. But we wanted to use this vacation simply to RELAX, so, Wailea was the perfect place for us. J We drove to Lahaina twice. Very nice place, lots of activities, restaurants, shops. There is a LOT more going on in lahaina than Kihei. Conclusion: We definitely LOVED the hotel and location, and would definitely go back.

We spent a few days in the upcountry at a friends house and then wanted an additional 5 days by ourselves. Wailea is much more mellow than Lahaina and it was great to have the shops next door to get a morning coffee or buy a new bathing suit. We parked over by the mall instead of the hotel parking which we found more convenient and a short walk. The valet would be my only complaint about parking--when we were unloading they were vehement that we could not park there. My husband said how about a welcome or a hello rather than a you can't park here. We were unloading and had they been nicer, perhaps they could have gotten a tip. Walking over to the mall parking was peaceful and convenient. The pools abound at this Marriott. I was able to swim laps alone and mid-day in the upper main pool, it's cooler and I think that was why. The adult only pool was gorgeous! And you could whale watch while relaxing. We wondered why there were no adult only hot-tubs and are always amazing by hottubs riddled with young children. We were, however, able to enjoy the hottubs to ourselves much later in the day. I liked the sparceness of the front of the hotel with just a few loungers oceanside. It was more peaceful that way. We jogged the path down to the other hotels and found them to be circus-like with loungers, people, etc. We knew at this point, we had made the right choice. Our partial view room was large and comfortable. We bought yogurt, granola, fruit and juice and put it all in our little fridge so we could have breakfast on our lanai. We did not use the internet, at $12 for 24 hours, I found that pricey. The running path was nice, although it seemed a lot of people went to Kehei for a jog too. The fitness center was great for weights after an outdoor run or if the weather is bad. We had cocktails and appetizers on the balcony of the restaurant and found the food and service to be lovely.

The hotel does not have a beachfront location, but there was a short walking path to both beaches located north and south of the property. The grounds were well maintained, but were almost \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsparse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by Hawaii standards with a well manicured grass lawn and tropical plants situated in beds around the property. It felt very clean and well cared for, but it was certainly not lush. My opinion of the hotel was that you could pick up the property and plop it down anywhere else in the U.S. and it would \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Meaning that, to me, it did not feel like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hawaii\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no lush tropical feel, no tiki wood, no tropical floral prints in the rooms. The only area that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfelt like Hawaii\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was around the open-aired lobby, where tall banyan trees shaded an open area with a small koi pond and waterfall. At night, the staff would light tiki torches around the property, including the lobby, creating a soft, calm glow. We booked a standard garden view room, but were upgraded at check-in to a partial ocean view next to their recently built serenity pool. The view from our room was lovely and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpartial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 view from inside the room became a full ocean view when sitting outside on the lanai. Inside the room, the bathroom was well maintained, the shower was clean and the entire space looked to have been recently updated with white linens on the bed and soft down pillows. My husband did complain about the bed that it was too soft, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me. The only concern about our room amenities was the television, which was outdated and had a remote that barely worked, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us since we certainly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book a trip to Hawaii to sit in our room and watch tv. My one complaint about the hotel is the service, and after one full day at the property, we had to adjust our expectations on service to align with the level the hotel was offering. Once we did that, it was a nice stay. As follows, is what prompted us to adjust our expectations on service: You can decide for yourself, based upon what rate you are paying to stay at this property, whether this is acceptable to you or not. Our second full day in Maui, we visited Haleakala to watch the sunrise. Upon return, we noted that our room had been cleaned, but they had failed to provide us any washrags. We called the front desk to ask for someone to bring us some rags. The front desk answered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aloha, I am currently helping a guest, may I place you on hold?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd upon which I replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No thank you, I will call back later.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We decided to forego trying to get some rags and headed out to Wailea beach. Upon return, I was very ready for a shower, so I called again, but this time I called using the At Your Service button on the phone. A lady picked up the phone and our conversation went as follows: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At your service, how may I help you?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, I would like to see if someone could deliver some rags to our room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Accusatory tone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do you need the rags for?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Response \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, the staff cleaned our room this morning and there were no rags in the room for us to use.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What are they for? Why do you need rags? Still accusatory. I politely responded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To bathe with? I just returned from the beach and would like to take a shower and have no wash rags. If someone does not want to bring us any, I can use a handtowel, but I would prefer to use a wash rag to clean up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At this point, her tone changed, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, I am so sorry ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122am, I thought you had spilled something in the room and were trying to clean it up on your own and wanted to offer our assistance in helping you clean. We will have those washrags to you immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 How many do you need?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My response \u00e2\u20ac\u0153two will be fine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At your service: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will have them to you immediately.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thirty minutes later, we still had no rags and I was ready to take my shower thinking we should have called before we went to the beach if it was going to take this long. At this point, I am covered in sand and suntan lotion and frustrated. So, I left the room and walked to the concierge desk at the lobby. Standing there, the concierge looked at me and asked how he could help. I replied that I called for some rags to be delivered 30 minutes ago and they had not yet been sent to my room and did he have any rags to give to me. The concierge then called someone, hung up, and told me that they would be delivered immediately. I gave him a skeptical look and he then frowned at me and replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maam, if I had rags at the desk, I would give them to you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can make your own opinions of whether my expectations were too high to expect at least an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from someone.

I liked the little shelves/drawers under the sink vanity for your stuff and extra towels. The TVs are not flat screen but this didn't bother me as I'm not in Hawaii to watch TV. The first room I was given in the main building shared a wall with the elevator shaft. It was so noisy! I asked to be moved to another room and the front desk found another room without issue.

There were times it was hard to find two available lounge chairs so this could be a problem during peak travel times. We ate at the poolside restaurant/bar one time and one time we ordered food poolside. WeI thought the food was good. Of course, all prices in Hawaii are expensive but I thought the prices here were the same or a little bit less than other resort poolside restaurants. We ate breakfast on our last morning at Mala Restaurant. The food was okay but for the cost, $26.95 per person, it was completely overpriced. The breakfast food quality wasn't that great and there weren't as many food options as other breakfast buffets I've enjoyed. Not to mention, there are little birds that fly in/out of the open-air restaurant. This doesn't really bother me as it's a common thing in Hawaii and they had all the hot food covered with lids and the other things covered with plastic wrap. The problem was people didn't close the plastic wrap after they took some of whatever it was (toppings for the cereal, pastries, etc) and the birds had fun jumping into the bowls and snacking. Yuck! We found most of the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I had a less than friendly front desk person help me one time and one waiter at the poolside restaurant/bar who was completely rude.

There are not enough self-parking spaces for all hotel guests. Additionally, the parking spaces are so small. Most of the cars can barely fit in the spot so people use two spaces or infringe over the parking space line. It was frustrating because there were always so many empty valet spaces.

I was able to enter the room without issue but upon exiting, the deadbolt had somehow locked even though I didn't touch it. After repeated attempts at opening the door, I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to the room. Unfortunately I was on my way to an ocean cruise and was running late, this delay really made me run late. No one from the hotel called me after the fact to apologize for the inconvenience.

The quality of service at Hyatt was so above and beyond my expectation that I got a terrible culture shock when we moved to Marriott. I got my reservation of Marriott from priceline auction last Nov. Because it was last Nov, I basically prepaid a pre-recession price which was pretty much the same as what Marriott is currently offering as their special, if not more expensive. But I knew I took the risk and I knew I would get the most basic room. This, I cannot complain. What I could not believe was this particular Marriott's quality of service and some other stuff, from top to bottom. It is almost like a culture embedded in their property. Many thing were accomplished halfheartedly. Yes, the place was renovated, but only partially. It is like someone only renovated his/her highly trafficked area in the house while leave the rest untouched or poorly maintained. When I checked in at the front desk, I asked if I could pay an upgrade. The receptionist happily agreed and asked if I would pay extra 150 dollars a night (not including resort fee and tax) to be upgraded to a ocean front room. He assured me this was one of their best room on the property. Therefore, I agreed the upgrade. The bell boy took our luggage and drove us in a golf cart to our room. Stopped in front of my eyes was the most dumpy place I had ever seen in a resort such as Marriott. The hallway of this complex, in my opinion, was like a no star motel in a small town on the side of an interstate highway, where would normally be stayed by truck drivers. I was so surprised and not sure to proceed or not. (The pictures I attached are the entrance of the complex and the dim hallway.) The complex was dark in the day light and eerie. Some lights were broken. The cleaning staffs were cleaning other rooms. Dirty plates lying on the floor. Their linen room doors were wide open. It was not a pretty scene. It looked like a humid Chinese restaurant kitchen. Yes, our room had a good view. The interior was not bad. But compare with other resort in the same class, this interior was not superior or special. The surrounding was so horrible it offset the beautiful view so much that I could not stomach 500 dollars a night for this. I was shocked, my husband was mad. We turned around and told the bell boy that we were very sorry but we had to go back to the front desk. The bell boy had some attitude, his face dropped, shake his head and signed. He made us felt so bad that we assured him that we would take care of him. At the end, we gave him 10 dollars for tip, while we only had 2 big pieces of luggage. He, showed no particular appreciation. When we went back to the front desk, the manager was not impolite, but she was cold. She immediately assigned us to another dumpy place, and told me, \"this was the original place you were supposed to stay.\" This was the first room on the right of the lobby with maximum amount of traffic you can imagine. The balcony faced another small dumpy dirt courtyard, beyond it was the main drive way where every car pulled into the lobby and every pedestrian who walked back and forth to the Shops at Wailea.

Do not dismay, because two excellent beaches are within a five minute walk either direction. The luau at the hotel was outstanding with great food and entertainment. Well worth the time and expense. The hotel has a beautiful lobby with a wonderful staircase that leads to the lower portion of the property. The ocean views from the top of the staircase are magnificent. That's the good news. The bad news is that the top of the staircase is a designated smoking area! Since this is the main route to/from the lobby and the rest of the property, we had to endure walking through groups of smokers. What was the management thinking when the made the decision to make this location a smoking area? Unbelievable. The resort charges guests a minimum of $15 per day to self park their cars in a nearby garage. This garage has the narrowest parking spaces I have ever seen including midtown Manhattan! Our midsize rental barely fit in a space. To top it off, the machine at the garage entrance was malfunctioning frequently throughout the week forcing you to go back to the front desk to get a new room key to open the gate. Personnel at the property were courteous but did not exhibit the welcoming aloha attitude I have experienced at other Hawaiian resorts. I have attached a layout of the property. Ocean front building offer fabulous views, but be aware that there is a public walking path as close as 20 feet to some of the buildings. A ground floor unit might not be the best choice if you have any concerns regarding security. Best buildings for ocean front views are 2,3,6 & 7. Overall, we enjoyed our vacation but were disappointed in the hotel experience.

We checked in without a problem and had a beautiful room with an ocean view as well as the Infinity Pool. We never had any problem with cleanliness, the maid would come as early as 9am or as late as 2 or 3pm, and then there was also a turn down service. The location is nice, located in between 2 beaches within a few minutes walk and 6 or 7 more beaches within a 5-20 minute walk along the coast. The room was very modern and the beds were very comfortable, some mornings I decided to stay in bed, since they were so comfortable. The beds provided lots of pillows 4 or 5 plus a body pillow. I always had nice friendly service within the resort, with a few exclusions I'll mention later. The resort also has a Spa on the premises, and each guest can use the steam room free with their stay - this is not advertised at all. The facilities are no where comparable to Cesears in Las Vegas, but were very nice, most of the female and all of the male attendants were very friendly. There is a kids area - only for kids and two waterslides available for everyone. I really enjoyed using the waterslides, it was a nice fun afternoon. There are a lot of activities to sign up, depending on if you want a relaxing holiday or action packed holiday. I recommend the Luao and the Hana tour all the way around the island. It's great. There are a lot more activities at a cost. Expensive to eat at the resort restaurants, less expensive to eat at the restaurants up the street, more reasonable to buy prepared meals at the deli at the general store up the street. I would recommend to check out the General Store on the main floor as well as on the 2nd floor of the Wailea Shops a 2 minute walk from the lobby. There are some great deals on food and souveniers. Some things are still expensive. I went to the restaurant on the property and didn't realize that you need to make reservations for dinner, so would have needed to wait 45 minutes or went to the bar style restaurant and are served right away. We decided to goto the bar style restaurant. The problem I had was that I asked for a grilled chicken sandwich on the menu, but it was served with a heavy topping of a local sauce that I didn't want. When I recieved the sandwich the topping was included on the sandwich and bun. I brought this to the attention of the server, she took the plate away and returned with the sandwich with the topping partially wiped off. I wiped off the rest of the topping, but spoke with the waitress and told her that if I am paying $20 for a chicken sandwich, it should be made the way that I ordered it, or I should have been offered a discount if they were not able to serve me what I had ordered. My experience using the Steam Room at the Spa was generally nice, there was one attendant at the front desk, she can come across as very unhappy sometimes. I found that when I was using the facilities for the free steam room she came across unhappy, but when I used the facilities for a paid massage she seemed more pleasant. Very little night life, not sure if its the time difference and everyone goes to bed early, but most nights i was bored and was in bed by 9pm, there were no fun things to do near the property at night.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay - after a change of rooms.\u201d", "Author": "RandomScreenName7042", "ReviewID": "UR26423854", "Content": "The hotel was fully booked when we arrived late in the night and we ended up in probably one of the worst located rooms in the hotel: immediately above the loading dock on the back side of the property.

The hotel is in a lovely location, relatively quiet compared to the commotion around the Four Season (nice), Fairmont (architecture like in 1001 Nights and nightly Luau in front of beach rooms?) or Grand Wailea (think Hilton Waikoloa, Hawaii, or Disney Land). We had an ocean front room with a nice view on the beach to the right of the hotel, which itself sits on a cliff. But there are beautiful beaches very close to the right and the left. If you go to the right, you can walk for hours, very beautiful. The hotel decor is very modern and very well maintained. The Mala hotel, which is in the Marriott but run by a different company is pricey but very good; which cannot be said for the Marriott restaurant down by the pool. Unfortunately, the service at the Marriott was on average very poor. It started with cold fries by the pool, cocktails without alcohol and staff in the activities booth too busy to talk to us because they were on a private phone call, plus the \"scam\" of the $25 resort fee. Supposedly, the $25 resort fee covers things like a free glass of champagne at Mala's and your ability to print your boarding passes. Well, it was clear that nobody at Mala was excited about our request for the free champagne, particularly if we did not state when ordering that it should be free. They should expect everybody at the hotel to order the champagne that is \"included in the resort fee\", no? You also cannot print your own boarding pass, as the business center is also not run by the Marriott. When you go there, they tell you it's $6 an hour to use the Internet. They don't volunteer any other information. My husband managed to find out that the concierge can print boarding passes for free, but you cannot look at the screen, and it was very painful...the concierge ended up being unable to print our boarding passes (which might be Hawaiian Airlines' websites' fault, but it caused 20 minutes of annoyance). I read in many of the reviews here how great the beds are at this hotel. Yes, the bedding is great, but we found the mattress much too soft. We both woke up with back problems every morning. The Marriott was so kind to turn our mattress and add memory foam on top. Which helped and was proactive, but we still found the mattress painfully soft. While Wailea is very nice, and we saw many wales from the shore and boats, it's really busy with all those hotels next to each other. You are stuck with the expensive hotel restaurants or eating at the mall (no view) if you just want to walk. Kihei has a bunch of nice places in driving distance. We liked the food at the Pupu Lounge a lot; very nice peopel. Overall, I would rather stay in a condo next time, where you can make your own breakfast and hopefully be in a more private setting. The pools at the Marriott are nice, as are the hot tubs. We thought it was overpriced though, to pay $100 to lie under a cabana for a day, with no privacy. If you like lots of privacy and peace and quiet, the beaches up north and in Malakea were great, but that strip of big hotels from the Marriott to the Fairmont appeared too busy to us. It's good if you want to be seen :-). Our favorite hotel in Maui is the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua, unfortunately, that area can get very windy, so spring is not the time. Overall, we had a fabulous time, as Maui is simply a heavenly place, and the Marriott was clean, a very nice room and all ammenities. Just not as good as we've had.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat, convenient choice in Wailea - perfect if you use points or get a great deal\u201d", "Author": "blunistgirl", "ReviewID": "UR26089149", "Content": "Just stayed here last week! Great option in Wailea. We stayed at the Fairmont here before and knew that the Marriott would not be that same experience & we kept our expectations in check. This is a more affordable resort option that will still be really nice & beautiful, but a different experience. The difference between the Marriott and the other resorts in Wailea (Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, Fairmont) is definitely \"Service.\" Here, you aren't going to be welcomed with a lei and drink upon arrival, you might have to wait in line for 5 minutes at the front desk, there will only be one very busy server at the pool and you might have to wait 20 minutes to put in your order, and there isn't going to be turn-down service at night. Does that mean this is a bad property? Absolutely not. It just isn't a 5-star resort so don't expect it to be one. We received exactly what we expected and were still very pleased. We used points so things couldn't have been better than free, but I just had to look up the rates to see how it might compare to the Fairmont or Four Seasons. Right now the Marriott has an AMAZING package from $205-$255 per night including valet parking and $25 food credit. Now THAT is a deal. If the best deal you find for your dates makes the Marriott only $50-$75 less, then other Wailea properties going to be a FAR better experience. I'd definitely recommend the Marriott if you're using points or if you can get a great deal. The additional cost at one of the other resorts will not only provide that \"service\" element that makes you feel like someone just appointed you king or queen, but it usually includes other perks like free yoga classes on the beach, free cabana (at Four Seasons vs $100 per day at Marriott), wonderful treats brought to you at the pool like cold towels and pineapple slices, staff magically knowing your name where ever you go, etc. The FS even offers free childcare during the day! I reserved the lowest possible room because that was the only way we could truly have free nights. We were pleased to receive a complimentary upgrade to an oceanview room. This was truly oceanview too! I'd almost call it oceanFRONT. We were in Hale 4 overlooking the adult infinity pool with a front view of the ocean. Ahhh...No twisting of the neck or anything. Right there. We enjoyed drinks on the lanai each night (we bought offsite and stored in the empty fridge in the room - great perk) which was great & allowed us to save a lot of $ not needing to go to the hotel bar. We wouldn't have enjoyed that at our room if we didn't have that view! However, housekeeping gets 1 star. On our first day, they didn't try to make up the room until 4:30pm when we were coming back to shower up for dinner. We just asked for towels and didn't have them clean it. The rest of the week was more reasonable. We never received all the toiletries each day. Many times we received shampoo & conditioner (which we didn't even need), but no lotion....or no body wash, although they could see it was missing or gone. I had to call to have some delivered. We would sometimes get 4 bath towels, but usually only 2. We showered at least twice a day, so having 4 was handy, especially when they cleaned the room late. They also didn't CLEAN. Dirty feet marks in the shower from being barefoot at the pool all day? Still there after housecleaning visit. Same goes for makeup on the bathroom counter - there all week. We walked into the room one time while they were servicing it to get something and they wash the glasses in the room in the bathroom sink. You don't get \"new\" ones. We had the ironing board out on Day 2, and they never put it away all week. They also swept, but never really cleaned if you could see dirty shoe marks somewhere (the whole room is tiled, so this is easy). I didn't complain, but it was quite frustrating & we were happy it was free. Like I mentioned before, this would never happen at the Fairmont or FS. The property is really pretty and feels updated. It is nice & there are many loungers at the ocean to whale-watch, enjoy the sunset or just relax listening to the waves crash in. It is also extremely wonderful that it is immediately next door to the Shops at Wailea - general store, coffee, Lapperts Ice Cream, restaurants, etc. We also loved that it was along the beach path allowing an easy walk to the other resorts for dining and recreation. An affordable & convenient option in Wailea! We seriously may not have needed a rental car! Overall it was a good experience & I'd definitely go again with points or if I found a really good deal.

The location of the Marriott is outstanding. Two beaches on either side of the property to choose from, very close to the water (since it's an older *but renovated* property, building codes allowed construction practically right on the water), and adjacent to the Shops at Wailea with a boatload of shopping and dining choices without having to drive anywhere.

We are both Platinum preferred and were staying on Rewards points. Upon check-in, we were told we had the option of paying the standard $25/day fee, $18/day for valet, or $15/day for self-park (had the option because we were staying on points). Also, we had reserved a garden view room assuming that we would get an upgrade since we live at a Marriott throughout the year. The hotel was at 100% occupancy and was actually oversold (what about this economic downturn we keep hearing about?!) so the upgrade options were limited (had the same issue at Avis- demand outweighs supply at the moment). Anyway, we were upgraded to a partial oceanview (expecting to see a sliver of the ocean), instead we were pleasantly surprised with a FANTASTIC view of the infinity pool and ocean (Hale 1). We were thrilled! The rooms are nice/recently renovated. We loved the tile floor (I hate when there is carpet in a tropical location). The balconies are great and we enjoyed many mornings/evenings watching the whales. After reading many of the reviews, we were prepared to fight the other lounge chair sharks at the infinity pool and put our towels down by 8am (of course being newbies on the first day we didn't realize the chairs we chose were the last to receive sun!- these were the chairs on the main level in the middle). Word of advice....definitely reserve lounge chairs ASAP since they fill up very quickly. There is a sign that says they don't allow guests to reserve chairs and any inactivity after 30 min. will result in loss of the chair (never saw that policy followed!). They have other options such as cabanas ($100/day) and blue circular lounge sofas (only $25/day). We reserved a blue thing one day and it was well worth it (especially since we were able to sleep in knowing we had a reserved spot!). Terry is the main server in the infinity pool area and while she is extremely friendly, she is stretched too thin. She is the ONLY server for that entire pool area so you can imagine as drink/food orders pick up, she's hard to come by! We had some of the frozen cocktails throughout the week (pretty good, only $10, $8 during happy hour (3-5pm I think). The food was ok- basic salads, burgers, sandwiches but way over priced. An ahi ceasar salad was $22! We discovered the Whaler General Store at the Shops at Wailea which serves sandwiches, salads, sushi, hot plate, etc. (way cheaper). The beach path is great and extends throughout all the resorts. Lots of walkers/joggers/whale watchers throughout the day. The Marriott is close to two beaches but we ended up just staying at the pool most days. The staff was all very nice. Housekeeping was very friendly and efficient (nightly turndown service with a flower). The valet guys were great (helped my husband take off the top to our jeep) and even gave us recommendations for places to eat, things to do. The bellmen, front desk, and concierge were all great as well. We didn't use the spa at all (besides taking advantage of 50% off all Pureology products...unheard of!!!). The location is great- in between two beaches, right on the water, close to the Shops at Wailea, quick drive to Kihei (although not much to see), convienent trips to Paia (only 35 min.) and the airport, ~40 min. to Lahaina.

We rented the covered cabana at the serenity infinity pool and that was great - $100 per day with towels, bottled water and a fruit tray - a little expensive but we enjoyed it and rented one more than once. The pool scene at the adult pool was quiet but still friendly - very relaxing. You could literally watch the whales jumping around in the water (it was whale season) from the pool. Drinks at the pool were hard to get - service friendly but slow. Not a big deal for us, but worth mentioning. The beach front walking path goes through the resort as it does through all the resorts so you're very connected to the other resorts and are next door to two beaches. Shopping: The resort is nearby Wailea shopping (as in a five minute walk away) - which is fantastic - it has everything from the Gap to Banana Republic to Coach, Fendi and Louis Vuitton to general convenience stores, swimsuit stores and restaurants and ice cream. If you don't have time to get everything you need for your stay, you can pick it up here (I wish I would have known that so I could have avoided overnight delivery charges for last minute items I ordered for the trip). You should note the very low sales tax but I did see that some Coach items were more expensive than usual. The Marriott resort shop had drinks, medicine type items, and some gift store items but was a little disappointing, but that was okay since the other shops were right there. The jewelry store at the Marriott was really great - they had a couple of sales while were there so ask about upcoming sales before you buy items. Marriott Spa: The spa was fine - just had a massage treatment and mani/pedi. They added some sort of service charge (20%) and the person could not explain that charge other than to say the service providers received a small percentage of it - we still tipped but did not understand this charge and it somewhat tainted our experience. They did not have OPI products but they were allegedly adding them to their nail salon. Comparison to other Resorts: We did a spa treatment at Grand Wailea and had dinner at the Four Seasons in Wailea. Both resorts were beautiful but there was something more tranquil and almost classier about the Marriott. That may sound surprising but the Marriott's (streamlined?) modesty seems more modern and relaxing than some of the more ornate grounds at Grand Wailea and the Four Seasons. I'd probably stay at the Marriott over these other resorts, but would try the other resorts if they cost less than the Marriott. You really can't go wrong. Wailea is great as is all of the hotels there. Minor Complaints (Service): we had problems with internet service in the room and the free wireless service in the common areas was extremely slow. Ultimately, there was an equipment problem in our room that wasn't discovered and resolved until the day before we left despite numerous calls. Overall service at the resort was good, but was not amazing (but nothing to complain about). Check in/out was quick and easy. We were unable to upgrade or get a late check out but they do have hospitality rooms to use if you have a late flight (that were not suggested to us when we were denied late check out, but that we learned about from someone else). Tips: Matteos Restarant is nearby and a good place for a (nice) pizza lunch. We did not eat at the resort as the lunch options weren't that great (but I am a picky eater) and dined at places we found in a book that reviewed all the best Maui restauarants. For nearby fine dining, we recommend Capische (LOVED it), Spago at Four Seasons, and Mama's Fish House (about 40 min. away). The ice cream at the Wailea shopping center is also good. We enjoyed doing the Hana highway and we also did powered hang gliding (I hate flying and felt totally safe in an open powered hang glide). Summary: loved Wailea, loved the Marriott, would recommend Marriott Wailea and would definitely return.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "SilverlakeJake", "ReviewID": "UR25202228", "Content": "This location could not have been better.

Better yet, hop in your rental car and drive south to Makena Beach which is great for snorkeling and not crowded like Wailea. We arrived at 11PM and were greeted with smiles and great service. The open air welcome area is so beatiful and complete with tiki torches and comfy sofas. The rooms were clean and well appointed, but who's in Maui to sit in your room? The 'ocean view' room we had was on the sixth floor with views of the hotel grounds and ocean in the distance. Some people may want the ocean front room, but honestly didn't think it worth it considering the beach is right there within easy access. The pools were great and clean. Food is typical of Maui, expensive. My favorite was the burger joint at the shopping mall next door, cheap and delicious. I believe it's called Cheeseburgers in Paradise.

Its location is absolutely georgeous. The Marriott Wailea Beach is one of the older resorts on Maui and is hence built very closely to the water. You have great water views from many of their rooms. The fact that there is no beach in front of the hotel did not matter to us. There is a beach on either side of the resort property, about 2-5 mins away, depending on the location of your room. The resort is big, but it maintains a certain cozyness through its widespread layout. There are numerous pools, including an adult-only serenity pool (ie it appears to extend into the ocean) and a kids pool with water slides. The rooms are spacious and must have been renovated not too long ago. While some people prefer carpet, I think tiled floors work quite well considering that you bring in sand from the beach. We had an ocean-view, which was actually almost like an ocean front as we had beautiful waterviews even from inside the room. Having said all this, you might ask why I only rated this hotel \"Average\". Well, while the staff was extremely friendly at all times, they did not seem to be willing to grant any guest requests. It felt a little bit like we were supposed to thank them for being able to stay at their resort on beautiful Maui. We certainly didn't ask for much during our stay as we spent a lot of time at the beach and exploring the island, but those few requests were not met. A few examples: 1. Arrival Coming from New York, we obviously had an extremely long trip behind us when we arrived at 11:00pm on Saturday night. We pulled up to the front of the hotel and unloaded the car. Because of the unreasonable valet charge of $25/day, we decided to self park. However, in order to get my fiancee (who is 6-month pregnant) and her 6 year old daughter up to the room as soon as possible, I asked if I could check in before parking the car. They denied, because they \"need to keep the space open\". Yet, there is space for 10+ cars and only one other car was parked there besides ours at the time. At 11pm at night, I'd consider this a minimum courtesy to the guest. 2. Parking This gets even worse due to the parking situation. The Marriott has layed out their parking situation to make people cough up the extra $$$ for valet parking. All the spots close to the hotel are \"valet only\" - plenty of open spots at all time. Regular guest parking is in the garage, which late at night is usually completely packed (small spots too so that lots of people occupy 2 spots at once) and it can take 10-15 mins until to park the car and get back to the hotel. 3. Marriott Rewards Benefits (Part 1) The recent changes in the Marriott Rewards Program (all members of the program will know what I'm referring to) have made hotel rewards a lot more costly and the program much less attractive compared to others like the Starwood Preferred Guest Program. During this stay, I tried to take advantage of two benefits that I should get as a silver member, yet none was granted by the Marriott Wailea Beach. 3a. Check cashing As a Silver/Gold/Platinum member, one is entitled to cash personal checks at the front desk. I tried so, but it was denied, because my street address was not printed on the check, only my full name. Once again, I do consider this just bad service. I have cashed the same checks multiple times at different Marriotts, so why not this time? Security concerns stated by the front desk manager are simply ridiculous, considering that as a silver member Marriott knows my personal details much better than many other vendors who gladly accept my checks. 3b. Late Checkout Our request for late checkout was also denied, citing that the hotel was fully booked. Once again, as a silver member I should get preferred late checkout. Even if the hotel is booked, there will be enough people checking in much later than 3pm, so an extension for an extra couple of hours to 2pm should be possible. Once again, while the staff was extremely friendly, it was obvious that they did not see the need of accomodating their guests. 4. Food I do not recommend eating at the Marriott, especially if you have a car to get around. We tried a couple of things at their poolside restaurant and they were only mediocre in quality, yet expensive. If your stuck to the Wailea resort area, you might have to do it, but otherwise there are plenty of more reasonable options in nearby Kihei. The shops at Weilea also have a couple of restaurants if you don't want to drive. The breakfast buffett at the Marriott is not bad, but again pretty expensive. If you do want to go for the full breakfast, pop over to the Four Seaons (15-20 mins walk along the beach path). Their buffet is only a few dollars more, but it is well worth it. Not only for their amazing buffet, but also to be reminded that excellent service does still exist - if you know where to go.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "johnnykuta", "ReviewID": "UR25049305", "Content": "Had a wonderful time at the Marriott in December with my girlfriend.

It is a beautiful hotel, large rooms, comfortable beds and thoroughly clean. The problem is with the people staying at the hotel. They have an attitude that is above and beyond anything I have ever experience. There is a \"serenity\" pool in the back that we had to walk past everyday. This pool was beautiful, overlooking the ocean but the only lounge chairs that were \"free\" were arranged side by side on a grass area or on the concrete with about 1 foot separating you from your neighbor. So you would think that with all that coziness, someone would be engaging in a lighthearted fun conversation. Not so. My husband and I called it the \"dead\" pool. There was not a single person talking, there was a sign that said \"no cell phones\" which I agree with but no talking??? It was really weird. It was like the people were more concerned with how they looked than actually having some fun. The double umbrella lounge chairs were for rent, $50 per day and the gazebo covered chairs were for rent $100 per day. No-one rented any of them so it was crowed on the\"free\" chairs. So naturally our room was directly behind this pool with the shower right across from our patio and the pathway to the rest rooms went directly past our patio. My husband and I went scuba diving everyday and had all of our scuba gear laid out on the lawn in front of our patio because there was no place to hang it to dry. I am not exhagerating when I say that 99% of the people that walked past us said not one word, made eye contact, nodded or even smiled. Only one guy said \"yea that's the way to do it\". Only because we decided to buy our own beers from the local store and drink them on our patio while we were drying out from diving. We decided to try the other pool by the bar to see if there was some life and conversation. We travel alot and enjoy meeting people. Well the only person that had a conversation with us was a little girl who told us she was rich and that she just sold her horse on e-bay. So that pool didn't do well with us either. We are beach people but when you are exhausted from diving and surfing, it's nice to relax by a pool for a little while and maybe have some fun conversation with people or even watch people having fun. Not here. So who cares right? We are there to celebrate our 20th anniversary, dive in the beautiful Molikini, surf and see the whales. We did all of this and enjoyed ourselves so much but we only wish that we stayed in South Kehei which is about 1 mile away, brimming with life and smiling faces. Our breakfast at the Marriott was $25.00 per day so naturally we went out and found the south Kehei Cafe that gave you so much food that you didn't need to eat for the entire day and the breakfast was $10.00 The coffee was good too. As a matter of fact, the Marriott charges you $25.00 per day plus tax on top of your bill just for \"bed making, two bottles of water being left in your room per day, unlimited phone calls to the main land (so does my cell phone) and the right to park your own car instead of using valet. I thought that was just as abusive as the $25.00 breakfast but maybe I am just a low maintenance kind of person and don't really care about having my bed made or two bottles of water. So now onto the dinner. Two fat filled, not cooked right, rib eye dinners, no alcohol drinks and desert was $134.00 We went to Ruth's Chris the next day and for only $20.00 more we dined on perfectly prepared, lean and delicious, \"cowboy steak\", fillet mignon ,steamed veggies, augratin potatoes, stuffed baked clams appetizers, two alcohol drinks and desert. What a great place to spend your money! You can walk there from the Marriott. Diving was the best I've ever done. Dive with B&B. The concierge won't know who they are because they are in south Kehei and not huge like Maui Dive Shop. B&B was a small operation of local people that are friends with the curator of the Aquarium. The curator uses B&B when ever he needs to go out so you are in the best hands with them. They meet at 5:45am and you are going out to Molikini in the dark. By the time you get there, the sun is barely peeking over the mountain. When you descend, you get to see the sleeping sharks and watch all of the fish wake up and start eating. Another great dive was at a little boat wreck that was loaded with the biggest turtles I've ever seen. They even pose for your camera. So to end this very long rambling, if you are fun and low key, don't go to the Marriott Wailea. It's too depressing and expensive even though it is very pretty, clean and beautifully located. The whole island is beautiful. I can't wait to go back, but to South Kehei next time.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Klark", "ReviewID": "UR23674966", "Content": "We truly enjoyed this hotel.

Other than this, the overall experience at the resort was great. The room is very spacious and well maintained, but the bathroom can definitely be updated. The bathroom is some what small comparing to the overall size of the room. Outside the room, the resort is very well maintained. They have a children pool and a adult pool. The ocean view from the adult pool is amazing. There is also a beach trail which is about couple miles long, and it is great for morning walks. I really enjoyed going down to the rocky sections along the beaches. You can find interesting marine lifes. In my opinion, it is more fun than going to the Maui Ocean Center. The location of the resort is great if the goal of the trip is to relax at the beach and play golf. If planning on going to Hanna or west maui, then the drive can be tiresome. If going during the whale season, then you may be able to see the whales from the resort. Just remember to bring a pair of binoculars. Also, there is a Laua going on few times a week right at the resort. You can sit at the children pool and enjoy the free Laua which usually cost over $50/person. :) By the way, the resort charges $25/day service fee.

Our family had a timeshare in Ka'anapali where we spent most of our nine days on Maui, but needed a place to stay for our first day since the timeshare was only for seven nights. There were six of us (plus a toddler) in our group, and we had three rooms that were purchased with Marriott points, so we weren't exactly in the ocean-view suites. But the rooms were gorgeous and clean, each having a delightfully comfy King bed and a lanai (though overlooking the parking lot, my parents' room actually had a nice garden view) and though I normally prefer carpet, I absolutely loved the tile floors in each room for such a clean look. Our rooms were also very convenient to the lobby (I LOVE the outdoor lobby) and front desk, so that made for a really nice check-in. One TEENSY downside - check-in was made a much longer process than it should have been. The front desk clerk was super nice and competent, but he was kind of taking his sweet time with the whole process and we really ready for our rooms (and dinner), as we had just finished nearly 24 hours of travel from Ohio. After checking out our rooms, four of us went over to the bar and grill for a light dinner/snack and two stayed behind to order room service and deal with a very cranky toddler. The restaurant was pricey (as to be expected), but the food was delicious - their gourmet mac & cheese was different than anything I've ever had and worth a try! My sister, on the other hand, who had stayed behind to order room service, seemed underwhelmed by her food, and was slightly appalled at the $9 they paid for an ordinary hot dog for my nephew - when in Rome, I suppose. After a great night of sleep, we found ourselves lucky that our first daytime view of Maui was at this resort, as it's breathtaking. After muffins and bagels purchased from the nearby market, we all decided to take advantage of the Marriott's later-than-usual checkout time (noon) and spend a few hours enjoying their pools before we left. First we wandered over to the kiddie area, which was really nice - especially since there were two slightly larger slides that we adults enjoyed, too! After that, the toddler was taken back to the rooms for cleanup while the four remaining adults went to enjoy the Serenity Pool for a little while.

We were not disappointed. In fact, we went to the Four Seasons for lunch one day and the pool area was so crowded you barely had enough room to put your flip flops on the tiled pool area. Anyway,lets talk about the Marriott. It was open air and it was a very comfortable place to stay. Not over pretentious! Since we were all adults we especially enjoyed the Infinity Pool, for adults only. It was nice and quiet and Terry and Anita were the best waitresses! They even remembered our names and where we were from! They really made the day go by fast, at the pool! We ate breakfast in the hotel, most mornings and my husband and I shared it. The omelet and the lox and bagels were very good. We really never had any bad food, as we ate at the pool almost everyday. Pricey as every place in Hawaii, especially Maui. I did ask for recommendations for dinner, and was told to not miss Serento's or The Waterfront. Well we made Christmas Day dinner reservations at Serento's and we were very disappointed. The spaghetti and meatballs were awful, my husband and my friend's husband had them and they both hated it! My girlfriend and myself had the veal marsala and the pasta we had with it was barely cooked...talk about al dente!! We would not suggest this restaurant to anyone. Now about The Waterfront....the food was good, not great, the prices were slightly lower than other restaurants, the decor straight out of the 80's and we had a \"visitor\" almost at our table...yes it was the biggest palmetto bug we had ever seen. YuK!!!! I am glad we were done with our dinner at that point. My husband was taking a picture of it when our waiter just said oh it is just a palmetto bug, we have them here all the time, after all we are by the water!!! Not for me at those prices! We are not snobs, but we do fine dining all the time, so we were not impressed with these two recommendations. We did have a wonderful dinner at Mama's Fishouse! In face, the best dinner of our whole trip. The fish was outstanding and the service impecable. The dinner at Tommy Bahama's, next door at the Shops at Wailea was very good too. We enjoyed the chowder as well as our entrees. We also dined at Ruth's Chris, always good, was not disappointed here either. We had breakfast at Longi's and it was good but not as good as the hotel breakfast. We also had a wonderful dinner, at Pacifico's in Lahina. My husband and I ate there 5 years previously and it was good as always...I highley recommend them for dinner. The hotel room we had when I arrived was supposed to be an oceanfront room and It wasn't what I thought a oceanfront room should be, but I just went and asked if we could be moved and we were, without hassle, and were given room 4510 it was overlooking the infinity pool and the ocean. We had sunset on our lanai everynight. The staff at the hotel were always helpful and very courteous and I would given them all 5 stars.

Upon arrival, we were happy to have been upgraded from a terrace view to an ocean front room. To be fair, I am a Marriot Rewards Silver Member, and this may have helped with the upgrade. Nonetheless, we were delighted to have such a wonderful room and beautiful view from our lanai. The rooms have been recently updated, along with the rest of the property. Bathroom was a bit small, but very nice touches of granite. Pros: The open air lobby is great. We had stayed at the Hapuna Prince on the Big Island, which also has an open air lobby. Everyone at the property was very friendly, with perhaps one exception. Specifically, I would say that Terry & Anita were the most incredible waitresses during our stay. They were the regular attendants at the Adults Only Infinity Pool (see pics). This is a brand new addition to the property and is not to be missed. What an incredible view of the ocean and mountains!! Most days, we had the breakfast buffet included and it was good, but not great. We splurged on breakfast at the Four Seasons (just a short walk down the path that lines the ocean) and it was incredible. There are two beaches nearby, and we preferred the smaller Ulua beach, just north of the property. We ate our dinners off property every night, except one night we did have room service. Can't miss restaurants are Mama's Fish House. By far, the most incredible seafood we've ever had and with it's own beach right in front of the property, it is absolutely beautiful. This is truly one of the best dining experiences my wife and I have ever had. Also, we took a very scenic drive late in the day up to Lahaina and ate at a delicious French Restaurant, Gerards. It is set in an old Victorian Era Home. We also had the opportunity to take a catamaran sail to Molikini. Many of these trips utilize very large boats and seem a bit overly touristy. We definitely recommend taking the catamaran that departs from the Maui Prince Hotel just south of Wailea. The catamaran had room for up to 80 guests, but we only had 15 plus 3 crewmembers. A pleasant experience indeed, as we snorkeled with many sea turtles and witnessed about half a dozen humback whales!! Cons: Maybe we're just not that picky, but I can't think of a specific con that really upset myself or my wife during our trip. Maybe that the ribs I ordered for room service were a bit overcooked!!", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for your money\u201d", "Author": "sosehaku", "ReviewID": "UR22808674", "Content": "Lets start with the staff.....Fabulous.

Our lanai overlooked the infinity pool & the ocean beyond - great view. - We ate breakfast on the lanai every single morning :-) - Loved the kids pool (my kids would be happy there all day) and also the Wailea beach was great, boogie boarding was a new sport my girls discovered here. -Our family doesn't like to eat restaurant food too much so we had to keep it simple soups and sandwiches kind of fare - when we landed at the airport, we rented the car and drove straight to the Walmart by the airport and stocked up on all the snacks and breakfast foods we could find (that walmart was also great for buying souvenirs on our way out at half the price of Hilo stores and other touristy places) We then stopped at the Safeway in Kihei and got everything else fresh we needed. - We also loved the Whaler General Store & ABC store at the Shops @ Wailea which is next door to the Marriott. I mean next-door, walk over and the Whalers store has a nice little deli counter and hot soups daily. They also sell whatever you may have forgotten or not carried in your carry on baggage. - DO NOT rent the snorkel gear or boogie boards from the hotels along Wailea.

Next door, at the Whalers, you can BUY the boogie board for $20!!! - We did not use any of the restaurants on site but they all looked nice and were busy in the evenings. - We did watch the luau for free by hanging out by the kiddie pool at that time and had the same great view for free. - The sunsets were awesome, each and every evening, for Free :-) - We used all the pools at the Marriott and they are all very well maintained. - The staff at the hotel were courteous and we had a good experience over all. - My kids did all the complimentary kids activities they had going on in the lobby and under the banyan tree - hula dancing, lei making, postcard making.

The groudskeepers worked in tandem and weed wacked for over an hour until several people at the pool complained. The second issue deals with \"towel cards\" At check - in you will be given towle cards to be used to get a beach towel. One card per person entitles you to one towel - no exceptions. Your towel card is taken once you are given a towel and noot returned until the towel is returned. This policy is strictly enforced and frankly a little petty considering the cost of the room and the meals etc. One afternoon I forgot my towel card in the room and learned a lesson on what Marriott service means.

The view from the balcony was excellent and watching the sunset every night was heaven. The hotel is very well presented and the rooms are contemporary in design and well kitted out (TV, Fridge, CD player, safe etc.). Wailea is certainly the exclusive resort on the island with manicured lawns and pretty beaches. Fortunately, we had hired a car for the two weeks which enabled use to freely travel the island and I would recommend this as the choice of dining is very limited at wailea and very expensive. Indeed, our only complaint of the hotel is the dining. The on-site restaurant (ran seperately to the hotel) was expensive and only a limited menu. However, we made full use of Kihei (10-15 mins drive) which is a seaside town with many good options for takeaways (e.g. Thailand Cuisine, Chinese, Shangri-la Indian and the Outback steak house) which were all good value. We also made use of the Safeway supermarket to buy lunches etc. We visited Oahu (Honalulu) using the island hopper planes (good value) and booked a trip to the Big Island to see the volcanoes. Both of these I would recommend to anyone. Overall, I can summerize by saying the hotel is excellent, ensure you hire a car and if you can, go see the volcano.

All the staff we encountered were very polite to us. We had a terrace view room on the 6th floor. From it you could see the neighboring condo complex as well as the ocean and beach. The view was actually nicer than the view my parents had and they paid for an ocean view. There is a small refrigerator in the room which comes in handy for storing your own drinks or leftovers. The bed was very comfortable for my wife and me. The decor was clean and simple, not the usual tacky wallpaper and ugly floral print that you find in many other hotels. There is a small safe in the closet. There is an adult pool, a kids pool and a pool for anyone. The three pools are located in different parts of the complex. We stayed at the anybody pool. It was not crowded at all (everyone else was probably trying to find a chair at the adult pool). There was no competition for lounge chairs. This is where the bar and eating place is.

I purchased the room through Priceline for $160 a might after doing some research and figuring out that on Priceline you will either get the Maui Prince or the Marriott if you select \"Resort.\" I saw enough decent reviews here that I figured we be okay either way and figured that we'd be spending most of our time away from the hotel anyway. I'll start by saying that we aren't really the big resort types. If you read my other Maui reviews, you'll see that we like small secluded places. That said, we needed to be in Wailea for the Maui Triathlon to watch a family member, so resorts seemed to be our only option. Check in went slowly. The bellman was nice enough but the woman at the desk wasn't particularly warm. She immediately tried to sell us a $75 upgrade to an \"ocean view\" room, or a $100 upgrade an \"ocean front\" room. If we'd wanted to pay more, do you think that we would have made our reservation through Priceline? Once we declined that she was kind enough to give us a room overlooking the traffic circle backing up on the elevator shafts. Okaym I git the rom through Priceline, but does that mean that you have to give me the worst room in the place. Even the bellman told us that it was bad. I'm a light sleeper and knew that listening to the elevators all night wasn't really going to work for me. So, back to the front desk where we acquiesced to an upgrade and got moved to a junior suite with a view of the loading dock. It was officially an \"ocean view\" room as you could see the ocean from the patio (while listening to the trucks idle). Oh, and don't forget the extra $25 dollar a night resort fee. The room: It was big, which is a plus, but had the most uncomfortable furniture known to man. The bed was so soft that we had to have them flip the mattress after the first night so that it would be a bit more firm. The couch, on the other hand, was rock hard and had a really straight back. I know because I slept on it the first night when the smooshy bed drove me crazy. (BTW - they told us that the bed is \"standard issue\" so this is NOT the place for you if you like a firm mattress.) As for the grounds, the pools and such were just okay. The adult pool is a nice concept but you really have to get there early to get a chair...or pay $100 to reserve one of the poolside cabanas. I did enjoy going early in the morning and swimming laps. Its nice and long! Did I mention that the Marriott doesn't have a beach? Its a short walk to the beaches but it would have been nice to have chairsand such to take there. Meals - don't eat here. Overpriced and average. Now the rub. Our friends were staying at the Four Seasons and we quickly realized that is a much better value. For just over $400 a night the mountain view rooms are pricier, but worth every penny. They had so many freebies - from lounge chairs and umbrellas at the beach to watermelon slices and otter pops at the pool. While our hotel seemed to be nickel and dime-ing us, the Four Seasons seems to make every effort to make sure you have an effortless vacation. We took the kayak/snorkel trip from the Four Seasons and it was great. Again, meals there are overpriced, but my breakfast at the Four Seasons beat the Marriott breakfast hands down.

I didn't understand how such an amazing pool with such an incredible view didn't have it's own bar. So, me being me, I asked her what the deal was. She told me that apparently the hotel is owned by another company out of NYC and after financial troubles Marriot swooped in to \"manage\" the property. I guess there were plans to build a bar at the pool the the money ran out and that Marriot simply wouldn't invest any more money in to a property they didn't own until vacancy (ie, profits) picked up. Now for the review. My stay was extremely pleasant. The only thing I could complain about were the prices. But hey, welcome to Hawaii in the summer.

Hawaii being Hawaii I think we all know that you're not gonna book a room at a resort property on the beach at any of the desirable islands and get a beer a burger for five bucks.

Worst thing they can do is say no which is what they're essentially saying if you don't ask. The room was great. And though it was considered and \"ocean view\" I thought it was great that she kindly pointed out that this room really only had a \"sliver\" of a view of the ocean. She was right. So....I was happy. Pools were great. and the gardens around the facility were beautiful In regards to food I recommend a little trick. Go up to the shopping plaza at the top end of their parking lot.

We made the decision to checkout the next day only three hours after we checked in. Here is a summary our my experiences; The valet parking attendant who helped us upon arrival was lazy and unfriendly. The self parking is very easy and close to the hotel main entrance. So really there is no need to valet is anyway. When I checked into the Westin Maui, there are friendly staffs at the door to greet and provide followers and ice water. None of that at the Marriott.

The front desk person told me the all the bellmen were busy, and it is an easy walk to our room. What she forgot to tell me was that there are no elevators at those hotel room buildings! We ended up get lost and have to drag the heavy suitcases up and down the stairs! The snack and drink bar by the kids pool area was closed. And the towel service station staff was not where to be found. I have to ask the security guy to get it for me. I later found out that the hotel cut down the services due to low occupancy. The kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool area was dirty, and not well maintained. The much talked about adult pool itself is nice looking. However, it is surrounded by the old hotel rooms, and not so nice landscape. Marriott did spend $70 million to upgrade the hotel. But it is not enough to cover up the aging of this property. The hallway of the hotel is dirty, and old, as if you are walking inside a cheap hotel. The room itself is good, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the tile flooring which gives you a very cold feeling. In summary, this hotel is old, and under maintained.

We had a partial ocean view room which was beautiful. It also overlooked the overflowing adult-only pool with cabanas (only downside was that they were rented out for $50 per day!). The pools were great, and overlooked the ocean. The restaurant was fabulous but expensive for dinner. The breakfast buffet was very good as well-- find out if you can book a deal where you get it for free because otherwise it can get expensive. The rooms were spacious and tastefully decorated, and very clean. No problems with anything in the room or with hotel staff who were very helpful. Room service was great as well. The balcony was one of the favorite features of the room because of its wonderful view. The only downside to this hotel would be its confusing layout-- we got lost more than once trying to find the right building, the right hallway, and the right room! We also used the spa which was beautiful. One complaint about the spa- we had booked massages and manicures weeks ahead of time, and when we arrived at the spa the staff informed us that the manicure person was out sick that day and they would be unable to have anyone else do them. They did book us manicures at their sister salon which was inside the Wailea complex, but the manicures there were considerably more expensive. The rest of the Wailea complex is beautiful, with many other hotels, shops, and restaurants. There was some construction going on in February that was somewhat bothersome when driving in and out of the complex, but not noisy and could not be heard from the hotel rooms. We rented a car because most things to do on Maiu required transportation to get there and back, outside of the separate Wailea complex.

The rooms were nice. I think they could have splurged on upgrading the televisons to flat panels, the tube tv just dates the room. I guess they figure people are on vacation, so who really needs TV? Also, if I was decorating the guest rooms, I would have added throw rugs under the beds to warm it up. That said, you will not be disappointed, the Marriott did a fine job remodeling the rooms - and the rest of the property. We were vacationing with my 10 month old son, so we weren't able to use the adult pool, but it looks fantastic. One suggestion to the Marriott - People with children like cabanas too! The Marriott has 5 pools throughout their property, each one was nice, but we frequented the pool past the adult pool overlooking the ocean. It also has an infinity edge, but stll missing the pods like the adult pool. I'm still really bummed about that! The pool service was great! We never ran out of cocktails! The breakfast buffet was good, and we ate there almost every morning. It's about $26 per person. I must suggest going over to Longhi's at the Shops at Wailea.

The box of 4 chocolate covered macadamia nuts was a special treat though. The rooms are recently renovated, though they put a tube tv in each room, instead of a flat panel tv. Also, it appears that they put the same old shower curtain rings (bent out of shape) back in the bathroom. Also, the shower head really needed to be descaled. My profile on marriott.com indicates that I like foam pillows, but that too \"slipped\" by their attention.

The upgraded room only had a queen bed though (why?). Since we had unpacked already we declined it at that point. I give the manager credit because she wound up sending us a nice basket of goodies to make up for the lackluster treatment.

Service: The reviewer who left a review on here from May 1st nailed it on the head. I received the same exact experience. When I pulled my car up, the bell hop was quick to great us. When I told him I can handle my lugguge myself, he said \"that's not the way we do things here\". I insisted and to say the bell hop was rude was an understatement. I then noticed when other people arrived, and used the service of the bell hop, they were greeted with shell necklaces that were put around their neck etc.... I've stayed at many hotels in Hawaii, shouldn't everyone get the same greeting, regardless if you use the bell hops or not? Leaving the property I encountered the same horrible service. I took my luggage down myself, pulled the car up and at this point, most high end hotels the bell hop will come to your car and at least offer to help you. Not here, there were three of them just looking at me and my wife and didn't want to move a muscle. I didn't need their help getting my luggage into the car but we did have a lot of stuff and for what they charge at this hotel, it should have at least been offered because we had some big suitcases. I thought them just standing there watching us put all this stuff in the car with out even coming over to see if we needed help was pretty poor. As far as check-in goes, I had the same exact situation, however I caught the front desk agent by surprise. I am a travel agent and I knew all the different rates going in there. He offered to uprade me for the $75 as they do everyone else. However there was a rate where I could have been upgraded for $24. When I asked about that rate it magically came up. Shouldn't the front desk agent say to the guest, \"let me see if we have other rates available to get you into a better room\". When I asked him why he wanted to charge me $75 when there was a rate that was only $24 more, he was like \"ahh, ahha, ahhh\" and just didn't know what to say. I could tell he was embarassed but that's fine with me because I'm sick and tired of places like that trying to rip you off and not tell you ALL your options. As far as the rooms, they were just o.k. if you ask me. Would I stay there again, just for the great pool I might.

It seemed to us that The Grand Wailea would be great if you have kids and The Four Seasons would be ideal for couples. We went to the Lobby Lounge at the Four Seasons and it was a good place to have a drink and appetizers and enjoy some music. Just be aware that it is pretty pricey but you will get great service.

As a side note, we also stayed at this property in December 2007 for four nights and enjoyed it very much, hence, our return trip. We were placed on the fifth floor overlooking the lobby with a partial ocean view - absoulutely gorgeous. As some people have noted, the rooms have been renovated recently. There was plenty of storage room to unpack your clothes, as well as, a refrigerator to hold snacks and drinks. While some people found the beds comfortable, I am not one to like soft beds, hence, not the excellent rating (my only complaint). They do have a pull-out sofa in each room and I was tempted to use it, but did not. Maid service was excellent each day of our stay . In addition, they do have washers and dryers to do laundry. When we were at the Marriott in December, the infinity pool was still being constructed. Now, that it is is completed, all I can say is that it is beautiful. Being our first day at the pool, we decided to rent a cabana ($50.00/day) which includes water and magazines. Yes, I felt it was a little on the expensive side, but we didn't want to be burnt toast on our first day. They do have umbrellas at the older pool, but since the infinity pool is for adults only, we wanted the piece and quiet - not that we don't love children (we have four). Pool service was excellent - thanks to Teri for her cheerfulness and always being there when we needed that drink with the umbrella (LOL). There are a total of 4 pools and a kid's pool at the Marriott. On our last day, Friday, April 25th we sat by the infinity pool and were pleased to see that they were in the process of putting permanent umbrellas around the lounge chairs. As noted, the Marriott is an older property. It used to be the Outrigger Hotel and before that the Intercontinental. It is a \"Work in Progress.\" They continue improving the property. The rooms are very nice, the open air lobby is inviting, and the pool area, especially the infinity pool, is very relaxing. During our stay, there was always some type of improvement being made, whether that be replacing the tile on the grand staircase, the light bulbs in the lobby, or working on the landscaping (it was not intrusive). The property has a lot of potential, and it was our feeling that the Marriott is trying to reach their full potential in this hotel. Just like anything, it takes time, but I have no doubt that they will achieve their goal. Though the hotel is not situated directly on a beach, but on a rocky point, there are beaches on both sides of the hotel within easy walking distance (just a few minutes). We did venture down to the rocks a few times and enjoyed watching the sea turtles bob their heads in and out of the water. As far as the restaurants are concerned, we did not try them. They have a restaurant off the main lobby for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, there is a pool side bar restaurant that is open from 10:30am to sunset. We had hoped this bar would be open later for watching basketball playoff games - perhaps in the summer they extend their hours? It would be nice if they had a coffee shop (think Starbucks) in the hotel, but there is one next door at the Wailea Shops.

My wife was in the far east on business for a month and we wanted to meet half way for a relaxing 11 day vacation in paradise. After meeting my youngest daughter (and her boy friend) in Honolulu for her 21 birthday, we shot over to Maui for a week. We couldn't have picked a better location and hotel. The hotel is the old outrigger hotel, which was bought by Marriot some years ago. After a $68 million dollar renovation - it is a dream come true. We were most impressed with the open air lobby, infinity pool, the openess and helpfulness of the staff, good food and great location. Oh, and the bed is spectacular - you litterally sink into it. The front staff was nice enough to upgrade us to an ocean view room - which was a nice extra. Get Frank the supervisor of Security to tell you the story of how he wound up in Maui. It moved us. And the bartenders recommended \"cafe Olah\" as a favorite local hang for dinner. It was reasonable and very good. The area is quiet and serene. There is a paved walkway seperating the hotel from the ocean. We walked it every morning going thru the Fairmount, Four Seasons, a variety of condo's as well as Ullua and Wailia beach. Over by the Four Seasons you can rent all sorts of water sport rentals. The hotel is a very short walks to the shops at Wailea - which sports good shopping for the gals and a couple of nice restraunts. The scenery from our balcony and pool was breathtaken. We spend many an hour standing in the Infinity pool, with a drink in our hands, just staring at God's paradise. Also, I noticed no construction whatsoever. If you are looking for action and night life - this is not the place for you. If you want to get away from the mechanics of life and just eat, drink, explore and vegitate - I would recommend this hotel. As far as adventures - renting a convertible is a must. We have fond memories of snorkeling in the morning and hiking on a volocano top in the afternoon (bring food and drink as there is nothing on the top). A day in Lahania should also be on the agenda, and a stop at bubba gums for some good food and fun. We didn't do the road to Hanna, but as a write this review, wish I had. The trip was expensive, long travel and took some planning. But for all the trips I've takin in my life - this ranks up there as one of the best and memorible.

The location of the hotel was spectacular and close to the shops at Wailea. From our hotel room, we could see whales breaching on a very regular basis. Fantastic view for sunset's each evening. Very quiet and peaceful. There is a 3 mile walk you can do which runs along the shoreline passing a slew of other hotels, this was great exercise! If you have young kids (under 10) they will love the waterpark area. It has a waterslide, a mock beach, sprinklers in the shape of palm trees, etc. The adult pool is also very peaceful. You can rent cabana's for $100.00 per day (personally, I think it is a waste of money... you are there for the sun right!). Although the location was beautiful, and the rooms were a nice size, I was not overly thrilled with the staff. Very few people said hello and they did not seem to go out of their way to make you feel welcome (with the exception of the valet staff). When we checked in, we mentioned that were on our honeymoon. Nothing was ever said or done. My husband is a preferred customer with Marriott, so I was pretty surprised by this lack of response. I also was very disappointed in the housekeeping. I had accidently spilled baby powder on the floor of out hotel room when we first arrived (no carpet in the rooms - all tiled flooring) , it wasn't cleaned up for 3 days. Our floors were never washed and the sweeping was not very thorough (i.e. missed corners and under the tables). There were also a few days when our bathtub was not cleaned or the bathroom counters were not wiped. Now, I am sure of this... because it couldn't be missed, I don't know how housekeeping did! I didn't complain to the hotel, as my husband didn't think it was a huge deal (his response.. it is a chain, what do you expect) and given that it was our honeymoon, I didn't want to deal with the headache of complaining. We had left a substancial tip the second day, hoping that things would improve; however, it didn't. I think my experience was unique, as other's at the pool said their housekeeping was great. The Marriott has also recently put in the memory foam beds...if you have a bad back, I don't recommend staying there. I don't mind a soft bed; however, I found it too soft...feels like you are sinking. I woke up everytime I went to roll over. After a few days you get used to it. I noticed a few other people around the pool complaining about the beds too. We had breakfast at the hotel only twice, as we have left early for our daily adventures. The food was quite good and not overly pricey. We had dinner a few nights at the Shops of Wailea (Tommy Bahama and Ruth Chris Steakhouse - were our top picks). We also had dinner one night at Roy's Restaurant (just a short 10 minute drive into Kihei) - this was very good. Hillo Hattie was a great spot to shop for souveniers, that was until we went to Lahaina (much better selection for the hawaiian shirts, etc). If you are looking at snorkling adventures, I would highly recommend Trilogy (by far the best company out there). Old Lahania Luau was also fabulous (far better than the one done by the Marriott), I would highly recommend this luau, but book as soon as possible as the best seats go quickly. Maui Downhill was great for biking down Halelaukala (it isn't a 61 kms bike ride downhill, you only ride down about 30 kms - no pedaling required)...smooth ride. Dress warmly, it was really cold on the top of the crater at 5:00 a.m. (I am not kidding...it was zero celsius). If you are going to Hana, eat at Charley's for breakfast...it is on the road to Hana in Paia (interesting fact... it is owned by Willie Nelson, who is a regular visitor). Go to the bathroom before you go (unless you are okay with outhouses or road side pitstops. Not much eating selections in Hana. Buy the CD about the road to Hana (driving tour) well worth the $20.00. We also stopped by the Garden of Eden at mile marker 10.

We had a package booking with expedia. Although we called them to book (rather than booking online), we got an ocean front rm instead of the ocean front room with breakfast for 2 option. After repeated arguments with them, they finally gave us $ 100 discount of the package (which is about 2 days worth of continental breakfast at the hotel). Except for this everything was done right by expedia. The hotel stay was great. The chekin time is 4 pm but the room was not done till 5pm. But they offered complimentary strawberry smoothies. The room was partially looking the ocean. It is very confusing whether u r getting ocean front versus ocean view (and there is a deluxe ocean front category too). When asked I was told that the room we got was an ocean front. May be I should have asked for other room options. They have a map of all the rooms showing different categories. They did show the map to me but it was difficult to decide the category from the map. To be on the safe side, I would choose the one that directly faces the ocean, rather than at an angle (although again the hotel is designed such that most rooms are at an angle to the ocean/beach, excpet for delux ocean front ). The room was clean and was serviced daily. The facility was clean and all the staff people were nice. There is an adult only pool too (18 and above). The kids had a blast. There are two pools and two spas in the main area near the Humu grill. Though the hotel overlooks the ocean, the beach - Mokapu and Ulua itself is little walk (3 min) from the hotel but access is easy. Ulua beach is closer to the hotel and there is great snorkeling site at the farther end. Basically the beaches are separated by a small rocky projection. This provides a good snorkeling site. There are additional pools and small rides, but these are slightly remote from the main tower (but may be close depending upon where u end up staying. Resort fee: Marriott charges $ 25 (plus tax)/day as resort fee. You get a small valet card at check in outlining the details. The details of this are also on their web site. If u choose to self park then u dont have to pay anything as the parking fee of $ 15/day is included in the resort fee. But if u choose valet then u pay $ 18/day over and above resort fee. Basically u loose the $ 15. You get 2 bottles of water per day in your room (if u dont than call them). This is included in resort fee. U get 2 complimentary Mai-Tai per stay, worth $ 9/drink (and not per day). There is some confusion about this as if u are sitting at the Humu grill near the pool, most waiters give u 2 free tropical drinks per day. But if u ask the front desk or the bar tenders they say that this only a one time thing. So try ur luck with the waiters daily till u run out of luck!!!!!! Pools and facility is clean overall. The breakfast was good. We did not try their restaurant or Luau. There are expensive restaurants in the nearby Shops at Wailea. There is a somewhat affordable pizerria (Matteo's pizzeria) right across from the shops. There are few restaurants in Kihei town which in 5-10 min drive. We liked Fred's Mexican place. Activities: Molokini Snorkel is a must and so is visit to Turtle town. The Lahaina cruise company charges $ 80 per adult with kids under 12 free (one per paying adult). Alex Air was the cheapest for the helicopter rides and honored their lower internet rates even if u booked on phone. We did not do road to Hana or Haleakala crater trip. Would certainly go back to Maui. May try a different resort next time, not because we had any complaints but just human nature.

We chose the Wailea area of Maui because we've been before and love the slightly quieter atmosphere as compared to Kihei or Kaanapali. The Marriott was in our price range within this area, which also has a Four Seasons and the very expensive but beautiful Grand Wailea. The Marriott was terrific. We arrived on a Wednesday evening and departed on a Tuesday morning and were there during spring break so it was busy. Our room overlooked their brand new adults-only infinity edge \"Serenity\" pool. We spent part or all of every day at this pool. They had waitress service, it was quiet, overlooked the ocean, and they had cabanas you could rent for $50/day, which we did twice. The hotel had been purchased from the Outrigger a couple years prior and the Marriott was finishing up its remodeling. The inside of our room was great - completely redone with modern furnishings (not tacky tropical style), bathroom with marble, etc. The rest of the hotel still kind of looked like an older hotel on the outside but it didn't really bother us. Between the fantastic pool and our room, we were happy. The hotel really only had 2 restaurants: Mala, an upscale restaurant where you can have breakfast (I believe lunch), and dinner. Dinners are good but expensive and their selection is kind of limited. Breakfasts are the standard resort breakfast offering with either a la carte or buffet and in my opinion was very good but expensive ($28 for the buffet). The other restaurant was poolside and had a very limited menu. This where we' d order lunch from each day when we were at the pool. I'd say if you are looking for a hotel with a great variety of restaurants, the Marriott is not for you. Otherwise, we were happy. We chose to walk down the path to the nearby Grand Wailea and Four Seasons and had several meals at both because they had so many restaurants.

STAFF - the staff was delightful and helpful at all times. You were greeted by everyone even the grounds crew. 3. ROOMS were nice and cool with ceramic flooring with great views. THE BAD 1. POOLS - the main pool had very few places to relax where you could see the ocean. Bushes needed to be trimmed so that you could enjoy the pool and the ocean at the same time. The new infinity pool was amazing but had no shade. You had to purchase a cabana to have any shade at all. 2. SPA HIDDEN FEES - After my massage I was shocked to see a $20 fee on my bill. When i asked if this was gratuity she said only 2 dollars went to gratuity and never explained the remaining 18. They had several chances to tell me about the fee when I called to make a reservation, when i signed in or when I was called for my massage. Then no explanation when I checked out. I was furious and the manager was called. They took off the fee but I was peeved that they would try and sneak 20 bucks out of customers without an explanation. 3. SPA was very small and didn't even have a hot tub or any hot water showers. Very dissapointed. 4. HOTEL HIDDEN FEES - After booking our hotel online we were shocked to arrive and have a $25.00 + tax PER DAY charge to the room that they call the Resort Activity Passport. Now this pays for self parking, local phone calls, 2 water bottles a day and a discount on laudry services but I was upset that they weren't upfront about the charges and I would rather pick and choose what I pay for instead of them forcing this Resort passport on us unwillingly. Started our trip off with a bad feeling about the resort. 5. PIPE PROBLEMS- We were woken up every morning around 5 or 6:00 am to the banging of pipes in the wall. There was nothing we could really call about since the pipes were in the wall and it would have taken a construction crew to tear down walls but I was the fact that so much noise woke us every morning we were trying to sleep in. 6.

We had booked an ocean view room through expedia. The room we were given was in hale 6 with a view towards hale 7. There was only a partial ocean view from the balcony. We went back to the front desk to get a room with a better view and learned, that all ocean view rooms are in reality partial ocean view rooms, and even the ocean front are not ocean front, they face the ocean but you overlook the pools and if you are in first floor people can look directly in your room. The oceanfront rooms in the tower have a nice view, but you have to use the elevator, what is very old and has a bad smell and you have to wait for ever. So the only rooms what face the ocean are the deluxe ocean front and we decided to pay for the upgrade, since they did not want to give us a free upgrade, even after we told them that we came for my birthday and our anniversary and that my husband is a Marriott rewards member. They gave us a discount upgrade rate ($50 instead $100) plus tax per night. Still there was a bad feeling since we already paid much more fore this vacation since we ever paid for a vacation before. On top of that you have the $25 resort fee, what includes the parking fee and 2 Mai Tais for the whole stay. The rooms are renovated with brand new furniture. Nevertheless I was disappointed because the rooms are not cozy but businesslike. The floor is very cold. But besides this, the rooms are adequate a 4 star resort. We've been to Maui 4 times before and always stayed at Napili beach. Our favorite resort there is Napili Kai. I wished, we would have stayed there again. The only thing what might be better in Wailea is the weather. The Marriott is not located on a beach. There are two beaches in walking distance, but you don't have any shade there after noon. Ulua beach is less crowded than Wailea beach but there are no chairs. On Wailea beach we took chairs what belonged to the Grand Wailea resort and so did a lot of other Marriott guests. The umbrella had to be rented and paid for. Since it was not terribly hot we were fine without umbrellas but still, you pay $500 per night at the Marriott and have to take longchaires from a different resort and do not get umbrellas? I f you are a pool person than you are fine with the Marriott, since they offer a lot of long chaires at the pools, but if you are a beach person like me you would ask yourself, why did I pay so much money? On top of that the Wailea beach is extremely crowded and so is the Wailea resort. I asked myself, why do people pay $1000 per night? To be on a crowded pool or on a crowded beach? The Marriott was much quieter. The breakfast and dinner restaurant has a nice view overlooking the pools towards the ocean and the food there is expensive but also very good. We always had the continental breakfast buffet for $17 per adult, kids pay $9 (it used to be kids eat free with two adults paying but they changed that). I liked the variety of fresh fruits. Full breakfast buffet is $25 per person. The service was not good at all, dinner even worse than breakfast. The restaurant itself is not very cozy, it is loud and does not have a relaxed atmosphere. We spotted restaurants with a much nicer atmosphere at the Four Seasons. The pool restaurant was okay for lunch, but the poor food quality didn't justify the high prices. You better have lunch at the Grand Wailea pool restaurant, what has the same prices but much better quality. Overall we had a good vacation. Our daughter loved the kids pool. I was surprised how nice the weather was. Since it was February I expected rain and storm but it was nice and sunny every day. Even the ocean was warmer and calmer than I expected. The only downside was that I always compared the Marriott with the Napili Kai, what I liked sooooooo much more for far less money. The rooms in the Lahaina Building, where we always stayed, are much nicer and right at the beach. For over$100 less per night you have a bigger room with a kitchen in a much nicer location. When you have kids, a kitchen is great, because sometimes they are to tired to go to restaurants. And room service gets booring after the 3rd time. The Napili beach is more beautiful and much quieter than Wailea. The vegetation there is more tropical, you get the real Hawaiian feeling. For me Napili was paradise, Wailea was just okay. When you are a nature person, you will love Napili.

We had rented a cabana and received no service for over 90 minutes. While I was in Maui, I sprained my ankle and required a wheel chair to get around. The hotel was less than happy to loan out their wheel chair to us and we had to constantly return it. I felt this was the most discouraging part of the experience. This resort requires a lot of walking to get from place to place, and their attitudes about loaning the chair out so i could still enjoy my stay was anything less but caring and accomodating. I just expected a little more from the Marriott team when I needed them most. The grounds are pretty and the room service was great. This is definately the upscale area of Maui and not much to keep you entertained in the evenings like in Lahaina or Kanapalli (excuse the misspelling). If you are younger and want more to do than shopping and pool time, definately spend some time up in Kanapalli and Lahaina. Wailea is definately more low key, relaxing and subdued. Hints and Tips: Dont forget to try a restaurant called Matteo's just across from the Shops of Wailea. Good food at a reasonable price. Also, make a stop at the Safe way before you get there for sodas, booze, and snacks...this will save you money on room service and drinks.

We usually vacation at $100 B&B's, but decided to step it up a notch for our trip to Maui. The hotel was very nice- clean, friendly, on the water, but lacked charm. No major complaints- but no major kudos either. The entry drive is through a beautiful tree grove- straight out of Jurassic Park. We were met by a bell hop at the entry- he said that since we declined valet parking, I needed to park the car before we checked in- so my wife had to stand on the curb with our bags while I parked the car. This was our first contact with our luxury hotel, hmm. The pool scene could have used a bit of an upgrade. There were just a couple of very busy waitresses- and no bar to order your own drinks. It rained one afternoon, and they stopped all drink service. We paid for the $20/day activity pass- which got us a parking spot ($10 otherwise), a bottle of water, and 2 fruity drinks a day, plus some other stuff that we didn't use. We had an ocean view room that had a fridge, a safe, comfy bed, & a sideways view of the water. We were warned ahead of time that they were building a new pool- our room looked right out over the construction. They only worked during the day and were relatively quite. It appeared that there were lots of other vacant rooms- and the only mention of an upgrade was at the check-in desk when they asked if we wanted to pay more-but this was before we even saw the room. Again- no big deal, but not what I expected at a luxury hotel. The hotel location is decent. There are a few great beaches with good snorkling, free beach chairs and sunset views within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is right on the ocean- but no immediate beach front. There is a high end shopping mall adjacent to the hotel property with a few decent restaurants (Loghi's & Cheesburger Island).

It's a beautiful resort, but overall, I'd say we were underwhelmed. I have a feeling that a lot of the issues with the hotel will be resolved once the construction is done, but as things stand, this resort did not measure up to other similarly-priced tropical resorts we've been to recently. The good: * The location: Maui is awesome and if you are willing to go just off the beaten path a little you can find good, local food and wonderful local beaches (Big Beach, for example). You'll need a car for sure. * First impression: The first impression when arriving at this resort is impressive. It is kind of a sprawling, open villa kind of view with open-air registration and fountains, etc. * The luau - it was fun and the food was good. We didn't pay for it ourselves so I'm not sure how the pricing is. The bad: * This resort is not on the beach - you have to walk or drive to the beach. The beach you walk to is okay - not bad, not great. Big Beach, which you can drive to, is fantastic. But if you want to be on the beach with hotel-provided chairs, this is not your resort * The bar - closes at 10, the restaurant doesn't serve breakfast down by the pool until 11am - there is nowhere to buy coffee in the hotel. Why wouldn't they put a Starbucks in the lobby? I have no idea. We didn't eat at the hotel but other than the luau, our friends also staying at the hotel said it was average * CONSTRUCTION: This hotel is undergoing major construction as of end-of-September 2007. They are building a \"serenity pool\". To give some perspective, this means that maybe 50% + of possible pool area is not open at this time. Combined with no beach, this means this resort is really limited. Also, there is a lot of obvious construction going on which takes away from the physical beauty of the place. * We had a very long wait in line to register. This was mitigated by the fact that they gave us juice and cool towels, but still. * $18 portage fee. There was an $18 \"portage\" fee on my bill. I've never seen this before. This is typical of this Marriott - you get the feeling they are trying to nickel and dime you whenever they have the chance. They charged me $8 to print out 4 pieces of paper in the business center (my boarding passes for my flight back home) * They rip you off at the spa. They charge you an 18% gratuity automatically, which is okay. But *then* when you're done with your spa treatment, they give you a guilt trip and tell you that almost none of that 18% goes to the person who did the treatment, and that you should give more if you want the person to get money. Marriott should be embarassed by this behavior. Overall, I would only recommend this hotel *after* construction is done and if you could get a good rate or use points.

Self-parking is $10.00 per day while valet service is $13. Hula Moons Restaurant & Lounge is the resort's main restaurant and there is pool-side service at Kumu Bar & Grill. Due to the high cost of food/drinks, we did not dine at the resort; opting for more reasonably priced meals in the nearby town of Kihei.

After check-in to our room in Haleakala tower on the top floor, we had a problem with the deadbolt. First we could not get out of our room. They supposedly fixed the lock while we were at dinner, but then we couldn't get in. It ended up being a real headache, first waiting in the hallway as security and engineering worked on the problem, and then they let us wait in a nearby room for a while. We were exhausted and just wanted to go to sleep, so after waiting a total of almost 2 hours, we asked to be put in a final room while they worked on the door so we could get our belongings. While security and engineering personnel were great and very sympathetic, the night manager at the front desk was not. She acted like we were deliberately trying to annoy her and just wanted a free upgrade. All I wanted was my luggage and to get some sleep. She grudgingly moved us to a deluxe oceanfront room (we had booked an oceanview). She seemed mad when I asked her for some travel toothbrushes so we could just get ready for bed and get some sleep. we wandered around in the dark trying to find Hale 6 which is on the opposite side of the resort. FInally, we reached our new room and went to sleep. At 11:30pm, we were woken up by the front desk calling to say they had drilled a hole in the door of our original room to gain entrance to it and we had to come get our stuff as they could not secure the room! Long story short, with security's help, we moved our stuff and got to bed at 1:00 am. Next day, I open up the curtains in our new room. We have a marvelous view of the ocean AND a black dump truck. We are now smack dab in the middle of the construction zone for the new infinity pool. I had specifically requested to be away from the construction. After talking to the much nicer front desk manager during the day, Julie, she agreed to move us to a new room. She told us we had to wait until 2 pm for the room to be ready. So we had to wait around the hotel on our first day in Maui to get this settled. The room was not ready until after 3pm. We were happy with our final room in Hale 2, but I was disappointed that the hotel did nothing to acknowledge the aggravation and inconvenience. Breakfast buffet was included in our room rate which was good, because it would have cost $25 per person per day. Be careful, they have a real problem with bugs and birds getting at the open air buffet. Overall, the resort is pretty and in the nice area of Wailea. But front desk personnel need more training. Some were great, others not. I asked for late checkout on our last day and the first person I spoke to was obviously not having a good day. I told her to forget it, and went back a few hours later and spoke to a different person. Suddenly it was no problem.

So we moved back after they repaired the A/C. 3. Below and above our room, we had restaurants setting up with at 5AM in the morning; disturbing our sleep at unreasonable hours. 4. The toilet handle broke off the toilet. 5. On two instances, there was construction on the roof below the breakfast lanai where sandblasting was happening. It was so loud that I couldn't hear myself think. The hotel management staff did move us to suites after our complaints. The move happened on the last night. To my wife and I, it was too little too late. All in all, the property's age and room quality clearly shows to all its guests.

I had very low expectations of this hotel as I knew it is under constructions and had read some bad reviews on this site. I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised by our stay! Check in was very easy and the front desk staff was always very friendly and accommodating to anything. The bellman was very friendly as was the pool staff (more on this later). Room was always cleaned very well. We did have an ant problem on our 4th night where somehow our room was invaded by about 1,000 small ants. As we didn't leave any food out or anything, I called the front desk and asked for a room switch because I didn't think it was us who caused the ants. After offering to spray the room (which i declined) the hotel offered to allow us to change rooms. Within 10 minutes we had a bellman there to help us with our things. The hotel was not crowded, which we loved. A nice thing is the kids pool is not located near the main pool, so the main pool stays pretty quiet. Food by the pool and service were fantastic. The pool staff, not employed by marriott, were friendly- but here is the catch. they are incented to sell maui jim sunglasses. Most of the staff is very tame about it and does not bother you unless you ask. One staff member, however, is so pushy and incredibly obnoxious i literally asked him not to speak to me for the rest of my trip. at one point he was coming up behind guests in their lounge chairs and putting sunglasses on their faces. We stayed on marriott points and paid for an upgrate, but received a double upgrade. I'd definitely recommend paying the $20 per day for the resort fee. parking is included as well as 2 drinks per day and the bottle of water in the room. That is more than your money back right there! We didn't eat breakfast or dinner at the hotel, only lunch by the pool. For breakfast we went to the Whaler's general store or the coffee shop in the wailea shops. The hotel is definitely still way under construction. We were not impacted too badly.

It is also in the middle of an upgrade programme so many rooms have a view of the ocean and a suite of Heavy Construction machinery just below. If you are paying for your room then stay somewhere else in Wailea. ---Service----- - We booked an Oceanview room on a high floor via the company's website and also notified them that we would be on our honeymoon. Cost $592 per night - On check-in we were first told that there was no room available yet (it was noon). We said we did not mind waiting for a good room and we would hang out by the pool. - We mentioned again that it was our honeymoon (hint hint!) and were a little insulted by the receptionists offer of an upgrade for an extra $120 per night! My reply was that surely $590 per night should be enough to secure a good room. That was the last mention of our honeymoon and we did not even receive so much as a complimentary drink. - When we arrived as well, despite the fact that the hotel was not busy, when I said I was self parking, the bell boy insisted that we had to park the car before we checked in. They then left us to carry our own bags to the check in desk. Poor - The resort fee is also another con at c$20 per day just for the right to park your car. Local phone calls are supposed to be free but they added them all to our bill and thought we wouldn't notice. - On check out, our bill was riddled with mistakes (all in the hotels favour) including the aforementioned local calls and our breakfast which was supposed to be included in the rate. ----Rooms----- - The hotel put us in room 420 which is supposed to be an Oceanview. We got there and to our dismay the only view was of the top of the palm trees! It would seem that this is the same for most of the rooms on the fourth floor. This struck me as a bit of a rip off as there is very clearly no view of the ocean and we were upset as we made it clear that we were happy to wait for a good room. - After much complaining the hotel moved us to a garden view room which was clean and modern although there were signs of a rush job on the fittings with screws loose on the door etc. - The bath and toilet are in a very small room and the double sinks are in a more open space. Well appointed but not terribly well designed or inviting - The rooms are somewhat spoiled by two issues. 1. The beds are extremely soft and offer no support. 2. there is no soundproofing so you can hear when you neighbours are showering or flushing their toilet. - Communal areas in the accommodation blocks are dark and extremely dirty, especially stairwells which really need attention. The ice rooms were generally filthy. ---Food ----- We only ate the breakfast but the buffet was quite limited and poor quality considering the price we paid. The orange juice was diluted to the point of being coloured water and was totally tasteless. A lot of food items were not replaced in the last 30 minutes and the omelette chef was in a miserable mood every day. I watched him constantly asking this supervisor what time it was and then at 5 minutes to 11 he would dump all his ingredients in a bin so he did not have to cook any more. ---Conclusion---- There were clearly a lot of guests here who were staying on reward points. For them you get a hotel in a good location, a sandy beach close by and modernised rooms. For cash paying customers you walk away feeling that this represents very poor value for money. We could have had a garden room at the four seasons for the same price. Service is just not good enough and staff look miserable. It would seem that due to the modernisation of the hotel, corners and costs are being cut to the bone everywhere else. This was clearly an under invested asset being modernised but it is very cosmetic. You are still left with the problem of wafer thin walls and poor service. We paid twice as much for a room at the four seasons on Big Island an thought it was fantastic.

Service: We were greeted by a friendly staff and check-in was a breeze. Housekeeping was good. The rooms were cleaned daily and at the time we requested. We requested additional beach towels which were not an issue. Bellboys and parking attendants were friendly and helpful as well. Room: The rooms are nicely appointed with new furnishings. The beds are a bit soft but of course that's personal preference. Our first room was a garden view on the 7th floor of Haleakala Hale. We had a decent view of the Marriott water fountain but also partial parking lot view. We switched rooms due to an incident explained in the \"Cons\" section. Both rooms were in the same category. Our second room didn't have a screen on the sliding door to the lanai while our first room did. Also, the air from the central air vent smelled like the ocean in our second room. The air from our first room did not have an odor. Perhaps because our second room was on the 3rd floor while our first room was on the 7th? Pool: The main pool area has two pools and a few hot tubs. We went to the pools twice during our 4 night stay. Once in the morning and once in the early afternoon. On both occasions, there were plenty of lounge chairs available. Getting additional beach towels at the counter was never a problem. Servers were always available to get drinks. Cons: There was an unexpected third guest our room 702. We tried to catch it or squash it ourselves but that sucker was really fast. We decided to call housekeeping to take care of the problem. It was so fast we couldn't identify what it was. When housekeeping arrived, they couldn't find it either. He wasn't sure what it was but based on our description, he said it couldn't have been a bug and might have been a mouse. At that point we called the front desk to request a room change. This is when we were changed to a terrace/oceanview. I would use the term oceanview very loosely because you can only see a bit of the ocean in between the palm tress. I didn't realize this until the next morning since it was too dark out. The amenities in the room were the same. We stayed here the remaining three nights with no issues. We requested compensation for the inconvenience but were offered nothing except the fact that bugs and critters are out of their control... So a word of advice, make sure your luggage is zipped up when you're not using it! The other negative was the ice room on the third floor of our building. The wallpaper was torn down and you could see what looked like mold on the walls. Disgusting. The room was very damp as well. We got our ice on another floor. Everything else: Construction wasn't an issue for us because we stayed at the north end of the resort in the Haleakala Hale. From what I saw, construction may only be an issue if you have an oceanview or oceanfront room on the southern side of the resort. Despite the negatives, we still enjoyed our stay here. The resort is a short walk to both Ulua and Wailea Beach. The Shops at Wailea is also a short walk away with a few restaurants.", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, FL", "Title": "\u201cWailea Marriott was Incredible\u201d", "Author": "tvanhooz", "ReviewID": "UR8207781", "Content": "I don't usually write reviews....just read them, but since many of you helped me with your reviews, I only thought it was fair that I gave my opinion. This property is absolutely wonderful. I was very skeptical after hearing about all of the construction, but it didn't bother us one bit. They are currently working on the new check-in area and the new Serenity pool. ROOMS: I thought it was great with very comfortable beds and plenty of space for my family of four. We had an \"Ocean Front\" room and in that I come to one of my few gripes. This \"Ocean Front\" room was on the 7th floor and did face the ocean; however, I am not sure why that isn't just \"Ocean View\". Nonetheless, it was a spectacular view and a great room. LOCATION: As many mention, Wailea is a bit slower-paced which means it is much quieter than the Lahaina and Kapalua areas. We loved the location and you are only about a 5 minute drive from the town of Kihei which has many, many restaurants to help you save money from the hotel's prices. ACTIVITIES: Overall, the prices were up there a bit for a family of four; however, we went there on points for our hotel, car, and airfare, so we didn't mind spending a bit. There are MANY fliers out there that offer deals and I think you can save some good money...just make sure you call to confirm that you don't have to sit through a timeshare talk to get the discount. We did the following activities and I have given a quick synopsis. Snorkel tour aboard the Four Winds II. This was INCREDIBLE. We were supposed to go to Molokinin; however, the winds came early so they took us to the Coral Gardens. Some of the best snorkeling we have done (and we have snorkeled in the Caymans, Jamaica, St. Thomas, Mexico, etc.) and saw many fish, eels, turtles, and an octopus. They feed you breakfast on the way out, snorkel for about 2 1/2 hours, and they have lunch on the grill (burgers, dogs, and chicken) any time you want to swim back to the boat. We have small children (6 and 4), so they had life jackets, boogie boards, some small floats you could put then on with glass bottom viewers and pull them around while you snorkel, wet suits, etc. They even had a slide off of the boat into the water for kids and adults. A great trip. Maui Ocean Center Aquarium - Great with a lot to see and learn about the marine life in Hawaii. Maui Tropical Plantation Tour - nice for a couple of hours to learn about the agriculture in Hawaii and it includes a tram ride around through many types of flowers, trees, coffee, etc. Iao Valley State Park - Free to go and walk around yourself. A few walking paths and a nice refresher (much cooler up there) to catch a break from the heat. Snorkeling off of the beach - many sea turtles around every day. We went out around the rocky point from the beach and immediately see clearly and swam with many types of fish and the sea turtles. Atlantis Submarine - Cool for the kids, but I would rather snorkel. You do go down about 137 feet, so it is cool to see what is around the reef. We saw several Eagle Rays which were cool. Kids Pool at Hotel - A GREAT kids pool with a playground in the pool and two water slides. Great for kids and adults as we spent many hours and burned calories climbing and sliding...climbing and sliding. Golf - Played the Wailea Gold course and thought it was just an average value. The Plantation course at Kapalua had just been aerated and they said it was in ROUGH shape, so I just played Wailea. I play many courses in Florida, and other than the elevation changes..it was just mediocre. Luau - We did the one at the hotel and it was very nice. Not over the top...just enough to get a taste of Hawaii without having to travel too far. RESTAURANTS: Some we liked were Gian Don's, Fred's Mexican, and Cafe Olei in Kihei. Giong to Gian Don's was a much nicer atmosphere than the MArriott and prices were about half. The mile and a half path in front of the resorts is really nice for a morning walk and you meet many people along the way. The grounds of the hotel were very nicely kept and we are already looking to re-book for next year. Make sure to do any snorkeling or other trips early in the morning as the trade winds kick up around 11 a.m. and things get a bit choppy and rough. That being said, they also cool things off a bit. Overall, it was an EXCELLENT vacation spot with many, many things to do. We wanted to do the surf lessons, fishing trip, maybe a helicopter ride, and going up Haleakala...and didn't get to those activities. I HIGHLY recommend this trip and we weren't bothered one bit by the construction.

The first 5 days of our stay were excellent as we rented a condo at the Koa Lagoon in Kihei. We then moved to the Marriott for the conference and the last 5 days of our trip. The room was nicely decorated, just remodeled. I was a little put off by no carpeting on the floor, and as soon as we went to bed that night, I knew we were not in for a great stay. Bed was horribly soft and very uncomfortable. We woke up around 4 am also to find that at some point in the night the air conditioning automatically turns down, so we were both very warm, sweaty and uncomfortable, not to mention backs cramped from the uncomfortable bed. My husband went to the front desk around 7am to ask for another room with a firmer bed. Well, should have gotten up sooner as there were about 10 people in line with the same request. To our dismay, the staff was not concerned and not helpful. No other rooms available, and anyway all beds the same. No bed boards, nothing to help and no suggestions, just Sorry ! Decided to have breakfast and go to the pool. Well forget the pool. All chairs and umbrellas taken, very small pool area for the amount of guests. Although there are signs posted that spots may not be \"saved\" there were approx 50 % of the chairs \"saved\". We did finally find 2 chairs. When we asked to have an umbrella that was not being used moved so we could have some shade from the blazing hot sun, the staff refused because there were towels on the chair. When we pointed out the sign, the pool supervisor just shrugged his shoulders. We then took a little walk and found cabana chairs with sun shades. GREAT !, NOT. When the pool supervisor saw us sit in the cabana he came over to tell us there was a $40.00 day charge for the use of the cabana. We asked if the fee could be waived as there was no shade at the pool, they would not move an umbrella for us, nor did they have any more umbrellas. Well, no good, ended up paying the $40.00. Again, staff must not have had any customer service training. This was our 3rd trip to Hawaii. We have stayed on the Big Island in the past.

Hours later, I was forced to take a shower in the pitch dark bathroom and could not apply make-up, fix hair, etc. We went to the desk and complained again and asked to change rooms. While they gave us a nice gift basket for our trouble, we were still expected to pay full price for that night. I found this troublesome--no a/c and no power and construction everywhere?

For the same price we were looking at condos in Kihei and opted to take a chance. Turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. When we arrived we thought we made it to the wrong hotel! It looked amazing at night with the open lobby all light up with torches. We were then upgraded to a partial ocean view room and stayed close to the kids pool. This hotel is in the hotel circle so a 2 minutes walk and you are at the beach. There didn't seem to be system of any sort... meaning you could just borrow chairs from neighboring hotels and use their bar services. Since you must get a car in Maui the free parking they offered was a plus. Room service was good and the tile floors were great because you get sand EVERYWHERE. The cooler in the room was great and cooled things just fine when left for a few hours. The location was a major advantage. Minutes walk to the mall where you can get cheap breakfast food/ lunches and last minute toiletries at the Whalers Store. Kihei is only a 5 minute drive away and there you can find a Kmart to buy snorkeling gear and boogey boards for ($10 thats a day's rental at the hotel). I highly recommend Roy's for dinner- it's not pretentious and has a great wine and food pairing menu for reasonable price. Only complaint was we got charged a mandatory daily fee of 15 dollars.. which was in addition to our vacation package. That did give us a discount to the laua though so i wasn't too irritated by that. Would highly reccomend this place - rennovation was occuring but mostly in the lobby and was not disruptive to our stay. Go in November because its not peak travel time and there's more free space at the beaches. And by the kids pool they were setting up a sandwich shop which would be nice when its available.

Not only did they give us a room right next to the kiddie pool but we also had a partial ocean view while paying for terrace view. I think the resort fee of $20 a day more than pays for itself. You get free parking, two free mai tais a day, a free liter of water a day, and kids eat free at breakfast.

Our room was a distance from the restaurant and pool (3 minute stroll) but no big deal beautiful walkways and surroundings. Some people thought the pool looked so so or out dated I disagree the pool area it really nice and there is an out door rest/bar right there. The water is cold though...Burr!!!!! The MW is located between to beaches both very nice. They are not as wide and long as some in the Carribean and not white sands more beige in colour but the water is spectacular so clear . The restaurant has a really nice buffet breakfast it was included in the price for us. If it isn't your paying around 25.00 each. Dinner is expensive there my husband and I went to the Mall (3minute walk) and ate mostly at Cheeseburgers. The prices are reasonable. Good selection on the menu...dinner for two around 40.00 to 50.00 dollars. Wailea is so so stunning and clean. I swear you could eat off the ground and it is hard to find a blade of grass out of place.. Rent a car and tour the island you won't be sorry. Breathtaking vistas!!!! Other resorts right near where we were staying like the Grand Wailea look amazing but they come with a high price tag. The staff were very friendly at the Marriott Wailea. I highly recommend the MW. Just one thing if you smoke there are very few places to light up. They are 100% smoke free!!!!! Bring your own booze. The drinks are very expensive. There is a small fridge in your room.

After staying at the Marriott Wailea over Christmas, I felt that I needed to give back and submit a review. My wife and I decided to spend Christmas in Hawaii this past year but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start setting up arrangements until October. After getting our airfare reserved, I then set out trying to get room reservations for Oahu and Maui. I had no problem getting arrangements for Honolulu (we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki Beach for four nights and enjoyed it also \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially the corner room view from the 20th floor of the Rainbow Tower). Finding a decent hotel for Wailea was a lot harder due to every one being full except for the Marriot. After reading some of the reviews, I was worried but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have many choices so I made the reservations for 5 nights arriving on 12/27 and staying until after the New Years. I tried to down-play the accommodations with my wife so she wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed. Wow, I worried for nothing. While there was construction going on, the hotel was very nice and the rooms were closer to water than the near by more expensive resorts (see pictures). The room was very nice and the bed and sheets were very comfortable (and my wife and I have a very expensive lush pillow top Simmons at home so we are picky about bedding). The room had a refrigerator (nice for cold drinks and snacks that we bought near by at the Safeway), large bathroom, and couch by the sliding glass door. We had a deluxe oceanfront room in Hale 7 on the 2nd floor and the view was breath taking! We are in Hawaii so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care about using the pool and instead used the adjacent Ulla Beach. We bought some straw mats, a cooler, and a boogie board at an ABC Store (think Walgreens) at Kihei\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they have a Safeway grocery store that we loaded up with beverages and snacks\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 By the way, the resort fee of $15 was not mandatory as stated previously in other reviews. I told them that I was not interested in the service from the resort fee and they were happy not to add it on when we checked in. Another complaint was the restaurant. We never eat at the hotel restaurant. We enjoyed dinner at Ruth Chris at the Shops at Wailea (couple hundred yards from the property), Roy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (about seven miles away in Kihei), in a Thai Restaurant (about seven miles away in Kihei), and the fabulous luau at the Old Lahaina Lu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122au (make sure and make your reservations before leaving for Hawaii). For breakfast, we took advantage of a previous reviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice to get the take-out breakfast at the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s General Store at the Shops at Wailea [--] it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only couple hundred yards from the property and they have a $5 breakfast from their deli counter in Styrofoam take-out box full of eggs, bacon, and hash browns\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very filling \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6these also have muffins, other breakfast sandwiches, fresh fruit, etc including liquor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you can sit in the courtyard outside the store and enjoy the breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6good store for a lot of things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.

The pool restaurant served a lovely shrimp salad for lunch, very tasty. The beach walkway is a great way to exercise in the morning and gives you a view of all the other hotels in Wailea. Not to be missed are the Blue cheese burgers at the Burger place in the Shops at Wailea, and Roy's restaurant in the Safeway shopping center for Dinner, just amazing.

The tile floors are nice, kept the room cool, and I imagine the hotel has eliminated the problem of musty smelling beach front rooms. The in-room safe and refrigerator were very handy. My only suggestion to the hotel would be to supply free, in-room coffee. We did not use the hotel restaurant. However, the bar has an amazing view of the ocean. There is a Safeway supermarket and a huge selection of restaurants in nearby Kihei. My 7 year old adored the children's pool and slides.

We stayed at the Wailea Beach Marriott Resort & Spa and were extremely pleased with the accommodations. It is true that there are some major reconstruction projects being done and this certainly was apparent during our stay. The main outdoor lobby was closed off as the floor retiling and the ceiling are being completed. The registration desk was relocated to the far left close to the Spa entrance. Though somewhat unsightly, this did not effect our stay at all except for our walk to our room being somewhat detoured around the construction. From our room we never heard any construction noise. According to one bell-hop there is no end in sight to the updates. Apparently they are still planning on adding a new swimming pool and restaurant to the property. Aside from the area under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeautification\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (construction) the resort was lovely though oddly laid out. Partly because some areas were closed off it was somewhat difficult to get from point A to point B at the resort unless point A was in the very direct vicinity of point B. Our point A (our room) was absolutely amazing. Because I am platinum elite with Marriott (neener, neener, neener) we had a complimentary upgrade from the Terrace View reservation to a Deluxe Ocean Front room. I certainly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting this as we were using points to stay here. After a long flight from Seattle (via Salt Lake City, we were using miles on the flights as well) it was incredible to walk into our very clean, open, newly refurbished room and slide open the door to the lanai to look out to the volcanic rocks and ocean not 20 feet from us. Simply amazing. Farther in the distance we saw Molokini crater and Kahoolawe beyond. This was the perfect room for a Hawaiian vacation. The hotel itself, as I mentioned before, is oddly laid out over its 22 acres. There are outdoor pathways that meander through the property but if you are staying on one side of the resort and you want to get to the other side, I would factor in 10 minutes for getting there and another 5 minutes for getting lost. It should be noted that despite its name the Wailea Beach Marriott is an ocean front resort and is not located on a beach but between two beaches, Wailea and Polo. However the walk to these beaches is so short it really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. The better of the two beaches is Wailea. It was never crowded, always clean, had amazing snorkeling, and was closer to our room location at the Marriott. The Marriott offers a fairly pricey champagne breakfast buffet. The food is good though the variety is a bit limited. For a $25 breakfast I was expecting to be wowed. It was unfortunate as well that after going to this breakfast buffet on three separate occasions during our stay that it was only at the end of the trip did we even realize that champagne was included in the price of the buffet. We were never told this or offered it even when the waiter came to offer coffee and tea. There are a few nice areas very clost to the Marriott as well. Since we were in Wailea we drove south down to the Makena area to check out some of the beaches mentioned in the Maui Revealed guide book. We first stopped at the Secret Cove. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so much a beach as it is a rocky ledge at water level. And it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel so much like walking on a beach as it did walking on a rocky and sharp volcanic rocks. The snorkeling was pretty good but not worth the trouble, scrapes and scratches to get in to and out of the water in my opinion. We also stopped at Big Beach and loved it. This aptly named spot was not only a big beach but also had some big waves. The crowd was very sparse and I could have easily spent more time here. As far as I can tell there were no facilities here but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really looking for them. Overall I would highly recommend the Marriot despite the construction.

Everytime we went to the children's pool, the slide attendant had an ipod with head phones in and could not hear the kids who wanted to use the slide. We were told that we could not unload scuba gear in the loading zone in front of the hotel beacause the loading zone is is reserved for guests checking in.

Finally, we went to the desk to pick them up and they told us that only housekeeping could deliver them, so we had to wait for nearly an hour before we could shower. In addition, we were reprimanded for putting pool chairs on the grass. The children's pool area has a snack bar, but no service, so we had to stand in line and clean up after ousrselves when we were finished.

Don't worry about earlier reviews, even though this hotel is still technically being renovated, there is very little work left to be done (Basically, the driveway entrance). The rooms are complete, the Pool is amazing (one of those infinity pools that you can see directly into the ocean) and MUCH nicer and calmer than any of the disney-style pool areas at the other resorts (Grand Wailea), with fewer noisy children, etc. The spa is beautiful and not under construction anymore either. Resort fee of 20 bux includes 2 free drinks per day, parking, and other discounts. overall, i would HIGHLY recommend this hotel and am sad that the place will most likely be packed or have higher prices once the renov. is complete. trust me...this is the best value of any of the hotels in this area, and i would rather stay here even if it cost the same as the Grand Wailea. i would, however, pass on the buffet breakfast...but other than that...no complaints!", "Date": "March 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGood Overall\u201d", "Author": "Moonray1", "ReviewID": "UR6843318", "Content": "We stayed at the Wailea Marriott for 7 days in mid-February.

We spent the 2nd part of our honeymoon here and it just blew away Waikiki Beach (the 1st part). It was exactly like how I had always pictured Hawaii. We spent a week in Wailea and the Marriott was the best place around. Other resorts seemed more crowded due to the lack of outside space but the Marriott had acres and acres of land to spread people out. The pathways along the ocean are right out of a movie. Beautiful scenery with gardens and extremely well kept grounds. The beach was amazing. There were many times during the day that we had the entire beach to ourselves. We'd pass the time drinking a few beers and watching the ghost crabs run from the water line back to their holes. The snorkeling was very good too! It was easy to get equipment, the hotel has everything you need right at the pool from masks, snorkels, flippers and even plastic cups for those drinks. When you start snorkeling, keep an eye out for things in the sand! I ended up finding 6 pairs of sunglasses down there, one of which I still wear today (the others were donated to some kids nearby). There were all kinds of fish to see and sea turtles were constantly around too. The one drawback is that the bar is not on the beach. You can walk up to it or just buy a cheap cooler and bring your own. Breakfast by the pool (which was included in our package) was the best way to start each morning. It was a decent sized buffet with the usual foods. The bar is in the same area and served the usual drinks (try the Kona Beer). We generally drove into Kihei for dinner where you'll find a large number of restaurants. There's everything from Mexican food to Thai and plenty of bars to check out too. Our room was facing the ocean and was amazing. It had the \"wow\" factor when you walked in. Very clean and simple with a deck overlooking the ocean for some great views of those Hawaiian sunsets. Speaking of sunsets... Make sure to go to the luau on the Marriott's property. Eating some great food and listening to some Hawaiian music is the perfect way to watch the sunset. I believe they only have the show twice a week so make sure to reserve your seats as soon as you check in. I can't wait to return to the Marriott Wailea.

We stayed at the Westin Resort in Kaanapali and much preferred the Marriott. We travelled with our 20 month old and had the time of our lives. That said, if you are going to splurge go to the Grand Waliea (we were VERY impressed when we walked over there); it makes the Marriott look like a category 3. On the other hand, if you get a deal (or stay for free as we did with points), you'll be very happy with the Marriott. Pros - BEAUTIFUL location!!!!!!!!!!!!!! True paradise in Wailea. Great kids' pool complete with sand and slides (zero depth entry fo even the tiniest kids) Uncrowded (even over Christmas). Upgraded to ocean view (again, for free!) Spacious, newly renovated rooms (enough space for our toddler's pack and play to be out of sight at night) Friendly and helpful staff Cons- This resort still has a LONG way to go if it's going to be a JW or compare to the Grand Waliea. The \"little stuff\" is missing. It needs paint touch-ups, better landscaping, etc. Not bad, until you see what true luxury looks like (Grand Wailea next door). Construction - Lots of construction is left; we were told by the staff that the entire pool area was going to be renovated (we were not told when this would happen). As of Jan 10, the only construction we observed was the complete remodel of the lobby. It looks like it'll be beautiful. Fitness Center - They ought to be ashamed! This \"final product\" does not even have a window. And, there are no mats to stretch on. Stay away from this room; run on the beautiful boardwalk instead (even in the rain it beats this room!). Bugs- I guess you can't do much about this, but we did have a few ants and what I believe were fruit flies in our room. I am sure they came in from the lanai. The staff volunteered to spray and reclean; we opted against this as we had the little one. Walking - This is not a con (in my opinion), but my dad didn't like how far he had to walk to get around.

I read a ton of reviews and have traveled and stayed at multiple Marriott sites. I do believe that whether or not someone likes/dislikes a particular resort is based on previous experiences and what one is looking to get out of a particular stay. My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in Hawaii. First in Oahu at the JW Marriott (see separate review) and then in Maui, at the Marriott Wailea Resort took our children (ages 10 to 21). Fortunately, the resort was not that crowded (we chose a good time to stay, Dec. 19-24). Unfortunately, we stayed here AFTER experiencing the luxurious JW Marriott in Ko Olina, Oahu. Granted, the hotel is still in the midst of its renovations (which really weren't that distracting), but this Marriott resort does not compare to the JW, even though it is the same category 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is really a mis-categorization. Check-in begins at 4pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we arrived at 5pm and there was only ONE person trying to check-in or service a short line of people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unbelievable. The grounds are nice, especially near the entrance. However, as you move towards the back of the resort (towards the ocean), the resort has that 'motel' feel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6one room after another\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6all the same. The renovation (as one might suspect) is taking longer than expected. In addition, I would say the 'workmanship' is just average. We had two renovated rooms (complimentary upgrade to ocean view), but on the ground floor. BIG mistake! If you like sleeping to the sounds of the oceans, then you are going to have to feel safe with the only thing between you and any perpetrator is a flimsy screen door (that doesn't lock \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not that that would make any difference!). Our room was just outside the nightly Lau, too. That gets old real fast. Inside, the rooms were clean. However, I am NOT a fan of just tile on the floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no area rugs or anything to absorb moisture or dirt. That means, if you get 'any' sand on the floor (imagine that), then whenever you walk around barefoot (say at night when you go to the bathroom), then sand sticks to your feet, and ends up in your bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be sure to use slippers (though I don't seem to remember any being provided). Since we did not feel comfortable sleeping with the screened door as our only means of security, we were forced to use a 'weak' A/C. I called the front desk to fix the A/C, but to no avail. The other room we had (for our children) had a great A/C, but needed additional repairs, which were taken care of promptly, except for the sliding glass door which would not lock. I appreciate a separate Shower and tub. Unfortunately, there was only a tub in our room. In addition, only the tub and toilet have a separate door. The vanity was not that isolated from the rest of the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hence hair drying can be obnoxious. On a positive note, their towels were oversized and fairly nice. My wife and I were not impressed with the beds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we prefer more firm beds. Our kids, however, loved them. I hate feather pillows, too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so had to request foam. The location is great, although the proximity to the Wailea shops is really no big deal since all the shops are high-end (e.g., Tiffany Co.!) You are really close to many other restaurants and shops, though. We spent a lot of time exploring Maui. Generally, I was underwhelmed with the resort. The breakfast buffet at $24/person was way over-priced. Fortunately, the only time we did the buffet were the days it was included in the price of our hotel room. We did not eat there for dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too many other good places (e.g., Fred's, Humuhumu\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6, Polli's, etc.) Had it not been for using points, I'm fairly certain I'd be staying elsewhere next time.", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cNice Beach, Great Service, OK resort\u201d", "Author": "kimlovestraveling", "ReviewID": "UR6171413", "Content": "Our family of 4 (two girls ages 5 and 14) and my husband and I stayed at the Marriott Wailea for 3 nights on November 20-23. I have to admit, I was disappointed with the rooms and the look of the resort. We used 90,000 Marriott points for the 3 nights plus had to pay $75/night to upgrade to an ocean view. They did upgrade us to an ocean front room which was approximately 50 yards to the water. However, the water is not the beach but a cliff overlooking the ocean. When we checked in, they gave us a lei which was very nice. Then because our room was in Hale 7 (room 7400), we had to wait for a them to shuttle us there. Upon arriving at the room, I was very disappointed for a newly remodeled room. The decor was very basic and boring. The beds were low with white down comforters and pillows. Other reviews said the bed were the best, I find them extremely soft and uncomfortable. The floors were ceramic tiles and were not clean. Our room look out into a lawn area and the ocean. I got up early the next morning and walked grounds. A few steps to the left of our room was the Wailea beach. It's small but beautiful. The Grand Wailea sits right in front of the beach. I turned around and walked the other direction toward the Marriott toward Ulua beach which is only a few hundred yards from the Marriott. This is a bigger beach than Wailea beach and is very beautiful. It is great for snorkeling and I saw some great fishes there. The service at the hotel is excellent. The bell hops, concierge, and front desk were all very nice and attentive. However, if you ask for a deluxe ocean front room that is closer to the Wailea Beach, there is a $175/night upgrade fee. The resort is old and so the pool area looks worned down. The lobby is also worned down. If you are looking and an expecting a resort type hotel, you will be disappointed with the Marriott Wailea. For Maui, it's more of a category 4 hotel instead of a category 7. Since we only paid $75/night with our points, I am not as unhappy as if I was to pay the normal rate of $530 for the ocean front room. It's definitely not worth that rate. The resort grounds are nice but not up to resort quallity. Also there is a charge of $13/day for wired internet service. It's free at the Marriott Ocean Club.

Trust me, the complimentary water was worth it alone. Hawaii LOVES to charge you for a bottle of water. Like $4.50 for a regular one. And you will want it. Hawaii water is terrible to drink from the tap. BUT as a hint, you CAN melt ice in your ice bucket and it drinks a lot easier. Anyway, there are beautiful walking paths (concrete) that people would jog on in the morning or simply walk on. And you can go a long way!

Example when we were leaving the property with our bags, the walkways are wide enough for two to walk abreast, however when we were pulling our bags up the walkway, the path was blocked by a security person in their golf cart who was talking with another employee. Not only did he never look up, he did not move, when we asked him to move, the person he was speaking with moved closer to the cart, which still did not give us enough room to pass. At this point we had to ask again to please move the cart to give us room to pass, at which point he did, without ever even looking us in the face. This is typical of the employees at the Marriott. The price of 199.00 a night is just about what it is worth. Also, the room conversions are not done yet, while we did stay in a remodeled room (Hale 7) there are many in the area, which have not been completed. Tip....

This is at the far end of the property near the hotel front desk, we did request, as well as others we spoke with, to be moved to something closer to the beach.

I was nervous about maintaining my honeymoon booking at the Wailea Marriott because of the negative reviews on Tripadvisor. My conclusion is different people will have different qualifications as to if the Hotel is good or not. It depends on what is important to you. Here is my wife's and I outlook: 1. You are in Wailea; An exclusive area unique to all of Hawaii. All the hotels are classy with the Four Seasons and Fairmont being part of the 5 hotels there. The Wailea Marriott is considered a Category 7 because it is in Wailea. It might not be rated as high if it was somewhere else. The employees are not top notch and the service is spotty. The pool is mediocre and there is sporatic construction you need to be aware of. Our first room was in direct line of jack hammer noise. I called the front desk and \"politely\" said it might be hard for us to relax. We immediately were changed to an ocean front remodeled room right on the boardwalk by the pool and ocean. The pool bar service is not classy at all and ends at 6pm (even though the bar is still open). The bartenders are mostly older and definately \"working to live.\" I was very upset on the literal 3/4 shot measured $8 tropical drinks (not all poor as such). The bar, restaurant and pool service definately lack the employees that want to work up the hospitality ladder. They are nice, but not the type of nice and class you are going to get at the big city skyscraper Marriotts or the Grand Wailea. The spa's jacuzzi jets are often broken. 2. Our attitude is - Why would you work out in an indoor fitness center when you are in Hawaii? Get outdoors. That is why we didn't care about the make-shift fitness they have while they are doing rennovations. Also, we did not eat at the hotel restaurant one time during our trip. Get out! Goto Kihei, Lahaina or even the classy Wailea Shopping Center just above the hotel property. There are great stores and restaurants there. The hotel restaurant is definately not where you want to dine knowing all the great places around you. We didn't do any spa treatments during our visit, but our friends did. The Grand Wailea is a walk down the boardwalk and is a top 10 spa in the world. I am carrying on so let me cut to the chase. I would only stay at this hotel if you are using points or getting at least half off what you would pay at the Grand Wailea, Fairmont or Four Seasons. The renovated rooms are very nice. The hotel is in a great location right in the middle of two beaches (Wailea has 3 nice beaches that are public with the Wailea Beach in front of the Grand Wailea being the best). It is also right below the Wailea Shopping center that has everything from Tiffany's, Ritz Camera and convenience stores. If you are going to compare the service employees to the Fairmont, you are not going to enjoy yourself at all. If your attitude is that your hotel is just a staging place to have fun in the sun and enjoy everything Wailea and Hawaii have to offer, then this hotel is for you. It is a very nice property.

The Marriott is in Waliea, a quieter area, next door to the Shops of Wailea. The Prince is in Makena (couple of miles from Wailea) and is tranquil. Rooms: The Westin room is nice, but the smallest room I have ever stayed in (no closets). The beds are very comfortable. The Marriott rooms are being remodeled and are very nice and I thought their beds were better than the Westin. The Prince's rooms are a bit larger, but decor is old and the beds are hard. PS. (The best beds are still at the Westin Villas) Pools: The Westin has a giant pool complex with an adult only pool. Very nice. The Marriott has a separate kids pool area and a couple of pools overlooking the ocean. Okay. The Prince should be embarrassed with their pool. The pool in my backyard is almost as big. Beach: The Westin is on Ka'anapali Beach which is nice but the area by Black Rock in front of the Sheraton is better. The Marriott does not have a beach, but on one side you havve Wailea Beach and the other side you have Elua beach. The beach in front of the Prince is very nice with good snorkeling Service: Very happy with all three. Kids: The Westin had many families and there were lots of children. The Marriott had some children and the Prince had very few children", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, CT", "Title": "\u201cHoneymooners beware\u201d", "Author": "CTNYCTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR6003021", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 5 days for our honeymoon. Here is a list of the issues: The hotel's gym/fitness center, if you could legitimately call it that, is horrendous. They have moved about 6 cardio machines into a guest room. No free weights or anything. The machines are old and make much noise. The room is small...very poor excuse for a fitness center. Spa was decent. I had an excellent aesthetician who worked very diligently and I had the best facial of my life. However, the Mandara Spa is not a spa. A number of guest rooms have been converted to spa service rooms. The service room I was in had a noisy inhabitant upstairs. Needless to say I wasn't fully relaxed. There is a LOT of jack hammering going on at the hotel. Mainly near the hotel pool and the hotel store. A number of routes to get to the lobby and hotel store were shut down and the elevators were temporarily out of service. So basically, you had to take the LONG way to get anywhere. The bathrooms are TINY. I wish I took a picture to show you. The toilet has about a one foot gap between it and the tub. If your looking for a resort with several food options, this is not the place for you. There is only ONE place open and it's the pool bar. The food was good, but still limited. Location was very good. Wailea shops right next door. This resort is not a beach front hotel, meaning you will have to walk a distance to get to the beach area. The pool was okay, but way too many kids, and I wasn't interested in that seeing as I was on my honeymoon. If you're okay with burning 5-8k on a room, seriously consider booking Grand Wailea or the Four Season. We regret not booking the Four Seasons, the resort is top notch. Yes, you'll pay through the nose, but they certainly go out of their way to accomodate your needs.

Great Hotel. This is our 3rd time staying here in 3 years. Booked the $199 terrace view rate and was upgraded to Ocean View at checkout. Everything thing was perfect. Very little noise.. normally only from like 10am til 2pm. Only drawback was the food selection as the restuarant open (pool one) basically only serves what is on the Room Service menu. Good food but selection is small. Best bet - Go to Shops of Wailea, there is a store called Wailers Village. They have a Breakfast deal that is $3.50. You get Bacon, scrambled eggs and either tater tots or toast. The amount of food you get is huge! Something like 8 pieces of Bacon and 30 tater tots and lots of eggs. Can easily be split by 2 people. This would cost you at least $15 at any resort. Another piece of advice. Beers at most resorts were at least $5.00. Go to Safeway and you can buy 30 beers for around $20. Saved $120 right there. Met lots of couples that had done this and bought a small cooler. We have stayed at the Kea Lani, Hyatt and the Wailea Marriott in the past on maui. We prefer the Marriott Wailea by far. Pools and restuarants aren't nearly as fancy as the others but the rooms and the grounds let you get so much closer to the ocean. Last part of our stay was in Lanai. I will try to post a report about this soon. All i can say is Lanai is the island we will be going to from now on for the majority of our stay. Loved the Four Seasons on Lanai, however the Wailea Marriott still has a better view as you can just take a bottle of wine(from Safeway) and sit right in the lounge chairs just 10 feet from the ocean and watch a fabulous sunset and the sea turtles playing in the waves. Try Mulligans, Mattaoes ( have to BYOB) but prices and atmosphere are great. Rented a Jeep Grand Cherokee from Dollar car rental for $238 for 7 days. Get out and explore the island. Drive 5 minutes south and you have Big Beach (1 of the best on the island). Drive around the the west Maui Mountains. Great drive and great scenery. Much shorter than rode to hana. Blow Hole was in action the day we went. If you have the time take the Ferry to Lanai even if just for the day. Spend $130 and rent a jeep from Eco Adventures and explore the island VIa 4x4 roads for hours. We went to a few beachs where we were the only people there. Literally saw maybe 10 other people on any of the 4x4 roads and we were exploring for over 8 hours. email me at it@boltonmga.com if you have any questions.

The hotel is in a prime location with beautiful views and adjacent to the ritzy Shops at Wailea. The poolside restaurant serves a fine breakfast buffet and happily it was included in our stay since it would be quite expensive to dine there otherwise. There is a lovely Beach Walk that overlooks the ocean and leads to other resorts adjacent to the Marriott. There are lounge chairs placed out on the lawns facing the ocean where we spent quite a bit of time in the late afternoons when we could find some shade. I would say that these are the main reasons for staying at the hotel. On the other hand, This Marriott is listed as a category 7 but in no way is it comparable to some category 6 marriotts that we have stayed in. It is undergoing renovations and has been for some time. One of their pools and most of the shops and their restaurant, the Hula Moons are closed. We were located in the Tower and had to use an elevator to get to the ground level in order to reach the pool and beach area. The elevator was in deplorable condition and is used by the maids and other hotel employees to transport their cleaning supplies. Our bathroom was tiny and contained only a very deep tub, no shower stall. a major disappointment. There is no direct access to the beach. There was no shade by the pools that were open and consequently if you want to spend any time there you must get there early to obtain one of the few beach umbrellas or pay $15/day for a cabana/lounge. The room was clean and bright and although the furniture was not comfortable and the balcony was crowded with just a table and 2 plastic chairs, the bed was very comfortable. Parking, if not using the valet service, was inconvenient. Since we paid for it with our Marriott Rewards Points it was not a total loss and in spite of our complaints, we loved Maui.

We stayed on Oahu for 3 days and spent the remainder of our trip (7 days) in Maui. We chose this hotel over the Renassaince simply becuase it had a better rating between the two and was within our price range. We arrived and immediatly were greeted with a shell necklace - nice, but everywhere in Hawaii typically does this. They were friendly, and check in was as long as it usually is. We had a lovely ocean view (which was probably the highlight of this hotel overall and made the stay somewhat positive). Right away my husband asks as we are ready to get the key and head on to our room, \"I have to ask, is there anything special for honeymooners?\". The desk clerk said \"Yes, do you like champagne? We can send a bottle up right away\". Well, I can tell you that we did not immedetialy receive that bottle of champagne, and I had to call at least 3 times down to the front desk and \"remind\" them about us. The last call, they finally mentioned \"Oh, they usually deliver it in the evenings.\" I think it was not a very welcoming jesture, and then it came to the point where I felt like I was begging them to follow through. Very dissappointed.... They also do not inform you of the $15.00 sur-service fee that you are paying everyday. They make it out to be optional, and if you do not read the many phamphlets that they hand out to you, then you would not even be aware that there is one. This fee gives you something like 10% off your meals at the hotel and then a percentage off the luau. Had we known this, we would have drank the bottles of Figi water that kept piling up in our room (we thought they were only for those who chose the resort passport) I can tell you that we skipped the luau, as we were in Oahu and visited the Polynesian Cultural Center and enjoyed their luau immensley. Like they mentioned above, if you've seen one luau, you've seen them all. I'd like the also mention the renovations were still being underway, and in their website they did note that it would be completed in July of 2006 - hardly finished by the time we were there which was 8/10 - 8/18. The lay out of this hotel is not for those who cannot get around easily without an elevator. Our room was on the 3rd floor and it was a workout each time (espcially since you are walking to and from the beach and pool) its a lot of walking. We opted for a deep tissue massage at the Mandara Spa - which is rediculously overpriced, but neither one of us had done it before and it was our honeymoon, so we gave it a try. While the massage itself was relaxing, it is not in the normal location. It is in a basic guest room with the beds removed! I was a little disappointed that it was not in the normal location (most likley due to the renovations) and thought for the price we were paying, they should have gived us an \"inconvenience\" discount. It seemed cheap. We were expecting a bit more from the pool area - I got the feeling the pool was not cleaned every day and it was disappointingly lukewarm - not something that is refreshing after basking in the sun. The guys at the towel hut were annoying. If you were just going to get a towel, you were getting hounded to \"Take the Maui Jim Challenge\". My husband owns a pair of his own Maui Jim sunglasses and they STILL hounded him every morning as if he were a new guest. So much for a sales pitch. Eating: Anyplace you go, you will easily drop $40.00 or more for a breakfast or a lunch out for two if you eat at the hotel restaurants. We found the Whalers General Store at the Shops of Wailea to be a nice option for grabbing a bagel or hot breakfast and you can spend under $10.00 for two ( a much better option). They also have deli sandwiches and such.

On the other hand, if you can overlook the obvious deficiencies, the location of the hotel is top notch. Unlike the Grand Wailea, which undeniably is the better hotel, the setting at the Marriott Wailea is more intimate and much less crowded. Unlike some of the other reviews, I found the housekeeping, parking and front desk staff to be quite responsive. Save your dining money by eating at the many surrounding restaurants. Our top choices: Mama's Fish House - absolutely a uniquely wonderful experience Sansei - had dinner here 3 times, its that good especially when discounts of 25-50% are offered for early bird (5:30-6pm) dinners Shaka Pizza in Kihei - pizza pretty decent for a quick meal w/kids For those who want to try authentic desserts - Homemaid bakery in Wailuku on Main St. Get there early as most popular items are gone by about 3-4PM. Despite the fanfare, found A Taste of Saigon (Vietnamese) to be a big disappointment. Fish was overcooked and the rest of the food was bland. Perhaps the chef was having an off day but disappointed enough to not return. Unless convenience is a major objective, suggest booking your activities (Kayaking, snorkeling, flying, biking etc) at various expedia.fun outlets. Found them quite knowledgible and reasonably priced. Trip highlights: - drive to Haleakala - boat ride/snorkeling at Molokini through Whale foundation. Very knowledgible hosts and very organized. Kids had a blast sliding and jumping in from the boat. - Kayaking/snorkeling from Makena Landing - used Kelli outfitters. Lots of fish, some turtles and can see Tiger Woods new house being built. - Drive South past Makena landing (about 3-4 miles) to see some incredible lava landscaping. First thought was why would someone dig up the land this way quickly gave way to recognizing land in its most raw form. - 30 North past Kapalua - drive very similar to Hwy 1 along S. and Central CA coast. Spectacular scenary - watch out when the state road ends and turns into a one lane \"road\" for about 15 miles - definitely not for the faint of heart.

I feel let down and mislead by the Marriott website, Marriott management and also by the previous reviewers of this property on tripadvisor for not being thorough and critical enough of a resort that charges 4-6 hundred per night. Marriott lists this property as a \"category 7\", this is as high as their system goes. NO WAY. Let me say that I am a Marriott Timeshare owner and stay at many resorts that are 3-5 stars for business and pleasure (I work for an international wine company.) I have heard much about the ongoing renovation. It didn't cause much noise in our wing (the haleakala tower) but it severely curbed the resorts dining options. Also, the hotel elevators in the tower wing look horrendous--what you'd expect in a budget Vegas hotel. I know transporting renovation materials causes a mess and puts scratches all over but the guest experience need not be affected if you set aside elevators for this purpose and kept certain ones for guests only. I can't believe management allows guests to use the \"beach access\" elevator--it looks like it went through a hurricane. What is very dissapointing is that management chose to keep this resort open and to continue charging regular expensive rates for a much degraded experience. No discounts and the resort had the huevos rancheros to actually charge a $15 per day resort fee! An outrage. The better option would have been to completely close the resort for 2 months and bring in hordes of workers to do it very fast so the guest wasn't exposed. Instead, Marriott chose to continue making a buck by delivering a poor product. The physical structure of the resort is 3 star--it's location is 5 star all the way. So why did I give this just 1 star? EMPLOYEE ATTITUDE, period. In my view, with the exception of the very good valets, the staff has given up for now and this place is devoid of Aloha Spirit. We didn't encounter outright rudeness, but no one made us feel welcome or seem to appreciate us. The front desk staff were sullen and did not smile on every occasion I had to interact with them. I asked for an upgrade and was denied flatly. If I wanted it, It was $175 for full ocean view and $300 for Ocean front. We had plenty of ocean view from our room but had to look out over the roof units and AC units of the main lobby. Room #817. One day at the kids pool my fiance' asked the towel attendant why the slide was closed and he didn't even look up from reading the newspaper while retorting \"lifeguard must be on break.\" On day #1 I left the housekeeper a $5 dollar tip and a nice note of thanks that was genuinely warm and she responded in no way at all. No cutely folded towels, no chocolate dipped strawberries, not even a note with a smiley face on it! I tipped her the same amount two days later and got the same result. I really felt like I was the one doing all the work trying to bring Aloha to this resort. I left two bottles of expensive wine when we checked out for the housekeeper with a note for her to enjoy them-- she really seemed to need a drink to loosen up. At checkout, I gave a $50 bottle of Cabernet to the clerk and instructed her to give it to the next honeymooners--her look and reply seemed to imply I was annoying her. My stomach turned. You would get more hospitality from Tom Boudet at Motel 6--atleast he'd \"leave the light on for you.\" I assure you I am no snob; I'm just not a pushover either. I do have expectations when rates are stratospheric. Here's some specifics: ROOMS: The renovated rooms where clean and adequate--not gorgeous but of slightly above average size; I would estimate 425 Sq. feet. Bathroom a bit small. Yes, the bed is terrific in every regard. Patio furniture is cheap. No seperate shower stall, just a bathtub. By the way, in pictures I've seen that Marriott is showing off it appears they are leading you to believe they have flat screen plasma TV's--not so. Technically, the screens are \"flat\" but the unit itself is large and not slender. A cooler is provided for use--it kept stuff cold. I agree with another reviewer that the towels are budget quality. They do provide good quality robes and a small safe for valuables. GROUNDS: Well maintained, very lush but lacking in bright color; mostly just green. Their are some water features but they aren't very impressive. The view from the open air lobby is very beautiful of the sea, unfortunately the lobby is very plain and lacks atmosphere. The resort is very spread out but it's nice to walk in the balmy breezes. Since there is no direct resort beach, loungers are put out by the rocks and provide nice spots for sunset watching. We saw some turtles playing in the surf. POOLS: Very ordinary for the adults. Not very big and no special features. (OK, it's an infinity pool but who cares!?) The kids pool was pretty cool as they have two fairly large slides that I had fun playing on. One of them is twisty and the other shoots you out into 10 feet deep water from a 5 foot dropoff. :) The kids pool also has a snack bar where you can get shaved ice--yummy. LUAU: Advertised as the \"best\", as are many things in Maui for that matter. Every single bar on the island makes the BEST Mai Tai, hhhmmm. If you have seen one Luau, you have seen them all, trust me. By the way, all of the resort luau's are so open you would have to be quite dense to actually pay $60-75 per person to have an actual seat and eat the food. You can see everything without paying--you just don't get a folding chair or poorly tasting food and poi--nasty anyhow. RESTAURANTS: We only ate at the poolside bar on our first night because we arrived at 9pm. Slow service but the food quality was good. Very outdated however. It's called the KUMU lounge and they served drinks in glasses circa 1980. I know it's by the pool, so the glasses have to be plastic but can't you find good plastic cocktail glasses when guests are paying these exorbitant rates? Main restaurant, Hula Moons is still under renovation. EXCURSIONS: Since you won't want to be spending much time at this character devoid resort you have many exciting options off premise. Maui is beautiful and worth exploring. We found a place called Activity Warehouse in Lahaina and booked 4 excursions that cost us only $204 each total. We had a 5 hour snorkel trip on the Leilani out of a nearby harbor (Maleea?) The crew was great--Paul and Sean were very cool and hospitable. We went to Molokini and Turtle Town. Great water clarity at Molokini with tons of fish to see. Some saw an 8 ft. white tip reef shark--awesome. Sea Turtles are everywhere in Maui--we saw a ton of them on \"Big Beach\" in Makena; which is just south of Wailea. Try to go to molokini on a calm wind day. We did a tandem 8 minute parasail ride in Lahaina that was serene, exciting, slightly scary and beautiful. I highly recommend it. Our boat crew was great and funny and very mischievious--they really loved to slow the boat down and \"dunk\" you in the ocean before they reeled you back in! It was fun but I kept on thinking that it wouldn't be so fun if a tiger shark managed to time his snack appropriately! :) When we were up the water is so blue and clear we could clearly see a large barracuda swimming below. We booked the 38 mile downhill Haleakala bike ride and sunset viewing but we skipped it as we couldn't pull ourselves out of the awesome bed at 2 in the morning! We did a 45 minute helicopter ride up to Haleakala and around the east in Hana. It was slightly scary too during turbulence. Those sitting up front by the pilot will also have much better views. I would still recommend it highly though. Alex air on the backside of the airport did a good job. RECOMENDATION: We visited two other resorts for comparison sake; the Renaissance (owned by Marriott) and the Grand Wailea. These resorts bookend the Marriott. Do yourself a very big favor. If you were going to stay at the Marriott on \"points\" or as part of a Marriott rewards program, as we were, switch to the Renaissance. It was absolutely gorgeous and the atmosphere was terrific. We got drinks from the lobby bar and watched the sunset while we fumed over how terrible our resort was in comparison. The Renaissance lobby is gorgeous with traditional hawaiian music playing. The grounds are also much better looking. And guess what? The Renaissance is actually listed as a category 6 and is less expensive than the Marriott! Change your reservation to the Renaissance or you will be very sorry. Or the other option is to spend more money and upgrade to the Grand Wailea. It is much more crowded but the pools are amazing--truly waterpark like. The grounds are simply amazing. You will have a serious case of resort envy if you go there. I know this is a \"downer\" review. When I was reading these reviews prior to my trip I didn't want to hear the negatives either. I wish I would have listened to the critical reviews!! If you are used to staying at budget hotels you will like the resort; but any kind of seasoned, upscale traveler will be greatly dissapointed. Shame on the resort for not considerably discounting rates while under construction! The Marriott is definitely the most blase' resort in all of Wailea. You are right next to the shops of Wailea--eat there. Other great dining experiences were at Ruth's Chris at the shops. Our waiter, Padgett, was amazing. An old Four Seasons guy who was a consumate pro. Wonderful and polite. Ask for him and tell him I sent you. (I tried to give him a bottle of Chalk Hill Merlot but he couldn't accept it due to local law) You can't bring wine into any Maui restaurant by the way, FYI. Sansei in Kihei was wonderful for sushi. Sunday and Monday for the first hour everything except alcohol is half price! Get there early! We got there 45 minutes before opening and a line had already formed. By the time the doors opened 150 people were lined up! Roy's in Kihei had good food but the place itself was not aesthetically pleasing at all. Roy's on the mainland are beautiful and oppulent--on Maui they look like cafeterias! For a real cool dining experience local style, go just past the Maui Prince hotel to the south and you will come upon a roadside Van/Shack called \"JAWZ\" Island Style Tacos. It was delicious, inexpensive and unpretentious--refreshing after all the ridiculously overpriced meals. That's about it for now. Feel free to contact me to discuss further and I'll give you as many details as I can.

The hotel is \"campus\" style with several smaller \"hales\" (units) that contain 20 - 30 rooms. This allows for guest to be spread out across the property. There is one large tower, however, we did not stay in this area. There are several pools (which need some modernization which should be coming soon) that allow for the guest to lounge close to their hotel rooms. The beach areas to the north and south (a one minute walk) are great and allow for great access to the Pacific. While the hotel is completing its renovations, construction noise and disturbances were non existent and never an issue. The renovated rooms are comfortable. One small complaint...since the rooms have tile floors, this allows for the guest staying above you to make a lot of noise by doing normal things like moving a desk chair, setting anything on the floor or closing the sliding glass door. For meals, I suggest avoiding the hotel unless you want to spend $24 per person for a breakfast buffet or $14 for a hamburger. The food in the evening isn't much better. An alternative would be to Cheeseburger Islandstyle, Maui Tacos, Sansei (great Japanese restaurant in Kihei), Italian restaraunt next to Sansei, Cinnamon Roll shop in Kihei for breakfast or stop by the Safeway and stock up on snacks, fresh produce and other items to avoid the $$$$ at the Marriott. Each room has a cooler, so there will be space to keep food fresh. The best restaurants in Maui are Mama's Fish House, Buzz's Wharf (for lunch) and Kimo's or other options in Lahaina town.

We arrived at the Marriott around 10pm after our flight, and we were greeted with heavenly-smelling leis and very friendly bellboys. The front desk check-in was smooth and fast, and they upgraded us from a garden-view room to an ocean-view which was a very pleasant surprise. The lobby area is open-air and has spectacular views. The room was nothing particularly special, but it was clean and neat. I don't need much more than that since I'm not one to stay much in a room when I'm visiting paradise! The next morning while my husband was in conference, I explored the grounds and, forgetting about the sun since it was such a mild and pleasant temperature, got a nice sunburn. The landscaping is lovely, and so many things were in bloom. The beach was a short little walk away, but since I'm not much of a sand and surf person, we only went there once. I'm used to the expansive, sugar-white beaches of the gulf coast, so I have to say that I wasn't all that impressed. It seemed small and not very good for swimming. But, like I said, I'm not much of a beach person, so I probably don't know what I'm talking about. The black sand beaches on the other side of the island (road to Hana) were much more interesting to me. Other than the conference-based breakfasts, we didn't eat in any of the hotel's dining establishments. Too pricey for our tastes. We did get their in-room dinner special twice, though. It's a great deal with quite a bit of food, and it can be utterly romantic. They come in and set up everything for you on your lanai. We ate after dark with the sound of the waves crashing, the tiki torches flickering, and a live band out by the pool playing Hawaiian music. It was just wonderful! Our other meals were gotten at The Shops at Wailea just steps away or on our island explorations. Keawakapu is just right around the corner by car and has lots of choices. Speaking of The Shops at Wailea, I spent some time there during the afternoons my husband was in conference. Lots of great upscale shopping as well as the ever-present ABC store where you can get pretty much anything you need. There's a great souvenier store/deli on the ground level by the main fountain that has huge delicious sandwiches - great for lunch. There was construction going on at the resort while we were there, but it was on the opposite side from our room, so we didn't even notice it. The pool area was really nothing special which was a disappointment. I was hoping for dramatic waterfalls or something like that. Watch out for the towel hut! They'll try to sell you some expensive sunglasses when you're just trying to get a towel. Overall, this is a lovely resort and was perfect for the kind of vacation I was interested in. It was a nice home base and place to relax in between island adventures. Speaking of adventures - definitely do Haleakala at sunrise and the Road to Hana. If you like even more wild driving, take the road around the back of Haleakala even though they claim it's unpaved and not for vehicles without 4 wheel drive. It was really not that bad, and we were in a Sebring convertible. Lots of fantastic view. For some really wild roads, take 30 around West Maui Mountain.

The renovations were still taking place, but I did not find the noise to be a problem. They are mainly working on room renovations right now, and the noise it limited to during the day. Our room was recently renovated. The rooms all seem to have the same look now, off white textured wall paper, dark wood doors, door frames and furniture, some modern art on the walls and ceramic tile flooring. Beds were extremely comfortable. I have 3 children (3, 6, and 9) and they enjoyed the pools. Childrens pool has a fun play area and 2 good slides even fun for adults. All pools were not too crowded, I imagine because so many of the rooms were being renovated and unoccupied. We had buffet breakfast one day at the restaurant. Price was not too bad, the whole bill was $40 for the 5 of us due to a discount you get from the mandatory $15 resort fee. Buffet was just OK, nothing special. The Marriott has no beach, but its lava rock coast is beautiful. There are plenty of lounge chairs set up on the grass by the rocks. It was a very peaceful place to relax. Two beaches are just a short walk in either direction. Wailea Beach to the right is very nice. Good for snorkeling as well. Don't rent snorkels from the resort, much cheaper at Maui Dive Shop at the Shops at Wailea - even cheaper if you drive up to Kihei. As far as dining, Cheeseburger in Paradise at the Shops is great, Sansei in Kihei very good for sushi and seafood. Mama's Fish House on the other side of the island is excellent. Kind of pricey, but very good food and great old Hawaii atmosphere. For shave ice, go to Maui Espresso - it's a little stand in Kihei on S. Kehei Rd in the Rainbow Mall shopping center.

Much larger but also more corwded, but the water was clearer and a little warmer. Yes the resort is under renovation, but for the most part, you will not notice it. They are working on the far left side of the resort, so just try to get a room closer to lobby or as close as you can get, and you'll be fine. Our package came with a nightly appetizer at the Kumu bar and grill poolside. They were actually pretty good and we took advantage of them daily. We did not eat at any other restaurants on site, but ate at Roys in Kihei, and at Maui Thai also in Kihei. Kihei is only a quick 10 min drive and has just about everything you need including a Safe Way for any groceries. Plenty of restaurants of all kind there. Which bringe me to the best part of the stay...... The rooms!! Make sure you get one of the renovated rooms...they are beautiful..very nicely decked out. If possible try to get a corner suite, which is much larger. We were in room 700 and it was excellent. The beds will probably be the best beds you will ever sleep on in any hotel. I have slept on the Westin Heavenly Sleeper, and thay dont even compare to these ones. I didnt see one of the older rooms, but they did tell me that they should be done with all the rooms by June, so if youre looking top go after that, it wont be an issue. The concierge at the Marriott, Stacy, was excellent. She is very helpful and if you have any questions, you can contact her before you get there, and she can book any trip you want for you. Also did the Luau at the MArriott, which was pretty good. Had a fun time and would recommend getting there early. Another great part of this resort was the lack of kids there. If youre going as a couple and prefer not to have kids running around, then I'd recommend this hotel. If you have a family with little ones, then I'd go elsewhere until they have all their renovations done, since there isnt much in terms of facilities for kids. We took a stroll to the Grand Wailea next door, and if you can afford to splurge, then definitely go there. It has a lot of kids running around though, and actually gives you a good reminder of how quiet the Marriott is.

We were literally passing hallway, after hallway to get to the elevator to get to the lobby. Seemed like it took forever. We didn't see any carts to take us anywhere.

The pools are really far from one another and they are cold. We appreciate heated pools. Again, this has to do with the layout and the location of our room but it was a 5 minute walk to get to the adult pool. We like to be a little closer than that. We paid $355 per night and in retrospect wish we had booked the Fairmont, which was just a bit more expensive but have all the 5 star qualities that this one is lacking.

(Check out the Grand Wailea..beautiful but busy.) The hotel staff were wonderful! Very friendly and the room (which hadn't been remodeled yet)we stayed in was very clean and nice. I won't pack shampoo next year as theirs was better than the salon shampoo I normally use. I have thin, fine hair and was worried about how the ocean water would affect my hair but their shampoo and soap was great. The lotion in the room smells like mango or peach..mmmm. Food: Expensive. Wailea is a resort. We found a grocery store and did snacking. Eating out at Roy's was execelent. It was like eating a piece of artwork and so good! Dinner for 2 w/o drinks but with desert was about $90. One night we ate at \"Da Kitchen\" Lots of food, kind greasy..about $24 for 2. Next visit we want to drive up to Liahana (about 45-60 min. drive with traffic) to eat at \"Bubba Gumps\". One day we just bought 4 different types of fish and BBQ on the beach. Great fish in Maui!! Snorkeling: If you know what you are doing you can get in right in front of the hotel on the rocks. Be careful as you don't even feel it and you are bleeding from the coral. If you want to be more careful walk eather direction on the path and get in at the beach. It wasn't real clear but good enough. It was really cool to swim with the hugh turtles. I didn't see an eel but a friend did. The water is perfect temputure and the waves at the beach are great for body surfing. In Dec. I think the waves are for the more experienced surfers. Non-water: I saw the turtles everyday sitting on the lounge chairs, even saw some dolphins. I talked to people who saw the whales but it seems that I just missed them each time they surfaced. We drove up the road to Liahana and beyond. We found this \"Rainforest\", parked the car on a little turnout, found the path that walks through it which leads you to a quiet little cove you can snorkel and watch surfers not far away. (We watched part of the Billa Bong Women's competition) WARNING...do not drive back to Wailea via this highway. If you continue on this skinny highway it gets much skinnier. The road narrows to one lane with mountain on one side and drop off on the other side. Beautiful but terrifing! We were really glad to get off that road! We didn't make it to Hana but others that had done both roads said the road to Hana was a piece of cake compared to this road. Taking home stuff: You can only take pineapple if you get it \"airport ready\". Sorry no mango, coconuts are OK. We got stuff for the kids and friends from K-mart. We may have been able to get the plain and chocolate covered nuts cheaper at Costco but we ran out of time. K-mart was OK, especially for cheap t-shirts. Would we go again...and stay in the Marriott?

It was WONDERFUL!!!!! We stayed in an ocean-front room that was very reasonably priced BECAUSE they're doing renovations on buildings that we never saw or heard! We specifically asked for a quiet room away from the renovations, and I would have to say we got the best room they have. We walked down the sidewalk that runs along the ocean and saw what are supposed to be the best places to stay, and in no way was I envious. Our hotel was perfect for us -- quiet, neat, lovely, no crowds -- when we would go to the lovely edgeless pool, or to sit in the jacuzzi next to it, there would be nobody, or at most, 2 families there. Very few children, as their children's pool with bells and whistles is now not open, due to renovation. The grounds are lovely, and kept pristine. Our room was fresh and clean every day. The ladies who clean it do an excellent job. The sandy beach is a stone's throw from our lanai, in both directions. Due to this season, too, I'm sure, we nearly had the beach to ourselves, unless we walked down the path too far and strayed to the ritzy resorts with all their cabanas. That place was packed!! Nope, we liked our end much better. The staff at our place was very helpful and accomodating. They provided an internet room free (due to renovations? All this fuss about renovations that never once affected our experience!!) If I were to do it again, I would go back here without a second thought. I feel like 2316 is \"our\" room and it's waiting for our return. Don't bother to rent snorkles at the store, rent from the resort - you can rent by the day. BUT, Snorkle-Bob's has great shirts to take back to the kids. Also, Bad---- Coffee, which is not far from the airport, is in front of a great little walk-through open air market where you can purchase a huge assortment of reasonably priced souvenirs on your way back to the airport. Give yourself an hour, you won't want to leave too quickly. Do NOT get the souvenirs at the luau! You'll find a lot of the same stuff here much cheaper! We did not eat at the Wailea Marriot. One of the restaurants was closed and the poolside food was pricey. We would pick up muffins or danishes at the grocery store daily before we would go back, and have them and the coffee provided by the hotel in the room, out on our lanai for breakfast. We got a cheap styrofoam cooler at the kmart and put lunch meats into it and cold drinks for a dollar for a half dozen at the store. This was for convenience's sake. We found that trying to read the guide books and figure out where was good food got very ponderous after a couple days, and we would often find ourselves where food wasn't convenient. Roy's was the one excellent dinner that WAS really ALL it was cracked up to be -- food was super, texture, color, and their chocolate souffle is to die for.", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Faribault, MN", "Title": "\u201cVisually stunning\u201d", "Author": "Jd318us", "ReviewID": "UR4045113", "Content": "I spent 3 nights at this property last week.

This was the first trip to Hawaii for both of us, we've just been through two months of stress leading up to our wedding (which was less than 48 hours earlier), and upon arrival, American Airlines did not deliver my wife's suitcase. So, we were in a crabby mood upon check-in. I had reserved our ocean-front room 7 months previous, and was ready to move on. But, I was informed that the rate I was quoted would only provide an ocean-front non-smoking room \"if available\", and currently there were none available, only smoking; or a non-smoking with partial ocean view. It felt like an upper-cut after already getting jabbed in the jaw at the airport. My wife was nearly in tears, as it appeared nothing was going right for us. So, we agreed on the smoking ocean-front for one night, then would hope for an upgrade the next day. I went to park the car while my wife watched the bags. When I got back, the bell man informed me that a non-smoking ocean-front room had magically become available. Frustrated as I was after pleading at the front desk for 10 minutes and being told there was nothing they could do, we didn't ask any more questions and went to the room. We were extremely pleased. We were in Hale 4 on the second floor, so our sliding glass door opened up to the ground level and we could walk straight out anywhere. We were glad to have a mini-fridge for beers and bottled water. As much as I despise these \"resort fees\" everyone is trying to hide from their nightly rates, I think we broke even. We parked ourselves; bought the Luau at the Marriott (saving about $40 off their price) and I brought my laptop to get on the internet, so we were spared ridiculous local-call charges that easily could have reach $20 as many times as we logged off and back on line. So, we think we broke even. We didn't mind walking - to the pool, parking area, Luau grounds, neighboring beaches, etc. I know people have written about how spread out the property is - but it seemed to us like all of Wailea was very walk-friendly. We walked to the Grand, and the Four Seasons for dinner. The Shops at Wailea being around the corner was a plus. The walking just wasn't an issue for us. Construction noise: Okay - Marriott's construction was not a factor. Only once did we notice commotion, when we were by the front desk and noticed a forklift moving stacks of mattresses to the big tower. Otherwise - the biggest construction racket was caused by the villas and condos being built between the Marriott and Grand, in front of the Shops at Wailea. Too bad for Longhi's, Tommy Bahama, Ruth's Chris, etc. - because their view is getting WRECKED by these new villas. We don't have kids, but whomever did and were at the kids pools at the Marriott dealt with some serious construction noise! I would imagine that folks in Hale 6 and 7 dealt with this too during the day, and may be following my good review with a bad one. But, we didn't get bothered. Our pool time was spent at the main pool, and it was beautiful. Great hot tubs to soak in after sunset. Plus, we brought a cooler of beer to the pool - at first trying to be sneaky, not knowing if we were breaking any rules. Soon enough, the waitress just asked us to pour our beers into plastic cups and to please throw the cans away. Is that all? Thanks!! We tipped her $5 for doing nothing but being cool about it. The Hula Moon breakfast was something that surprised us, as I had read no review of this coming in. Even at $23 per person, it was excellent! One of my Maui-expert friends practically demanded that we go to the Grand Wailea breakfast buffet, saying it was the best of the best. Well ... here's what Hula Moon's included for $23 that the Grand DID NOT for $25: champagne, pancakes, waffles, little 3-4oz. cuts of New York Strip steak, and a bread pudding dessert. Plus ... a better view. From Hula Moons you see the ocean, Lanai, Kahaloowe and Molokini. From the Grand you see the pool and palm trees, with the ocean somewhere behind them. All we had was breakfast at Hula Moons, not dinner or anything else, but we considered that a highly underestimated and under-hyped aspect of the resort. The Luau was very nice - but we've been to no others and have nothing to compare it to. Very friendly staff, good food (nothing outstanding or worth a great rave, but good) and an entertaining show with a fire-twirler who was billed as the \"3-time world champion\" of fire twirling. With Mai Tais flowing non-stop and the sun setting from behind, it was a memorable outing. Also something I didn't read about here on TA: there are two washing machines and two dryers in Hale 7 for resort guests. Had we known about it before hand, it would have drastically changed the way we packed. As it was, we still washed many items and were greatful we discovered them. I complain constantly, and know there are things I frowned on when I was out there, but I just can't think of anything now as standing out. I do remember the carpet being the nastiest I've seen in any hotel in America, but I know they're fixing that up soon. The parking spots were designed for European minis and all the cars there were full-size or vans, so it's one of those deals where you park and have virtually no room to open your door. We wished kids were kept to a kids pool, so we could just lounge peacefully with our cocktails without fear of a ball hitting us in the head, or some 9 year old doing a cannonball off the side of the pool and splashing everyone ... but, maybe that's just a honeymooner's prejudice against distracting quiet-killers.

We'd been there 5 yrs ago as honeymooners when the hotel was still called \"Outrigger Wailea.\" We think it was a bargain compared to all the other hotels in the Wailea area. I agree w/ other's comments about the openness and not feeling crowded. We stayed at an oceanfront room ground floor and were at a unit that was one of the closest to the ocean. The room was a pukey green and definitely outdated but clean. The website and brochures had said we'd get bathrobes but we had to ask for ours (no slippers though). There is optional turndown service (which you have to request) but I wouldn't bother. This is currently NOT the kind of hotel that fits with this service. (We love turndown service but when it matches the hotel amenities). Because it's so spread out, you potentially have to do a LOT of walking to get to the lobby/parking/concierge. Compared to the other hotels near it (Four seasons, Grand Wailea), the Marriott is definitely below their standards. I'd give it a 3 star. But I can't complain because we paid around $270 a night for ocean front (as a Marriott Rewards member) and you can't get that price for ocean front in peak season anywhere else at the surrounding hotels. Their mandatory resort fee was a waste of $15 a day. Supposedly, it includes \"free\" valet parking (but you end up tipping and I think it's a conspiracy to keep their valets getting business but we're suckers for valet so ended up tipping about $6-8/day extra) and one appetizer per room (but we never went because the hours were restricted (eg 3-5pm at the poolside grill) and it's not like you go to their restaurants just to share one appetizer and then leave). It's a way to try to make you eat at their restaurants and targets dinner time but we're mostly vegetarian and their menus for vegetarians sounds unappetizing (their only dinner entree was tofu w/veggies--and costs about $19--no thanks!!! We'd rather spend that money at a restaurant w/ better food and selections). They also have a luau which we went to 5 yrs ago and didn't go to this time. I heard they are going to stop it though and build a restaurant there instead. Might as well. It was an average luau. We never ordered room service bcause as stated above, their vegetarian options were limited and it costs MORE to order room service than to actually go to their restaurants to eat and get 'serviced'. There's a 20% mandatory fee added to the order and on top of that a $3 fee. I'm not sure if they want tip for the delivering person as well--probably. You don't even get your water glasses filled or any waiter service and you are essentially paying over 20% above the total to just have some food delivered. Unless you are comatose or bed slugs (or newlyweds), I'd advise trekking outside of your room for food. There is no beach and only rocks at the oceanfront of the hotel but we were fine w/that. You could walk to a nearby beach. They are also doing renovations right now but they are localized right now to towers near the lobby--which we were far away from so we didn't hear a peep. Hopefully, they'll do a great job updating the rooms and decor. The service was so-so. We had a male concierge who practically pressured us to go w/Aloha Blue for the Molokini snorkel trip. He discouraged us from using other boats and didn't give us any options. It cost about $85 dollars and we didn't think it was worth it. The captain and crew were pretty nice though. The boat fits around 30 people and was VERY choppy. My husband was seasick as were a few others. The concierge also told us they have a good lunch for vegetarians and it was NOT true. There were a few cold veggieburgers (no grill) and a pasta salad. I wonder if the concierge gets kickbacks from recommending this charter. It turns out we met another Marriott couple who had been sent their by the concierge too. We found the concierges at Marriott definitely subpar (we interacted with 2-3 of them). They didn't seem knowledgeable, did not seem interested, and didn't give us much options (they would jump to their favored \"brand\" and were not interested in discussing the others--sort of pooh-poohed the others). So I wouldn't use them or use them with a grain of salt and a lot of independent research and DON'T get pressured into bowing to their \"expertise\". The staff at Marriott were OK but not outstanding or excellent. I'd give them a good rating. Once they update the hotel appearance wise, they should update their staff too to be more professional, helpful, knowledgeable. There was one valet who was great (greeted my husband by name). The staff are decently friendly and not snooty. Overall, we paid 3 star prices (for Wailea that is--it's a pricey hotel area) and got 3 star rooms (in terms of appearance), service. So we can't complain. We were happy with our fantastic view which was 5 star view so we think we got a good bargain. Once they finish the renovations, I bet they'll raise their prices to be more comparable w/other hotels in the area but need to work on their amenities and staff training and services to justify the increase. They have a nice looking spa which we didn't use and the exercise room was pretty nice. Bring your own water (from Costco near the airport) because the Evian bottles in the room cost almost $5/bottle. Happy traveling! PS. Bring bug repellant--especially in the summer!!!

The decision was a good one. We just returned (6/19/05) from a wonderful and relaxing stay at this resort (check out my photos of the WM, taken last week). To summarize our feelings about this resort, it is all a matter of what you prefer, we like warm friendly environments that are not over-done. We like staying at places that cater to us with a friendly staff, resorts or hotels whose clientele is interested in relaxing and not impressing you or themselves with their social status. The WM is our kind of place and currently a great value, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait or you will miss it. Construction: We found it to be almost non-existent. During our stay, all 4 pools (except slide at main pool) and restaurants were operational. The construction was under way in the Haleakala Tower with little physical evidence except occasional pounding (daylight hours only) heard in the area of the main reception entrance. There was more construction noise heard from the condo construction next door, but again, it was during the day and more obvious to residents of the Grand Wailea (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153GW\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) (more on this resort later), two doors down from the WM. Room Cost & Condition: Our Oceanfront room in building Hale 7 (Hale means house in Hawaiian) was roomy and very clean, not worn but well maintained, they are upgrading these rooms but for the $ paid a good value, and very nice. We booked our travel package via Northwest Airlines MLT Vacations. The package included air, convertible car rental and an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanview king room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with daily breakfast for 2 (more on this later) included. I calculated, considering the best deals I could book separately on the airfare & car, the king room w/breakfast cost under $250/night including tax. I paid the $15.00/night mandatory resort fee separately. We arrived @ 6:00 PM and were quickly greeted by a very friendly staff, the receptionist immediately upgraded us (without us requesting) to a third floor OCEANFRONT room. Like so many prior reviews we read, we thought the upgrade was unlikely, but it proved out to happen for us, our room was literally ~100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the Pacific Ocean. The king bed mattress was used, but did not sag and was comfortable. There was a double sleeper bed sofa in the room, hot shower, cable TV, cold a/c (note most condos in Maui do not have a/c), small refrigerator and coffee maker (or tea) in bath area (this was a nice addition), granite countertops, marble floors in bath rooms (one roomy bath comprised of 2 rooms),in-room safe, lanai with table and chairs overlooking ocean, washer ($1.25) and dryer ($.75) in each building, daily (M-F)local paper delivered to the door. Breakfast at the Hula Moons Restaurant: buffet (w/waiter service) was included free in our package, the posted price:($22.95 pp). Champagne or Mimosa; HOT coffee or tea; made-to-order Belgian waffles (blueberry, macadamia and plain);chef cooked-to-order omelets; island and other fresh fruits; yogurt; breads, bagels, muffins, doughnuts and Danish; Fruit smoothies & 3 fresh juices; potatoes; bacon, sausage, eggs, cheese blitzes, pancakes, bread pudding, rice, several dry cereals, hot oatmeal and many other items too numerous to mention. All this seated at an open-air table overlooking the pools and picturesque Pacific Ocean. (or you can sit inside if you miss the city life). This breakfast was great, I think I gained 5 lbs from this alone! $15.00 per room Resort Fee: while no one likes to pay extra fees, this one didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me considering the overall value. For $15/day + tax, you receive valet or self-parking (your choice), unlimited local calls, high-speed internet in central room (beats dial-up in the room) with 6 individual computers, free daily sunset appetizer, discounts on luau (very good show, but not worth the $74.95, we saw it from our lanai), snorkel/fin rental or scuba dive, access to fitness center. The WM Resort: Wonderful, sprawling, spacious and friendly. We visited the GW and the Four Seasons (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153FS\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), just a few minutes stroll 2 and 3 doors down the coast from the WM, and they were nice and very polished at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153price\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The lowest price at the GW or FS is at least double what I paid for a comparable room location. If you want to be really pampered and stay in high-rise buildings, next to lots of people with the closest hotel room multiple 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of feet from the ocean, then stay at the GW or the FS, we preferred the WM. . The WM is comprised of 3-story buildings Hale 1 thru 7, except for the one 8-story Haleakala Tower. It is nice that the WM has no sand beach immediately in front of the hotel. If you are familiar with Maui, the coast is mostly lava rock with short stretches of public sand beaches in-between. The GW and Four Seasons like most of the beachfront resorts are on PUBLIC beaches. So while you pay a price for location, you share it with the public and at most times in a crowded noisy way. There is a winding paved pathway connecting the Wailea sand beach (South of WM) to the Ulua sand beach (North of WM), guests jog and walk on this path. During our visits to GW and the FS we noted how crowded the beach and pool areas were, how many people were Nextel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ing each other or talking loudly on their cell phones. We experienced none of this at the WM. You could carry your own chaise lounge, or plop onto one that is already there, to any spot on the 1000\u00e2\u20ac\u2122+ grassy oceanfront overlook in front of the WM. We spent several mornings and afternoons on these lounges, after obtaining clean beach towels daily from the concession at any of the pool areas, with virtually no one within 50 feet of us. While lounging were entertained by a family of sea turtles (~2 feet in diameter) playing in the surf just in front of our room. A popular dive spot (known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turtle town\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) is just off the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coast, you can snorkel here just outside your room in the clear blue Pacific. The grounds are so spacious, you feel like the WM is almost your own private resort, figure that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6less price - more privacy. We guessed that most of the high-rise hotel occupants and public were at the crowded beaches, leaving the WM for just its residents that chose to stay there. We found each member of the resort staff to be helpful and very friendly, when you walked past an employee they always greeted you with a cheerful hello. Tips: Stock your refrigerator with your favorite beverages water from a local grocery. While on Maui, be sure to drive (best view from a convertible with the top down) the road to Hana to see: cliffs, waterfalls, beaches, towns, rainforests, and active pasture lands. Also visit the Haleakala Crater at sunrise or sunset, both are magnificent. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to enjoy the Wailea Marriot resort and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true value, the deals won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t last long once the renovations are completed. We will be back even at the higher price.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Noblesville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cBest value in Wailea\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3546754", "Content": "This was our 1st trip to Maui and found Wailea to be paradise. The area is surrounded by luxury hotels and the Marriott is by far the best deal. The lawns were lush and tropical, the jagged coastline mesmorizing, and the sunsets worth the flight over. We stayed 4 night at the Marriott and found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly. As excited as we were to be there, they seemed to be as eager to tell us the highlights of Maui. We also stayed in Kapalua and found the staff to be much more pleasant in Wailea. The rooms are somewhat outdated but always clean. We didn't go to Maui for the rooms. The Wailea area is better than any of the pictures you see. The hotel strip is exceptionally clean and quiet. The shops located near the Marriott are upscale but also provide your typical chains. The Whaler General Store, located in the Shops, will provide you with a \"to go\" boxed lunch well under $10.00. The lunch's are similar to Einstein bagels or Panera Bread. We wished we had known about this sooner. The hotel food is expensive...especially for breakfast ($22.95/person). If you must pay this then eat late and skip lunch. The hotel is gracious to offer at least a complimentary breakfast during your stay. If you have rented a car there is a shopping area 5 minutes away that offer many American chain restaurants. We ate at the Outback 2 times just to save some money on food. The beach area is great for snorkeling. There are many trips to Molokini to see the turtles but we saw several of them when we went snorkeling at the Marriott beach. Same view and free. I would recommend a helicopter tour if budget allows. We traveled down the same waterfall that was filmed in Jurassic park. Also, the trip to Hana was beautiful. The tour group that we went with made my husband car sick with how fast she drove (621 curves to Hana). If you do it on your own, then you can stop and swim in the waterfall pools. A great memory to take home. As for the Marriott, it is by far the best deal in the Wailea area. The hotel was extremely quiet and caters to more of an adult crowd. Having the children area separate is nice for families with or without children. The infinity pool overlooks the jagged coastline. Not having a public beach directly in front of the hotel keeps the noise level down and the view undisturbed. Enjoy your stay at the Marriott... it won't always be the best deal in Maui.", "Date": "June 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cnot pretentious, beautiful lawns, romantic ocean view\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3540784", "Content": "Stayed At Marriott for 5 nights and the 6th night at the Grand Wailea Resort.

I was the one who just commented a few wks ago about the person who stated this was the 'worst condition' hotel. I stated then we were going to take a trip back, and we did. We just returned and we were NOT dissapointed. People who go to this hotel have to understand this is one of, if not the oldest resort in Wailea. It is going to be renovated (supposed to start June 05----July 06 I believe). And until then it is just fine. It doesn't have to be PERFECT paying the rates you pay to go to this resort. If you need perfect, go stay at the Four Seasons and pay 500 to 800 a night. But I won't pay those rates and would prefer to stay at a wonderful place where the staff are fabulous and things are very good. The beds really are the only thing I would complain about if there was anything I would complain about. They are taking all the beds out however and replacing them with really nice ones I have heard. And so, by next year there should be alot more 'comfort' when you stay at this resort. I have been told they are adding a childrens/tot area. And making the current pool that is for children, a 'teen' area. The adult pools I think will have changes as well. The renovations on the buildings I have been told will be starting with the 'tower' building. And also just so you know, the current 'restaurant' will also change. Half of the restaurant is to be the spa, which currently is just in part of one of the hotel room/buildings. So that will be nice for the spa to have a nice area for them. And the restaurant will expand over into where the bar area is now I was told. Not sure where the bar will be going. But I don't drink, so didn't ask about that. Just want whomever is contemplating to go over to Maui, this is a place where if you are looking for serenity, this is where you would find it. It never seems to be noisy whatsoever! We always stay in the Hale 2 building which is a low rise building.....only 2-3 stories. And is closest to the Ulua Beach which is really a great snorkeling spot. The rocky area out in front of the Hale 2 building is where a family of sea turtles reside. They are out there most anytime of the day you can spot one or two of them swimming around. Pay the extra money and get a 'deluxe oceanfront' room and you will see them from your balcony! My husband actually went out and saw a octopus and a turtle one day! Great place to snorkle! Now to address the 15.00/day resort fee which they have added since we last went to Maui last year. Actually this fee is GREAT! What we liked about it was that our childrens evening meals were INCLUDED---FREE in this fee. So they both ate supper completely free on the childrens menu. And it included a drink and a dessert! It was a wonderful thing! Also it includes valet/self parking. We used the valet as it was nice that my husband could just go with us instead of parking the car! Other things were included in the fee as well, like free appetizers in the evening. And other things we didn't use. But this fee was well used! And it was a bargain for us! This is a wonderful resort.

On arrival because there was no upgrade offered we upgraded ourselves to what was supposed to have been a better room. It was rm700 end of the row with a pie shaped lawn ending at a wall with huge trees and no view at all. Went back to what we were suppose to get only to be given a room overlooking roofs of AC units. Had to settle for a room with two (2) double beds. We were told that the only other rooms with king size bed were in smoking. We specified nonsmoking, king size bed 6 months prior. This was our 2nd trip back to the Wailea hotel and we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversay. I know they are going to have a 60 million dollar renovation, I am just hoping their prices won't be sky rocketing to the moon. Room service was excellent, breakfast buffet excellent with people friendly waiters and waitresses, registration and concierge services just ok, bellhop and valet services great. Had trouble at registration with room and mandatory $15 charge for valet parking, free internet service in a room with just 2 computers to work from unless your brought your own ,free daily appetizers which if you were not moving around and doing things would be appreciated. Reading reviews from people who have stayed there between Nov. 04 and Mar. 05 they make no mention of mandatory $15 fee. Hotel has good possibilities and a nice location. I will be keeping my eye on this hotel and hope they don't price themselves out of my desired price range for example their neighboring hotels.

We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast every morning - fantastic!! We had dinner at Hula Moons once - very nice and romantic - good food. We had appetizers at Mele Mele lounge which were also good. I also loved the ocean view with the lava rocks - something you don't see every day. Also - there is a walkway along the beach to the other resorts (Renaissance, Grand Wailea, Fairmont Kea Lani, Four Seasons). It was great for strolls in the morning and evening.

Based on a number of reviews I had previously read I had significant doubts before arriving. Prior reviews had mentioned an old hotel, poor amenities, lizards, what have you. This hotel is in a fabulous location right next to the shops at Wailea. It has beautiful grounds, is well maintained (major renovations are starting in April), and offers stunning views of Maui, the ocean, and several neighboring islands. Classic outdoor lobby with a concourse of shops. This will be remodeled soon but is great even now. The pools are clean and well staffed but not opulent. If you must have free form pools with waterfalls, etc. try somewhere else. We liked to swim in the ocean and found the pools (including a kids pool with slides for our 8 year old) and jacuzzis to be just fine. The hotel is on a \"lava beach\" (with sea turtles visible in the water) but a very short walk puts you on the same beach that the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons use (it is public). For no charge you can take as many chairs as you need from a stack on the beach (you bring your beach towels down from the Marriott)- this is totally ok to do. For a fee you can rent an umbrella from a vendor at the beach. Our room was in the Haleakala tower (8 story building). We had a full ocean view. The room was clean, comfortable, very quiet, and everything worked. They will soon renovate this building (the rest of the hotel to follow) with new flooring, furniture, beds, etc. Our room was great even before the remodel. There are many ocean front rooms in two and three story buildings. These looked similar to our room and will also be remodeled in the near future. The restaurant only charged about $5 for the breakfast buffet for kids 8 an under- this is a very good deal and our daughter was very happy with the selections. We had dinner at the hotel on one night and we had fantastic lobster tails, a generous glass of wine, salads, and bananas foster- all very good. There are many great places to eat in the area. Mike W. was one of the concierge staff and he was fantastic. Friendly, enthusiastic, and was right on the mark with food and activity suggestions. I had a poor experience (our only glitch on this trip) with one other concierge but the hotel manager made things right. If you want to save some money on beachside food, order boxed lunces from the Whaler General Store in the shops at Wailea. You can call ahead. They have a full service deli. For about $10 you can get a sandwich, chips, small slaw, etc, giant cookie, and a soda in a nice box to go. My daughter enjoyed the kids club (twice). One of the activities was a nature walk to look for geccos (lizards). Despite what someone had written earlier about animals everywhere the kids only saw one lizard. I've seen more critters at upscale hotels in Palm Springs and Scottsdale. As for the two legged animals, I felt the hotel never seemed too crowded due to the nice, spatious lay out of the grounds. Anyway, I went from skeptic to fan of this property. I would definitely consider staying there again particularly after their pending upgrades. I don't know how much they will raise their rates but now they are a steal next to the adjacent properties mentioned above.", "Date": "March 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, NJ", "Title": "\u201cResponse to poster who said all rooms open to the outside\u201d", "Author": "Slinky1", "ReviewID": "UR3284860", "Content": "Just wanted to respond to the person who posted that all rooms open to the outside.

The hallway is open-air, but none of the doors open directly to the outside. There are other 2-3 story units scattered around the property; perhaps that's what the poster was referring to. Although we didn't stay in one of those units, I could see how they might get lizards in the hallways there...they seemed more open. Also, it depends on your tolerance for things like that. My husband and I both love the outdoors and liked the \"open-air\" feeling of this property. If we saw a lizard, it wouldn't freak us out. We've seen lizards or geckos on trips to Florida and the Caribbean and just chalk it up to being in the tropics. We saw lizards on some of the walls in the hallway at the Hyatt in Kauai.

We relied on this site extensively when trying to decide where to stay in Maui and it was probably the best decision we made. Here are some of the highights: Location, Location, Location! There is no other resort in Wailea that is closer to the ocean than the Marriott, literally. As the oldest resort in Wailea, its developers definitely took advantage of the choice land available at that time. Our ocean front room was so close to the ocean that the sound of the waves lulled our 15 month old daughter to sleep every night while we sat on the balcony drinking mimosas under the moonlight. Shopping The brand new Shops at Wailea are a five minute walk away. Cuisine Breakfast buffet was great, we went every morning. The cost is $23.99pp so make sure to get this included in your package to save some money. Lunch was ok, menu was not very extensive. Drinks were verrry good. Service With a smile - all the time! Room service was never longer than 15 minutes. Housekeeping immaculate. Turn down service every night. Staff at the front desk, concierge and activities desk were extremely warm and friendly. Also, after you check in, depending on where your room is located you are transported via golf cart. Car Rental On site and five minutes away at the Shops at Wailea. We rented a car for three days of our trip. DEFINITELY RENT A CAR! Spa My husband had a oceanside massage which he didn't feel was that great. The spa itself was a bit lacking in the amenities but the menu was extensive. Of course there was no way that I was going to the Mandara Spa with the Grand Wailea Spa right next door. Girls, I don't care what you have to do to make it to the Grand Wailea Spa - just get there anyway that you can. The prices are about twice as much as everywhere else, but it is well worth it. You will definitely leave feeling like a new person. Beach There is no beach in front of the the resort. But both resorts on either side of the Marriott have decent beaches. We are not big beach fans so this was not a bummer for us. Kid Friendly Great kiddie pool with water slide for kids and adults. Wailea's Best Luau We had a blast! This is our first one so we don't have anything to compare it to. There were about 800 people and it was very well organized. The fire dancer was moving so fast that we got tired just watching him. The Luau is right on the premises and you can charge the cost to your room.

I can't say enough great things about this hotel. We chose Wailea, because we heard the beaches and snorkeling were excellent, and the weather in this part of Maui was always good. We were right! We pulled up to an open-air courtyard after driving down a banyan-tree-lined lane. The lobby is open-air, with views of Northern Maui from the veranda. The air was perfumed with fragrant tropical flowers. The staff was friendly and helpful...every staff member we encountered was smiling and relaxed. We were automatically upgraded to partial-ocean-view since we were on our honeymoon. We originally booked a garden-view room. The room was large and comfortable, the bathroom clean and sparkling. Partial ocean-view meant we could see the roof of one of the other buildings, but otherwise our balcony had a fantastic view. There are 2 or 3 pools on the property. One has a water slide and is popular with kids. The \"adult\" pools consist of an infinity pool (where we spent most of our time while not out sightseeing) and a regular pool. At the most, there might have been 40 people (total) around both pools. Not overcrowded or noisy or busy. Nothing lush or fancy like some of the hotels in Kanapali, but it suited our needs just fine. There is no beach in front of the hotel, just rocks, but there is a nice beach that the guests of this property can use right next door. We rented snorkel equipment from the guy by the pool, and drove to a few other beaches in Makena and Wailea for some excellent snorkeling. This hotel is not as \"busy\" as some of the other hotels which are popular with honeymooners. We visited some of the other hotels to see where we could've stayed, and it confirmed we made the right choice.

The staff greated us nicely. Parking is $10 for Valet - $7 for self, I chose the Valet option. They checked us in, since my wife had some emails to send the next day, we opted for the $15/day fee to get the HighSpeed access and the free appitizers. Did not know about the open wireless network, will use that next time. We did not use all the other items as we bring our own snorkel gear and skipped the hotel show. They brought our bags to us, and gave us a bottle of Champaign. Nice standard Marriott room. Clean bath and linens. The sink area was nice, and an empty refrigerator to use to store snacks.

They're OK, but if you're used to some of the ritzier resorts at Kaanapali, well, this is just one cut below. Also, and this is CRUCIAL, there is a condo construction suite on the property just south of the Marriott. If you have a room anywhere near that part of the hotel, or even facing it, the view will be ugly and the noise unbearable. We had to move from the first room and taking a smoking room (fortunately, not too bad an odor) to get away from the construction. But I'm a Marriott platinum member; other folks might not be so accommodated. Ask for a room far, far away from the condo construction site.

To this end the Wailea Marriot excelled. When we arrived we were greeted by a bell person who unloaded our car and we were given the option of Valet or self park. When I asked they explained that I could do either at anytime. Check-in was quick and I was told that we had received a room upgrade to an ocean front room in the Hale Six building. The person checking us in explained that our room had been cleaned, but not verified, and we would have to wait while they sent someone to do that. We were there before the posted check-in time so this was not an issue with us but they were very appologetic for our delay. Ten minutes later our bell person was giving us a guided tour of the property on the way to our room from the oversized golf cart. He also provided good information on getting around the building in the rain. The room was spacious, clean, well appointed and everything worked as it should. The grounds were well maintained. The property is spread out over twenty+ acres and the buildings are built low so you don't have to wait for elevators or fight crowds. Very well designed layout with chairs and lounges distrbuted throughout the property for sun bating or Whale watching. There are shops, a fitness center and a spa on site for those who want them. There is shopping adjacent to the resort. The only dining we did at the Wailea Marriot was at the breakfast buffet in the Hula Moons restaurant.

The buildings are low (3-4 stories comparied with the huge hotels nearby). While it isn't as luxurious as the Grand Wailea, we liked how the staff were very laid back and the resort was unpretentious. The one great thing about the Wailea Marriott is that the rooms are RIGHT by the ocean, whereas all the other hotels (Grand Wailea, Renaissance etc) are situated much further from the coast (the zoning bylaws changed after it was built), so you can actually hear the waves from your room. Staying in Wailea was also much better than in Lahaina/Kaanapali in my opinion. Much quieter and more laid back with a lot more privacy on the beaches. Also better snorkeling overall in the southern area. The Wailea Marriott will be undergoing a major renovation in 2005 and will be re-branded a JW Marriott (similar to the one on Oahu). This will bring the resort up to par with the other Wailea hotels. That will be a mixed blessing as we were very happy with the resort as it is now, and prices will be sure to increase.

The carpet is dirty and worn and the furniture is quite old and worn too. Found that out after wearing white socks in the room. The bed itself was nice and comfy. This resort is very close to Shops at Wailea, basically within walking distance which is a real bonus. The hotel staff was very nice and accomodating. Parking used to be free at this hotel but changed to pay parking in October of 2004. Pools are somewhat small but never seemed crowded for some reason, even thought the hotel was totally full due to the Nissan Xterra World Championship being held during our stay. Pool furniture was dirty especially the small tables and chaise lounges. I would rate this hotel a 3.5 out of 5 for the fact that the room is in dire need of updating. I would say if you can get a rate of less than $200.00 per night I would recommend this resort. FYI This property is going to become a JW Marriott so renovations are definitely going to happen here in the near future which this hotel badly needs.

The parking is free, upgrades are free, if available, buffet breakfast was great. It saved us money. Go to Foodland in Kiehi and get groceries to stock your fridge with for lunches. That saves alot of money too. Ask them at foodland for a discount card. They will give you a temporary one so u can get the sale prices. The hotel is undergoing another renovation this fall and by next summer this place will be extra fabulous I'm sure. The views are breathtaking. Ask for a room on a high floor and you cannot go wrong. Dinner at the hotel restaurants during sunset were the best. I cannot say enough about this hotel. Its beautiful, and its staff is great. We hope to return for our 1 year anniversary. Please don't let the other little negative comments left in these reviews shy you away from this great resort. It is worth every penny and then some. Hope you all enjoy your fabulous vaction at this hotel in Maui cause we sure did. We miss it so much and cannot wait to go back.

I had read all the Tripadvisor reviews before booking and it seemed like the most bang for the buck in Wailea. When all is said and done, I don't think I got that great a deal through expedia.com for air/hotel/car, but the Marriott experience was lovely. The grounds, as everyone has mentioned, are gorgeous. I requested an upgrade from the mountainview room I had booked and was told that the hotel was too full to accommodate the request, so I was bummed. However, when we awoke in the morning we were stunned to discover that, indeed, we had been given an oceanview room, and a lovely one at that! That immediately put me in a good mood. The kids loved the pools and the beaches. I would second the complaint about no shade around the pools. I can't understand why they wouldn't plan that better. The sun was brutal and there was really no escape at the pools. The other thing I found odd was that none of the beaches and none of the resorts had lifeguards. Our package came with the breakfast buffet at Hula Moons, which was a fine thing until my 5 year old son said, \"Why do we have to go to the same place every day?\" It did get a little old. The luau was horrible, as I expected it would be, but I suppose it's something you gotta do once. My kids were fairly traumatized by the sight of the dead pig, but enjoyed the dancers and the fire guy. The luau food was as appallingly bad as I had been prepared for. The pina coladas were good, however. I was a little jealous of those staying at the Grand Wailea, the Four Seasons and the Fairmont as we strolled the oceanfront walk, but on the whole we had no complaints about the Marriott.

I bid the category of \"Resort\", which the Marriott is not deserving of. It's hard not to have a pretty location in Maui, so the grounds were up to par. There is no beach immediately at the hotel but there are swimming beaches on both sides of the resort. Fairly good snorkeling at Elua Beach just to the right of the hotel's waterfront, although the sand kicking up made the water a bit cloudy. The bed was springy, pillows too fluffy, A/C did not dehumidify the air so it still felt hot even though it wasn't. Overall, the room was clean, spacious, and furniture was decent though not \"resort\" quality. It's what I'd expect at a Courtyard by Marriott, not a resort. Bathroom had a fridge and decent sized counter/sink area separate from the toilet/shower. Cable TV was about 25 channels, had all the basics you'd expect. Pool area was OK - although absolutely NO shaded areas to enjoy the fresh air and scenery without a sunburn. Pools were very small for the number of guests staying at the resort. Parking was FREE, which was a welcome treat. Local calls were $1 and food at hotel restaurants quite pricy, but we bought beer/water/snacks/sushi/cokes/bread/etc at the grocery store and utilized the local Quiznos and Maui Tacos down the road for cheaper alternatives. I think Hawaii is overpriced in general, but given the going rate, I was satisfied with my stay for the priceline bid of $155 a night. (I would be upset if I had paid the $290/night they wanted on marriott.com.) This doesn't mean I'd go back though - now that I've been, I'd rather spend my money going to an island in the Mediterranean or Caribbean over Hawaii. Bottom line - if you can get a good deal, it's decent and clean. If you expect a resort, stay somewhere else. I visited the Hyatt at Kaanapali - now that's a resort.

Our stay started out on an up note and didn't stop. We were upgraded from a ocean view room to a ocean front room, at no charge. Ocean front it was, as we were 30 feet from the lava rock shore/water, with a view of Lana'i, Molokini and the volcano. The sand beach was about 100 feet away and was one of the best beaches on Maui. We received a complimentary bottle of champagne, a canvas tote bag and coupon for 2 free Tee-shirts (no purchase necessary). Everything about the Wailea-Marriott was top class. The buffet breakfast was great along with the view. The shops were the best known everywhere and was a very short walk from the hotel. The hotel-services booked our anniversary dinner at our requested restaurant, the Sea Watch Rest. and gave us each a complimentary dessert.

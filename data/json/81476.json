This place was certainly no luxury hotel however it was clean and at such an awesome price. It is located just a few blocks from the most crooked street in America and a short walk to Fisherman's Warf. The parking here was free. I would for sure stay here again on my next visit to SF, what more could you ask for but a clean room with free parking, in walking distance to many hot spots and at such a great deal.", "Date": "Mar 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR118919748", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "shawna_wms"}, {"Content": "NOT RECOMMENDED for familes with young children From the first phone call to the property we knew our stay wouldn't be all that great. The person answering didn't sound too friendly; he was gruff, short, and didn't seem to want to talk.We stayed for two nights in room 101: two double beds with a sofa bed. It was on the second floor, above the office, right next to the street. Definitely not a room for light sleepers; expect street noise during early morning rush hour and sunlight filtering through the shutters.The walls are paper thin and floors are, too. Not 30 minutes after we settled into our room we received a call from downstairs to not run across the room, something our two kids (5  4) love to do at hotels. We've NEVER received a complaint before and we've stayed in MANY hotels. We could also hear people talking  watching TV next door. And on the morning of our check-out we heard pounding/knocking on the floor, presumeably from the office (no calls this time). Apparently, our infant was being a baby and our children were being kids, either laughing/crying too loudly and/or walking on the floor too hard, if that's possible. The floor creaks in spots even if you walk carefully across!The room itself was shabby with outdated furniture. The beds were fairly comfortable, although the blankets needed changing because of holes. Our kids slept in the sofa bed, which my son thought was broken because it was sinking in the middle and didn't look too comfortable. The carpet was dirty, as testified by my clean white socks. Although we asked for a non-smoking room, I could smell the lingering, musty odor of cigarette smoke. Not good for sensitive people. Also, the bath towels were small, thin, and some were fraying.On the plus side: minimal continental breakfast is included and the room came with a TV, 'fridge, and microwave (which wasn't plugged in and we didn't use). However, there was no temp control in the 'fridge. And since foraging ants were noticed in the bathroom, eating in the room can be risky. Some renovations to the room were noticed: plantation shutters, shower door, bedding, throw pillows.Other than that, the location is great if you're not afraid to walk steep hills or take public transportation. Parking is FREE (a $20/day savings), but spaces are compact and the driveway is one-way with one entrance/exit.Final thought: you get what you pay for. Wished we would've paid more for better customer service and accommodations. We will NOT be coming back to the Town House again.", "Date": "Nov 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR313086597", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "RubyAn"}, {"Content": "Great Location, Great rate, Clean room Very good value for the money. I stayed at this motel for 3 nights. Having lived in San Fran for 7 years in the past, I knew what I was looking for. This Motel while modest in amenities provides great value and location for your money. Included in the price are parking and free wireless internet access.The rooms were small but clean and functional, with iron and ironing board, cable TV and a small fridge.You are within walking distance of the Marina, Ft.

A 15 minute bus ride from Civic Center BART station (airport connection) and CalTrain station which services towns south of San Francisco to San Jose.

It was clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. In fact, on a 6-night trip to the CA, this was the most comfy bed of them all. The sides of the window coverings (wooden folding blinds) did not completely block out the light, but that did not bother us- we only noticed after we woke up before daylight (having just arrived from the Eastern Time Zone).We were in a room set back from the road, so traffic noise was not a problem either (plus it was a Monday night).This place is not within walking distance of downtown SanFran, but it has a FREE parking lot on the premises, something we later came to appreciate.We did not have trouble with the management, as someone mentioned here earlier, but the person on duty was certainly less than friendly.

Very reasonable rates but the extras we got were above and beyond more expensive hotels. FREE PARKING! At least a $20 per day savings and nice free muffin breakfast. The room was cozy and clean, small bathroom w/ shower but were very happy to have own bathroom at the price we paid. Good location. Can get a little noisy. So pick room in back or off street. Would recommend if you are on a budget and have a car- tight parking in lot use your small car not an SUV. Great Coffe cafe right down the block on corner. Safe area. Bus nearby.

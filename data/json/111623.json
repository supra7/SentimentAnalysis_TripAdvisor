I would like you to know that you have a valuable team member in Lassandra. She is very friendly and welcoming and can prepare a wonderful breakfast quickly. On the morning of 03/15/2012 she had an exceptionally busy morning - with a large group of hungry contractors waiting for her as she opened her station. She didn't miss a beat and served all with a smile ! I went down to breakfast later than usual because of the morning rush - and even after rush - she remained kind and welcoming. She is a wonderful asset to the Embassy Suites family. I travel for my job and visit Indianapolis once or twice a month.

Well, as it goes in the IT world I was stuck on a conference call in the room and made it downstairs just minutes after closing. The screen was down and the kitchen already appeared to be cleaned. (BTW it's kept clean even when it is open and serving). This was the third day of my stay so I guess the Chef remembered me. I'd like to think I was getting special treatment because she appeared from nowhere as she saw me shuffling around looking for fruit or whatever I could find. I heard a voice say \"have you had anything to eat\"? or something to that effect. It sounded so kind, sincere and nurturing to me. I was taken aback because as you know with most places when they\u2019re close they\u2019re close.

The hotel is very nice, the rooms are roomy and clean. The managers reception and breakfast are both free and wonderful. But we won't be going back anytime soon because it is chaos in the hallways and trying to get an elevator is trying. There was several groups of kids ranging from small to teenagers for some sports gatherings I imagine, and they were completely unsupervised and ran the hallways, from floor to floor, and played in the elevators at any given time of the day. I understand that the parents (or coaches) are the first to blame for not properly parenting or supervising these children, but the hotel has a responsibility to also supervise their facility and unruly guests asked to behave or leave, for the peace and safety of other guests staying there. While eating our breakfast the teens were several floors up throwing candy on top of the diners and when we complained directly to a staff member, he just laughed and did nothing. Its a shame that such a nice hotel with great ammenities loses a guest, but this has happened. I would suggest another hotel unless you can stand the chaos, noise, long waits for the elevators, nearly being knocked down by running kids, and frustration.

The first stay wasn't so bad. I requested extra towels and they were delivered to my room upon arrival, which was nice, because I have stayed in a few Hilton brand hotels and have not received my special requests. The breakfast was pretty good for a buffet style complementary breakfast. The eggs were cooked well and the food was hot/fresh. Before my second night, which was this past weekend, I used e-check in to secure my reservation. I had been given a room on the 8th floor, which is what I'd hoped. I finally arrived at the hotel around 5 pm after a long day of running around Indianapolis and was given a room on the 5th floor, no big deal, I understand that the room isn't guaranteed. However, when I walked into the room and into the bedroom area to put my suitcase on the bed I saw something dark on the bedding. I walked closer and I'm not certain, but I believe that someone had used the bedding as a tissue and wiped his/her nose on it. It was a large spot and it made me sick. I grabbed a washcloth with warm water and cleaned the bedding, went back to the sink at the bedroom vanity area and noticed hairs along the top of the sink basin. My family wanted some food, so I went across the street to get some barbeque carry out. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member and I don't typically complain about anything. I am used to finding a stray hair or two in a hotel bathroom or a carpet stain that makes me a little queasy, but this was the first time I'd found anything so revolting. I stopped by the front desk to explain and was offered dinner or something to make up for it, which was nice. I explained that I was going across the street to a place my family had requested and that was ok. She told me to think about it and to let her know what they could do, a movie, something. I agreed and went to get our food. As I sat waiting for the carry out, I really thought about this. After seeing the bedding, I sure didn't want to eat dinner there, I didn't want a movie, I just wanted a clean room. They must have been sold out, because I wasn't offered a clean room. I was offered clean bedding. This really made me question how clean the room was and I had a hard time resting that night, in fact, I didn't rest. I did take them up on the movie offer and it actually appeared on my bill and I had to ask to have it removed. Anyway, I took the movie because I felt that I should go ahead and get something, but what I really wanted was to rest assured in a clean room.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, Indiana, United States", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jason J", "ReviewID": "UR119051408", "Content": "Lassandra is one of the cooks there and that woman has a gift.

I rated cleanliness lower because we found a previous guests deodorant on a chair, as well as a previous guests shoe peeking from under the bed. It appears housekeeping isn't observant when cleaning up... But the tables in the room were clean, the bathroom was clean and we knew they vacuumed, because the kids made a mess of chips on the floor... On our last trip here, the pool was absolutely freezing-so cold we couldn't use it... This trip, it was cool-but not so cold we couldn't make use of it-and the kids enjoyed it. The pool area is also another place that needs some renovating (and if they could heat the pool (and I thought this place was supposed to have a heated pool) instead of relying on the sun, that would be even better).

This hotel was not as great as posted in this site. We have stayed at many Embassy suites in the past and were very disappointed with this hotel. We requested a low floor prior to check in and when we verified this hotel on out way down, we were told the only rooms were the third floor and up. The entire 2nd floor was being cleaned (or so we thought). We checked into our room and I wanted one with a balcony that opened outside. The hotel cooperated and granted us that wish. However, the wish would put us up one floor. We gave it thought and said yes. We checked in and went out to eat. Upon our return, we turned on the lights in our room and were horrified at the stains on the couch, bugs behind the microwave and a big dent in the door. I was very apprehensive about sleeping in this room so we asked to be moved. There were no other rooms available since they were full the night before. They only cleaned a small amount of rooms so we really had to either stay in this room or continue looking for another room or even another location. Sharon called the Homestead Inn down the street since they too were Hiltons, but their rates were quite high. So we went and again to move to another room. (This was 4 times now and 2 were my choices and 2 were due to the unclean rooms that we were put in at first. Monday afternoon we went into the pool. That was another misfortune as the pool had some like foam or fiberglass at the bottom. When I went up the stairs, I grabbed the railing and it came right out of the cement. It was very broken and I cannot believe it was missed. I was furious at all the issues and requested to speak to a manager. He came into the pool and we pointed out all the issues and all the other problems experienced by us at this facility. The manager offered to pay for a night stay for us but really offered no apology only that the hotel was booked solid over the weekend by a team of soccer players ( I am not sure what this has to do with all our issues, but that was his answer). We decided to leave and find another hotel on Tuesday and when we checked out, the free night was on our bill but NOT ONE INDIVIDUAL expressed any apology for all the issues we dealt with at this hotel. I am not sure why we were not worth their time but I found this to be very disturbing by a huge hotel chain as this one. The ONLY good point about this hotel was the breakfast bar and the wonderful cook Lassandra. She was the sunshine on a rainy day and she cooked ALL of our breakfast to meet our every need. She was very happy and I could tell she loved her job very much. I think she was one of the assets of this hotel and I hope she receives recognition. Another person who made our stay comfortable was Rhonda who cleared our table and we talked a great deal with her. She is one very proud mom to her kids. The third individual who made the stay worthwhile was the bird Sweetie. She was very sweet and we enjoyed seeing her when we went down the reception area.

We had dinner reservations in Indy that night, so I searched for a romantic, unique hotel for literally three weeks. I did not want to be disappointed on our wedding night and I wanted to escape from the midwest as much as possible until our real honeymoon. From the moment we arrived, I knew I made the right choice. The facade could have been in several foreign locales - the lobby was beautiful - the tropical atrium was perfect! The staff was super friendly and congratulatory and the reservation was without any errors. I reserved the Romance Package. The suite has french doors in from the atrium, then beautiful modern/traditional decor in a living area; complete with sleeper sofa, wet bar, table, and tv. The bathroom is in the hallway - it is small but just fine with granite (?) vanity and a nice shower. There is another door there, then a beautiful sleeping area with another vanity and tv, and french doors out to a wrought iron balcony -- our view was of a pond - I'm certain the best view they could have given us. We even saw a large snapping turtle in it and a heron the next morning - with a bird's nest near our balcony and dutiful mother swinging in every now and then. The Romance Package was delightful - the champagne was delicious and we were given a gift basket and card - it was perfect for us. The only disappointment of the whole stay was that the heater in the pool was being repaired and it was brisk - but it was still a lovely variating depth pool beside a large whirlpool - if you sat in the hot tub long enough it made the pool water bearable. :) It wasn't bad enough to ruin our stay. Breakfast the next morning was plentiful and tasty - sitting in the atrium felt like we were thousands of miles away. We also befriended their Macaw, Sweetie, who is quite the ham and gave us plenty of sugary pictures. We had a GREAT time and I was SO relieved. Oh - and I thought the bed was perfect - but I like firm - and he did not - he likes soft. The down pillows are fabulous. If you want to escape from the ordinary, stay at the Embassy Suites in Indy.

Two downfalls: they do offer a lovely hot buffet breakfast - complete with omelette station. My husband ordered an omelette and could not eat it due to the fake oil/grease they use to 'butter' the pan. Yuck!

The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable; bathroom was clean; shower water pressure is strong. I like how you can open a french door to a small exterior balcony. It was very warm the day I stayed, and it was very nice to be able to open the door and enjoy the balmy breezes blow into the room. For a moment it didn't feel as if I were in Indianapolis. Granted, the view from my third floor suite was nothing special and brought things back to reality. Access to I-465 or 86th Street is very easy. I did not avail myself to the other amenities, including breakfast, on the property.

We chose to stay during the week after Easter. It appears that most renovations have been completed. In fact, there was no construction visible from the lobby or atrium. Our room contained two double beds and a sleeper sofa with a full door in between. It seemed to be generously sized (bigger than what I remember the Embassy Suites in downtown Indy being) Our room was very clean at check in, but missing all the pillows from both beds. A quick call to the front desk remedied that. The sleeper sofa was adequate for our 10 year old son, but looked to be uncomfortable for an adult. He was awoken each morning by people in the atrium moving tables around. Because we were on the second floor, we did not have an outdoor balcony. When we checked out our view, we noticed that window did not latch properly nor did it have a screen. We also noted that it was accessible from the side parking lot by a low roof. It did feel a little unsafe. Housekeeping Service was still not complete by 5:00 on day 2 of our stay, but again a call to the front desk fixed that. The free cocktails offered in the evenings from 5:30-7:30 had adequate chips/pretzels and dip as well as a great selection of drinks. The free breakfast in the morning was outstanding with made-to-order omelets and french toast available along with the traditional breakfast items (cereal, bacon, eggs, pancakes, donuts, waffles). The pool is very appealing to families. It is only 3.5 feet deep throughout. Deep enough to have a good time, but not so deep that you worry about the kids the whole time. The work out area was viewable from the pool. It looked to have 3 pieces of equipment in a very small glassed in room with a TV. Because we were there during Spring Break, there were many families. At times the pool area was crowded and the hallways noisy. By our second night the business crowd had arrived and things were much more relaxing. I would definitely stay here again. I would recommend this hotel for families - the breakfast can't be beat.

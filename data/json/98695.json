As far as the hotel goes, the rooms are recently renovated, but the rooms still look shabby. There was mold in my bathroom, for example. Also, the rooms were wallpapered with a dark cranberry color, making it hard to see. The bathroom was black, which was also impossible to see in. The front desk staff were helpful and courteous. As for the conference services, the staff was very attentive. The meals were presented on time and were delicious. The only complaint is that we couldn't get he temperature at a comfortable level. The hotel is close to Mockingbird Station, which is a quick 15 minute ride to the West End. There is also a shopping area nearby with stores and restaurants.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Big Lake, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPoor wifi...great rooms...got lost walking around...\u201d", "Author": "skidoo44", "ReviewID": "UR116910332", "Content": "CLC rate again, we paid 57 bucks.

Nothing wrong with the decor and the food was OK but...mid June in SW USA was more than a little hot this year and this hotel hasn't looked at its carbon footprint for many a year. The sun came up at 6.30am and within a short time, the sun reflected off the very large glass building opposite and threw copious radiation onto the windows. So hot that you could not touch them. Thus for most of the week or so there I lived in a darkened room with the curtains shut! They need to spray with anti-UV or something. On top of that, the air-conditioners were old and either did not cope or were so noisy as to make sleep impossible (I changed rooms at least twice trying to find one cool and silent enough. unfortunately even when one was found the air-con directed straight at the desk and so you chilled (but not in a nice way) trying to do work). To add yet more to the list, the 5 or 6-lane highway outside made most rooms on the road side impossible as noise went on through the night. IF I stay there again (and it is close to SMU) ear plugs should be supplied...", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cBad service, bad restaurant\u201d", "Author": "nosluap57", "ReviewID": "UR99266343", "Content": "Check in - Staff appeared disinterested. Initially only one clerk, who seemed more interested conducting a telephone conversation. As that call ended, he was joined by a second clerk, who while serving me, was interrupted by another call. Nothing more was said to me explaining details of my visit (breakfast, facilities, etc.) other than my room number. Unable to locate a luggage cart for use. Inquired at the desk, and was told they were all in use. Waited ten minutes then gave up. By chance later in the day I seen hotel staff locking them into a room near the front desk. Why do they hide them? Rooms - have outdated CRT televisions. Control unit for Sleep Number bed did not display settings. Room had an off smell to it. Hot water in sink nearly scalded my wife's hands. Restaurant - Items on buffet were almost all cold. No fresh fruit available, only processed and canned. No jelly for biscuits or toast. Overpriced for what you get. Checkout - waited in line for over 25 minutes. Several people ahead of me, but only one clerk behind the counter. Overall an unsatisfactory experience. I was visiting as part of a group which had booked the entire hotel. I would never choose to stay at this hotel if not for being part of that group.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cStaff is very friendly\u201d", "Author": "JTScout", "ReviewID": "UR10076895", "Content": "This Radisson is currently in the middle of a renovation. The tower appears to be near completion. The rooms in the tower are very comfortable and all have the sleep number bed. The wireless internet access is good in all of the rooms. The showers are not that good. The water pressure is low and the water tempurature does not go much past mildly warm. The best part of the stay will be the staff. They are very friendly and treat each guest with respect. The restuarant is okay and will suffice when you do not feel like going out to eat. One caution.

The room was well-designed, with thought given to everything from the bath to the kitchen and the bedroom area. The bed was very firm but easy to sleep on. A full-size fridge was a bonus for an overnight guest like myself. Noise off I-35E was not a factor inside the room. The A/C worked fine for early March; for mid-August, I think it might struggle, but I can't say that for sure. Definitely a bargain for my $30 bid via Priceline! The area doesn't have much to offer -- no restaurants or real shopping around, unless you go behind it a bit to Dallas' Design District for home decor and furnishings. As far as safety goes, I had no problems and saw nothing to raise any concerns. The room does have a full-size fridge, as well as a stove and a microwave. I'm not sure where the nearest grocery is, but you could certainly \"eat in\" and save some money. And like I said, I got the room for a $30 bid for a Friday night stay. Only real \"con\": Its exit off Commonwealth can be difficult to reach if you're coming down I-35E because of merging traffic right before that interchange -- you're in the right lane, then you're two lanes away all of a sudden. You might exit Inwood and promptly get lost!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWatch out!\u201d", "Author": "Jeffner115", "ReviewID": "UR121399698", "Content": "Here for 2 months.

I was not at all familiar with the Dallas area and just wanted to find an affordable place close By the time I realized that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the greatest place to be, I had already committed to the monthly rate, and was going to end up paying a whole lot more if I moved out. Make sure you know what you are getting into before you sign up to stay here for a long a period of time. The neighborhood is BAD, period. There are a couple of office buildings and warehouses around, but otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mostly your friendly neighborhood liquor and adult stores all around. The parking lot is poorly lit and feels very unsafe at night. After my first week, my car got broken into and I lost my stereo and some other stuff. One of the staff persons said that it happens on a fairly regular basis. The reason I picked the hotel was for convenience because it was close to downtown, and it was convenient to get to work for the most part. However, if you are trying to get out during the peak hour, traffic coming into the medical center blocks out the feeder and makes it a hassle to get out. The closest grocery/shopping without having to worry about safety is a good five miles away. I used to drive over to the other side of downtown in the lemmon/knox-henderson area to do all my shopping. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too bad once you get used to it. There are plenty of good restaurants in the uptown area and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too far either. About the hotel itself, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s average at best. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to be renovated, but all the kitchen appliances are falling apart and the air conditioning is fairly old/loud. But the shower was good and the bed was comfortable and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I cared about most. The room was pretty spacious as well. The do have a DVD player that barely works, and cable TV sucks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very few channels and no comedy central or HBO. Instead you get Showtime which plays the same two shows/movies every night. As for internet access, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to pack that old modem because the wireless internet ($5/stay) is much slower than dialup. Several calls to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctech help\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 turned out to be frustrating and futile. There is a laser printer in the lobby, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real pain to use. Among other useful stuff, local/toll-free calls are free. There is a weird odor in the corridors but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me that much. There is a laundry room on the first floor and a small gym (mostly cardio stuff, no weights). The front desk sells detergent and provides change as well. There is a vending machine that has some basic stuff, coffee, snacks, etc. There is a small pool, not in great shape. There is also a small conference room that you can use if you need. I must say the staff is very friendly and helpful, although for the most part there is not much they can do. There is free breakfast on weekdays, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just plain bagels and some fruit. Housekeeping is once a week if you stay for more than a week, but I think that is pretty typical of extended stays. You can have it cleaned on other days for ten bucks or swap out towels at the front desk for no charge. I had a couple of packages shipped over, and the front desk will accept/hold it for you. Overall, not a bad place if you staying for a couple of nights and are not overly worried about safety, but I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stay at this place for too long. If you have to work in downtown, consider also places on 75N, near the Northwest freeway, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too far and I think is a much nicer neighborhood with a lot more stuff to do around.", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGood for the Price\u201d", "Author": "mshplover", "ReviewID": "UR6533946", "Content": "Visited Dallas over New Years and was able to get a room for $30 a night.

There really isn't places walking distance to go, but a short drive if you have a car. The rooms were large and comfortable, only had a problem with the shower draining but nothing major. If you plan on using a taxi you may have issues, it took about 45 minutes to get a taxi so be prepared for a headache but that has nothing to do with the hotel itself.

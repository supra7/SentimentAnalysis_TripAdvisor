I should now mention THE NOISE. All day long, trucks are backing up in the street behind the hotel and they must be large trucks because they have constant back-up beeping noises that sounds like you are spending the day in a CostCo warehouse. What was all that clanking in the back alley ALL NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT? Apparently the restaurant is emptying out trash and bottles every hour on the hour. And the restaurant employees were smoking, talking and just being incredibly noisy all night in the alley. The new room decor is OK, although already a bit outdated. The hotel staff is super friendly-but watch out for the AWFUL RESTAURANT STAFF who are mainly just nasty and snippy. The hostess could not have been more unprofessional and rude. Never going back.

The magnificent setting - the pool, pond, gardens, and swans remain untouched - provide an oasis of calm with LA just outside your door. I had booked a five day stay through WhataHotel, which came with the added bonus of a continental breakfast, although no room upgrade was offered.The newly styled interiors are superb, with beautiful and thoughtful design features providing elegant, modern luxury. The rooms are very well finished with heated floors in the bathrooms (although surprisingly not in the loo), B&O TV's, La Prairie soaps,superb linens and fluffy robes. Although some die-hards may prefer the old club style bar, it too is now lighter and far less stuffy. The ballroom would make a wonderful spot for any celebration. There's a new spa and gym, both state of the art; although the gym could offer several sizes of Swiss ball, and also make sure there are plenty of clean headsets! The staff were apparently all replaced (except 11) after the two year shutdown; the new waitstaff, bellboys, and cleaners are all wonderful, where you're really made to feel extremely welcome. A small niggle - some of the day to day restaurant managers could be more client focussed; on several occasions it took far too long to get seated for breakfast or dinner. Wolfgang Puck's restaurant is still settling in; the food is competent, although a little more innovative menu will be required if the restaurant is to receive many star accolades. At the prices charged for dinner there were surprisingly no ameuses bouches on starting dinner, or extras around dessert. There's a great wine list, if you have a reason to celebrate, with knowledgeable sommeliers. The house white, a Gruner Veltliner, offers the best value. All in all, this is a unique hotel, with a great provenance, now brought in to the 21st century.

In one sense it is without rival the best hotel in Los Angeles. Let me explain. If arriving after dark you cannot beat the twinkling lights over the water as you cross the bridge to the lobby. Self check in is possible on the i-pads in the rooms but I was processed the traditional way by cheerful staff. My room was a delightful ground floor with a large sunny patio reached by a longish walk past the lozenge shaped pool and several playing fountains. I was totally satisfied with the room including the new technology. Very impressive was the log fire with a pile of logs in the room so you could light it yourself and enjoy the ambiance it leant. However this hotel is QUIET. Monastery quiet. I felt I had the place to myself with a large staff. Rather like I was in a grand hacienda alone searching in vain for my host who never appeared. It wasn't unpleasant, just unusual. Come the weekend the inevitable wedding appeared. White seats by the pool outside and a ravishing bride swishing around the property all afternoon. I was rather glad to see other people there by this stage. The dining situation is a little too upscale for my tastes. that is to say food is gorgeous but very expensive. A casual cobb salad by the pool for lunch seems unattainable but this is not a criticism just an observation. I used the fitness room which was very well laid out if small, and the spa too was attractive. Zero points for the hair salon though which appeared to be smaller than my own wardrobe, claustrophobic and with no natural light. Just one girl working there made for a very dull appointment. I wont be going back there for my blow drys. I never got to grips with when the bar was busy during my 6 day stay - I'm sure it's very nice but wasn't appealing to me at the times I went there in the early evening. Transportation is slow. One house car is available but given the distance to Rodeo it naturally takes longer than more central hotels to get back. They should have two really but it's a small price to pay to stay at this divine place. Waiting for a taxi when called can take 15 minutes so extra time must be allotted when going anywhere. It's best to have a lover if you stay at this hotel as romance oozes from every corner. Honeymooners should beat a path to its door as should A-listers who like reclusivity. I was in none of these categories but nevertheless counted myself one of the luckiest people in the world to get to spend a week in this haven.

After being closed for more than two years for upgrading there should be major changes and there are. Building exteriors and the wonderful gardens are either untouched or faithfully restored. The swans are still there. Inside everything is new. The lobby, restaurant and bar are in the same locations, but have no resemblance to their former versions. The quality is very high and pleasantly appealing. Rooms have been completely redone and are very modern. Baths are large and swank. All furnishings are new. My first impression was good. But as my stay continued I found that function and comfort had not been given the same attention as appearance. The rooms lack comfortable seating and a good light for reading. Some things just don't work. For example, it was not possible to open the door to the toilet compartment without moving or rolling up the bathroom rug. It was not possible to place the bathmat in front of the shower door because opening the door swept it aside. Counter space in the bath was a bit skimpy. Lights can not be individually controlled--switches control groups of lights or lamps with settings of on/off, low or high. The shower has a choice of a rain shower that drenches the entire enclosure or a hand-held shower head. I could not use the shower head in place on the wall, because it sprayed on the door and I could not adjust its height--it was mounted too high and I was unable to lower it. The phone contains a control panel for the room, including the thermostat, that takes a bit of time to learn to use effectively. Valet parking costs $38.50 per day. Internet access costs $15 per day. Valet service was excellent. The wall-mounted TV is about 3 feet square, but only the upper half contains the screen which is equivalent to about a 37-inch TV. The TV controls are complex. The staff was uniformly polite, welcoming and well trained. The restaurant, now operated by Wolfgang Puck, is outstanding. Rooms were clean and quiet. There is a new added section of rooms that blends in well and looks the same as older sections. Of course, the great location in a residential section of Bel-Air, just off Sunset Boulevard is the same. There is a large new spa, but I did not visit it. In summary, I enjoyed my stay and probably will return.

The Good News The service is perfection, like nothing I have ever seen, training at its best. They make it so easy and exceeded my expectations. Luckily they did not mess with the grounds during the renovations because they are still a jewel, but parts are a little run down. The Bad News The Decor - Whoever designed the interior of the lobby clearly designed this in a vacuum in London and I would guess never even saw the property. The grounds of the property are warm, quaint and special. The cold black and white styling is objectively the wrong fit for this space. The interior should be like an urban San Ysdrro Ranch with warmth. Sadly all the soft goods need to be redone at once, maybe they should call Ty Warner. The interior is so cold, depressing and out of place it almost ruins the entire resort. Our Room and Technology - We had a regular room with Patio, the Patio was much larger than our room. The finish out was superb, the only problem was our room was way to small for the size of the furniture. It is rare that I would advocate more room for lower finish out cost but larger, but these rooms are just too small, maybe they should in close the worthless patios. Technology can be a game changer when it is done perfectly like Apple has shown. I think Microsoft consulted on their technology because it is really bad. The Ipad program crashes 10 times in a row before it works properly each time you use it. The lighting system is delayed and will drive you nuts. The wort part is the bang and olsen remote, it is really confusing and is not intuitive at all, these tv's need to be replaced asap. The pay per view movie system is hard to use because of the remote and the selection of movies is very limited.

While our stay was enjoyable, we didn't love the experience or facilities as much as we'd hoped. The new decor is nice, but in many cases very at odds with the exterior which seemed completely unchanged. Some will find that last point a relief, but I myself would like to see a modernization of the pink stucco (I know I'm probably alone in that view) - to me it just looks old, dated and very tired. The interiors are now black & white and largely modern, in stark contrast - it's a bit odd, especially around the restaurant patio where all the different motifs come into play. But I was thrilled to see the swans are still there and very happy! The new pool is lovely, but the gym is way too small for a hotel of that caliber (with that much space!). I was extremely disappointed. Our suite was nice and quite large with wonderful beds and bathrooms. The big negative was that everything is controlled by touchpads that were VERY glitchy - trying to turn off one light vs. another was an exercise in frustration. The hotel staff are very focused on being friendly and attentive, but could use some work in efficiency. A perfect example was check-in. We were asked dozens of questions about what we wanted in our room from newspapers to pillows to mattress type (huh?) - the process was borderline annoying it took so long. And then it seemed as if the questionaire was ignored - none of our answers were implemented. None of the missed items were a big deal at all, but let's please not spend 10 minutes talking about things if you're not going to bring them. A lot of staff are new and seem a little confused, to be honest. All are trying VERY hard and have great attitudes, but some things were just a bit off. One person called us at 8:15am to ask if we liked the room - ? We were well awake so no biggie, but it's a little early for a \"how are you doing?\" call - and our privacy light was on too. Odd. We found the food to be very good though overpriced and VERY slow in arriving - we'd be alone at breakfast and simple items would take strangely long amounts of time to arrive. The servers were wonderful though. So all and all, a mixed bag. We certainly won't be racing back. In most catagories the Montage Beverly Hills is much better.

Every aspect of our room (a.c., lighting, messaging etc.) was controlled by touch screen and I Pad, and we experienced significant problems in adjusting the room temperature,adjusting the lighting, deleting messages etc. , all apparently due to programming errors (although we are not 30-something techno-philes).

It appears the design team dropped in from NY to deem the heart, or core, of the Hotel \"old school\". After all, management delegated restaurant and room service duties to Wolfgang Puck. This is probably seen as an uptick for future bookings. The hugely transformed terrace/ restaurant (and lobby) has gone from relaxed CA garden elegance to sleek urban trendy. A lot of black elements are in jarring contrast to the charming California mission style architecture. The design feels over wrought and out of context, especially at day time. Flame towers, really? While the food is very good, it follows the Puck tradition of overpriced and under portioned. The restaurant service is amateurish. Unfortunately, the Terrace now features a generic computer podium check-in w/ \"hi guys\" hostesses. I'm guessing the highly seasoned restaurant staff of yesteryear found employment elsewhere. Room service staff was highly competent, yet the very pricey food seemed under portioned. Surely nostalgia has influenced my assessment, though I tried not to be crumudgeony about the changes. I guess sometimes a place is so very special, its memory so visceral, that there's no going back.

Lucky enough to travel a lot in the best places, Hotel Bel-Air is one of the few places my partner and I are longing for. We love LA, and would go to LA just to vacation at Hotel Bel-Air. It is almost what we do, and we are French. Few places are as 'right' as this one. I could not share more the previous reviewer's point, that there are only a handful of places like this one in the world. She can feel free to share the others with me. Over the years and stays, we have experienced a dozen rooms, up to the Grand Deluxe category. They all bear heavy family resemblance, but they are all different. They all have dated bathrooms. And then, so what ? Everything in and within the room make it up for that patios are SO private and exquisite and ... The service is first of the league. Nothing is too small or too big. Always handled with smiles and care. All, from the valets to concierges, from the reservation (Maria) to bellman (Roger), from check-in (Ronnie) to pool attendants, they go over the top to make your stay memorable. And, boy, it is. Not a hint of lacking motivation, despite the situation. Thumbs up. So the owner has decided to, I quote, make a sizeable investment in the property. I wonder why, but hell, I am no Sultan of Brunei by any mean. But I, together with many worried guests, have been staing there, and come to love a home away from home. I am not sure he ever set foot on the damn property. I am sure the property will be upgraded. Besides being possibly improved, I just hope it will not be destroyed; all things that make it so pleasant : architecture, atmosphere, ambience, fireplace, vegetation, tiles, patios, ... This may sound a little dramatic. Talking to fellow guests, I realized I was only a newcomer to the place. Some guests have been staying once a month for 15 years. Some Angelino people were staying there, only because they know it was closing down. This place means a lot to ots customers. We will be back.

A lot has been said here comparing the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Bel-Air. To my mind, if you are more interested in where you are seen to be staying, and who you see while you are there, then visit the Beverly Hills. If, however, you want to experience the best possible service in a discrete, luxury location then stay at the Bel-Air. The setting of the Bel-Air is truly exquisite - it is almost akin to staying on a luxury island. The grounds are wonderful; filled with glorious gardens and the even the occasional humming bird. The hotel is far enough from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles to be truly tranquil yet the courtesy car can have you on Rodeo Drive within ten minutes. Our suites were spacious, well appointed and the linens provided were of the highest standard. Of the two the Garden Suite, though cheaper, was my preferred room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its location, adjacent to the restaurant, was ideal and its layout slightly preferable to that of the Spa Suite. The Jacuzzi in the Spa Suite was a delightful addition but the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location, the other side of the service entrance, was far enough from the main entrance to be a mild irritation. The service, from parking valets through to pool attendants, restaurant staff and housekeeping was exceptional. Perhaps the staffing highlight of the trip was the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driver, Steve, who was not only incredibly helpful but also highly intelligent and articulate and able to offer an unexpected insight into life in Los Angeles and wider California. The only flaw in what is otherwise a perfect hotel is the food. It is of a very high standard but does not quite hit the culinary heights one might find in an equivalent European hotel (Claridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or the Berkeley for example). My advice to any European visitor used to fine dining is stay away from classic European dishes as you will be disappointed. Instead try dishes such as the delightful \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHuckleberry braised short rib\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMaine Lobster with Angel Hair Carbonara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.

Subsequently, at breakfast, the milk served with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOatmeal with Apples, Cinnamon and Honey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 had gone off. Both errors are inexcusable in any kitchen. To the credit of the staff they agreed on both occasions and replaced the food without hesitation. These errors aside the food was very good but not truly world class. The wine list is fantastic and includes an excellent selection of attractively priced Hirsch Vineyards Pinot Noir. For the best possible experience be sure to sit outside.

Since last year we stayed at the Beverley Hills Hotel we decided to try the Hotel Bel Air this time. While there are stellar reviews on this place, and it is often named as one of the top hotels in the US, I was less than impressed. I wish someone had told me the following details as it would have really helped me not to make such an expensive mistake as choosing the Bel Air: Extremely remote location, no lobby or central areas at all, it's all about the grounds, plants, flowers etc.. The non-suite rooms are located in a separate building out back, across a service road, facing either the main road (traffic-ish) or the dumpster area (no smells, just noise). We upgraded to the best possible non-suite room and that's where we were anyway. We did have a fireplace a super small patio area with a small table for two and two plastic outdoor chairs. If you want a fire, they ask you to call a bellman and we were beyond tipped out so did it ourselves. The room was nicely decorated, but quite small. The pool was nicer than the pictures on their website, but fill up fast on weekends as there are only about 25 of them. There is only one restaurant, and it is expensive. Our modest room service breakfasts (oatmeal, fruit, two eggs, coffee - for two - was $100 per day with their additional charges added on. The restaurant was good for dinner, but we took friends to the $65 brunch and it was the all time low point. Food had to go back twice (cold, then runny egg whites.). They actually removed one of the 4 brunches from the bill so only $200 for a bad brunch for 4. The entire staff, from start to finish, seemed edgy - but it could have been me. And really, nothing can compare to the thrill of the Beverley Hills Hotel for us. Think twice before staying here,spending this kind of money on a place we always wanted to drive away from really ruined our weekend.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Albans", "Title": "\u201cExcellent 5 star Experience\u201d", "Author": "JeroenR", "ReviewID": "UR17122499", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed in this great hotel/resort while we were touring the US.

From the moment you check in to the hotel and pass the swans in the pond, your senses are greeted with the beauty of the property and the smell of the colorful flowers that everywhere. Here are the specifics: The Service--This was the most outstanding feature of the hotel. Every employee was beyond generous and willing to extend themselves in every way possible. In fact, after we left my partner forgot a charger in the room. It was Fed-Exed to the next stop on our vacation, but did not arrive on time. The head of security at the Bel Air credited our account at the hotel to cover the Fed-Ex charge. He called promptly and did everything he could to resolve this slight mix-up. The Grounds--Terrific places for sitting and relaxing. Lots of little off-the-beaten path spots. I never felt crowded and I always felt secure in knowing that I could find a quiet location outside of my room. The Location--It is up Stone Canyon Road in Bel Air, so the hotel is not downtown and it does take a while to get places. However, to me, this was a plus. It allowed my partner and I to feel as though we were escaping into a hidden world tucked away from the vibe of the city. The Room--We had a standard room--room 105. While the room was not a suite, nor did it have its own patio or fireplace (many do), it felt spacious and it was very comfortable. Linens and towels are all top notch, as are the bath products. The rooms are also not overdone, which is always a pleasant surprise. The Pool--Very elegant and comfortable. Also, very quiet, which I adore. The Gym--It's small, remember the hotel only has about 90 rooms. Yet, it was never over-crowded and it had plenty of equipment. The Bar and Restaurant--Very tasty and the bar has a very old-world feeling. The service here was terrific. Concierge--I worked closely with a concierge named Mark who was a fund of information. Very helpful with directions and advice. Overall--I would not suggest this hotel for business travelers because it is away from the rest of the city and things like the Internet always seemed slow, but the setting and beauty of this place should be experienced by everyone at least once.

Unfortunately, this hotel did not live up to my expectations at all. I agree with others who have written that you need to \"look the part\" to get better service. I was on vacation with my family and looking for a chance to relax - therefore, I decided to dress more casually - although, still in a nice shirt/sweater and dressy jeans or khakis each day (with nicer clothes for evening wear). Despite this, I still had a general feeling of being looked down upon by the hotel staff and hotel \"regulars\". This is definately not a welcoming, family-like atmosphere - it seems that it would be better suited as a catwalk for you to show off your newest surgical improvement or designer clothing from Rodeo Drive. We went to the restaurant one evening and got exceptionally poor service because all we wanted were appetizers and drinks and did not order off the \"pricier\" main entree menu (We would have ordered off it had there been more choices and seating in the Pub - not everyone wants to eat Foie Gras or Rack of Lamb after being on an airplane all day). The rooms were nice but the lack of cleanliness was appalling. There was mildew on the bathtub, the tile floors throughout the suite were full of hair and dirt, and the bathroom wall had some sort of disgusting, brown splatter on it. Oh, and the \"Business Center\" was a joke. It was nothing more than a computer tucked into a small, hot closet that you needed to ask the front desk staff for permission to use. Not what I expected from a member of the Leading Hotels of the World. Don't get me wrong - Hotel Bel-Air is in a gorgeous setting and definately worth checking out. However, I would recommend simply stopping buy for a walk on the grounds rather than staying or eating here.

We arrived around noon and our room was not yet available, we were treated very cordially and we chose to enjoy lunch on the Terrace. This open air restaurant has the same menu as the dining room, but is an oasis of flowering plants and classic California design. The service was beyond compare without being smothering. The first room that we were shown, 135, was on a main walking area, although well laid out we were put off by the proximity to a walkway, in hindsight it would not have mattered as despite a high occupancy we barely ever saw another guest. We were quickly moved to room 115, a premium room with a nice patio with fountain. Not only does this hotel offer a quiet escape from the bustle of the city just a few blocks away, but it also soothes the soul in its gentle charm and the easy service that seems to flow naturally from the outstanding staff. We don't look like a-listers (although we are in our corner of the world!), but we felt that we received the star treatment throughout our stay. No request was too small (like pressing a jacket within 30 minutes of dinner) or town car service to the Getty Museum, discretion was beyond reproach (in fact, noone ever addressed my wife as \"Mrs.\", they only called her Madame and used my name - I guess in case she was someone other than my wife! I hadn't noticed but she certainly did. There were some stars and influential people staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant during our time there, but everyone received the same treatment - I can't repeat enough how special you feel being at the Hotel Bel Air - from the valet to the gardener, everyone is in on the star treatment. You notice it even more when you leave the little neighborhood of Bel Air and realize that you are just blocks from the 405 freeway. Don't ask how much it costs.

The location is hidden on 12 acres in Bel-Air and surrounded by lush tropical gardens that are expertly maintained. It really feels more like being in your own private villa in Hawaii than a hotel in LA. From the swans to the secret herb garden to the beautiful pool to all the hidden courtyards, it is a site without peer. Then there is the service; warm, personal, and clearly driven to exceed your expectations. The staff were always helpful without being servile - coming across as dedicated professionals who enjoyed their ability to deliver outstanding customer service. There was only one minor flaw in the service; the woman at the concierge desk had a slightly arrogant attitude - like one of those boutique sales people who become confused and start to think they own all the merchandise they are selling - but given that we only needed airport transportation and to mail a letter, it hardly impacted our stay. The room (153) was welcoming and personal, with carefully chosen furniture and art. We had a fruit plate, a box of exquisite chocolates, and a small cake waiting for us in the room when we arrived, as well as a note from the GM, which was a very nice touch. This is not meant to be a sleek modern antiseptic hotel room, so there is no swimming pool-sized tub carved from a single piece of obsidian, or curtains that open with a wink of your eye (although those are things that I do enjoy in that type of hotel) - this is a refuge designed to make you feel at ease. Everything from the lamps to the well polished wood floors to the beautiful curtains looks as though it had been individually chosen to make you feel as at-home as possible (and at-home in a mid-20th century mansion in Bel-Air to boot!). We had a beautiful patio surrounded by trees and tropical flowers, with 2 chaise lounges, a full dinning table and chairs where we had breakfast each morning, and a fountain. Probably one of the most pleasant surprises was that the Hotel does not nickel and dime you at all - everything from the bottles of water at your bedside to the WiFi access to the fruit, water and sunscreen at the pool is complimentary. I think most travelers today have become accustomed to being (over) charged for all of these items, plus a \"resort\" charge, so it was amazingly refreshing to not have to worry about these things at all. So, in closing, I would like to extend a very heartfelt thanks to all of the staff at the Hotel Bel-Air for making our stay so wonderful, and to say that we will definitely be back.

Driving up Stone Canyon Road one glimpses impressive mansions nestled behind huge manicured hedges. It is hard to believe when you enter the property that the overladen freeways and heavily built up suburbia of Los Angeles are only a short distance away. The low scale of the hotel nestled in the canyon provides a sense that you are in a tropical resort. Our stay was only one night, in January, yet we were lucky to enjoy sunny blue skies and balmy warm temperatures. We arrived at the hotel around noon and received a warm welcome from reception and immediate access to the room. The room was a deluxe guest room with a terrace and wood burning fireplace. Due to the warm temperature we unfortunately never lit the fire. The room was small, yet cosy, and newly refurbished. During the night we opened up the doors to the terrace and enjoyed the fresh air of the canyon and silence. The room was quite a distance from reception, however, we loved the walk past the beautifully manicured gardens, restaurants and pool area. There appeared to be only a handful of guests at the hotel compared with the many friendly staff bustling along the access ways. Due to the design of the hotel it may well have been full with the majority of the guests rarely leaving their suites. On both days we chose to have lunch by the pool rather than the busy outdoor restaurant. Again we almost had the whole area to ourselves not to mention a bevy of waiters keen to please.

We travel to Los Angeles about twice a year, and have always stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The location and grounds at the Hotel Bel-Air are stunning, but the service and room quality don't compare to that of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Our visit started off beautifully with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to the room (the trip was a special occasion) upon our arrival. We had a deluxe room with a patio. The room was quite small and not as luxurious as other similarly priced hotels. The mattress was also very uncomfortable. The first morning for breakfast we were seated on the patio, which is beautiful. We asked for the heat lamp to be turned on, and were told it didn't work and they would call engineering. No one ever updated us as to the progress, and after we asked 2 more times, we were told it wasn't working. After ordering, we waited about 45 minutes before our breakfast came. When it arrived, it was cold. We sent it back, and waited 30 additional minutes. At that point, it was almost lunchtime and we decided to leave. The hostess apologized profusely and said the hotel general manager would be in contact with us later that day. Indeed, the manager called and asked what he could do to rectify the problem we had experienced. When we returned later in the day, we had cookies and water in our room, a guaranteed late check out the next day, and a credit to use in the gift shop or restaurant. We were pleased with the way it was handled.

The staff are in the main outstanding, the grounds and general ambience are entrancing and food and drink choices and venues excellent. That's a lot that's very good. The not necessarily good, regardless of price, are the rooms. I've stayed twice about a year apart. Both times I've immediately requested a room change on arrival. Looking for upgrades? No, looking for a room where the bedroom doesn't adjoin a major walkway or other source of significant noise (there are very many of these rooms - see review posted September 30, 2005)and where the size of the room approximates the promotional literature and photos. If you pay twice as much for a room that features a fireplace and balcony don't expect that room to be also larger than a small standard room - it won't necessarily be. When discussing the fact that room size wasn't closely correlated with price the Bel-Air staff simply pleasantly agreed and worked with me to find an acceptable room. It's either a charming eccentricity or very much not depending on where they first put you. The hotel gives you a map with room numbers, if you plan on staying again keep the map. Like the lady who posted September 30 I'm now populating mine with crosses and ticks. A final little point that the management might attend to is the concierge service. They do the job, no doubt there, but there is a tension about them (there are a few different ones)that is at odds with the general relaxed warmth or simple professional reserve of the other staff. There is also the sense that any service, no matter how small, requires a tip. I didn't find that attitude from the other staff; perhaps they need to pay their concierge staff more - helpful not hungry is a better demeanour.

I had written a hard copy letter to the general manager's attention, but I never received a response. My first disappointment was that my room was in bad shape. It was old and in need of updating, and the heater was loud and did not work well. I spent my sleeping hours alternating between being too cold and entirely too warm. Each night before bed, I always eat ice cream. It's a dumb (and fattening) habit...but it's what I do! So I called room service to order some ice cream before bed and was told that the freezer was not working and therefore no ice cream could be delivered. Another disappiontment, but not a big deal in the whole scope of life. The *biggest* disappointment was my check-out experience: I had agreed to meet an old friend for Sunday morning brunch in Malibu at 9:00 a.m. I figured that I would go to Malibu; meet my friend; then drive back to Hotel Bel Air and check out before catching my return flight to Washington, DC. In hindsight, it wasn't \"the best laid plan\"...but it was my plan for that particular morning. As things happened, my friend was running late; our breakfast therefore ran late; and traffic from Malibu to the hotel was horrendous -- it was summertime, and everyone had gone to hang at the beach. So I called the front desk from my cell phone and explained my situation. I informed the person who answered that I was terribly sorry and would absolutely be checked out by 1:00 p.m. The person with whom I spoke said that was fine and thanked me for calling. Well, after battling some of the worst traffic I had ever seen, it was about 1:15 when I pulled into the hotel driveway. I felt very bad, as I am a man who prides himself on being punctual. I **literally** ran to my room; gathered my bags; and rushed to the front desk to check out. What happened next could have been a video on how *not* to treat a hotel guest: The woman at the front desk, as I approached, informed me that I was \"checking out late.\" I told her that I was aware that I was checking out late, and added that I was very sorry. The front desk person continued, informing me that the hotel was completely full the coming evening and that I had created a real problem for them. She then continued to tell me that she had every right to charge me a half-day room charge on top of what I had already paid. Her mouth continued to utter words, but -- at this point -- I was so angry that I honestly didn't hear what else she was saying. I am an exceedingly polite person who rarely gets angry. The Hotel Bel Air representative, and her attidude, pushed me over the edge. I raised my voice and told her, \"Look, I said I was sorry.\" She looked stunned and said, \"There is no reason to raise your voice.\" I continued, \"I went to Malibu for brunch, which ran late. Traffic was terrible trying to get back here. I took the time to call from the car to say that I was running late. What else do you want?!\" At that point, other guests in the lobby were now staring -- and, to be quite frank, I didn't care (and still don't). You see, I'm not accustomed to visiting 5-star hotels and being treated like a five year old. At that point, the Hotel Bel Air employee admitted that she was unaware that I had called from the car to arrange the late check-out. But -- keep in mind I had apologized to her twice for my tardiness -- she never apologized to me for her error or behavior. I have since returned to Hotel Bel Air's restaurant for breakfast and lunch...but, to be sure, I will never - ever! - stay there again. I have written the general manager twice and never received the courtesy of a reply letter or phone call.

The bathrooms were clean, the whole apartment was amazing. The floors could use a deep clean as it would leave our feet looking dirty but it didn't FEEL dirty. There were no bugs inside the town home though there were plenty outside. We had an excellent time. The drive was a little far but it was about 25-30 minutes from Disney and 35 to Sea World. We drove out to Universal City Walk once and it was the farthest at about 45 minutes away. I'm a military wife so I'm used to traveling so the drive didn't bother me much.

I use trip advisor a lot when traveling. However, my in-laws gave us a weeks stay here for our wedding present. So, with that we didn't have much say. I don't want to come across as unthankful because we really appreciated the fact we didn't pay anything however, if we had paid we would have been throughly disappointed. That's why I'm writing this to you. Upon entering our condo it appeared nice and clean and the only thing I noticed when unpacking our suitcases was how cheap the furniture was. That stuff doesn't matter to us. It wasn't until the next day that the shower in the master bedroom had mold in it. I'm not talking just a little mold but a lot of mold. And to go with the mold in the shower we had to shut the bathroom door at night due to the non stop faucet leak. Needless to say, the rest of my showers were taken in the guest bathroom. The second problem was the bed issue. First, it was one of the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept in. We woke up every morning with neck and back aches. Also, the headboard and bed somehow didn't fit together right and every time someone moved the bed creaked. It wasn't until the last night that has left me traumatized. While my husband was sleeping I was using a nightlight to read and noticed a bug on my nook. I squished it real quick and blood squirted out of it. Gross, I know and I'm sorry but it's the truth. I then freaked out as bed bugs came to my mind. I jumped up and started doing research on bed bugs. I looked at the mattress and couldn't see anything else, but I'm still praying that is not what it was. I know how bed bugs follow you home and how hard they are to get rid of. And now as I have read of someone else in a previous review having had bed bugs in their bed I'm really worried. In addition, they didn't ever come get our towels to clean so we had the same ones all week long. We left our trash outside our door and they were supposed to pick it up but didn't. Again, I can only tell you about the experience I had and other rooms might have been different I don't know. I did want to give you a fair opinion and if I had the ability to choose where to stay I would suggest you look somewhere else. I know it's very confusing when you are reading the reviews and some a great and some are horrible and you wonder if some are just being too picky. I always get confused when reading the reviews and you have some good and some bad. But when you are dealing with the possibility of bed bugs I wouldn't chance it. I hope this helps and that where ever you choose to stay that you have a nice enjoyable trip.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPoo in your shower....\u201d", "Author": "Bezzadoestravel", "ReviewID": "UR119153634", "Content": "Just come back from holiday with my two kids, wife, mum, sister, bruv in law and nephew.

The living room was on a separate floor from the bedrooms which was great with young kids who go to sleep early. The patio was a pleasant place for dinner. Room ammenities - nice tv, great ipod adapter, functional kitchen, bbq close to room.

Staff - the staff were very friendly and helpful What's Bad: This is not a resort. The facilities are limited, it is in a remote location, there is nothing to walk to nearby. Consider this like having a home in the suburbs of Orlando - it is a place to crash, spend a day by the pool, but if you want to see anything, you got to get into the car and drive 20 minutes.

We got a very good dollar rate on this resort, so for what we paid we were okay with our stay. This resort is not great, I would call it a place to hang your hat after a long day of being at the parks. The staff was polite and accommodating. Our townhome's heater kept tripping out the first two days we were there. A maintennance man was sent over to fix the problem and when it was going to take longer than planned, we were moved into a similiar townhome across the way. Our townhouse was neat and clean. It had two bedrooms and two baths (one with just a shower and the other with a tub/shower) upstairs. The master bedroom had a queen sized bed and the other room had two twin beds. One of the screens in the second bedroom window had two large tears and holes in them. I also noticed another unit with holes in the window screen. I did not think that this looked professional. The 1st level had a half bath, living room, dining room, kitchen, and breakfast nook downstairs. The living area and dining room are one open room. Because of the way the room is laid out, only one person could comfortably see the T.V. The couch was off to the side to where you could not view the T.V. well at all. We tried to turn the television set a bit so that we could all watch it, but it just didn't give very good results. A few of the other reviews and even resort advertising say that Disney World is only 20 minutes away. We tried various routes to the park over the week and we could not find one that got us there in that amount of time. Our time was anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes. With two small children it was just too far from the parks for us, especially since we went to Disney everyday. The route that we ended up using the most cost us $5.50 a day in toll fees. All in all, the distance is my biggest complaint. We spent our entire days at the parks and being 30+ minutes away was just not convenient for us. It wasn't practical to take a break in your day back at the resort because you would end up using 2+ hours in travel time getting back and forth between the resort and the parks. Since we visited in December we did not use any of the resort's outdoor amenities.

She told me that I only had to go to breakfast and fill out a survey with no 90 min. presentation required. My \"survey\" took 4hrs. We were sent to Vacation Village at Parkplace. The property was very nice, and the breakfast was at a cuban restaurant on the campus of Disney Celebration.

For example, I needed to print out our boarding passes. This is crucial to do 24 hours ahead of time if you fly Southwest. The one computer that guests were allowed to use did not have printer access. I asked if the front desk could do it for me and she said I would have to wait until the next day because she needed to talk to the manager first. Very sad.

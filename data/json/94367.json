Theater district, Boston Garden, and malls are also a short distance away. If you enjoy pubs like we do, the \"Black Rose\" is across the street and is very nice. Many of the rooms in the hotel are all built out from an old building and don't have any exterior views but windows look into an atrium. The rooms were a nice size, nice clean bathrooms and beds were comfy. A nice touch was the sterio system wich music in the bathroom as well. Nice flat screen TV was nice too. Again, clean, no bed bugs ! The 2 elevators worked well and were fast. Coffee was available in the lobby all day ! No bell hop so carry your own luggage, but thats ok with me. Overall we thought it was a good hotel and would stay again. The only negative with Boston overall is Parking. It cost us over $100 to park the car for 2 nights !

Although the building is old, management seems to put effort to modernized the interior elements. The lighting reflects contemporary interior styling. Starbucks, 7-eleven, and some bars are located walking distance. Bedding is nice and comfy. Restroom is nice and modern. During my stay, I encountered three flaws: parking, structure, and staff. The hotel does not have a parking area. Instead, they suggest usage of 75th State St parking, which is around 2 blocks away. If you are traveling in the winter, arriving late, or traveling for business or vacation, I suggest you to find other hotel as well because of this reason. Don't expect to park your car on the street. Within 3-4 blocks radius, all streets are tow away zone from 2 am to 7 am. No in and out privilege. Once you are out, if you are going back in, you'll have to pay the new rate. Unless you go to the hotel with airport shuttle, parking is disaster. Structure is old. You can hear your neighbor talking or walking. If you are talking inside the room, then the people outside your room can hear your conversation. You can hear squeaky noise from the floor when you walk by. I guess management did not considered the old flooring when they renovate the hotel. Front desk staff seemed arrogant and indifferent. If you park your car by the 75th parking, make sure to have the ticket stamped. The ticket should have Harborside Inn stamped on it. Check before you leave the front desk. They could care less about the parking situation. The hotel is using regular metal key, instead of magnetic key. I personally like magnetic key better, so the key is annoying for me. I hanged the Do Not Disturb sign. When I returned at night, the housekeeping hanged a bag filled with fresh towels. That was pretty nice. I stayed at this hotel during my business trip. In summary: Pro: 1. Close to Quincy market 2. Contemporary interior design 3. Close by mini-market and coffee shops 4. Comfy bed Cons: 1. Noise festival 2. Parking is disaster 3.

Having never been to Boston we were unsure where to stay. This place had good reviews and a great price so figured we'd take a chance. Was definitely a great decision! Pros: location, location, location! Parked the car at check-in and didn't have to move it until check-out. We were able to walk nearly everywhere and for places just outside of walking distance the hotel is about 2 blocks from the State Street T. There are great places to eat just steps from the hotel as well. The front desk was very helpful through our whole stay, which was also pleasing. There are about 4 or 5 computers in the lobby that hotel guests have access too if you need to be near the internet during your stay. The hotel decor is very cute! Loved the exposed brick both in the rooms and in the hallways. Bathrooms were up to date and very nice! We also stayed at another well-known hotel chain during this trip and would have to say the harborside inn wins! Cons: the hotel does offer hot coffee and tea in the lobby but other than that there's not much else being offered outside of a bed to sleep in and free internet. But like I said before there's two coffee shops and a 7 eleven just steps away so it's not that big of an inconvenience. Because of the hotels central location it did get loud on friday night as we had a city view room. We were able to hear people leaving the bars in the middle of the night. Will most likely get an atrium room next time to have a little less noise. The only other complaint is parking - it's expensive even with the hotel validation!! And although we can't fully blame the hotel for this one, it would have been nice to know that we had to pay for a full extra day if not out by a certain time!

So I decided to give this non-chain hotel a try. I was not disappointed. The hotel is conveniently located about 20 yards from the State St. exit of the Aquarium T stop, and is within walking distance to the Financial District and the Freedom Trail. The lobby was clean and modern. There were several computers there that guests could use. Free wi-fi was also present in the rooms. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. Unlike most hotels, room locks are opened with a key, not a programmed card. I don't know if this makes a difference, but it seemed to me that key-operated locks would be less secure (prior guests could make a copy of the key and I doubt the hotel changes locks after each guest). I chose an atrium view room, because of the lower cost. If you like lots of sunshine, you should know that the atrium rooms tend to be on the darker side, but this was not an issue for me. My room had a comfortable king bed with LOTS of pillows, big flat-screen TV, stereo equipment, HUGE mirror, spacious and cool, gray-tiled shower stall, small refrigerator (great for leftovers and beverages), The AC worked well, but it cycled on and off frequently until I realized that I could change the fan speed to LOW. It was very quiet in my room and throughout the whole hotel during my entire stay. If you have active kids, please keep them away from the wall overlooking the atrium as you exit the elevator on the upper floors. The wall was about belly-high and it looked scary looking down from the 8th floor. The hotel had poles on top of the wall and it looked like they were going to install steel cables through those poles to prevent any accidents.

Truth be told, I tend to look at the major brands first when hotel shopping. I was drawn to the Harborside Inn because the name brand hotels were pricing their most basic rooms at over USD350 per night, while Harborside was offering rooms at the USD250-300 range. That Harborside places relatively high in Tripadvisor helped seal the deal. (Why Boston's hotel rates were as high as they were during the time of my short visit, I do not know.) Stayed at a Queen room on the 8th floor facing State Street for 3 nights. At around 230 square feet, I expected the room to be and feel small. I was wrong, it actually felt quite spacious. I liked the room's nautical motif as well with the exposed brick and lighting fixtures adding to the room's overall character. The in-room basics were more or less present (mini fridge, LCD TV, WiFi, desk, personal safe). The room even had a DVD player. Overall, the room looked and felt new and well maintained. The bed was queen sized, fine if you're traveling alone, as I was. The mattress and pillows were just right. The property being an inn rather than a hotel, the room had no pens or writing paper, mini-bar, laundry service, or slippers. The guest services directory was a cheap looking binder with the information printed on basic bond paper. But those don't really matter. The only thing I seriously missed was the complimentary bottled water, a standard amenity in many 5-star hotels. (It helped that the convenience store next door was offering a Buy 1 Get 1 free promotion on 750 ml sized Poland Spring bottled water.) Also, the WiFi signal in my room was pretty weak and the speed was slow. I got a better signal and speed at the lobby. The bathroom was pretty nice. While it was not large by any means, it was nicely designed, compact and functional. No tub. Just a shower. I should mention that the shower area was large for such a compact bathroom. The same was true of the counter space. (They certainly made efficient use of the available space.) I liked the hand held shower and the strong water pressure. The towels were nice, large and soft. The toiletries (shampoo, bar soap, conditioner, shower gel), however, were your no-brand type made in faraway China (relative to Boston). (Good thing I brought my own.) Plastic cups but made of sturdy rather than thin plastic. The room key was a real key not the electronic credit card sized plastic keys you get in most hotels nowadays. Not a criticism. I just thought, as other reviewers have done, that I'd mention it. Room lighting was weak to adequate. I had read other reviews complaining about street noise seeping in for those rooms that face State Street. I can indeed confirm that street noise does seep in. Thankfully, I was in Boston mid-week, so State was relatively quiet at night for the whole duration of my stay. Staff were professional. I checked in early (around 11 am) and was immediately given a room. No waiting. I asked for a late check-out. While I was told that they were booked full for the night, I was nevertheless allowed an extra 30 minutes from the 12 pm check-out time. As for location, as it's name implies, Harborside is close to the harbor. Quincy Market and Faenuil Hall are a short walk, away as are some of the other major tourist sites. It helps that Boston's downtown is actually quite compact.

The hotel is in the financial district of downtown Boston, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also nearby to many of the popular tourist attractions such as the New England Aquarium, Quincy Marketplace, Faneuil Hall, and more. It would be simple to walk all over the area for sightseeing, but if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk, there are numerous sightseeing trolley tours and harbor cruises within 1 block of the hotel if you prefer. The hotel itself is somewhat small (I believe it only had 8 floors); it definitely felt more like a boutique hotel, and what it lacked in size, it made up for in charm. The common areas of the hotel, as well as the room I stayed in, had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchistorical Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feel. The red brick walls were exposed in many places, there were creaky wooden floors in some places, and there was a nautical theme throughout that I found rather charming. The lobby had a big comfortable common area for socializing or waiting, an area with 4 complimentary internet computer stations, and a table set up with complimentary coffee/tea. Check-in was easy and efficient, and the guys behind the desk were eager to provide sightseeing maps and recommendations for lunch. I had a room on the 7th floor, with windows looking out over busy State Street (which the entrance of the hotel is on). Looking out my windows, I could see some of Quincy Marketplace to the left, and the Boston harbor to the right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was quite lovely. The room had a comfortable queen size bed with 4 cushy pillows and soft linens, a small loveseat, a small table with 2 chairs, a closet with iron/ironing board, a huge mirror on one wall, a huge entertainment center with a very big flat screen TV, speakers, a DVD player, a safe, and a small fridge. The nautical theme was carried out inside the room, as well, with a large painting of a sailboat and harbor above the bed, and a really cool lamp hanging over the table that looked like it was plucked off of a tall-masted ship. The bathroom was modern and bright, with a nice array of amenities (shampoo, lotion, mouthwash), soft towels and a hairdryer. Overall, a spacious and comfortable room. After first getting settled into the room, I was overjoyed at how charming it was, what a good location it was in, and the fact that it had complimentary wireless internet (bonus!). However, my enthusiasm faded later in the afternoon when some shortcomings started to surface: - First, the complimentary WiFi in my room stopped working. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been using it for a couple hours, but when I returned from lunch, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work anymore. I called the front desk (they said they were unaware of any problems), and then I called the internet help desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but after a long phone call and various attempts, the problem was still unresolved. Not having internet access on a business trip is a deal-breaker for me, so this severely crippled my productivity. Using the complimentary internet stations in the lobby wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an option, either, as the documents and programs I needed were on my laptop. - Second, the creaky floors that I originally thought were so charming then became a bit annoying when I realized I could hear the guests in the room above me walking around. Someone on the floor above me was also playing loud music later that night, which I called the front desk to inquire about, and they had already received other complaints and were getting ready to go talk to the guests about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I realized how thin the walls and floors of this historical building must be. - Third, after my meeting was done at the end of the night and I was winding down in my room (the internet in my room still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, and I know it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my laptop, as it was able to access WiFi perfectly at my business meeting), I realized that charming State Street (which my windows overlooked) was loud. Very loud. For most of the night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if the noise was from the nearby bars, restaurants, or even Quincy Marketplace, but it was distracting and I was unable to sleep. Had I known that the area was so loud, I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve asked for a room that was not facing the street. I realize that the noise on the street is not the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, but the windows were only single paned, so the hotel could attempt to remedy this type of a situation by installing dual-pane windows, or even curtains. The two windows in my room only had mini-blinds, which did nothing to help block out the sound, much less the light. I prefer very dark hotel rooms, so with the light and the noise coming in from outside, I had to use an eye-mask and earplugs to sleep. I know not every hotel can completely soundproof and lightproof their rooms, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sure prefer if every attempt was made to do so. Overall, this hotel is very charming, well-located, and has many great amenities. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just be leery to stay there again due to the internet problems I experienced on this visit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and if I did stay again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely request an interior room that would hopefully be quieter and darker.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201c3 night stay in Boston\u201d", "Author": "LHMB", "ReviewID": "UR118755227", "Content": "Having never been to Boston before I was unsure as to what area to stay in.

The room itself was very well done, although the stool in the bathroom was not secure, as it was at an odd angle and freely moved around the floor. I found the bed to be very soft, along with four very soft pillows, which I assumed were for resting a head on while sleeping. Shortly after turning out the lights, I realized that the pillows were not soft for sleeping, rather they were soft for another reason. They are best used to bury your head as deeply as you can under a pile of them in an attempt to mitigate as much of the external noise as possible. This includes being able to hear your neighbor on a phone very clearly through the wall, the trash service that comes between midnight and 1 AM on the street below for at least an hour - diesel engines and dumpsters clanging, and finally the construction crews that start dumping things from second story windows into an open 32 foot roll-off from 5AM to 7AM, right below your window. All of this noise sounded so loud, as if my windows were open. When I made a comment to the front desk in the morning, I got a \"Yup\".

The second room was awful too...even with the 'city-view'. I decided we would stay just so we could drop our luggage and go out for dinner. Robert stared at me as I left and I really felt that he should be in anything other than hospitality! Got home today and unpacked and started organising receipts, etc. I opened the envelope from Harborside Inn and found that I had been charged 2 times the original amount quoted. An upgrade from one terrible room to another crappy room with a 'city-view' that consisted of a few buildings that blocked all other views! I will be fighting these excessive charges and would tell people to run from this Inn!

Now that we're no longer a cab ride away from Downtown, we have stayed overnight in Boston the last couple of years. I decided to try the Harborside Inn this year and was not disappointed. After watching the room rate for a couple weeks, I was able to book for $99 (best deal in Boston!). They were able to provide early check in and the staff was very nice. We had an atrium view, which looks out on the brick interior of the hotel. Nothing special, but it's a little cheaper than the room with a city view. The room was clean and the bathroom was a good size. Very nice flat screen tv with a good amount of channels. The two downsides to this hotel is the parking situation and lack of room service. You can receive a discounted rate at a garage that's a two minute walk down State Street and that's probably the best price you'll find in that area. Most of the hotels in Boston have additional fees for parking, so be prepared to pay no matter which hotel you choose. Also, the Harborside does not have a restaurant onsite, so there is no room service available. Having said that, you have Faneuil Hall just a few steps away with plenty of options for meals, snacks and beverages. There is also a 24-hour convenience store in the same building as the hotel. If you're just looking for clean place to rest your head and relax a little during your stay in Boston, this is a great option in a convenient location. If you're looking for a place with a lot of amenities and pampering, I would recommend shelling out some big bucks for one of the larger hotels.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in Boston centre\u201d", "Author": "TravellerGU14", "ReviewID": "UR63045535", "Content": "We had a great stay here for one night on our tour of New England for before heading to NYC.

Pushed my rolling bag and brief case for at least 3/4 of a mile to find the hotel across a main thoroughfare from hotels blocking the view of the harbor (Marriott). Nice place though - family run, front desk were conscientious and asked questions and gave directions about dining/etc. Renovated hotel in an old brick facade - rooms had regular keys for locks. Simple room - nice queen bed, two night stands, a small round table w/ 2 chairs and a sofa. Large tube style television w/ a DVD player and stereo system - all placed in a shelf unit. No bureau or cabinet, just open shelves for your belongings. Closet had an iron/ironing board and some shelf-unit and hangers. Bathroom was very compact - walk-in shower (no tub), not much counter space around the sink. Free wifi and computers in the lobby. Free coffee in the lobby. No restaurant, though hotel surrounded by bars and restaurants in both sides. Convenience store two doors down. No obvious parking, though parking was available down the street. Hotel was very nice and in excellent location if I was sightseeing. Surrounded by bars, on the weekend the noise from the street might be a problem. Went less than a block and I found Faneuil Hall and found a take-out dinner there. Didn't walk across the main road to check out the harbor. From my room, if I looked closely I could see a bit of the docks where a few boats were tied up next to the Marriott - that was the harbor view. Overall, a nice emergency hotel, close to the train station at an affordable price. Excellent location if you wanted to see the local tourist attractions. I checked and no room had two queen bed setups, if you wanted to bring a family of four for example. However, my sofa opened up to a sleeper sofa.

Getting there from the Airport couldn't have been easier - Shuttle Bus from the terminal to the water taxi stop - Pressed the button on the water taxi intercom - \"I'll be with you in 5 buddy\", and low and behold a chequered water taxi comes speeding across the harbour. $10 and 5mins later I'm on the jetty by the Long Wharf, I cross the street and the Harborside Inn is in front of me - 2 mins walk at the maximum. Check-in was a breeze and staff were courteous and friendly. The room was large, clean and overlooked a back street. There was a nice large flatpanel HD TV and DVD Player all hooked up to a home cinema amp which was nice. The bathroom was nice - with a lovely large tiled shower cubicle - big enough to have a party in. The bed was comfy with lovely soft and fluffy pillows. The hotel itself doesn't have any dining facilities, but due to its location - that is not a problem. If you fancy a snack then there is a 24hrs convenience store next door - turn left out of the front door. For breakfast you turn right outside the front door and you have Nunzios - serving all the usual American breakfast classics. If you fancy a brewski - then there is a bar called the GoodBar right next door - this also serves standard bar snacks. All these are in the same building as the hotel so walking times not given (under 10seconds !!) For evening meals you're spoilt for choice, turn right out of the hotel and there is a LegalSeafood about a minute away towards the Aquarium - also the rather excellent Chart House is behind the Long Wharf hotel - try the coconut shrimp and follow it with the Scrod Sandwich - you wont be dissapointed. Turn left out of the hotel and about 30secs later you're in Fanueil Hall - which has more restaurants than you can shake a stick at - the food hall in the market is mindblowing. Around the outside are more trad restaurants, including a Wagamama and a replica \"Cheers\" bar which has some of the best burgers I've tasted. The Union Street Oyster House is on the other side of Fanueil Hall which is a must visit for anyone staying in Boston.

There was a really big flat screen TV hanging on the wall and there was a really nice sound system with an amp/receiver(FM radio, which plays in the bathroom as well), and even a DVD player in case you get stuck on a rainy weekend. I even think they rent movies downstairs for you. There was a freakishly large mirror in our room too, a little strange.

This is not necessary; for one thing, the inner rooms have windows that open to a well lighted atrium, and secondly, the windows were so high I had to stand on a chair to see out (or to open/close the blinds). In fact, you might prefer the inner rooms as they would be quieter. My initial impression was good since I showed up at 9 a.m. intending to check my bag and go sightsee. However, the clerk at reception said they had a room open if I wanted to check in right away. (This may explain the view, and is sure OK with me) I had room 610.

Shower only, with a major water saver shower-head. Plenty of hot water, though, so what if it takes a little longer to rinse off? There is also a hairdryer. No in-room safe, and no coffee maker.

Extreme traffic noise (mostly cars honking due to traffic snarls on surrounding streets), police sirens, very loud crowds, and an incessant throb of techno beat from next-door club. And it continued past 4am. When i voiced my concern the following morning to the person who checked us in, he did apologize, and admitted the noise was indeed high on thu-sat nights, and even the atrium rooms still get significant nightclub throb. Would have been nice to get that honest assessment before we wasted our evening and money. Hopefully i can save you the bother. So, the desk help was extremely helpful (but we feel less than honest), the rooms were very clean and comfortably furnished, but none of that makes a difference if you're trying to relax. We could forgive until midnight perhaps, but past 4am? No way folks. If we were much younger and so inebriated it didn't matter, and the rooms were free, well perhaps a good fit, but for anything else avoid avoid AVOID.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Bostonorbust", "ReviewID": "UR23896659", "Content": "Just spent a week in Boston and loved all of it. We arrived by bus at South Station and quickly and easily navigated the T to the Harborside with no trouble. Check in (and check out) were quick and easy. When I booked the room, I figured the City View rooms facing State St. would have a nicer view than the rooms facing out from the back of the hotel, and my request was accomodated. On Friday and Saturday evenings when a line was forming in front of the bar two doors down, the waiting crowd got a little loud for a couple of hours. We could also hear horns beeping occasionally ( I think this wouldn't be a problem in an Atrium room.) Our room had two brick walls; the new construction is drywall. The bed was spacious and very comfortable, as were the pillows. This was easily the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. A hook in the bathroom for hanging clothes would have been nice. The room was perfectly clean every day when we returned from our outings. The free coffee in the lobby saved us probably $100 over the course of the week. There are plenty of places to eat within two or three blocks of the hotel, and we chose to eat at a different place each time. There is also a convenience store on the same block. I used the lobby computer twice to check email without having to wait. Even though the hotel was busy, we only heard other guests in the hall once. It was nice having a stereo in the room.

I would say that we got lucky on this one. If I had read the reviews I might not have stayed there. Our primary goal was the location. We planned on spending little or no time at the hotel. So the lack of ammenities or the hotel staff's lack of attention (as others stated) didn't bother us. They were fine with us. We didn't ask alot of questions and didn't expect anything either. We did have to ask for a second key though. We were handed only 1upon check-in. I haven't carried a key on a plastic key chain in years from a hotel! I thought all had switched to the key cards by now. The hotel's website does not show wood floors with exposed brick walls so we did not expect that either. It looked modern and clean, which it was. We were surprised however that after the first night they only made the bed and did not change the towels. The following day, my husband found one of the maids and asked her to put fresh towels in our room. She hung them on our door about 5 minutes later while we were still in the room. He had to find her again and tell her it was ok for HER to change the towels and make the bed. The $8 tip we left probably helped get the bed made the next night as well, but no extra towels. Other than that and than fact that one elevator was out of service, the hotel was fine. We had room #509, which I would recommend to anyone staying there. It was an interior room (king bed) but quiet. We heard some very faint music but not as bad as the other reviews. There were a couple of other rooms on the floor that were right near serious creaking problems in the hallways (possibly rooms #514 & #515) and I would avoid them. One thing about our room: it looked a little unfinished. Nothing on the walls, very plain. The sound system looked like it was put on the shelf as an after thought. And if you want to use the sound system, you'll need to bring CD's since there is virtually no reception in the room for AM/FM channels. The only thing the hotel might want to consider is updating the parking information. The garage at 75 State Street is closed for renovations, so the garage that the hotel is currently using is quite a walk if you have luggage. The parking situation might be the only reason we don't stay there again. It's makes a big difference and it's not convenient at all. Also, it might not be a good idea to stay there when the kids are back in college. We were there in July so the college hords were not at the two bars in front of the hotel. Otherwise, the hotel was clean, the staff was fine and the location was great. And as other reviewers stated, if you want 5-star service, you'll need to look elsewhere.

The room was clean, and while not large had enough storage space for our stuff.

There is no parking. If you have a car, they have a deal with a parking lot a block and one half away. It might be wise to drop off your luggage, then park your car. There is no bellboy service. I do mark it down a little for not having any sort of continental breakfast. There really are no breakfast spots in the neighborhood open on weekends (this is largely a financial district) other than at the Long Wharf Marriot a block away and that is expensive. I found the front desk staff to be friendly and helpful, especially with restaurant recommendations -- they knew the best places, and because the hotel doesn't have its own, they didn't feel pressured to recommend eating in-house. I highly recommend this place unless you want to spend 3x the price for bell service and a coffee shop for breakfast.

We had a Cityview room with a king bed. Really liked the hardwood floors and exposed brick walls in the room. Bedding was comfortable if a bit soft. Bathrooms needed some work. Limited counter space, cracked porcelain on the sink, fixtures were a bit worn and dated. Nothing outlandish, but everything just needs to be redone in the bathrooms. TV was okay, with a good channel selection. Small love seat and large table filled out the room. Front desk was very nice at check-in but other than that, pretty limited service/staff interaction. No room service or bar/restaurant. No bell desk or porter. Checking luggage was self-service. We went out late one night for some drinks and right outside the main door on State Street was a young man stumbling from the bar next door throwing up. The vomit stayed there, uncleaned, outside the front door for the next day and a half. Location is what really attracted us to this hotel. Minutes to Faneuil Hall, Waterfront and the North End. Short walks to the Financial District, Boston Garden, Boston Common, Beacon Hill, etc. There is a T stop right outside the front door as well. Plenty of bars /restaurants within minutes of the hotel. Really got to see a lot of Boston and this was a great home base. Overall, I would recommend the Harborside for anyone looking for a good, clean, well-priced, well-located property to explore Boston.

The room was recently renovated with a king sized bed and a flat screen television. The room was very clean and nice. The only negative was the room did not have any pictures and kind of lacked some character. The location was GREAT! The blue line aquarium stop is literally outside the hotel. Close to North End which is Little italy. We had dinner at L'Osterio which was fantastic. Very reasonable and super food. A block or two away from Qunicy Market/Fanueil Hall as well. We had Celtics tickets and we had less than a 10 minute walk to TD Banknorth Garden. If you like to go to a bar or two, I would highly recommend the Tap and Sullivans Tap. The Tap is close to Quincy Market and we had a bartender whom was SUPER friendly and offering us popcorn made in Quincy Market. Sullivans Tap has always been one of our favorite stops. The Sam Adams tour is also worthwhile. We were told to visit Doyle's which is very nice but off of the beaten path. We were told we could walk, but it looked like a shakey neighborhood so that was where the 1-day pass came in handy. If we go back to Boston, I would probably look elsewhere first, but would be willing to stay here again. It was a very nice hotel but kinda lacked that little bit of character to put it over the top.

We selected the Harborside Inn located near Fanieul Hall. It looked like a great location and the price was very reasonable -- we paid about $159 per night (plus tax). First, I should mention that the location is excellent. 2 minute walk to Faniuel Hall/Quincey Market, Boston Aquarium nearby (which we didn't visit), subway stop (The \"T\") literally right outside of the hotel (Aquarium stop) and a convenience store at the corner. Many sights were easily a 15 minute walk and anything further, we just hopped on the T. It was great. The Harborside Inn offers 24 hour complimentary coffee & tea. They have 2 computers in their lobby with internet access hooked up to a printer and this was compimentary to hotel guests -- we found this very useful. The staff was extremely pleasant. On the flipside, it's just an average hotel. The rooms were clean but small. The exposed brick and hardwood floors gave it a nice feel but they only had cheap miniblinds on the windows with no curtains. Although our room faced other rooms, I felt uncomfortable without curtains, that maybe people could see in. Also, although it was not a big deal, I noticed that the wall was partially unpainted and the bathroom & room door were not painted well (you could see white through the one coat of paint they put on). I know those are little things and honestly, not that important to me anyway (we were not in the room much) but the guest rooms have potential to be really nice and those things just made it seem a little sloppy. They were obviously remodeling becuase there was some work being done around the hotel so maybe they haven't gotten to the guest rooms yet. Important note: There is no restaurant or room service at the hotel. This wasn't an issue for us since there is a convenince store nearby and also Quincey Market is very close and walkable for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Lastly, I think I read this in a review for this hotel before but I completely forgot about it until we arrived and it's really important.

Negatives: -- The Aquarium T stop was closed for part of my stay (not the hotel's fault, of course!), but the Government Center and State stops are only about a 5-minute walk away as well. However, if it is critical for you to have the T stop right there, I would advise checking the MTBA website to see if any closures of the Aquarium stop are planned during your stay.

The floors were not clean, we pulled out the so called sofabed (it is a chair) and the sheets were dirty with crumbs etc. I called downstairs to get some clean sheets, they just dumped them on the bed when we were out, didn't even make the bed or take the dirty bedding away. It was just a very beat up room from the broken blinds, dirty curtains and smelled like stale smoke. The photos on the internet showed large windows, nice large rooms and brick walls...ours looked NOTHING like the photos. Low ceilings, small, and very small windows. It was loud at night with the nightclubs untill about 2am. If you want to stay somewhere relaxing and quiet this is not the hotel.

We checked in, changed, and set out for a night on the town, returning to the hotel at about 1:15 a.m. The first surprize was that all of the bars in the neighborhood were overflowing with raucous, screaming college students. (This hadn't been the case at all in June.) The front step of the hotel was covered in vomit. We tried to enter the hotel to escape the very unpleasant street scene, but found the door to be locked. Just then we were approached by a young man who identified himself as the hotel night clerk who informed us that he had come outside to clean up the vomit but had forgotten his keys! We asked him what we should do - wait for him to get the door open, or go find another hotel. He replied \"I really don't know what to tell you\" and walked away. After standing outside for almost an hour weighing our options (we had no reservation anywhere else, and all our luggage was locked inside along with our car keys), we were finally let back into the hotel by another guest who had been awakened by the impromtu street party and come downstairs to investigate. The next morning we checked out, determined to find a different hotel and salvage the weekend. I told the desk clerk about our ordeal and asked what sort of compensation the hotel would provide. She pled ignorance of the whole affair, and took down all my contact information, saying that the hotel would be in touch. I waited a week. No calls, no emails, no apologies. Finally, I called the hotel and asked the manager why they hadn't contacted me and what sort of compensation they would provide. The best excuse he could come up with was that they had lost my contact information! (They had managed to bill me, however.) Eventually, he promised to provide a full refund and hung up.

The attendants werent the most helpful in the world, but we kind of knew what we wanted to do anyway. We got an atrium room and it was nice with period-style pieces and exposed brick. It is a little on the small side, but once you get past that its comfortable. All we did was pretty much sleep there anyway. The location of this hotel is what makes it amazing. It is in one of the most active areas of Boston, with tons of restaurants, shops and pubs within walking distance. You are a block and a half from Quincy market and a block from the waterfront and acquarium. The location was by far the greatest aspect to this hotel- you could walk everywhere.

Repeated calls to the local police and complaints with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front desk went nowhere, although the staff was aware of the noise situation and told us that others had complained the night before and that they themselves called 911 the previous night to complain about it. The front desk did offer us the only other available room, but it was a smoking room and it really stank! Due to no sleep, we canceled the rest of our planned stay in Boston and decided to return home on the next available flight. Upon check-out the manager had apparently just left, but we insisted that the front desk contact him and they were finally able to reach him on his mobile phone. He claimed to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sorry\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for what had happened but was not willing to take any responsibility for this miserable experience because it was not in his \"control,\" and he declined to compensate us even part of the room rate. We will follow-up with the owner as well as file a complaint with Better Business Bureau. Apparently, the crews are working on the \"Big Dig\" project in Boston, which has been ongoing for several years now, and they had been working at this particular location for three days, which the hotel staff was well aware of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even at the time we made the reservation. At a minimum, we believe the hotel was responsible for informing its guests upon making reservations that although it had rooms available, they are next to the construction project, which would allow the guest to make an informed decision.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham, WA", "Title": "\u201cSleep deprivation experiment\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4052737", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing.

The guy giving me my key does not need to be my new best friend. I did notice a few of the furnishings are a little bit worn, and the bathroom decor is much more Holiday Inn style, failing to match the charm of the rest of the room. The hallways are non-descript, though the design of the lobby, which is open up to the top floor, is unique. There are loads of papers to read and nice leather chairs to relax on in front of the elevators. The restaurant was being remodeled. Speaking of remodeling, the Big Dig is still goin' strong, 15 years and counting! I had a room on the street side (because I wanted the view,) and could definitely hear construction noise, though it didn't bother me. In fact, it was neat to look out and watch. Now I know why it's taking so long. (I watched a shovel push the same mound of dirt back and forth for days...) I am sure when the Big Dig is over, should it ever be completed, the Harborside will raise its rates, so enjoy it now. Speaking of noise, I had read on tripadvisor that the outside rooms were noisy from the local bars. This was a Thursday, so I wasn't too worried. It ended up being fairly quiet, until about 1am. I was then treated to an extremely loud conversation - every word audible. Looking down seven stories I saw the culprits: one single pair of women smoking and chatting. I can't imagine how loud a big crowd would be.

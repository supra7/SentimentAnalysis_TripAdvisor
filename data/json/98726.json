After 5 wonderful visits at The Crescent in Uptown, I decided to investigate The Mansion, for a girls' weekend with my sister and my daughter. Mara's professionalism and interest in our party, when I called with a pre-arrival request, were very impressive and set the tone for a remarkable experience. From Thomas' warm introduction to the hotel, as we walked the hallways to our room....to Oriana's unexpected proclamation when we called for breakfast service the next morning, sharing a dietary restriction, \"The hotel has gluten-free bread and we can make you toast!\" .....to Jackson's prompt and fun room service deliveries, which included ice packs for an injury, unsolicited but oh so appreciated...I felt like we had stepped in to a fairy tale....and I was one of the three princesses. Becky suggested and arranged an amazing Sunday afternoon snack on the restaurant's terrace and Haley served our delicious treats (grit fries...really?!?!) patiently and sweetly, as we basked in the perfection that is The Mansion. The hotel is beautiful, but there are many, many spectacular properties around the world. What sets The Mansion on Turtle Creek apart is its commitment to impeccable service from dawn until dark, offered in an unaffected and genuine way. Very few establishments get it right....that perfect blend of being there for you, but not being intrusive. They do.

The valet was friendly as was our bellhop who showed us to our room and showed us all the features. We were upgraded to a suite with an additional bathroom and living area which is something I always appreciate--if the better room is just sitting there empty, why not give an upgrade? My friend and i enjoyed all day out by the pool with some of the greatest margaritas I've had in a long time. We then met other friends for dinner and wine at the bar while enjoying live entertainment but unfortunately was not my favorite Mansion entertainer, Hunter Sullivan. Just going to one of Hunter's shows is worth a stay at the Mansion if you are into the old charm of Sinatra days. He's not a cheesey Sinatra impersonator but a talented charmer himself. The dishes are great. If you just want to have cocktails or wine while watching the show there are great snacks such as my favorite truffle fries or an amazing foie gras.

Cons: 1) The waitress insulted me twice. I have never heard of a martini on ice and my date had a steak knife for his steak, but I was given a butter knife for my lamb. I asked for a steak knife as well and she mentioned how neither of those things are normal and she had worked there for a long time.

I mean small! 3) We weren't asked how our food was after we were served our entrees. She didn't check if the steak was cooked properly, which it wasn't. 3) The menu was not explained. She pointed out the $95 meal and that was all. 4) Service was really slow. It took us 45 mins for our appetizer, another 30 for our entree, 20 for our dessert, and 30 minutes to get our tab. 5) When we called, they said they didn't have an open reservation, but they made and exception and accommodated us. Which would be a good thing, however, when we got there the dining room was only 60% full at 8:00 and slowly decreased from there. I would say the service was 2.5 stars, the food was 3.5 stars if there was enough to eat and overall experience was a 3.

I booked a package through the internet that was called, I believe, A Taste of the Mansion. It was a great package though that is not why we selected the hotel-I had always wanted to stay there then to add frosting to the cake they added a free night since we choose to stay 3 nights instead of 2. Before we even arrived I was constantly impressed with the numerous contact emails and calls they made verifying our needs and asking if we had any further requests. I have worked in hotels most of my career and traveled around the world and was amazed at the level of service, caring, warmth and hospitality. We arrived to a polite but very friendly reception from the valet and then found hot cider, apples and gorgeous fragrant flowers in the lobby. The front desk associate was delightful and there was an anniversary card greeting waiting for us from the manager. We were taken to our room where there were iced tea, chocolate covered strawberries and another card waiting in our room , again courtesy of the manager. What a great start to our stay and it only got better. We then went to the lounge for cocktails which were included in our package. It was a very classy upscale lounge, but not stuffy, and full of beautiful Texans (you could just tell). Obviously this is a popular spot for locals too. We then went to dinner in the dining room. Our reservation was handled beautifully and we were seated immediately. We sat in the atrium part which was lovely because it was actually snowing outside (it had been 75 the day before). Just beautiful and very romantic! In retrospect of the great service I wouldn't be surprised if the manager hadn't ordered the snow just to add to the ambiance. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. We thought we would get a special menu because of the package but were able to order anything we wanted off the regular menu. The only thing not included was caviar. Oh, I forgot to mention the chef and the restaurant manager also welcomed us with anniversary cards when we arrived. What attention to detail!! The next morning we ordered the package breakfast from room service and again were allowed to order whatever we wanted. This was one package where they really wanted you to enjoy what they had to offer and not make you feel like you were being given a deal or made it difficult to use like most hotels do (listen up Las Vegas). Each day the valets were a delight (one night's parking fee was included in the package too) and constantly offered us cold chilled bottles of water (no $6.00 bottle of water gimmick-don't hotels realize how insulting that is?) and gave us great service and great directions. As we were leaving on our last day I was carrying two bottles of warm water that we hadn't used. The valet took them from me and exchanged them for cold ones without my even asking him. Wow! Oh, by the way, not to be totally overshadowed by the fantastic service, the Mansion itself is incredibly beautiful and recently remodeled. The beds and pillows were fabulous and the bathroom and amenities incredible. It was fun to read about the history of the mansion as it was a cotton barons home at one time. However, do not get the impression that it is some type of elegant old B& B type. It is a very up to date 5* hotel of incredible warmth and beauty in a great location with a well earned reputation for excellence. Another example, I had asked for a steamer and they very nicely put a full size professional steamer in the room and left it for the whole stay. Room was spotless and faultless. As you can see I would highly recommend staying at the Mansion when you are in Dallas. I have only been to one hotel I could compare it to (and we never stay in less than a 4* hotels) and that would be The Alvear Palace in Buenos Aires. Whoever is doing the training for this hotel sure knows what they are doing and the manager is to be highly commended for developing such a fabulous team and product. We stayed in a Four Seasons in Austin after we left Dallas and as great as they were they had a hard time competing after our stay at The Mansion.

The feel of the hotel is decidedly different when you enter as if you are coming in the back door. The only request for special service that I made in advance of our stay was that they say, \"Happy Birthday,\" to my 8 year old daughter and make her feel special. In fact, no one mentioned her Birthday at all unless I prompted them, and even then there was no enthusiasm or sincerity. We were put in a room overlooking the parking lot of the building next door...a really terrible view. The newly remodeled rooms seemed unremarkable. The coffee table and desk were unsubstantial. The room service dinner was very costly (as one would expect) but was very disappointing, especially considering a new chef and menu. I asked them to adjust their \"macaroni and cheese\" dish to make it simple for my child's tastes, but they did not make any adjustments that I could discern. We had to go out for pizza. After my stay, the Mansion sent an email request for an evaluation. I filled in the evaluation honestly and got no response at all. This really surprised me. I must say, though, that the valet service was quite good. Those men are very accommodating, super nice and were very kind to my daughter.

Had I known, I might have picked this location for my wedding. From the moment we drove up to the front door, we have been treated as though we were their only guests. Call down to the front desk for anything and within moments, someone arrives at your door. We asked where the ice machine was, and instead someone brought a silver bucket of ice to our room. We found some ants on the floor that had discovered some crumbs from a pastry that we had eaten, and someone came to sweep up the debris. We have been away from Dallas for so long that we have been having trouble with directions, so the hotel always makes sure that we know how to get around. I will say that if there are any flaws with this hotel, it's that it can be very tricky to find. It's in a residential neighborhood in Turtle Creek, but that's what makes it so wonderful. Since we have been here, we haven't heard a sound from the other guests. The spa is wonderful, with showers, steam room, lockers with robes and slippers. The pool area is nice; Small, but not so small that it's uncomfortable. Plus, it even comes with a waiter, who can take food orders. The pool isn't very deep; five feet at most, but it's very relaxing during the hot Dallas summers! The room is very spacious; we have a balcony that looks out onto the street, and the room has a DVD player. Downstairs behind the front desk, there is a business center that could be considered an office. Internet service in the business center is free 24/7, but you can also use the high speed in your room for $10 per day. That's a bargain, compared to some places.

It is wonderful just as it is. I would call it a hotel with a lovely patina. It is not a new, modern, trendy Four Seasons or Gaylord. It is the MANSION on Turltle Creek. What does that mean to me? 1. Bed Linens are made by Quagliotti and Carmignani of Italy. Not the the cheap \"hotel\" lines of Sferra Bros and Frette (Made in China) which are so popular today but in no way compares to the aforementioned. 2. Table Linens are also of Carmignani of Italy. 3. The furniture is all customed made by Beverly Furniture of California. Not bought off of the floor in China but handmade in the USA. 4. The fixtures are gold plated and somewhat worn to a very nice patina. They are not cheap stuff in the latest bronze, platinum, etc finishes. They are what a mansion should have: aged gold finish. No flashy chrome anywhere to be found 5. The doors are solid wood and very heavy. Old. Ditto for the vanity. NO shiny black plastic looking finish, just an aged white hand finish. 6. The bathroom is done in marble and not granite. It doesn't have that ultra shiny finish either. The lighting is very pleasant and without all of those super bright LED , HID bulbs all over the celings. 7. In the restaurant, the men dined in suits and ties. Yes, that's right. The men actually worn ties and none of this open collar, caual nonsense so trendy today. 8. The food and service was truly superb. No fancy colored glass dinner plates or weird coffee saucers etc. (You'll have to go to the 4 seasons for that). 9. When you compare the rate here ($425 incl dinner for two) vs. the 4 Seasons at $895 and up (w/o dinner) you realize what a bargain this place really is. The Gaylord out in Grapevine is $395 for crying out loud!. 10. Ben Stein of Business TV fame was being interviewed in the lobby just prior to dinner. 11. The in-room breakfast ($38.00) was beautifully presented and with the french doors open onto the small balcony you realize how special this place is. They forgot the creamer but brought it up promptly 12. The staff is professional, experienced, helpful and friendly. No arrogance, pomposity, etc unless you prefer it. 13. The plumbing has some issues. When the water drained from one sink the opposing sink made a strange sound that was yet familiar. \"That's it! That's sound of the bongo drums from I Love Lucy when Desi would be at the Copacabana warming up.\" 14. You are fool to miss out on the Mansion on Tutle Creek. 14.

We called early the day of arrival to request an early check-in, and were told the room was ready, which we were happy to hear since I wanted to spend the day at the pool. I skipped lunch at home thinking I'd get a great lunch poolside. When we pulled into the driveway, we were greeted immediately and warmly by the valet and someone came to the car with a luggage cart (even though we had planned on wheeling in our small overnight bags). We were greeted enthusiastically by the concierge, but the front desk welcome was underwhelming, and I thought it odd that the clerk did not review our reservation and discuss the included breakfast. I called later, and was told we had a choice of room service, or choice of menu in the restaurant., but I thought this should have been explained at check-in After getting settled in the room, there was a knock on the door, and room service delivered two glasses of ice tea and one tiny pastry. In spite of there being only one small pastry for us to share, I thought this was a lovely welcome and nice touch. The apple and peach tart was yummy. Although this is a luxury hotel, it is a city location, and as such, the pool area was quite small, but beautifully landscaped. The lounge chairs were wood with cushions (I often evaluate a hotel on the quality of its lounge pool furniture), but there were only 11. Fortunately, two people were leaving, so we were able to get two chairs. There is a sundeck up the stairs with four more loungers, but I like being near the pool since I like to swim. I imagine during the week when there is a business crowd, the pool area is not crowded as it was this holiday weekend. There was a \"pool boy\" who laid new towels, and gave us a bottle of cold water, which he replenished later in the day. He also moved our chairs into the shade at his suggestion. He gets the award for the best service of the weekend! Lunch at the pool was the only disappointment of the weekend. I ordered a caesar salad from the very limited pool menu, and it was small, way overpriced even by resort standards, and with ordinary boxed croutons. There was a room service delivery charge, so if the salad was an indication of the quality of room service food, we decided we should have our breakfast at the restaurant instead the next morning. Breakfast was excellent, well presented, and not ridiculously priced like the pool menu. We didn't realize the gratuity was included in our package, but you wouldn't have known it by the great service we received. We would definitely return to the restaurant just for breakfast on a weekend. The room had a traditional key lock, and when we checked out, we forgot to return the key since we typically have a card key at other hotels, which we just throw away. The desk clerk did not request the key, so when we realized we still had it, we drove back to the hotel to return it. I would think this is a common occurence since an actual key is so outdated, and thought it odd that the desk clerk did not request it back. Again, we just weren't impressed with the front desk staff compared with the other good service we had received. All in all, a lovely stay, but I don't have an overwhelming desire to return.

The valet staff in particular deserves kudos for running back and forth for my car in 106 degree Texas heat ! The front desk staff made sure that messages were promptly delivered and were gracious with my frequent service requests. And therein lies the problem. My service requests were frequent -- almost daily. The safe failed to work after I had placed my items inside. The air conditioning unit made a clicking noise every 20 seconds throughout the evening until the staff finally got it fixed about 8 hours later. The hot water took almost 15 minutes to get to the Texas sized soaking tub. (They told me this was due to the low occupancy in the hotel. Huh?) Each time someone flushed a toilet or took a shower the water pressure would make a rushing noise through the plumbing loud enough to be heard in the main bedroom. I could go on but you get the idea. The Premier Room that I was assigned (Room 412) had very dated furniture. Not in a good English country house way but in an overused and confused decorator look. I wasn't hoping or looking for over-the-top but neither was I expecting a return to the 1980's. Honestly, I thought perhaps my expectations were too high so I invited a friend to visit my room and give me her opinion. Shocked may be a slight exaggeration...ok, maybe not. Even she noticed that the black and gold bedding was old and the chenille occasional chair was stained and dirty.

I know this is a 5 star property, but our order was messed up, soggy bacon, $6.50 for a cup of coffee and an $80 bill with 2 out of the 4 being from the kids menu. Nothing was exceptional. Three of us got the omelet which was good and I had french toast which was really good, but not that good! Anyway, turn down service was nice, but by 8 o'clock one night we came back to our rooms ready to put the kids down and it hadn't been done. Just a minor thing, but you would think they would know to do it early with a room with children. Also, the bathroom facet was loose and the toilet paper holder was looking as if it needed some TLC. Never did find the ice machine, but I think that is what keep us up part of one night. The doors to the rooms slam shut as well so everytime someone goes in and out you hear it. The coffee and tea are nice in the lobby, but what wouldn't been great is to have a coffee maker in the room! I will end on another positive note, the bottled water at the bedside was very nice.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Granite Bay, California", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious!\u201d", "Author": "MegAndJohn", "ReviewID": "UR14643543", "Content": "Beautiful and yet quaint setting..

King bed very commfy. 100% tiled bathrooms have nice double sinks, deep, deep tub, and a glass in shower. Very thick and large bath towels, and lots of bath amenities (tons of soaps/shampoos) along with fresh flowers in the bathroom too.

Had drinks in --The Bar-- and breakfast in -The Restaurant-. Both places very nice and efficient, and suited to the Top Drawer fashion of the Mansion. Wife had a massage. She also did a AM work out in the gym,, all good she said. The room rate I paid for a -deluxe king- was 395/nt,, and since they did not have any 2 bedded/double rooms,,had to get a rollaway. The rollaway was a bit steep at 40.00/night. Thought they should eat the $40,, but I did not say anything,,just paid it. The only room negative was the TV. It was the --old-- standard 24 inch tube TV. In my home I got rid of the tubes a year ago and I'm spoiled to the HD/flat panel LCD sets. I've been to a ton of nice hotels (Ritz/ Four S.

The rooms were decorated well, and offered the services you would expect of a fine hotel - minibar, internet, turndown, etc. They were also the right size. I don't think you can have too big of a room, but you certainly can have a room that is too small. For example, the Four Seasons in Maui is too small for the money, and perhaps the Halekulani - but the Four Seasons in Lanai is huge and the Mansions rooms are similar, but not as big as the FS Lanai.

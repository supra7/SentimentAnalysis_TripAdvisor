I read enough reviews to not book a courtyard room. We did walk through the courtyard hallways to go and look at the pool area. Just seeing the hallways made me so thankful I didn't book one of those rooms. My husband and I stayed in the Luxury Tower on the 10th floor, non-smoking, king-size bed and nice marble countertops in the bathroom. It had another sink and large mirror before you go into the bathroom which is nice for bathroom privacy if someone else needs the sink. We had a nice view of the mountains to the right and the strip to the left. The parking garage was our view below and across from us. There was a large tv which was nice but would've been nicer if you could get more channels. The bed was wonderful, so comfortable as well as the pillows. Our room was cleaned very well. I do believe they need to update the tubs, the outside of ours was stained and the bottom still had the residue from stickers that were once on it. Endless hot water, something I have trouble finding in many hotels, but found it here. Great places to eat with great prices. My only grip is the only way to the buffet restaurant was through all of the smoke in the casino. I do agree the shuttle does not run often enough and they need to inform all of the staff that give out information, over the phone, where exactly the shuttle picks you up, not at the Forever 21, where taxi and other shuttles show up, but BEHIND it in the parking garage. Also on the way to the hotel from the airport, we asked how much it cost for a cab to the strip and were told it was $40. They make you feel like they are saving you so much, (that you end up giving them a tip), the shuttle being \"free\", which it isn't because it's included in the \"resort fee\" of $16 + tax per day, no resort that I could see. It was $12 for a cab. I don't understand why they don't go up on the price of the rooms, to cover the \"resort fee\" instead of sneaking it in on people at the last minute and tell people, \"oh, that fee includes your internet, your phone calls, the gym, shuttle and the use of the pool\". In Texas, that's not a resort fee, that's what you pay for when you pay to stay at the hotel! Plus in most cases, you at least get free coffee and usually a free breakfast. Nothing is free here, I'm surprised you don't pay to ride the elevator. (oh wait, guess that's included in the \"resort fee\" LOL) The pool area doesn't even deserve a review. I guess it does meet the requirements for the definition of the word \"resort\", just not what we envision when we hear the word.

There is smoking in the casinos, at the slot machines, at the table games, and on the streets: smoking, smoking, smoking. The only places I didn\u2019t see smoking was in the restaurants and on the non-smoking floors of the hotels. If you smoke, you will probably love the Palace Station. When you first walk into the hotel, you immediately smell the smoke. Years of in-house smoking have embedded the smell deep into the carpet and walls. It is a smoker\u2019s paradise. People smoke while playing casino games and while just walking around inside the casino or outside. It seems that all casinos allow smoking while people gamble, but there are other casinos that do a better job of keeping the smell of smoke out. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a person who hates the smell of smoke, I would suggest that you plan a vacation to a city other than Las Vegas. As far as the Palace Station itself is concerned, it was a decent 3-star hotel. We got a free upgrade. The room was large and comfortable. The elevators were fast and efficient, although there was one that shook a lot as you went up or down. There is a grand buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is cheap and nice, though the most direct route to the buffet is to run the gauntlet of smokers in the casino. The main negative factors of staying at the Palace Station were: (1) Hidden fees. Every guest must pay a $16+ fee per day for hotel services (shuttle bus, internet connection, etc.), whether you use them or not. We didn\u2019t know about this fee until we arrived. With the addition of the fee, I realized that I could have gotten a hotel on the Strip for the same price. (2) Not located on the Strip. If you book a hotel on the strip, you can walk to most shows. However, at the Palace Station, you\u2019d better have a car. The Palace Station has a shuttle bus, but it runs so infrequently as to be practically worthless. (3) \u201cBusiness Center.\u201d The business center had two computers, but you have to pay to use them. The cost is 55 cents/minute with a minimum $5 charge. (4) Disadvantageous blackjack rules. At this casino, the dealer must hit a soft 17. This rule means that the dealer will get better winning hands, and the casino will take more of your money. I recommend trying to find a casino where the dealer must stand on a soft 17. There are a few casinos here and there that have that rule. If you can\u2019t find a casino that has that rule, then it\u2019s a good idea not to play blackjack at all.

We were upgraded to the main tower and I glad we did because the rooms at the courtyard section looked like an average truck motel. Our room was very spacious, and at night or in our case in the early mornings had an awesome view of the strip. The casino although it is smaller than the ones on the strips or even at downtown, had all the slots, table games, and amenities that you would find in any Vegas casino. My husband made like $4,000 during the weekend playing craps, he mentioned that the poker room was below average with some of the rudest dealers in the business. Moving to the slots, I found that the machines at the Palace pay way more often that the ones on the strip. We watched the Super Bowl at their Mexican cantina and we had a blast. A pitcher of beer was $4 and the shots $1, plus the lady bartender is one of the best in the city.

They also had specials that were worthwhile. Now that I\u2019ve said everything good I can say about Palace Station Hotel, let me give you my review. First you should know that the price you get from Hotels dot com is not the price you\u2019ll end up paying. Be very careful to check the \u201csmall print\u201d. There is a mandatory Resort Charge of $16.95 a day. This might be worthwhile if you don\u2019t rent a car and need a shuttle to and from the airport, you have to have Wi-Fi in your room and you also are doing business and need copy and fax service. Otherwise, you have no choice but to pay the fee even if you have a non-refundable pre-paid reservation. After arguing with the front desk that I didn\u2019t need any of the services, they took $5.00 a day. When we went over to the casino it was Smokey and very dated like the rooms we were in. It reminded me of years ago when you would go out for the night and when you came home and took off your shirt, it had this smell of cigarettes on it. I stayed in the courtyard rooms. The best thing in my opinion would be for the Palace Station to implode the Courtyard buildings. They have a card system to let you into the building and they didn\u2019t always work. The view from the room was the wall from the part of the building. We did have a \u201cpeek-a-boo\u201d view of the pool. The ceiling is \u201cpopcorn\u201d style. There was no bedspread on the bed and the blanket was lightweight. The room was cold. They do have a heater in the room and it did eventually warm up the room. The TV was an old analog style TV and the remote looked filthy. The walls were so thin that we could hear the maid listening to the radio while she was cleaning the room earlier in the day and then was able to hear the whole TV show that the room next door was watching until 12:30 in the morning the night before we had a 5:00 wake up to make our flight out. I wouldn\u2019t stay at the Palace Station again and wouldn\u2019t recommend it to any of my friends.

The shuttle bus leaves very infrequently, so I wouldn't rely on that for transportation. The gym is lackluster and really sub-standard (like most hotels I guess), however, the lady at concierge was nice enough to call up a health club and arrange some complimentary visits to the gym which was great! Showers/Bathrooms in the Courtyard rooms were a bit crappy.... but not bad enough to cry about. The Pros: They reduced the resort fee to $10 a night since I was there for 12 days, however, I upgraded to the tower room due to the Courtyard rooms being really average and motel-like (which was $20 extra per day).

The hotel is offering a shuttle every 1.5 hour down to the Strip which brings you to the Fashion Mall, directly located opposite Wynn and Encore hotels. Furtherone the hotel offers a shuttle running up and down to the airport in a convenient way. The entrance of the hotel is easy and the staff at the front desk is very friendly and helpful. The hotel has about 1000 rooms and suites divided in three categories: courtyard rooms, located around the swimming pools and parking lot. Tower rooms with views over Vegas and suites, also located in the towers. Prices vary upon season, weekday and occupancy. For example during CES (Consumer Electronic Show, mid january prices are higher). This was my fifth visit to Vegas and as well my fifth stay in Palace Station, although this is my first review for this hotel. I booked a suite which gave a nice view over Las Vegas. I used mainly the Feast buffer for breakfast ($4.99) and for dinner ($7.99); the choices are widespread and the food tastes nice. There are chefs around to have your wishes cooked directly like you wish. There are also other choices for restaurants to make in the Palace, but that's everyone's choice. The rooms are clean and well organized; the house-keeping does a good job. As mentioned earlier you have good access to the Strip by shuttle, and even the times are not convenient to you, you can take a taxi always for about $11. If there's any problem, the front desk is more than willing to help you. If you are looking for a nice, cozy place, please choose Palace Station; they offer good rooms for more than reasonable prices. It it really worth.

Had they been honest and told me about the charge ahead of time and included it in the room rate, I would have never chosen this hotel as there were many of a much better value when calculating the total cost.

Pillow top beds, granite counter tops and tile showers and large flat screens really improve the look and comfort. Good temp control, Plenty of free parking, decent eateries (I suggest the Steamer Bar or Cafe) The hotel caters to locals and mature visitors. The Fair: No tub and the tile shower floor does not drain well and must be a chore to clean, if it is. No coffee maker and the casino while better than it use to be is still dark, low cealing and only ok air flow with a good deal of cigarette smoke. Buffett can be a deal at $5-10 but only so so quality. Stick with the breakfast for $5. The Poor: Only the tower has been upgraded. The Garden rooms remailn in 1980. Not much of a Pool area. Even in the tower the walls and door are still thin and noise carrys well. I could hear what sounded like pipes and the elevator all night as well as my neighbors using the Facilities and tv. There is also a less than $20 daily resort charge for things most of us will not use (shuttle, pool) also the internet charge is significant.

The maid service was excellent, keeping my room clean, bed changed, and plenty of coffee. The room temperature was 71F(21C) when I entered the room and I found it too warm, and reset it to 60F(16C), keeping the fan on low for much of my stay. I have back issues, and found the bed to be very comfortable and contours to my body. It was a 'Serta Presidential Suite' pillow-top mattress that was put there in April 2011. I checked the labels. The $14.99 Hotel fee includes the high speed internet. When you turn on your computer it will say there is a $5.99/day charge. I talked to the front desk about this and was told that it is charged to your room but then taken off your bill when you check-out. And they did take it off. But do remember to mention that to them when you check-out to make sure it happens. You also get a daily newspaper sitting outside your room door. It seems to be delivered around 2AM, although someone must have been taking mine as I didn't get one for the first 2 days of my 5 night stay. Convenient & friendly Shuttle service to and from the airport and Strip. The driver even helps by loading your baggage. The Buffet was plentiful and great taste. A good price as well.

My wife was supposed to have booked a luxury room in the Tower but booked a Courtyard Room by mistake. The Courtyard room was disappointing and really no different to any very average motel. Unlike motels however there were no coffee/tea facilities in the room, no fridge or microwave. On bookings.com it states the room had a safe, but it didn't. I was aware that apart from the reasonable room rate there was a daily charge of $15.99 covering high speed internet, a shuttle bus to the strip, free local calls etc. When you try and log onto the internet however it pops up a screen asking you if you want high speed internet access ($12.99 per day) or slow speed internet access ($5.99.) I ring reception and ask what this means. Two phone calls later I find out that the $15.99 daily charge includes slow speed internet but if you want high speed access it will cost you another $12.99. So the claim that the daily charge includes high speed internet access is not true. I just find it annoying that anywhere these days is charging for internet access at all. There is no breakfast included at the hotel as one reviewer stated. The hotel is supposed to be about 600 yards from one end of the Strip and three miles from the other. We decided to walk to the strip. Now, I do understand walking anywhere in the States is an alien culture and never easy but you cannot walk directly to the Strip as it involves going over the freeway which pedestrians cannot do. Ended up walking three miles to the other end of the Strip. So we learnt that it makes sense to use the free shuttle bus included in the daily charge. Next evening we went to get the shuttle bus at 8pm and arrived 5 minutes before. There were about a dozen other people waiting for it. At 8.10 no sign of the bus, I go to reception and get told it may be late. 8.20 still no bus, I go to reception and get told if it was full it would have left early. So I ask if it will come back and do a second trip for all the other people waiting? No, it won't. So we have to get a taxi to the Strip. On a positive note the casino is as good as most on the strip. Alot of non hotel guests obviously come to the casino making good use of the large free car park. We had a very nice meal in the pasta restaurant in the hotel which was also very reasonably priced. Eating on the strip is very expensive. The room was clean and well serviced.

Fortunately, a business contact got me an upgrade to a Tower room, which had a great view of the Strip, big flat-screen TV and was definitely the better room. Big plus was the location, which allowed faster driving alternatives to the crowded I-15 and Strip routes, both to and from the Sands and elsewhere around town. Culinary highlight at the Palace Station was the Oyster Bar, which has great New Orleans-style seafood dishes and all-counter seating, good when dining alone. Didn't play much in the casino, basically bought a Starbucks and relaxed at the keno lounge area. All in all a positive experience.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque NM", "Title": "\u201cI highly recommend Palace Station\u201d", "Author": "ErnieE415", "ReviewID": "UR119238280", "Content": "Palace Station is a very nice a pleasant place to stay in Vegas...The towers rooms are nice, big , and very clean..

They also have a jacuzzi pool.

The rooms they put us in were in the \"Courtyard\" area in the back of the hotel. This was, bar none, one of the absolute worst dumps I have had the pleasure of staying at, anywhere in Las Vegas. I was coming from Harrah's, and was very disgusted when I saw this place. The \"Courtyard\" rooms are nothing more than a modified \"Motel 6\" or \"Super 8\" type buildings. This is a very old structure, which is musty, and is many years old. It is a two-story building with no elevator; only stairs, so be warned if you have lots of bags. It was like they took an old Motel, and moved it in back of the Palace Station tower. It just did not belong there. Upon arrival, both rooms that I had reserved did not have functioning Internet access. One of the rooms had a very strong \"medicine\" type odor. The second room smelled very musty, and like it was a former smokers room. I had requested non-smoking. The carpet was worn, and also had several stains on it. The front desk was told to change both rooms, at my request as they were unacceptable to stay in. The replacement rooms had working Internet, but were definitely not to the expectations you would find elsewhere in Las Vegas. Even though my reservation was for two nights, the rooms keys for both my rooms were shut off the following day. My guest and I were locked out of our rooms. Upon calling the front desk about this problem, their solution was to dispatch their Security guards to make sure we were supposed to be there. The Palace Station security guards gave us the third degree, and told us we needed to make the long walk back to the front desk to resolve the key problem even though we were not fully ready, or had taken a shower yet. Between the structure, casino/hotel clientele, and condition of this place, I should have known better. Palace Station is definitely the kind of hotel you would put into the \"budget\" or \"low budget\" category. I have stayed at many Motel 6 and Super 8 type places, and this one is about par, or sub-par with those types of places.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cPalace Station Vacation - Las-Vegas, NV\u201d", "Author": "Patricia M", "ReviewID": "UR118711197", "Content": "My wife and I are no strangers to Palace Station Hotel & Casino. We have stayed there several times with absolutely no problems at all. We have also stayed at Caesars Palace, RIO, MGM, Excalaber, Tropicana and Golden Nugget. I have probably forgot a few. We love staying at Palace Station, It is off the strip and like an Oasis all by itself, I always rent a car but there is no need to, they have shuttle service runing every 15min. to all the strip locations, also a free shuttle service to the airport. At check in my casino hoste checked us in right with no delay. The valet picked up our car and brought our bags in. They stored them until we were ready for them. A great thing they have for handicape people is they rent electric scooters, which I picked up one right awat. My wife and I went to our room and had a wonderful suprise. We called the bellman and he immediately brough our bags up to the room. After unpacking we went down to the Grande Cafe and had a wonderful meal. The food at the Grand Cafe, Oyster Bar, Ital. Rest, and the Broiler Rood are all EXCELLENT. The Prime Rib with the bone in is like getting a side of beff on your plate and cooked to perfection. My wife could not eat 1/2 of her order but I did not eat the shrimp cocktail or the baked potatoe, or salad and I was almost able to finish the whole thing.(YUM YUM) The casino is most exciteing, the dealers keep you happy, they actually talk unlike most casino's they just deal the cards and that it. The cocktail waitress is very good, keeps your drinks full. The room service was excellent, we ordered Pizza and it was hot and excellent (the waiter must have run from the kithen because the pizza was so hot you could not pick it up) most days we have lunch at the Oyster Bar, You would think you were in Boston it is so good. I always had to have the clam chowder with a dozed raw oysters. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!! We had a wonderful time at the swimming pool, the water was warm and the service was excellent!!! You must have a pinacoloda and lay back and injoy the shade or sun which ever you wish, you think you were in the Bahamas. not much more I can say but the room was excelent, plenty of towels and shampoo, conditionar, tooth brush, tooth paste, bath crystals and so much more in the bathroom to list.

Set outside the strip, at first glance this looks like anyother city hotel; faceless, non-descript concrete and dour design. It's key attraction is (as you might expect in Vegas) its casino. Set near to the main highway and on the flightpath to Vegas airport its more akin with a Heathrow Airport hotel than any desert break. As you walk through the doors be sure and inhale the stale cigarette smoke that greets you in the lobby and be sure to hold your breath as you walk by the several smokers sat outside. Banal music wafts into your ears as you enter the place. Inside, it's easy to see gaggles of staff just standing around being busy doing nothing - perhaps the whole day through. (sorry to wax lyrical) Approach the desk to book in and some lady tells you that your room isn't ready- when you ask how long she says that she has no way of contacting anyone and can't tell anyone to make it sanppy as the guest is waiting. Come back in 30 mins. when she then tells you its still not ready but she can put you in a queen sized room at no extra charge: Excuse me, I 've reserved and paid for a King sized room! I speak to my partner and then attempt to go back to her - she ignores me and serves someone else. So, guess what?, yep! I went to another lady who without being asked suggested she make a call to find out the status of my room (What was that about - that other lady told me - she had no way of contacting anyone)?? Well, the room wasn't ready, but hey wait a minute - she had a look on the computer told me it wasn't a problem there was another king in the same block that would do nicely. But then a slight sting in the tail - I would have to pay just under $17 dollars a day for \"...use of the amenities...\" Strange I didn't recall being told this when I booked on line. Amenties? oh yeah, thats the use of the pool, the internet and shuttle bus - that kind of thing. Well by this time you're well and truly hooked; wriggle as much as you want, but you can't get away. The room was clean but the net curtains had to remain drawn all of the time as our room looked directly onto the multi storey car park. If I had been Batman, Robin, Superman or some other comic hero I could have jumped the gap between the two - thats how close it was. The room was otherwise comfortable and satifactory There was, however, one saving grace: The Cafe Grande on the ground floor was excellent, staff courteous and friendly and the food first class.

The internet is indeed free thye tell me but he has to agree to the $5.99 fee in order to acess it, big promise that it won't be charged, we'll see. As a note there are two choices, $5.99 and $7.99 if you click on the $7.99 you will be charged. The girl at the front desk explains that is the cost for their non complimentary wireless. OK, confusing? First of all when you are paying 14.99 resort fee to get your wireless I'm not sure you can call it complimentary. Final note he had to call down three times to get the coffee pot brought up. If you want a refrigerator in your room that is an extra $10.00 a night.

Ask for a tower room. These rooms are very nice. The hotel is an older one, with decent rooms in the tower section. My only complaints about my tower room were the pillows (VERY thin) and the shower. The pillows were so thin, I had to stack 3 of them to get any sort of support. You may want to bring your own pillows if you like any sort of head support during sleep. My other complaint about the room was the shower. I laughed, because normally people complain about the lack of pressure and lack of hot water. My complaint was the excessive pressure (felt like scalding hot needles being shot at me) and the extremely how water from the shower head. I actually had to run the water for about 5 minutes to allow it to be cool enough for me to stand under the shower. God help anyone with a sunburn! The room was fairly clean and houskeeping was very accomodating. Cigarette smoke was not an issue in my 10th story room, nor was casino noise, although, I would imagine anyone with a \"courtyard\" room would have suffered from both smoke and noise from the casino. BEWARE OF THE RESORT FEE! This place charged me $17 per night for \"complimentary\" things such as free wi-fi (available only downstairs and not in rooms), shuttle to the airport/Strip locations, use of the swimming pool and fitness room, local phone calls from the room, daily local newspapers, etc. It seems to me that if such things are truly complimentary, one should not be paying for them. I drove my own vehicle and did not need shuttles anywhere, have a smart phone (with internet, local, and long distance calling capability, as well as getting news) and did not need or use free wi-fi, did not use the small/cold swimming pool (which a young boy jumped out of and urinated next to it as his adult family members watched), and did not use the small/inadequate fitness room. I have stayed in nicer and newer casinos (Southpoint, Suncoast, etc) and didn't pay nearly as high a resort fee for \"complimentary\" services. On a positive note, the parking areas were dilligently patrolled by armed security guards, and I felt my vehicle was relatively safe from people breaking into it. The casino was not bad. This is considered a \"locals\" casino, and consequently, some, shall I say, INTERESTING, people were there. The slots were very stingy, although I actually came out ahead by about $50. (I play slots for entertainment, not necessarily to win.) I was able to play $100 for about 8 hours during the course of my stay (about 3 hours a day for the 4 days I was there). Cocktail waitresses seemed to be pretty good about making their rounds while I gambled. Be forewarned - the casino floor is poorly ventilated and cigarette smoke was quite thick. I am not a smoker and during my meals inside the casino, I tasted/smelled the smoke while eating. There is an excellent pasta eatery inside the casino, as well as several other decent/reasonably priced establishments. I did not have any children with me, although I saw many kids, ranging from toddlers to teenagers.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancaster, California", "Title": "\u201c\"We're Coming Back!\"\u201d", "Author": "TeresaY4", "ReviewID": "UR113280727", "Content": "I've stayed here a few times in the past and have only had a problem on check out once.

I arrived at 10:30 PM and valet instructed me on what to do. Got it done with no problems. I have a property in Las Vegas that I lease out so I come to the Las Vegas area several times a year. The Palace Station is off the strip, not a whole lot of traffic that you would normally see on the strip, which makes it a more comfortable setting for me and my wife. The Cabo Mexican Resturant was also superb as usual. Great service, great food served in a very timely manner. Slots were loose and won a little money. The Feast Buffet was great for a good breakfast, lots of items to choose from and fresh selection to choose from. My Tower Room was on the 11th floor with a spectacular view! To me it was just like a mini-suite, very spacious and loved the bed and TV! The casino comped me $15 for slot play and also a mailer was sent to me for a free Meal at the Feast Buffet. If your considering staying any where in Vegas take it from me the Palace Station \"has it right\" from the moment you arrive until you leave!

Station Casinos, which owns Palace Station, also has a great Player's Club program, which rewards you with free rooms, food, slot tournaments, entertainment, etc. One \"must do\" experience in Palace Station is eating at their Oyster Bar, located right in the middle of the casino. They use the freshest ingredients, and the menu is extensive and delicious! Their many other restaurants are satisfying as well, but my all-time favorite is the Oyster Bar. The casino is top notch, with many of the newest and most popular machines (locals, remember?). I won a $2,000.00 video poker jackpot this last trip, which made me very happy! I later saw a gentlemen playing a \"China Mystery\" penny machine get a $6,910.00 jackpot (rain on my parade!!). I can't figure out how he won that much, but I will be trying to figure it out during my next visit there (June slot tournament). Overall, nice rooms at a decent price, great restaurants and plenty of different casino options make Palace Station one of my favorite Las Vegas destinations.

Was told there was nothing they could do unless we left the room for an hour? at 9 pm with a sleeping kid? Instead me wife kept her sleeve up at her face all night long.... not pleasant. The Food: The Grand Cafe has decent food. In 4 meals, 3 were very good, one was not good. We got their Prime Rib twice, but one time the meat was flavorless and tough, the 2nd was flavorful and tender. But when ordering food togo, the host/cashier was rude and even though I was sitting right there waiting, I had to ask for my food (they said 15 min, asked after 25) and it was there at the counter, but she never told me. Maid Service: We only got it once, and they did not replace cups or give us enough towels that we had to call and ask for more. Not good. Getting no help with a broken TV and smoke smelling room killed our experience here. I don't think the service here is good, and they don't seem to care that they amke you unhappy.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "CharlotteTravel11", "ReviewID": "UR100294237", "Content": "We enjoyed the stay here at Palace station.

The desk staff was polite and helpful. As is typical in Las Vegas, smoking is allowed in the building. I'm not sure what they are doing at the Palace Station, but the ventilation must be one of the only things upgraded as you really could not smell that disgusting/lingering burnt tobacco smell. The rooms in the tower are considered an upgrade. Not sure what the other rooms look like, but other reviewers have made comments. My room had a king bed, decent furnishings and decor and a very large flat screen TV. I thought the TV was overkill since the idea of going to Las Vegas was not to stay in the room and watch the limited channel selection. In fact, for the $14,95 daily convenience fee, I would expect a lot more channel choices, including free premium cable movies. Restaurant food was just slightly above average.

I asked at check out the next day and there were some renovations done to the tower rooms a year or two ago and the clerk said they gots lots of thumbs up from guests so told her to add mine to the list as I was very plesantly surprised as had been expecting a bare bones room with a cheezy western decor from 1982 and worn out highway motel sort of feel but it was anything but that. Despite the location a little way off the Strip there is a fairly regular hotel shuttle and I used it to catch a ride to the Fashion Show Mall and caught a taxi back from the far end of the Strip near Luxor and it was approx $12 one way so not a huge cost.

In small print, you will be charged a \"resort\" fee of $14.99 plus tax per day for services such as the free airport shuttle, newspaper in the tower rooms, internet (wired), health club, pool, etc. I think that the fees are stupid, but a lot of these hotels are struggling to make a buck.

However i was pleasantly surprised. Check in - There were 17 of us and it was quick and painless and they were very obliging even changing the rooms so we were all in the same area. Rooms - We all had courtyard rooms and found them to be clean and functional. All had a hairdryer a TV, WiFi, toiletries. Rooms were cleaned every day and towels changed if required. We were on the outside of the hotel next to the freeway but noise was minimal. Our room was probably located furthest from the lobby but we could park our van almost outside the room so we had no problem. Even if we didn't use the van it's not THAT much of a walk to the lobby as highlighted by some reviews. Swimming Pools - There are 2 pools the difference being is that one is heated and the other is not. However it was in the 100's when we visited so the colder pool was a welcome relief. they were never too full and if anything were under used. Towels are provided at the pool. Eateries - We used most of the restaurants and found them cheap and plentiful, the staff were always pleasant. If you are going to use the buffet make sure you get rewards card as you get it cheaper. The buffet sometimes gets very busy so you have to time it right. Also make time to eat there as there is soooo much food to choose from. Fitness Centre - the gym is small and there was a few pieces of equipment broken but it wasn't never too crowded that you couldn't get in there. Please Palace fix your machines!!! Transport - Palace provide a bus to take you to the strip/airport. The drivers are very accommodating (he dropped us off at every Terminal when returning to the airport), they are very knowledgeable and cheery! The only down point is the smoke in the casino but seeing as we didn't go to gamble it was only a minor point.

For the low-low price of $37 per night (plus tax and all that stuff) for a tower room, the Palace Station is an absolute steal.

The breakfast buffet is good value (there was a weekday morning special available for $4.99 when you checked in on my recent visits), but for dinner, I'd recommend you try other restaurants within the Palace Station or buffets in some of the Strip casinos or larger \"off strip\" Casinos, as the selections are pretty basic and lack a bit of flair.

I visited the pool several times and found it relatively uncrowded with enough shade and sunny areas to satisfy everyone. It was a bit small, but large enough to apparently handle the number of guests since it was never crowded. To reach the pool, you have to walk through the courtyard facility. It is NOT nearly as long a walk as some reviewers have made it out to be. Some of the rooms are actually quicker to reach than the tower rooms. To reach it, you only have to walk through the front fringe of the casino and the exterior walk from the main building is only about 30 feet. Reading some reviews led me to expect a long walk through a desolute back lot, which was not the case. You're basically crossing what looks like a maintenance drive between the main hotel and the courtyard. All rooms open to interior halls, which basically circle the pool areas. I looked in several rooms which were open for maid service as I passed, and, while not as nice or large as the tower rooms, they did not look any worse than a Holiday Inn. I can't vouch for their cleanliness, but there were no obvious signs like bad smells or trash sitting around to imply that they were not maintained just as well as the tower. In fact, since they're all smoke-free, the hall smelled better than the tower. I would not hesitate to grab the low rate on a courtyard room in the future. Buffet was mediocre at best, both breakfast and dinner (and I'm not usually picky). On site restaurants have some reasonable prices and specials though, so you're not locked in to eating at the buffet every meal. Check-in/check-out was a breeze with no line on check-in and express checkout over your TV. If you plan on eating breakfast in the buffet during your stay, take advantage of the special rate at check-in to save a buck over even the reduced Player's Club rate. Do get a free Player's Club card though, even if you don't intend to gamble enough to earn any comps, because you will save money on the buffet by flashing it. And, high speed internet is free for the lower speed, which is on par with the speed of a DSL line. Free shuttle to airport and strip, but it only runs about every hour and a half.

Conversations in adjacent rooms can easily be heard, as the walls are paper thin. If you're used to an HD LCD or plasma TV, these rooms only have regular television sets. The last two nights were spent in the Tower on the 8th floor. These are very nice quiet rooms. The furniture is new and tasteful with a nice desk and internet connection. There is a large dresser to put your clothes and a nice-size closet, as well as a 50\" HD LCD TV, large bathroom with lots of granite counter space, pleasantly-set central air conditioning, sunny with nice window view of city, but again bed comfort was fair and I did miss a coffee pot. The hotel has a very nice large casino (smoking) and bingo hall. In my opinion, the bingo buy-ins are too high and the pay-outs too low. The slots were tight and seemed just to tease. I did not see one person win any significant amount of money the whole time I was there. Although the floor waitress did come around quite often bringing drinks which kept me very happy!

However, the mashed potatoes were delicious! No splurging on the butter! The Buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner has a fairly good selection, but food is definitely not top quality; ok if average is what you're expecting. Price is not bad. Overall, the stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. Staff was very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend booking a room in the Tower, unless by the time you read this review, you\u2019ve found out the Courtyard rooms have gotten an upgrade or if the Courtyard rate is substantially less than the Tower rooms.

We upgraded to a premium tower room, and a savvy traveler is well aware of the $17.00 fee that they charge, we knew about it before we arrived. We went to our room to drop off our bags. The elevators were clean and well maintained. The hallway to our room was bright and smelled very clean. Our room was well stocked and very nice, with two queen sized beds, a beautiful newly renovated bathroom (with AMAZING toiletries, I stole as many as I could get away with lol!), clean carpet, white bedsheets. A large screen tv with lots of good channels turned out to be a saving grace, as the weather was so cold and windy when we were there that we spent a bit more time than we normally would have in our room. It was quiet, but we had some noisy neighbors one or two nights (my hubby would disagree, of course he didn't hear a thing lol!!) The casino was typical of what you would expect, but if you enjoy the mayhem of a Harrahs/Excalibur/MGM type casino, you may not enjoy the Palace Station casino as it's much more laid back than any casino on the Strip. The buffet was a good deal price-wise, and had many selections, but it became a little repetitive. They could switch up the menu items more. Cabos Mexican restaurant was great - authentic and great service. We didn't try the Oyster Bar, but it was always packed so they must have been doing something right. The broiler resaurant was comfortable, we went there on our first night and it was tasty, well priced food - nothing spectacular.

All the bad reviews are correct!!!! We had the first room which had a sign in it that said a $250 cleaning charge for this room if you smoke in it. But it already smelled horrible. We could not take the smell in the room any longer than the first night! The hallway smelled bad too. We asked the front desk for a different room. They tried to up sell us for another $50 dollars a night for a room in the tower. We said no and then there was another room available for us in the other part of the hotel. We packed our bags and went to the new room. That room did not smell, but the shower head was so low that my wife of 5 feet 5 could not stand under the rainfall shower head without touching her head it. The shower curtain was too small for the already tiny shower and was impossible not to get the floor soaked!!!! The rooms look nice and the bathrooms look nice with the tile on the walls, but looks looks is not good enough when the smell starts to burn your nose. There are no coffee makers or fridges in the rooms. The first room had a high speed internet cord on the table, but the second room had the box for the high speed cable but no cable in the box!! The food at the casino is not good and is not cheap. I ordered a bottle of beer at one of the casino bars and was charged $3.50. That is more than what any bar in our home area charges. I thought the casino was suppose to be cheaper. The entire casino has a very very strong smoke smell from all the smokers. We went to some other casinos that are on the strip and not one of them had even a hint of smoke smell!!! Then at check out they tried to double charge us!!! We already paid with the travel agent. The double charges are still on the credit card, but the card said that the charges will be taken off once they recieve copies of our paperwork from the travel agent. Thank god for credit cards. The front desk staff was not overly friendly. We will never never never stay at the palace station again!!!!!!! It was not a good experience at all.

It may not be the luxury of the strip hotels but we prefer the quiet atmosphere and reasonable prices. There are options for accomedations. The tower rooms are newly remodeled and are similar to any higher priced strip hotel. The courtyard rooms are basic but nice and newly remodeled. The pools and jaccuzis are basic but nice, and stay open until 12am which is nice after a long day. There is a resort fee added on to the price of each night but still is a deal. Buffet is still the best deal in town. Basic selections but satisfying. Casino play is great and very easy to earn points for comps. Guests will have a better experience if they know that there is an additional nightly charge and understand that the courtyard rooms are not the strip luxury but still much cleaner and updated compared to any downtown hotels. I reccomend asking for a courtyard room facing the pool areas. Some outside rooms face a hotel delivery area so the location of the room will give you a better experience.

If you want to visit the strip a shuttle is available or a quick 5 min drive to the Sahara and a jump on the monorail will get you to anywhere on the strip you may want to visit.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cBack again--for the umpteenth time--and we still love it.\u201d", "Author": "beckylyn", "ReviewID": "UR45121120", "Content": "Our recent trip was just the two of us, but I've stayed here on trips that included our kids, girl vacations with sister-in-law, sister and niece and a girl-boy trip with my two brothers for the Vegas Marathon. While much has changed here since the days when this hotel was the home of the 99-cent margaritas, it's still a great property and very good value. Recent reviews of this property have complained about added charges. When we began staying at this hotel, about 14 years ago, the airport shuttle and one to and from two locations on the strip (at that time, Fashion Show Mall and MGM) were free. During our last stay hotel staff explained that $10 per day in fees were added to the room to cover the shuttle costs to and from the airport and Fashion Show Mall only. I wasn't shocked because on recent trips to Los Angeles we saw similar shuttle charges and on the East Coast some have eliminated weekend airport shuttles altogether. Don't let that be a deterrent. The hotel has the two room types others have described here, known as courtyard rooms and as tower rooms. While both types of the rooms have similar furnishings, the types are different as night and day. Tower rooms have full baths, courtyard have showers only. Look carefully at bed types offered. True there are not refrigerators, but those are hard to come by, in Vegas. Our recent stay was in a tower room where the beds were comfortable and the furnishings and decor very up to date. The bath toiletries were high quality Tarocco products, including the whole line of bath and body items. The restaurants are good and varied. Our faves are the Guadalajara and the Feast buffet restaurant on the second floor. There's also an Irish pub for some live music with your ale. Their loyalty program awards members assorted meal coupons for food and drinks in the restaurants and pub -- collect them from the rewards desk in the casino after check-in. As for the facilities, unlike some reviewers who boast that they don't work out on vacation, I usually use the gym, the pool and often go for an easy run right out of my hotel. The off-strip location allows runners to take advantage and head out into a residential area for an easy 3-miler in the early-morning mild temperatures. I also use either of the hotel two pool areas, one of which includes a warm spa so even in winter, there's a place to go for a little sun. Did I mention the casino? I love this one. And while we always head out to other casinos, we end up back here at the end of each day for play. So though the 99-cent margaritas may be gone, this place is still a good deal among Vegas many hotel options.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cDo your homework\u201d", "Author": "MommyMoneySaver", "ReviewID": "UR42543453", "Content": "My partner and I were looking to go to Vegas for spring break and I have read through ALOT of tripadvisor reviews. After waiting till the last min to book we choose Palace Station. I have to admit I was a little scared after reading some of the reviews. We wanted something that was going to be nice but not break the bank (after all who wants to spend all their money on the room and have no money to do anything when you get there). While reading online and looking at pictures I saw that there were two different types of rooms courtyard and tower. We wanted something nice so we picked tower. There is a huge difference in these rooms. If you want Motel 6 then go with the courtyard rooms but if you want better then go with the tower rooms. We did take a cab from the airport which I don't recommend. It was around $25 and we stood in line for about 30 mins waiting our turn to get one. We would have taken the free shuttle provided by the hotel but it was going to be an hr before their next airport pick up. But we did use it to get back to the airport at the end of our stay and it was a comfortable shuttle with a very nice driver. I would recommend taking the third party shuttle service. Yes it stops at other hotels along the way. Judging from the time it took us to get a cab I would rather be inside an air conditioned shuttle riding along the strip than standing outside in the heat holding on to a weeks worth of luggage. If you do take the cab be sure to grab some of the free coupon books they really do come in handy. Back to the hotel review. We arrived at the hotel before check-in but where able to check-in right away. There was no line at all meaning no wait. Are room was three doors down from the elevator and on floor 15 (rm 15007) with views of Red Rock, north strip, and Freemont. As you can see from the pictures our room was wonderful. The only thing I would have liked to have is a frig but that is very hard to come by in Vegas unless you rent a suite. To get around that after getting ready in the morning we would fill up the bathroom sink with ice and put our drinks in there. By the time we would make it back to the room in the afternoon and evening our drinks would be perfect. Hotel staff was very nice and helpful. After getting to the room we tried using the safe and had a little bit of trouble so we called down to the front desk. With in mins security had shown up to help. If your bringing your laptop and want to store it in the safe make sure it\u2019s a 15 inch monitor or smaller. Mine is 17 and it didn't fit so I had to store it in between the mattress. While doing so I found a shocking surprise an adult toy. That is the only problem we had the whole week. We brought it up to the front desk and they removed the whole weeks resort fees ($54.25). Now that\u2019s what I call customer service. For the people that complain about the resort fee stop. If you would do your homework you would see that almost all the hotels have a resort fee. When you do your pricing add in the resort fee and compare. That's what we did. Plus unlike most of the strip hotels you get free internet in your room. Some of the other hotels charge a resort fee of up to $20 a day then up to $15 per 24hrs for internet. We didn't allow housekeeping to clean our room during our stay. But where about to change out dirty towels with the housekeepers in the hall with no problem. We didn't use the pool so I can't really comment on it but yes it\u2019s very small. I didn't really come all the way to Vegas to swim. We also didn't make use of the small gym but I would never workout on vacation. We did eat at four of the restaurants I would have to say subway and the cafe where the best to me personally. If your looking for a hidden gem of a restaurant try Ellis Island located behind Bally's. I got the tip from a fellow tripadvisor and they were so right. Great price, very large servings, and great taste. We ate there twice and both times we could not finish our food they give you so much. But look up Ellis Island on here and get the details. The casino isn't that grand but again I wasn't there to gamble. For the people who are worried about transportation there is a bus stop by the entrance of the parking lot. That bus will take you to the Sahara from there all you have to do is cross the street and grab the Deuce to any hotel along the strip or up to Freemont Street. $7 for 24 hrs I don't think you can go wrong with that. Jump on and off the Deuce as much as you like. The hotel does have a small gift shop style shop in the lobby. For those that are watching their pennies there is a 7/11 next door for snacks and drinks. The General store at the corner of Sahara and the strip is a great place to grab a bottle or two to keep in your room. So all in all we love this hotel and wouldn't bat an eye about returning. If you looking for a great place to rest after a long day of site seeing or long night of partying this is the place. We never had any problems with noise. If you\u2019re a high roller and need all the frills then this isn't your place. Either way do your homework. You can't be mad if you don't get high class service if that isn't what you paid for.

The place is small enough to feel at home in, easy to get around in and has been good value for the money. Sadly those days are gone and this was most likely our last time staying at this hotel. Unhappy wait staff, excessive fees and an air of depression seem to have taken over this hotel. I booked a room at the Palace for a few nights in their tower section having been here before, there was no surprise there. The rooms are perfectly fine, the bathroom was modern and clean and the bed was fine. When I booked the room, I knew that this hotel was charging a $14.95 daily fee but by the time we checked out, we were told that this 'little' fee had jumped to $16.95 a day. Since this now makes any value of the hotel slide down, why stay here when you can stay on the strip for the same amount of money and no travel time. We decided to eat at the cafe and wouldn't you know it, the hostess decided to walk off her post while there was a line of people waiting to get in. The guy ahead of us finally just walked away in frustration and we were about to do the same when another host came to seat everyone. The same thing happened again at the cafe the next day when the woman serving the take out counter had to also check out customers and we walked away rather than stand and waste our time. We then decided to eat at the Pasta restaurant there since it has always been a good meal. The food was still good but we noticed a few big changes, the meal was now minus the salad but the cost had risen by $3 bucks. If you wanted a salad with that meal, you had to add on another $3 bucks making a $10 meal cost closer to $20...not good. I must say that the only happy wait staff appeared to be in this place...everywhere else people just simply looked unhappy and it really left us with a rather depressed feeling about the place. Decided to top the night off with a starbucks coffee, but wouldn't you know it, the counter person there had disappeared and after waiting to get a cup of coffee, we just walked away again. All in all, this was a poor experience and one that I don't want to have again. From outrageous resort fees to dismal service, the Palace Station is just not in the running now.

However, this would be my first time planning the trip and the hotels. My wife (then girlfriend) and I booked a room at \"Palace Station\" because it was one of the cheapest hotels we could get for a Friday night and we wanted to save our money to put into a nice hotel for the next night... which would be our wedding night. We paid a little over $60 for the cheapest room we could get at the hotel and booked over \"Expedia.com\". Expectations were pretty low but at the same time we were hoping for the best and were excited for our first Vegas trip together when we arrived. When we found the hotel,we were a little disappointed that it wasn't near the strip or even Fremont Street but from the outside, it looked like a Vegas style hotel so were happy. I skipped on the self park and let the valet take care of parking. On to the front desk, where we found a short but very slow line. I remember the front desk not being overly cheerful but just helpful enough. We were given a map to the room and were just a little confused when the directions lead us out of the hotel and casino... and into another building that appeared to be some sort of \"Motel 6\" or \"Super 8\"??? That's right, we were put into the infamous \"courtyard rooms\". Some people rave about how wonderful these rooms are for the price but let me tell you... these rooms just flat out suck. Okay, so the rooms are updated but the building itself and the caliber of people who stay in it are depressing and almost scary. This was the first lesson we learned about Vegas... NEVER book the lowest priced room on a travel site unless you KNOW FOR SURE there are no motel style buildings at the resort. \"Circus Circus\" and \"Imperial Palace\" also have motel style buildings for their guests who book the lowest rate. Anyway, we were fortunate enough to have only booked the one night and we decided to spend all of our time out of the room. We went back to the main building and decided to treat ourselves to one of those fabulous Las Vegas buffets. Unfortunately, we were at \"Palace Station\", so it wasn't so much \"fabulous\" as it was \"repulsive\". Yes, that's right, the buffet is absolute garbage and was filled with screaming unsupervised kids running all throughout the restaurant and rowdy middle aged folk who had probably had a few too many cocktails. Maybe it's cheaper if you're a slot club member but we paid about thirty bucks total to feast on the slop they were serving. That was the final straw for the \"Palace Station\"... we retrieved my car from the valet service and headed to the strip, where we spent the remainder of the evening before returning for some sleep. We woke up and checked out as early as possible and were on to what must be the polar opposite of the \"Palace Station\". A wonderful gem called \"The Signature\", where we spent our wedding night.

By no means am I one of these picky travelers that thinks anything less than the Belagio is \"slumming it.\" (Heck, I've never even stayed at the Belagio before!!) I got a wonderful deal through price |ine for a Sunday night stay (27.00 w/ tax). But there is the \"mandatory resort fee,\" which includes use of the pool, free airport shuttle, blah blah blah. By time I got dinged with the fees, it wasn't such a hot deal anymore. I could've stayed somewhere else and got a nicer room. The room... yeah, let's talk about that. This is obviously their low-budget travelers quarters. You have to walk outside from the hotel lobby into a separate building. Dingy corridors, squeaky stairs (sorry, no elevators!!!), and a few flickering lights here and there. Still... not terribly bad. I didn't feel \"unsafe\" or anything. But when I got to the room and opened the door and I was like \"OH MY GOD... WHO FORGOT TO FLUSH?!?\" There was this incredibly foul odor coming from the bathroom (I guess the drain was backed up? The toilet was empty and everything was clean.) Normally I would have requested another room, but I was exhausted from a 5+ hour drive and having had very little sleep. I cranked up the A/C on high and closed the bathroom door. The bed was comfortable enough, but the sheets had a few little mystery stains (they had been washed), but the pillows were brand new. Was this the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel? Mmm... no, not really. Was it the best? Definitely not! The staff was friendly and helpful (what little interaction I had with them during check in/out). And they even threw in a pack (box?) of those premium M&M's and a \"welcome kit\" at checkin. (OOHHHH!!! FREEBIES!!!) All things considered, make sure to read the fine print when you book here so you're not caught off guard. Yes, you WILL be charged a 16.95 resort fee for each day you're staying, regardless of whether or not you're using the pool or \"free\" shuttle. Scandal? Nah... That's sort of like American Airlines, JetBlue, Delta, etc. charging a \"Fuel Surcharge.\" It's just another way for them to offer a \"cheap up front price\" and then add on their little hidden fees at the end to help make their profit margins.

Normally, I stay at Wynn, Bellagio or Venetian, so I knew I was in for an adventure, at the very least. If your priority is cost for the room ONLY, then this might be the place for you. The advertised rate is lower than the actual fee you end up paying. The hotel adds on service fees and and taxes which raises the price more than $20 additional dollars per night. Even at the business rate of $39 per night, this place was not worth it! It is the SMOKIEST casino I have ever been in. Although I had a non-smoking room, the whole placed smelled like a dirty ashtray. A few good things: the rooms were surprisingly clean looking, and looked as if they had been recently updated. (I stayed in the Tower rooms at other reviewer's advice.) There was a flat screen television and a decent sized bathroom with hairdryer. There are limited options for eating. There is a Starbucks downstairs, but it only serves muffins and breads. The gym is tiny and minimal - same goes for the pools. The median age there was approximately 55 years old. Not a very lively or hip crowd, but the hotel does not advertise itself as such. There is a bar, but no dance club of any sort. A cab ride to the Wynn on the strip was about $11 before tip. I left Palace Station whenever I could, but after sleeping there for a few nights, I developed a \"smoker's cough\". Yuck.

On the last day of a four night stay, I again asked for a partial credit since we never used the pool. They refused and the curt reply was, \"Look at this way, today we are raising the pool fee.\" That means that with over a thousand rooms, the hotel is raking in $16,000 a day to maintain a pool that is used by only a few guests. The other problem was the greatly reduced shuttle service to the strip. On my first visit three years ago, the shuttle to the strip was hourly and stopped at the northern (Fashion Mall) and southern end (Tropicana) of the strip. Today, the shuttle starts service late in the afternoon at 4pm. Because the hotel is so far away from the strip, there is nothing to see except the busy roadway.

I had a flight the next morning and just needed a basic place to stay and relax for the night. I looked on several hotel sites and couldn't resist booking Palace Station for under $20. I was aware of a $10.85 amenities fee which included the use of the pools, fitness facility and high speed internet. I was okay with that because I did want to work out and use the internet, which would have cost me double or triple that amount in other hotels. I booked a courtyard room which was not a part of the towers. They require a little walking to get to. I didn't expect much but I felt the room far exceeded my expectations. In the entryway of the room is about an 8 foot section of tile. This is an area to keep bags if you would like. Off to the right is the bathroom. The bathroom is of average size, with a shower only. The showerhead was one of those really large rainfall type deals which was really pleasant for me. The bed was comfortable. The TV was a flatscreen, not the wall mountable type, but large and with a quality picture nonetheless. My room overlooked one of the pool areas. My room was on the second floor, and since I had a lot of stuff and there was no elevator in the courtyard rooms I asked a bellman for help. He carried all of my stuff, had straps going every way possible in order to carry everything. He was such a nice guy. Infact everyone at the property was extremely nice. I had a coupon for 25% off room service so I gave it a try. Room service prices were surprisingly high for this property. The food was just average and it took a while to get, so I can't suggest ordering room service. Overall the rooms were nice and clean and just what I needed for the night. I was so impressed with the property that I plan to stay there on my next trip. Their rewards program for gambling is very generous, so I would like to mostly play there in the future.

I was looking for an inexpensive room for 1 night and a Courtyard room at the Palace Station fit the bill nicely. The Courtyard rooms are buildings of 2-story motel-style rooms. They are all non-smoking (your credit card is charged $250 if you smoke in the room) and there are no elevators to the 2nd floor. There are a bunch of Courtyard buildings and a number of doors out to the parking area so you are not too far from your car. The pools & hot tubs are in the Courtyard rooms area. There is no garage near the Courtyard rooms so your car will sit in the sun & bake. The garage is on the opposite side of the hotel near the tower rooms. I was familiar with the hotel's layout and knew just where I wanted to stay. Room 1841 was perfect. On the 1st floor, near a door and my car, and not facing the parking lot. I did not have a view of anything but one of the other buldings but I did not care because the curtains stayed closed the entire time. Supposedly the rooms have all been recently renovated and my room seemed fresh & clean. No flat screen TV so the big 32\" (?) TV took up almost all the counter space in the room. The king size bed was very comfortable but the flat-as-a-pancake foam rubber pillows were HORRIBLE! Instead of new duvets and light bedding you have the old style heavy bedspreads.The heating/air conditioning floor unit worked fine and kept my room nice and cool. There is no closet, just an armoire with a few hangers & an iron and ironing board. My main complaint with the room is the bathroom. Whomever deisgned the bathrooms is a complete idiot!!!!! The lighting in the bathroom is not very bright, good luck trying to shave or put makeup on! There is a teeny tiny shelf over the sink for toiletries and that's all the shelf space available. The bars of soap are the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel and king-bedded rooms only get 2 small bath towels. Fortunately when I 1st got to my room there was a maid cleaning the room next door so I asked for more towels and got them no problem. The shower is very small (about the size of one on a cruise ship) and if you are taller than 5'8\" you will not be able to stand directly under the nice rainforest shower head. There was plenty of hot water & great water pressure. Some of the other reviewers mentioned problems with taxis, airport shuttles, etc. My recommendation - if you don't have a car & plan on going anyplace beside the hotel, then don't stay here! The Palace Station, as well as all off-strip hotels, are designed for the local Las Vegas population - ie, people with cars. Cars are so cheap in Vegas, rent one!!! Or else stay on the Strip where you can walk to all the casinos or take the Deuce bus. My other big problem with the Palace Staion, as well as many, many other hotels, not only in Vegas but all over the world, is the \"Resort Fee\". Palace Station charges a $4.95/night + tax ($5.40 total) Resort Fee for as far as I can see, practically nothing. The fee covers local calls, 800# calls, the airport shuttle, notary, copies & fax services & line passes to the buffet (means you don't wait as long to eat at the buffet). A bunch of nothing for people with a car & a cell phone. At check in I was presented with a form I had to sign acknowledging I would pay the Resort Fee & that I would be charged $250 if I smoked in my room. I challenged the Resort Fee charge as no where on my Vegas,com confirmation did it say there was a Resort Fee. After about a 10 minute discussion with his manager, the desk clerk checking me in came back to me & said they would waive the fee. It was not a lot of money, it is the principle of the thing. If a hotel wants to charge a Resort Fee (and I think the Palace Station would hardly be considerd a resort in anybody's mind!) then let them just up the nightly room rate by $5 and be done with it. The Palace Station is not my first choice of an off-strip hotel to stay In Las Vegas, but it was fine and I would stay there again if the price was right.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerville, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cSufficient\u201d", "Author": "ShannonSomervilleMA", "ReviewID": "UR20400900", "Content": "The Palace Station is a large hotel off the strip, with its own restaurant, casinos and free shuttle service. The rooms here are inexpensive, and the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. With its many conference rooms in the convention part of the hotel, and the quick setup-teardown jobs - it's a great place to hold a convention. I myself was visiting for the Las Vegas Bellydance Intensive. At the same time, there was a female body builder convention. There was enough space for everyone to co-mingle without ever feeling crowded. On the plus sides, the rooms are large and the tower rooms have expansive views of the city. The courtyard rooms are close to the two pools and hot tubs, which we used frequently. Pool-side food delivery was great. Our room was non-smoking and smelled fine. On the down side, there are only two pillows per bed and the blankets/sheets are not luxury-level as one might expect for a Deluxe room. With two of us in the room, we also felt that we ran out of towels quickly - I think there were only two big towels per room. Also, this hotel is not on the strip and it will cost around 15$ to get a cab to the strip. Cabs have to be called, as they do not stop here on their own, and can take up to 30 minutes to arrive. Be warned if you are going to the airport that you will have to plan ahead, or make sure you get on the free shuttle. The main lobby and casino area was another story. The combination of aromas between cigarettes, greasy food, and strong cleaning chemicals was often strong enough to make me gag. I did not find other casinos to smell this badly, although smoking seems to be permitted everywhere in Vegas. This is not an upscale casino - the machines are close together and it can be difficult to navigate through the casino if you are simply trying to get to the other side of the hotel. The food at this hotel is not the best. It is very average American style food, huge portions and prepared in a fattening manner. Maybe some people would consider this a plus. There was an oyster bar, but I would not eat oysters in an area that smelled as badly of smoke - it would ruin them. There was a Mexican, Chinese, and American food places. Most of the time, I visited the Starbucks, which was a godsend. The huge buffet always had lines and smelled too bad - I didn't want to eat there so I didn't even go inside. If you like trans-fats, high fructose corn syrup, processed food and factory-farmed meat, you might like the restaurants here. If you are here for the Las Vegas Bellydance Intensive, there are no grocery stores nearby and the hotel doesn't offer any healthy options. Do yourself a favor and bring along a supply of powerbars and sports drinks.

I had stayed several years ago but was not pleased by the hotel's shady pricing policy (they casually forgot to tell me about an \"Energy Surcharge\" that they were adding to the nightly room cost until it appeared on my credit card bill). When I couldn't book rooms on the strip in my price range, I decided to give the Stations another try. The room charge from their website was $34.99 per night so I booked two adjoining rooms for my party. On the reservation printout a $4.95 AMENITY fee appeared at the bottom of the page in microscopic print. Of course I never noticed the item since the print was so small and the charge didn't appear up on the same level with the room charge and tax information. It was only after I had travelled all the way to Las Vegas and was checking in that I found out about the charge! The hotel clerk drew this to my attention and clearly stated that I \"could dispute the charge and it will be withdrawn\". To top it off, the so called AMENITY charge was now, on the day of my check in, $5.99--due according to the clerk to tax. That increase represents a 20% tax and when I told the clerk he just told me that he doesn't make the rules but I could dispute this when I checked out. Moreover, this so called AMENITY FEE was charged to each room for every single night of our stay. Now what does that AMENITY FEE cover??: A telephone in each room so you can call the front desk, maid service or room service--you still pay for most telephone calls I believe; A coupon book (should be charged the lesser state sales tax rate not hotel tax on this) of which, even though we stayed four nights, we were only entitled to ONE per room per stay; the use of the hotel fitness equipment in a dinky dark facility somewhere in the tower and not close to our rooms; a shuttle to the strip during limited hours; and believe it or not, the possiblity of having Room Service should we choose to have it (no extra charge for room service, how convenient). What a RIP-OFF!! Every other casino hands out coupon books for free. As to the coupons, they offer a certificate entitling one to ten percent off a purchase at the gift shop, a ten percent reduction on a Palace Station Casino T-Shirt (oh yay!), a free drink at the bar and a coupon for playing a table game in the casino. Pretty standard coupons. Compare a Continental Breakfast from the hotel restaurant to the Room Service Menu and one can see a $10.00 service charge built into the price differential. How about the Fitness Equipment? Why not charge those who wish to use the facilty when they use it? Ditto the shuttle. So what, pray tell, are the amenities? When will Palace Station start charging for soap, toilet paper, shampoo and towels? BTW, the amenity fee of $5.99 was added daily to the daily hotel room and then tax was charged on the overall daily rate! So my original $4.95 is now increased to $6.59 by means of \"tax\" or it increased 33 % (wish my investments could do so well) and the room charge of $34.99 is actually $40.98. As to the rooms, Palace Station should make some improvements in their linens. Each bed was short sheeted. That's not so bad for children who are four feet tall or less, but a normal sized adult will struggle with that all night long. Towels are thin standard white terry and rough. We had to ask for a second bath towel each day as only one set came with my room. The sheets were clean but the pillows were not and the general room cleanliness needs to be improved. Luckily, the mattresses were clean and comfortable but not enough to outweigh the sheet problem. Well, when I was ready to check out I went to the desk to dispute the Amenity Fee charge and was told in no uncertain terms that by initialing that the clerk had told me about the amenity fee I had agreed to it! That is not what it says, it says that I Understand the fee which I certainly did. I understand that Palace Station wants the benefit of enticing customers with a low rate that they later jack up at check in.

I was to be charged $59.00 for the fourth night as the offer was good for 3 nights max. My flight from Tampa was over an hour late in leaving and I missed my connecting flight from Chicago to Las Vegas. United re-booked me to a 6:00 AM flight and provided a hotel for the night. I called the Palace Station from O'Hare and the friendly operator changed the arrival date and dropped the charge for the extra night. I arrived on Monday, 07/21 about noon and checked in. Check-in was slow, but a posted sign explained that check-out time was noon, and guests checking out would be given priority to those checking in before the 3:00 check-in time. Got a coupon book on arrival with a $5.00 match play, some two-for-one meal offers, and various discounts including the gift shop. The room was not overly large but tastefully decorated. Pillow-top matress. Nice, modern furniture and a giant flat screen T.V. which displayed a fuzzy, grainy picture. (All except the Station Hotel channels, which came through with amazing clarity.) In-room safe was locked, but security quickly opened it up for my use. The bathroom was very spacious, with granite countertops, a magnifying makeup mirror mounted to the wall. The shower was new tile with marble shelves and featured a very large \"rain\" type shower head that gave excellent volume and pressure. Shampoo and condtioner provided, of course. End table had a clock radio. No in-room coffee. I was plesantly surprised by the quality of the room and appointments. Much better than I expected. I ate at the buffet for lunch immediately, as I was famished from the trip. Food selection and quality was mediocre and totally ordinary. If there hadn't been a line at the Grand Caf\u00e9, I wouldn't have eaten there. After a long nap and some play in the Casino, I had dinner in the Grand Caf\u00e9, where I had the NY steak special for dinner. Excellent and well worth the price. This was one of a number of meals at the Grand Caf\u00e9, each of which was satisfying and reasonably priced. It's also not possible to go near the Grand Caf\u00e9 without staring into the refrigerated case in front to marvel at the beautiful pastry and cake creations that comprise a veritable museum display. I don't have a sweet tooth, normally don't eat desserts, but just looking at the cakes and pastries became a daily ritual for me. Who would have thought? During the last night of my scheduled stay, I awoke gasping for air, unable to breathe. I was able to call the emergency button on the house phone and security was swift in responding and accommodating to my needs. After a short time, rather than have them summon a paramedic, I took a cab to University Medical Center emergency room. When it became necessary for me to be admitted for tests and observation, I called Palace Station, and they were friendly and accommodating and allowed my wife arrive later in the day and extend our room stay indefinitely. The staff was friendly and helpful at every turn. I was released the next day after having been diagnosed with pneumonia, and now accompanied by my wife, spent a couple of more days while I recovered some strength before retuning home on Sunday, 07/27. (My four night, solo Vegas excursion ended up being a multi-city, seven day ordeal including a hospital stay.) My wife got the \"check-in special\" of two $3.99 breakfast buffets (she hadn't been able to talk to me before she checked in) so we had the breakfast buffet one morning. A repeat of the lunch buffet, so far as it went. Indifferent food, passable quality. Neither of us will make that mistake again. I had to tell my wife about the coupon book. I kept trying to figure out how all of it adds up to the \"$500.00 Value\" as printed on the book. I tried to estimate the value of everything, including the free cocktail at the Irish pub, and all I could do was tell my wife, \"Honey, don't you DARE spend $2,250.00 at the gift shop for a 20% coupon discount!\" I had dinner at Chang's, Palace Station's Chinese eatery. Good, standard Chinese selections reasonably priced from about $8.00 and up. On the whole, about the same as most neighborhood Chinese joints, if your neighborhood isn't New York, San Francisco, or Peking. My wife and I dined at The Broiler steak house one evening. The meat was very good, the salad bar was outstanding. We weren't dissatisfied, but certainly felt that the price was on the high end for the quality. I enjoyed playing in the Palace Station casino. It was large enough for plenty of variety in games and machines. The dealers were capable and friendly. Everything about the casino appealed to my low-roller needs. A daily paper at your front door is a nice touch. We normally rent cars, and since my wife rented the car when I was hospitalized, she did all of the driving. One of her comments at the end of the stay was, \"Wow! This is a great location. You're right near the Strip. You're near Downtown.

Played some poker, and while the game can be profitable you should know it is 80% locals who all seem to know each other. I spent alot of time at the unheated pool, there is another (heated) pool which I had no desire to check out. Pool area was nice, chairs were uber-comfortable and were always available.

My husband and I are in our early 50's. We are very picky!! We have overalled stayed at the Palace Station for the past 10 years, at least 16 times. We have even stayed a few nights at their sister place...The Red Rock Canyon, but Palace Station is our home away from home. My husband and I both travel alot throughout our jobs! We stay at all 5 star hotels, because they are paid for through our jobs. Palace Station matches them! Even better than the others. Reason being is because they care! They have everything ready for you when you arrive. We always check in through VIP, because we go through our hostess, Janet Anderson, who we have known now for over 10years. Their newly renovated Tower Rooms, are very lovely and comfortable. I always bring my added special rooms items such as candles, air freshner and CD player. We always win there! OK we are not High Rollers, not even close. We usually take an allowance of $2000.00 for play money for 5-7 days. We never...never...go under that! We have many times came back home with our money. Mostly we come with $500.00-$2,000.00 winning! We use our players cards, and usually don't have to pay for our food or our room. The Broiler, their upscale restaurant is to die for. Just their fresh salad bar will fill you up. Homemade rolls and bread. There are just not enough words to describe how much we enjoy ourselves when go! Vegas is fun, and it is what you make out of it! Security is excellent there! No one can go up the elevator without showing their room key. I mean day time and night time, when we have stayed there. Their two pools are small, but never overcrowded. We don't go to Vegas to swim, we go to gamble, eat good meals, and to enjoy ourselves. We do go to the pool everyday for 2-3 hours of sun, and always can find lounging chairs and tables and umbrellas. Excellent set up at their pools. Again, you make it out to be what you want it to be. As I said earlier, can't wait until August 30th.

Rooms The courtyard rooms are a step down from the tower rooms. They have been updated, but they are tight on space. This is the room to get when you want a fantastic deal in an updated OK room. The tower rooms are much better and I think stack up to most regular rooms on the strip. This is the room to get if you want to stay in a nice comfortable inexpensive room. Deals Make sure you get the coupon book at check-in. Good deals to be had. 25% off room service, buy one-get one free at Italian restaurant. Also, the newspaper that they leave at your room door M-Sat has a free glass of wine coupon. You can use more than one coupon. Ask for the food specials at the cafe - they have several of them off the menu. 3.99 all you can eat pancakes, etc. The buffet is a good deal and is good for the price. I recommend it for breakfast, lunch and brunch, but supper brings some low quality people. The Margaritas at the Mexican place are great and a good deal during happy hour. Food The food at the cafe, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, and Broiler places is great. The first four are high quality for a cheap price. You can't beat the Italian place when using your coupons. You will not be disappointed. Do not waste your money ordering appetizers. The entrees are huge. The Broiler is top notch, but not a cheap price. The seafood is flown in everyday fresh. Transportation I didn't mind being off strip. The shuttles that run every hour to the strip and airport are too convenient to not use. Gaming Most of the tables are $5 minimum which helps on the pocketbook. They have 25 cent full-pay dueces wild at the back entrance. You can find the strategy on the internet. The dueces wild at the two main bars in the middle of the casino pay just under 99%. Less payback, but continuous drinks and full points on your players card (the full pay does not give full points). They have a full pay JOB in the high limit area, but you'll need to spend $5 a pull to get it. The slots are a little looser than on the strip. They have two deck blackjack for $10 minimum without surrender and six deck for $5 minimum with surrender. This is the one to play since comps are much higher for the six deck than the two deck. The odds difference is negligible due to the six deck allowing surrender. Service I found everyone to be very friendly and the service to be higher than expected.

My bf wasn't too thrilled when I told him the hotel name. He had stayed there before it was renovated and didn't like it. I read the reviews and figured it wouldn't be too bad. I did bring my own extra bed sheets and room deordorizer as I have a sensitive nose for bad smells. First off, valet was horrible. We arrived at the front of the casino and went to the valet section. No one helped us although they were not busy at all. (We were the 2nd car.) We got out and started unloading our luggage hoping someone would notice and help us. Finally someone came and told us if we were checking in, we are quite a way from the hotel and for us to drive around to the side. When we did and arrive at the hotel check-in section valet, again no one helped us. Waiting a few minutes out I decided to check-in while my bf waited for valet. Check-in was a breeze. Person was friendly and nice although they wouldn't upgrade our room for an additional as they were \"solid booked\". We got the regular room. The regular rooms are off the hotel and in back of the casino. I thought it was a hassle to drag your luggage to go down the casino to get through a few doors and then get to the rooms. The room building is like an \"enclosed motel 6\".. The ceilings are pretty low and the building is a bit old. The hallways were stuffy and hot. Our room was on the 2nd floor which I believe is better than the first floor as the first floor seems to have too much foot traffic. Our room was extremely hot and stuffy so we had to turn the a/c on right away. It was quite small. and simple. Renovated and up to date. King size bed with two night stands and lamps. Across was a small desk, next to the desk was a 27' TV, (NOT FLAT SCREEN, it was old and huge) and next to the TV was a little closet to store your clothes. Bathroom was nice. Nicely renovated. I was impressed. Sink is pedestal. No space to put your toothbrushes or whatnot. There was a small shelf on top of the since right under the mirror. My only complaint would be the shower. It is a stand up shower however if you are taller that 5'8\" you might have to bend otherwise the shower head will hit your head, it is quite low. Also, the curtain hangs from the very top of the ceiling down to the very bottom of the shower making it quite dark in the shower w/ very little lighting. The shower stall is a bit small. I didn't stay around the casino b/c the cigerette smell and stench was soo bad. I'm not sure maybe the casino is a smaller casino? I don't have problems at other casinos but for some reason I couldn't stand the smell there so we didn't hang around there much. We had the buffet there the first day b/c it was cheap. They don't have a large variety - no seafood, pasta etc but for the price, it was ok. The waiting in line was a bit slow. We were like the 5th group in line and had to wait about 15-20 minutes just to get to the register. My bringing my extra bed sheets was worth it. The 2nd night while I was fluffing my blankets and saw a nasty stain on the blanket and got grossed out. Housekeeping will good. My towels were changed and bed was made when I returned back to my room. Overall, it was an ok stay. Next time I'd rather pay more for a better quality hotel. Will I recomment this hotel to a friend?

Looking @ the Palace Station website & especially the descriptions of the Tower Rooms, one would THINK the 'newly renovated' rooms included beds on par w/other hotels fully engaged in the 'hotel bed wars'. I can tell you from personal experience it is exactly the same bed as what is @ the Sunset Station. Exactly the same mattress w/exactly the same un-fitted bottom sheets (complete w/holes in them, btw!) & the flimsy mattress 'pad', both of which are guaranteed to end up in a wadded up knot in the middle of the bed the first time you turn over! And the 'duvet' pictured on the Palace Station website-that's also the blanket; nothing else on the bed or in the room! As a self-confessed hotel 'bed snob', I am VERY annoyed @ the desception this hotel practiced from this perspective. I will admit the bathroom @ Palace Station is a HUGE improvement over those @ the Sunset Station, however, the towels are exactly the same (rolled @ PS vs. folded @ SS). Oddly there isn't a towel bar for hanging of bath towels, though there is a smaller one located on the bathroom counter right in front of the sink. However, since the counter & sink are MUCH lower than you would expect in a hotel, this towel bar doesn't do much except get in the way of trying to get to the sink. This is also one of the very few 'Strip' hotels that actually provides a real work desk in the rooms, so they get points for that. Enormous flat screen tv is nice, as well, but it's so big, the only way to really be able to watch it is from the bed; it's too big to turn for viewing from the armchair in the corner or while seated at the desk. In-room internet access at both is a rip-off; $9.99//day AND you must have the super secret 6-digit password you can only get from pressing 'menu' on the tv remote to access the internet (& thus ensure that you are appropriately charged, of course!). Problem was the night I checked in @ the Palace Station there was a problem w/the 'menu' function across the entire hotel & the front desk staff couldn't seem to understand how to get around this. They finally connected me to the hotel's internet support desk, who did know how to get around it, but the only phone in the room was no where near the desk. Phone cord was long enough to reach, but only AFTER I moved the nightstand & got it off the phone cord which had been wadded up under it. Once connected there was an on-going problem w/being actually being able to access anything which I am guessing is a result of the hotel's settings. Nearly every website initially comes up as 'Page not found', but after hitting the refresh button, the site comes up. Not exactly 'high-speed' as far as I'm concerned!

Due to circumstances we decided to stay two nights at this hotel rather than the one night we had prepaid.I had phoned to add the extra night to our itinerary and told them to charge our credit card. This did not happen and we were then charged extra as they had not got the card number on record. Ridiculous. This scenario was obviouslsy very confusing for the check in staff. One night had had been paid for and we paid the other night on our credit card. We were asked to leave a $50 deposit and our credit card details. We left the deposit in cash as we wanted the cash back. They also put a hold on $180 for what was a $65 room. On check out we were told our deposit had been used to pay for the room with the remainder being charged to our card. This was not what I had agreed with the check in lady.They also kept going on about a $5.40 service charge for each night but I still have no idea what this was for and why it was payable on a room that had been prepaid in full.We are still waiting for the money to be released back onto our card, which although is not entirely the hotels fault was avoidable and annoyed me as we were without the $50 and had no acces to the money they had put a \"hold\" on. This is not a lot of cash but it was contrary to what I had agreed with the hotel. The rooms had been refurbished to a high standard, lovely king size bed, huge plasma screen TV, nicely done bathrooms, however the whole effect was marred by the room being dirty. It hadn't been dusted in an age and the bathroom needed a good scrub. The TV remote didn't work neither did a replacement. The bath looked nice but when you lay down in it it was like lying on sandpaper. The non-slip coating was very effective but impossible for having a bath.

Based on the previous reviews, we opted for two tower rooms, floor 7, adjoining. Very nice, with new furnishings, no odor, etc. Clean, roomy, we got a king, which had a separate area for shaving, dressing, with all mirrors. The girls (2x21) had two doubles with a more standard bathroom (ie. ask for a king if there is only two of you). Parking is convenient, but every garage in every hotel in July in LV feels like the back of a bus exhaust, even when it's windy. Buffet was good, nothing special, but Grande Cafe was very nice. Prices are reasonable and food is great. I had the Philly cheesestaek and, as my waitress recommended, it was the best one outside Philly. Oyster bar=overpriced. Nice to have some fast food outlets, as well, for a quick snack. Location is very nice, in some ways more convenient than the strip, which has traffic problems in some parts. Yes, we rented a car, and you need it here, sice a \"Las Vegas\" block is similar to a \"New York\" block, almost unwalkable, particularly in the intense heat of a LV summer. It is on W. Sahara. two miutes to Stratoshere, Circus Circus and Sahara. But W. sahara going away from the strip has every kind of convenience that the locals use: shopping malls, restaurants, groceries, even Arizona Charlies with 24-hour bingo! And it's only minutes the back way to the strip hotels (use Industrial Road) or to Rio and The Palms, both gorgeous off-strip hotels. Seems the west side is by and large nicer than the east side of town. Best part is the hotel is located right at the I-15 interchange, so everything is only minutes away. If you stayed at Caesars, or at Planet Hollywood, for instance, it could take 15 miutes just to get to the I-15 because of the traffic. Casino was large, slots not as friendly as we expected, but the Sports and Race Book peopl;e are by far the nicest! Also, they had a roulette table, mid-week, midday, that had $0.50 chips and a $2.00 minimum, just my speed! Pool was, well, OK, but the sun was as strong, the water as wet as tat Bellagio. We saw so many shows, did so much, sunning wasn't our first priority, and only go out there a few days in a week vacation. Internet access was $10.00, but that's everywhere here, and think it's a ripoff. Movie was $9.99. Maids were overall fine, never ran out of towels, did a nice job. Yes, there's the construction noise, which stated around 8:30. I was up by then, some of us were not, and this caused some complaints. At check-in, they warned me and offered to switch us if was a problem. They also rented us a no-smoking room, warning me about a $250 fine if that was violated (it wasn't). The casino was smoky, so was evey casino but a few with vey high ceilings. Welcome to Vegas. Apparently it's the law that old ladies playing slots are required to smoke.

I've been on Palace Station once before a year ago and have loved it since then. The hotel is overall great and their resteraunts selection are almost unlimited. I totally recomend The Pasta Palace. Besides a seafood resteraunt that they have in the hotel, the Pasta Palace is probably the most expensive place they have in the hotel, but well worth it. The only thing I didn't like this time was the buffet, I wasn't thrilled about it. The one that they have on Arizona Charlie was a lot better and their food wasn't blend and they have a larger food selection. Still, you can never go hungry on a Vegas Buffet. I didn't even bother with the Guadalajara Grill....Yuck! American style Mexican Food, Yuck! Let's just say that when you travel to Mexico, REAL mexican food tastes a whole lot better! Try out their Quesadillas! Yum-o! I was there in Vegas for about 3 weeks to celebrate my brother's wedding getting married to my sister in law, and we were in my sister in law's parents house in 3 weeks in a half and then stayed in the hotel (in the last days of our trip) in a Suite Room for 1 day with my bro, because we couldn't see the brides' dress before the wedding. Then on the next day when he got married, then I went back to my sister in law's parents house, while my brother stayed in the Suite room with his new wife for half a day. Overall, Vegas is a fun place to relax to see the familly and to go out to places, and when you need a good hotel with a great price, Palace is the place to be. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews, I do know the fact that the hotel is of above adverage quality and doesn't compare to the MGM, Caesar's Place, etc. but on it's own it's a pretty decent hotel and again there's so much to do. And yes, in the Casino room it smells smoky, and yes maybe the tub in the bathroom is a bit small, but for the most part I had a great time in that hotel and for those of you that complaint too much, go to a fancier hotel if ya wanna go fancy. For me, I don't go for the fancy, I look for what's convenient for the short stay that I have for the hotel and its price. Besides, maybe the ones that complaint too much didn't went out much. Even in a fancy hotel you'll get bored if you don't go out once in a while! There service is excellent and would recomend this hotel to a lot of people. Hands up Palace Station! Keep it up!

This was a girls' get-together reunion. Though it is located off the strip, the hotel provided a shuttle for guests to and from the airport as well as two stops on the strip (at the Tropicana Hotel and the Fashion Mall). We did not have to show any ID, passport or room key to board from either the airport or any other pick up points. The buses were clean with polite drivers. No cost but tips are accepted. We took taxis to most places ($10-$12 to downtown, approximately $10 to the closest outlet). We had no problem finding taxis as they are lined up right outside the entrance. We stayed in the garden rooms, outside of the tower. No elevators...so we pulled/carried our luggage up to the second floor. Some girls had the Bell service do that for them. The rugs were quite worn and dirty. However, I did wake up at 2:30am to the sound of rug cleaning or vaccuming! The cafe was 'okay' for breakfast and snacks... their $1.99 breakfast of 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast is a good deal. We did have one dinner at the Broiler Restaurant (Saturday night). Since they were booked from 5p on, we opted for an early 4pm dinner. Quiet, good service, extensive salad bar and no complaints on their food. The dishes from the Oyster Bar were very good. Unfortunately, the casino was noticeably smoky. One of our nonsmoking rooms had a definite smoky smell. We reported it to the maid working down the hall, and she quickly had it taken care of.

We caught the shuttle from the airport to the hotel, which took abt 15 minutes and the driver was happy to give information as he drove. We checked in with no problem at all and was stopped on the way to our room. This was the beginning of many \"offers\" by all of the casinos in Las Vegas- apparently everybody is pushing time shares and are willing to give you free show tickets if you go listen to their speech. We were stopped entering every casino and also on the street for these \"offers\". After declining the offer, we checked into our room. Although the room was small, it was clean and the beds comfortable. The bathroom was nice and the only complaint was the shape of the shower. The shower only has a small lip, as opposed to a bathtub catching water, and a lot of the water would spill onto the floor as the lip seemed too low. The first night, our neighbors were very loud and we asked them to be quiet and didn't hear them again for the rest of the trip. We were also unfortently placed in a room opposite the ice maker, which made a decent amount of noise but it didn't bother us aftr the first night. If I went again, though, I would request a different room. The buffet was very good; we ate 1 breakfast, 1 lunch and 1 dinner and the prices were low as long as you had the Players Club, free to sign up downstairs. I think it was $5 breakfast, $6 lunch and $7 dinner. We also ate the 24-hr-cafe and thoroughly enjoyed that meal too. Somebody else has complained about the room service- although we didn't order room service, we did ask for extra towels. 45 minutes later, they still didn't arrive and we called again. After speaking to a very rude front desk person, the towels arrived in 10 minutes. Somebody else complained about the smoke- the smoke is in the casino and surprise: in all of the other casinos in Las Vegas. True, it is a lot of smoke but it was in every casino we visited with the exception of the Wynn, which is very expensive. Shuttles ran every hour and we used them every day. I would suggest arriving several minutes early as they do fill up and once they are full, any other people would need to wait for the next shuttle. This happened to us once. I would definately stay here again and am considering booking my parents a vacation there. The only poor things were the shower, ice maker and slow towel arrival. The good things were the price, the cleaniness, the shuttles and the bingo downstairs. Suggestion: There is a $5 daily pass for a double-decker bus that runs through Las Vegas 24 hrs a day. To get to the places the hotel shuttles don't run, I highly suggest the bus.

The halls were always clean, no room service trays blocking the floors like two years ago at the MGM. The staff was very friendly and helpful. In fact when my mother ordered oatmeal for a very late breakfast the waitress advised against it as it was late and the oatmeal would be several hours old. We ate several meals at the cafe and they were all very good. Myself I did not think the buffet was that great, but I tend to not like buffets anyways. The food was fresh and there was plenty of variety and the prices were great. However I would rate it as typical rather than spectacular.

The only downside was that it was lacking in sound proofing (as said in the reviews the walls seem to be on the thin side) - we got woken up by the next room occupant turning their TV on loud at 4 am!

The food at the onsite Grand Cafe and mexican restaurant Guardalajara were both excellent, the food at the the onsite Chang's was just average. If I could change some things. First would be no hidden charges - as others have mentioned - upon checking in there was a $4.95 daily charge added to my stay on top of what I had already paid.

However, I was very dissapointed with our hotel. Rooms: In the interest of saving money, we booked a \"courtyard\" room, which are in a building adjacent to the main hotel/casino. Didn't mind that there was no elevator, but handicapped/elderly - beware! Upon arrival, we were treated rudely by the staff when trying to explain that we wanted to leave keys at the desk for people checking in after us. When we got that issue straightened out, we went to our room and were greeted with the MOST disgusting cigarette smell I've ever encountered. The room reeked - the bedding, curtains, even in the shower!! The windows also didn't open more than 3 inches, so we couldn't air it out. SO gross for non-smokers. We were also not told we would be getting a smoking room upon check-in. Didn't want to deal with switching rooms, so can't say what the situation would have been like if we had. Room was very small and shower was definitely not spacious - also leaked all over the floor. Food: While the banquet food was terrible during our convention, the food in the restaurants was not bad. Service was friendly and quick. Had breakfast in the Grand Cafe and ate lunch one day in the Irish pub - both good values and the food was ok. Never tried the buffet, but saw it had afforable prices. Casino: The tables had cheap minimums which was nice to see compared to the bigger hotels on the strip. They were also less crowded, which made it less intimadating for a young woman to try her hand at some new games. Location: SO far from the strip - the shuttle only goes until 11:30 or so at night, so if you plan on staying out past that time, forget getting back without paying cab fare. Also no nightlife in the hotel. The shuttle also only ran hourly, so we ended up spending a lot of money on cabs. The few times we did take the shuttle were annoying since it only makes 2 stops and was always crowded - the Fashion Show Mall and the Tropicana - so if you want the middle of the strip you have to walk a long way or take a cab - defeating the purpose of a shuttle!! I would recommend for people not planning on spending a lot of time in the hotel or people looking for a bargain as far as accomodations go - however, consider the money you will spend on cab fare getting to all the places you want to see in Vegas!

Two days later when we checked out we got a telephone bill for $59.87 US!!!!!!!! Two itty bitty phone calls cost more than our hotel room!!! No where is this ignorant pricing posted in the hotel nor the room.

As far as our room, we were scheduled to be in a courtyard room but were upgraded to a tower room at no extra charge because we asked and it wasn't busy. We stayed on the seventh floor. I'd highly suggest spending the extra couple dollars to stay in the tower because the elevator is right next to the lobby and casino. The courtyard rooms require a little walking to get to. Our room had a good view, the hotel staff were friendly, no bed bugs, large comfy room and the free shuttle to and from the strip was nice. The shuttle drivers were quiet and didn't make small talk with anybody so we didn't tip them - which we normally do. Keep in mind however that if you catch the red eye in or out of Vegas and you're staying at the Palace Station their free shuttle to the hotel stops at about 11:00pm or 11:30pm. After this time, a lot of other pay-as-you-go shuttles won't go to Palace Station they'll only go to The Strip. So, you have to take a taxi to the Palace Station and it cost us $24 US dollars. Ouch.

My boyfriend and I spent 5 days on the strip over New Year's! We stayed an extra day due to a substantial savings on our flight home and needed to get a hotel room for only one night. On New Year's day I went to the internet cafe of our current hotel to look for a room somewhere else. I had spent the last 5 nights at the same place and wasn't very happy but the price was fantastic over New Years so I couldn't say no. Plus my boyfriend had already booked the hotel almost a year in advance.. Anyway..... I couldn't believe when I went onto travelocity and saw the rate for the Palace Station. $12.50 for the night. This was for Jan 2nd. I said to myself.. It can't be that bad! lol So, I booked it! The next morning around 11am we left our hotel on the strip and took a cab over to the Palace Station. There were a lot of people checking out and they had top priority so we had to wait in line for about 15 minutes. We finally checked in and received our room keys. We had room 1526 (I think) which happens to be right beside a stairwell. Overall the room was very nice. Nice comfy king size bed, the bathroom only contained a shower and pedastal sink but was very nice and roomy! beautiful details and decorated very nice! I only had 2 complaints, 1) the room smelled terrible of smoke (was supposed to be non-smoking) and there was a TON of noise at all hours because of the stairwell beside our room. So, if you go make sure the room is non-smoking and request a room AWAY from the stairwells. This is an older hotel with a lot of charm. Ed at the roulette table was great! We ate lunch at \"the feast\" buffet and it was just ok.. If you are looking for a sizzler type buffet with average food then it's a good place. fyi.. the desserts were terrible! We decided to try one of the restaurants on site that evening and chose the Broiler. What an excellent choice. The salad bar is great and the quality of food is excellent! The lobster bisque is to die for! If you go you have to get the Ponchatrain topping on your fish for an extra $4.95!! I could have just eaten this as my meal!! Fantastic!!! My boyfriend and I ate sooo much. The bill was about $90.00 without tip. My entree was 26.00 but there were plenty of options around $18-$20.00 each, bisque was $5.99, calamari appetizer was $7.99, drinks, etc.... The service was great. Everyone was very attentive! The oyster bar would be another option but there was a very long line of people waiting to be seated and there were only about 20 seats at the bar... SO, they must be serving up something good!! :) It's very hard to fault this hotel when you only pay $12.50 for your room!! LOL I would definitely stay here again.. Not worth anymore than about $40.00 per night especially when you have strip hotels that are around $50.00.

For frame of reference, we're not into butt-smootching service hotels...we're quite happy with most Hampton Inns, though our preferred style accomdations are the 1 and 2 bedroom villas at WDW's Old Key West resort. Since we stayed on the Strip before the conference and after, we've no experience with the airport shuttle. Since we were coming from a Strip hotel (check-out by 11), we arrived well before the check-in time of 3:00. During the morning hours, the reservations desk gives priority to check-outs, so we wound up waiting about 25 minutes to check-in as people who were checking out, getting change, etc. walked up and received the attention of the 2 counter staff. It wasn't annoying until one of the women spent 10 minutes on the phone with someone...I'm sorry, humans physically present should take priority over people on the phone. But, we eventually got checked-in and our Tower \"Deluxe\" room was available. The room itself was OK. The bed was comfortable and there was a semi-circular sofa in the bay window area overlooking the strip, the mountains, and the block of low-income apartments (the area around the Palace reminded us of the Las Vegas you see on COPS.)The windows desperately needed washing. The room decor was a bit dark and drab, but nothing horrible and it was clean. The bathroom was well lit, with a whirlpool tub and a decent shower. There was a single cup coffee maker in the room, with coffee for 2 small cups...enough at least that I didn't need to get dressed to have enough coffee in the morning to get down the to Starbucks in the lobby. There is wireless Internet access in the room, but they charge for it. Not a big deal since we did expense it, but annoying nonetheless. The TV only had about 1/2 the channels listed on their guide screen...and not one premium channel. I know most people don't go to Vegas to sit in the room, but it would have been nice to at least get what they advertized they showed. We didnt' do the pool...we're not bathing costume type people. There is a bank of 5 elevators for the towers. Only 1 night of the 3 we spent there did we see security guarding access...and never during the day. The one elevator we called the Wonka-vator..it's a glass outside the building one, but it overlooks the COPS apartment blocks and in the distance, the mountains. One thing we were not warned about...the extreme dry air meant everytime we pushed the elevator button (or touched a slot machine) we got zapped with a nasty jolt of static electricity...enough to evoke profanity at times. Gambling at the palace was gambling like anywhere else. Jacks, the Irish Pub, was ok...comfortable, reasonably (not cheap, but reasonably) priced drinks and lots of TV's. Even showed a couple of NHL games...though watching them at 5PM is weird. The Italian Restaurant was good...not great but solid Italian that goes above typical chain restaurants but isn't so specialized that they would not appeal to more plebian tastes...they also had the only good crusty bread we had in vegas. The Chinese restaurant was very bland chinese...not much of the more exotic asian influences, but I eat in Chinatown most days for lunch, so I admit my tastes are much more demanding vis-a-vis asian food. The buffet was so-so. Breakfast was OK, but a decent value for the price ($5-ish). The salad bar was out for breakfast, and was pretty fresh and crisp. Dinner buffet, other than the salad bar, left much to be desired...food quality was akin to what i remember about college cafeterias and the hand dipped ice cream was runny. Contrary to one review I'd read somewhere, there are NO laundry facilities in the hotel, nor within normal safe-looking walking distance. There is laundry service, but it's the typical hotel expensive service. in fact, I don't think there are any laundromats in the touristy areas of Las Vegas, a bizzare concept to an east coast city boy. The shuttle to the Strip was very useful if you're going to the NYNY/Exclibur/MGM area or the area around the fashion mall. One that cruises the strip would be nicer given that it's often hundreds of yards between things on the strip, but it did save lots of money on cab fares. We did have two issues with the hotel. The first was room service remains sitting all day outside the rooms. The second was an erroneous billing from the Chinese restaurant to our room...while we did eat there 1 night, we didn't charge to the room and we wound up with over $200 in charges to the room that wasn't ours. Because we were checking out before the restaurant opened and every single accountant in the hotel was on break, we had some difficulty dealing with the front desk staff. However, a manager was finally called and after we discussed the situation, she quickly removed the charges from our room and offered us a late check-out. Our issue wasn't with the charges....transcription errors happen, but the woman who manned the front desk was not very helpful.

We are anxious to revisit Palace Station to see the changes! The hotel advertised $19 room rates for those rooms in 2004 and since the remodel; have upped the price to $35 for a Value Room. My only advice if considering one of those rooms would be....If you are clostraphobic....don't bother, again, they are small rooms. They are better suited for single guys lookin for somewhere to store luggage, sleep little, and \"play\" in. As far as the dinning experience...the food was great and the prices were deffinately affordable if you are on a budget! But, I am sure that anyone visiting Vegas on a budget seeking Great Customer Service....give Palace Station a whirl!

They took both of our tolietry bags which had my wedding rings, make-up, a couple of pieces of jewerly, all of our medications.

Of course, we immediately called security, which in turn made us feel that we just making it up. He asked us such questions \" Are you sure that you had your bags with you?\" Grrrrrrrr!! \" Are you sure that you didn't leave your bags at home?\" etc. I travel enough to know that hotels are not responsible for anything that you leave in your room and all that we asked for is a report so that we could report this to our insurance company when we got home. It took us 4 days and much pestering to get that report. It was on a hotel form and was never reported to the police, even though they told us it would be. I do realize that this sort of thing can happen at any hotel you choose in Vegas however, most hotels would offer a toothbrush and toothpaste in this case, however, not the Palace Station. If you stay here, make sure to rent a car. It is too far to pay for a taxi to the strip. If you are looking for less expensive accomodations, I would suggest The Orleans, or the Gold Coast.

I arrived early morning (coming from Detroit) and took the complimentary shuttle to the hotel. For everyone's information, I arrived in Terminal 2 which does not have a stop for this shuttle. I had to call the hotel to find out what to do. Palace Station should be a little more forthcoming with the fact that you need to be outside of Terminal 1. Check-in was efficient and friendly. My room was ready, nice and early, which was great for me. I would have otherwise had to lug around a heavy suitcase. The room was in the farthest corner away from the front desk. This was bad for the walking distance but great for a quiet nights sleep. The room itself was pretty basic. The bed was firm (big plus in my opinion). The shower pressure was good but maybe a bit strong. The television was nice sized and in a good looking armoire. It was extremely clean and I received towels, shampoo and soap every day. I am a poker player (serious) and despite being small, the poker room was good in my opinion. Every day that I went in the Poker Room, the knew me by name (find that elsewhere in Vegas!). The comps weren't hard to get. They use the Station Casinos card system. I dont play too many other games but there was a wide variety of everything in the casino including the betting limits. The Buffet upstairs is great for breakfast. Its $5 for a huge assortment of foods. The omelet stand is excellent. I also like the fresh fruit area. There were a large amount of dessert items to choose from as well. I like the Burger King by the Sports Book for a quick cheap burger. The Cafe was nice too. You get large portions and good tasting food. I had the baked chicked which was pretty good. It came with two sides and I was definitely stuffed once I left. The shuttle to the Strip is awesome too. It will go to Tropicana, then onto Fashion Show Mall. All of this is free for staying at the Palace Station. To Review...... Pros- Just about everything.

Stains in the toilet and the grout was dirty. Not sure what the tower rooms were like, but you would think that a well know casino chain would maintain some sort of overall standards. Not the case.

I stayed at Palace Station from 4/14-4/17/05. As far as appearance, our room was spotless (especially the bathroom) and pretty well kept. The curtains look like they could use replacing though. We had a room in the tower which you will definitely want to spring for because the courtyard from what i saw and heard is not the place to be. Granted we weren't in the room but for maybe 6 hours each day but we still expected it to be comfy. The casino and hallways smell kind of old but the gaming is cheaper than most casinos if you play the tables. Beware of the way certain websites describe the location of the hotel. They may say it's right off the strip (which is true) but they don't tell you that it is across the HIGHWAY and there is no way to walk to the strip. There is, however, a shuttle that runs promptly every hour to the strip from the hotel. The food in the hotel is pretty good and reasonably priced. there is one cafe open 24 hours too. Now, on to my complaint. When we checked in, we were told that our room had been upgraded to a suite as a courtesy.... for one day. After that night we were to check out and check back in to a standard tower room. I called the front desk to find out if we could stay in the suite rather than pack back up, take our luggage back to the lobby, check out and then check back in. They said no. I said well how about if I pay the difference of the standard room... they informed me that would be an extra $220 per night. So i explained to them \"what part of this upgrade is a courtesy? because it's more of an inconvenience to me\" There only rebuttal was \"but you were given a suite\" like that was supposed to mean something to me. They would not accomodate or compromise with me. SO, when we checked out the following morning so that we could check back in, i was told that there were no standard rooms ready and to just stay in the suite until 1:30PM when the other room had been cleaned. Back upstairs we go with our luggage. Finally we were able to check into the standard room which we liked better than the suite anyway.

The clientele looked rather rough. A lot of people were there dragging children around. Some looked as young as 2 or 3 years old.... (going on 11pm now). Why anyone would bring their kids into a casino is beyond me! We had to squeeze past a few people in electric skooters, wearing oxygen tubes as they puffed away on cigarettes. The air in there was absolutely overwhelming. We were gagging. Don't get me wrong. We smoke! This was unreal, though. By the time we got to our room, exausted, we smelled like an ashtray from the thick cigarette smoke permeating the entire place. The casino had no ventilation. The Courtyard hallways were no better. We dodged buckets on the floor, collecting rain dripping thru the ceilings. Throughout the casino and Courtyard, the carpet was squishy and nasty. It actually smelled like sewage. The room was small and overlooked the dumpster. I opened the window. The smell of trash and rotting garbage was sickening. The phone in the room was not turned on. I used my cell phone to call (long distance for me) to the front desk. I was told we could change rooms... for an additional charge. Instead, we checked out. We went across town to Boulder Station. (Same company) It is newer, nicer, quieter and costs the same or less. The people at Palace Station cancelled the charge and transferred everything over to Boulder with no problems. Enroute to the front desk we stopped at the Rewards Center because we got lost in the twisting maze of a layout. The man working there apologized profusely for our inconvenience and offered us a T-Shirt and a money clip. The staff there was very nice. I have no problem with the staff, location or price at Palace. But the Courtyard rooms are really REALLY dumpy and there is NO ventilation in the casino.

I read quite a few of the reviews about this hotel and cannot undersand some of the negative ones. My husband and I enjoyed our stay along with our 11 year old and his friend. Of course, we had to watch them carefully, as they were not old enough to linger in the casino area. We never had a problem with the children walking thru the casino while they were with us. We did not allow them to walk thru unescorted, but that really was not a problem. They were able to go to the pool and swim and visit the various restaurants located inside the hotel. We were glad that the front entrance to the hotel does not require the children to walk thru the casino. We took advantage of the shuttle service to and from the strip. Even though the shuttle does not go directly to all the hotels, we found it easy enough to go to the Tropicana or the Fashion Mall and walk to the hotels that we wanted to visit. We also took advantage of the new monorail that goes from the Sahara hotel to the MGM Grand. Saves alot of walking and you can ride back and forth for $10.00 for a 24 hour period. I also found that restaurants in the hotel had great food, including the Burger King. The best food was at the 24 hour cafe. We did decide to upgrade our room to the tower room and had a great view of the strip. The room was clean and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful during our stay. We would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "August 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat for Students!!\u201d", "Author": "SmileighGirl", "ReviewID": "UR2442356", "Content": "Palace Station is awesome...for someone that's poor =) I bought my flight and hotel ticket at priceline after little research. At first, I thought it was a great deal...until I read the reviews...I got a little scared from some negative comments. When I got to Vegas...I was picked up by the Palace Station shuttle...they brought me to the hotel (I save taxi money)...checked in...went and got something to eat at the hotel diner. That place is AWESOME....great food, REALLY CHEAP...and they give you a lot. The reason why I said it's great for students...it's because most of the people at the hotel are old... they don't chill by the pool ...they go straight to the casinos...which leaves the pool for the younger people...a few. It is a gem for younger people =) i really do recommend the place... i like how when you come into the lobby, you see a lobby...not slot machines after another ...overwhelming you as soon as you walked in.

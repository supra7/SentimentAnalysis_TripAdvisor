I ate at the Blossom restaurant which I thought was excellent, and Happy Hour (3-6 PM) at the Skybox near the poker and sports rooms was a great deal for drinks and snacks. BTW, it's a very good poker room. Like everything in Vegas, it's a fair walk to get to places although you're next door to high end shopping at the City Centre. Overall I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10.

But it's all form over function, and it is really frustrating to stay at this hotel. Here are a few of my issues: 1. Navigating the hallways is impossible. One bank of elevators serves 10 or so floors, so if you want to go to a room that isn't in your bank of elevators, you have to take your bank all the way to either the casino or the promenade to get on another bank, and then go back up to the floor you want to go to. Additionally, there are several different pathways once you get off the elevator and you have to read a sign like five different times to figure out which way your room is. 2. Figuring out how to turn the lights on in the rooms is also impossible. It is not as easy as hitting a light switch. There is a NON-WIRELESS, awkward room control monitor that is not very touch responsive, and also is not synced with the buttons on the walls - so if you make a decision on the wall, and then change it on the monitor, stuff gets all messed up. 3. The shampoo and conditioner SUCK. The WORST shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. On Friday night when I went out it looked like i hadn't even washed my hair. I bought new shampoo for Saturday and it looked fabulous, so it wasn't the water - it was the shampoo that Aria provides. 4. Everyone I dealt with in the check in lines was an a-hole. They were impatient and judgey, and not helpful. My friend made the reservation and put down the deposit, and I checked in before him, then asked them to refund the deposit to HIS credit card, and they refunded it to MY card - which I figured out after i returned home. The cleaning service was amazing. Really, really amazing. I am never impressed with maid service. But it was awesome here. The pools are nice, except we kept getting free invitation/VIP passes to go to Liquid FROM ARIA POOL STAFF, and then we tried to go and they told us that the cover was $50 and the passes were no good unless signed by the bouncer in line. A $50 cover for a pool party is beyond ridiculous. Also if you want food you have to get up and go to the cafe to order it - waitresses will you bring you beer and a caesar wrap (literally, that is the only food on their menu) but if you want food you have to walk all the way over to the cafe. A beer costs $15 and a club sandwich was $16. Not cheap. And the hotel adds a $25 resort fee for internet to your room charge, and some other fees, so its way more expensive than advertised. None of us were happy with Aria. We've stayed at the Trump, the Mirage, MGM Grand, and they were all better - or at least more comfortable - than the Aria.

The rooms are beautiful - everything is electronic and operated through a small digital screen next to the bed: lights, temperature, tv, music, window sheers, etc. Plus, when you turn the TV or radio on for the first time, the room remembers your likes and automatically turns them on when you enter the room again. And let me tell you about the bed - I know, when you're in Vegas, you barely spend time in your room...but the beds at Aria are heaven! Stearns & Foster mattresses in every room, make coming to bed at 6am, literally, a dream! Fabulous restaurants, from Michael Mina's American Fish and Jean George's Steakhouse, to Julian Serrano (one of my personal favorites - tapas!) and Todd English's P.U.B.

Hotel was well-located, in walking distance of most places, and there's lots to do in the hotel if you don't get out much. There's a variety of places to eat and drink, and a 24 hour shop that sells souvenirs, consumables and booze. Perfect. Check in was average, had to wait 2 hours for our rooms after a long-haul flight from Australia, which was sub-optimal, but not totally unexpected in such an enormous hotel. We were travelling in a family group (3 ppl, 3 rooms) and we'd requested our rooms close or adjoining. Had to haggle a little to get 2 adjoining rooms, with one of our party ending up about 2 min walk away which wasn't ideal, but hey, nobody died. A number of reviewers on this site complain about the distance between the lifts and their rooms, and it's true, it was a bit of a walk, but nothing too devastating. If you are sensitive in the respiratory system, this may not be a great place to stay. The weird perfume that's pumped in the casino to cover the smoke is pervasive, and it was always a relief to get outside in the fresh air. The Elvis show was fun, and the theatre was awesome - I'm not a fan of Cirque du Soleil, but this was good - probably because of Elvis. We also hired a car from the Avis in the hotel, and this was really handy - super convenient, and the pick up and return was painless. The electronics in the room were fun, especially the curtains.

When we arrived our rooms weren't ready (it was 11:00am) however, the front desk stored our luggage while we headed to the buffet. My hubby and I are not fans of the buffet but this was no typical casino buffet!! The food was delicious and fresh and plentiful!! Once we walked around a bit after lunch we checked on our rooms but only one room was ready; the one for my hubby and I. Not too much of an issue since we booked a one bedroom suite with a connecting room for my mom and brother. Holy smoke.....the suite was unbelievable!!! A huge living area with a couch and 2 chairs, a table and chairs, refridgerator, humongous tv with a universal remote that was for the tv, curtains, and lights! It was wild!! Our bedroom was huge, huge bed but it was a little high for my liking. Our bathroom was awesome!! 2 person jacuzzi, huge walk in shower, his and hers sinks with a flat screen tv on the his side. And my husband's favorite..the \"fanny\" washer and heated toliet seat!! Oh boy did he love that thing. Then after being there over and hour, we discovered another 1/2 bath in the front of the room near the front door...who knew?? Needless to say, a few negative areas....my mother and brother's room was not available until well after 5:00pm which could have been an issue had we not had our suite available next door. And not for nothing but we were traveling with my 80 year old mom which we had mentioned during the check in. The walk from the elevator was far, not bothersome for me but I can see where that can be an issue for some people. The beds were really high! It was a major issue with my mom which after much back and forth with the front desk nothing was done to help her! We were better off walking to Walgreens to purchase a stool, they should really keep those around for future use. Our view of the strip was awesome but our window was filthy! On our last day there, our flight was pretty early so we got up early to get breakfast but nothing opened until 7:00am which I thought was strange. That was not at all convenient for us. Last but not least, I was quite shocked how expensive soda and water was there in the bar and grill and gift shop. I guess being that it's the adult Disney that I shouldn't be surprised but you are definitely better off heading to Walgreens to pick up soda and water for your room. As a side note, Vegas and the aria are great! Go see \"O\" and go have lunch at Cabo wabo, what a blast!! I thought the Aria was centrally located and in walking distance from everything on the strip. Unfortunately, it was way too cold for the pool so I cannot comment on that. Despite the negatives, I loved this place and would stay again in a heartbeat!!", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Spa & Casino\u201d", "Author": "Manuel V", "ReviewID": "UR126802410", "Content": "From the time I made the reservation for me and my wife I knew that I was dealing with friendly & professional staff.

We all know each hotel tries to differentiate itself from the others on \"the strip\". The Aria has decided to appeal to the young, hip, business traveler. It is very modern and it's decor has an Asian influence. I do admit that the Aria is new, and clean and rather beautiful. But, I am comparing it to some of my other favorites in Las Vegas, and it doesn't measure up. It's a nice hotel but \"it isn't the Bellagio or Mirage or the Wynn\". The \"innovative\" rooms that they boast of are more trouble than they are helpful. I am computer savvy, but it took way too long to figure out the system to even turn the lights on. In the meantime, I had the curtains opening and closing at odd times! (When did I become \"an old fart\"???) We never did get the clock to the correct time. However, we really, really liked the heated toilet seat! (We stayed in their smallest suite called a \"corner suite\", so I don't know if the deluxe rooms had this feature.) BTW, the corner suite was about a city block walk from the elevator. (Good exercise if you go to the buffet, which was very good.) The casino was okay - not great. We had some problems with the folks at the players club acting what I call \"snooty\" when we had some questions about our players card and then later with comps for our bill. (We were NEVER treated like that at the Mirage.) Overall, our encounters with the staff were courteous, and we appreciated the assistance of one of the supervisors when our players card wouldn't work. The food options at the hotel, even by Vegas standards, seemed expensive. The Viva Elvis show (at this venue) was outstanding! I had been to a Cirque du Soleil show several years ago that wasn't that impressive so I was hesitant about this one. I was very pleasantly surprised. The pool: I am not really a pool person, but I got rather spoiled at the Mirage pool. So, on our final day I did walk around the Aria pool to at least see it. It seemed very nice with lots of palm trees and a variety of pools and restaurant bars etc. (Compare to the bland concrete at the Paris and Venetian.) It looks like it would be a good experience. Overall, the Aria could have been a \"4 rating\", but I rate the Aria a \"3\" because of their \"attitude\".

There are lots of variety in the bars and restaurants to suit all tastes. The pool area was lovely and waitress service for drinks. Sadly the Liquid was not open, but looked very nice.

I don't think my husband was ever completely happy with the temp, because he'd set it at 65 at night and awake with it still over. My biggest problem was the consistency with what is written and voiced. For instance, since you pay for the gym it'll be good to know that it closes at 7? Or was that 8pm? Depends who you ask at the front desk. There's great new equipment and variety in the gym despite the mix-up! Also, I love the 24 hr Cafe Vetro, (so it says upstairs in your hotel guide),...although when you open the menu BOOK, (honestly love the variety), it has specific hours too. My best advice is if you intend to visit someplace on the property, (even the pool), ask about hours. By the way the pool was refreshing and scenic. On Friday & Sunday nights there is a talented guitarist/pianist/vocalist near the casino elevators that's worth a drink and listen. He's completely captivating over the expensive slot machines, (which boast normal penny/nickel/quarter/dollar increments but then have much higher minimums when you look at the buttons), but with a central location it's easy to travel to another casino for your slot needs.

The location is perfect - especially if you are shopper - great shopping right next to it if you are into high end brands. It's close to the Cosmopolitan, which is also great. I also really liked the TRAM that transports you all the way to the Bellagio. Great Plus as the trip is always so busy, there really is no point to taking a cab. The service was good too. Even though we had a blast, I doubt we'll stay there again. The rooms were disappointing in that they aren't very well designed, and the colours are dull. We didn't watch TV (of course, we are in Vegas) but it was not possible to watch TV from the bed, I found this as a design mistake! (or is it on purpose, who knows) The couch table, chair...all very uncomfortable. A long hallway was just a waste of space. Nice bathroom, but no counter space whatsoever! We were in a corner suite with a view of the strip, which was ok. The view from Mandalay Bay is a lot better! The whole room was high tech which was nice, but I didn't care much about how overcomplicated they made it. The bed, pillows and linens were top notch, I have to say, so that's a big plus. But I think in Vegas, pretty much every hotel is like that. One night we got a table at Gold Lounge. Great service! I loved it because it's a smaller type lounge. However, the music was sooo bad! They really need to hire a good DJ. The music was just horrible. Cannot even compare to some of the well know clubs in Vegas, but it has potential to be an amazing spot - hire a great DJ! Personally, our room a the Wynn & Encore was a million times better. However, they are bit far from everything and there isn't much to do there, but I must say, I really love the decor and rooms! I hear Bellagio has spent a lot of money renovating the rooms now with a modern look. So next time, we will probably check that out.

We had decided to stay here months before after being very impressed by the food and the sports book on our last visit to Las Vegas. I think that my expectations were too high because I got disappointed about some things. First of all the hotel is gorgeous, so let's get that out of the way. Nice and modern, decorated stylishly and simply. However, two mishaps occurred that I believe should have gone smoothly for the type of hotel Aria is and for the cost ($275 a night). Firstly, I made arrangements prior to arriving to have some anniversary treats delivered to our room the day that we checked in through the concierge. When I called down to the concierge after settling into our room, I was on hold for about 10 minutes before someone answered. Then the attendant that I spoke to seemed not to know what was going on. I explained that I pre-paid and had arrangements for champagne, strawberries and rose petals and she acted like she couldn't find my reservation/itinerary. She put me back on hold for several minutes and then I was finally able to confirm. Later on, I received a call from another person at the concierge department requesting my credit card info again. They claimed that they didn't have the last 4 digits of my credit card. By then, my dealings with the concierge department were annoying, at best. Anyway, after all that, they did deliver the items and also made a heart shape on the bed with the rose petals, which was nice. The transaction, however, was far from flawless. Another issue that annoyed me was that our TV malfunctioned about 3 times. The first time, we called a technician who arrived promptly. The 2nd and 3rd times, my husband observed what the technician did to fix the issue and did it himself (I think it was a series of steps to reset the TV). Everything else was good. I went to the salon for a manicure and pedicure and they were able to take me for a last minute appointment early in the morning. The buffet was delicious and so was the food at the sports bar. The sports book is a little small for big events (we were there to bet on the NCAA college basketball tournament) and it was quite crowded, but we expected that. I like that the City Center (of which the Aria is a part of) is right in the middle of the strip. A small note regarding the crowd and the atmosphere: the Aria is a little pretentious for my taste. The crowd is mostly made up of stuck up yuppies who want to show off their money. It is not very diverse at all. I didn't feel very comfortable or think that others were very approachable. I like to have a good time and laugh with fellow travelers. I didn't feel like I could do that at Aria. The relaxed and fun vibe at Planet Hollywood or MGM is more my speed. In conclusion, I think that I put the Aria on a pedestal and was a little disappointed, especially in the concierge experience.

My husband and I renewed our vows and finally got the honeymoon after 8 years of marriage, so we splurged and paid a little more than your average resort on the strip to stay at the Aria (which we got for a good deal on Allegiant's website). I do have a couple of comments on different areas of the hotel that seem to be frequent issues on here. Staff: I've read a lot of comments about staff attitude issues, etc. on here and I have to say that we had ZERO problems. The staff were all friendly, from concierge to the front desk, the bellman, and even the folks assisting guests where the shuttles arrive at. Everyone was professional, courteous, and very willing to assist us with our stay. Room: We reserved a king bed deluxe room for our stay and upon arrival were told that the only king bed room had a shower only and not the shower-tub combo I was looking forward to. When I let the desk clerk know that I still wanted a tub, she put us on the 53rd floor in a room with two queens, promising to have them find a nice room for us the next day with a king AND the shower-tub combo. We called our first afternoon there and after complaining a little bit about the room we were in (the technology did not greet me or anything when we walked in!), the clerk put us on the 20th floor with a Strip view. LOVED IT! I enjoyed everything about that room and did not mind the darkness as we tend to use only ambient lighting in our own home and it keeps it a bit darker. The towels were plush, the view was impeccible, and the furnishings and decor were lovely. I was looking forward to the comfy bed, but I really didn't find it all that great. It wasn't bad, but I think that the bed had seen a lot of use and the mattress seemed kind of firm for my liking. That's okay, though, because I've stayed in a lot of cheap motels and this was delightful compared to them. Housekeeping: Often I've read that houskeeping has been sub-par during peoples trips to this hote; however, our housekeeping was wonderful. We would turn the light over to \"SERVICE\" and by the time we reached our room again for either the night or to change or take a break, our room was spotless. The only bad thing I didn't like at all was that the last day we were there the housekeeping had thrown away my boot cup from Fremont, which I was going to give someone who wanted it. Spa: Oh...my. Wonderful! I loved the Spa!!! My massage therapist, Sheila, was very nice and quickly made me feel comfortable as this was the first massage I ever had. The ambiance was relaxing throughout the spa and the hosts were very accomadating. Food: We at at Cafe Vetro the first night we stayed at the Aria and the food was unimpressive as well as the high price. $60 for two people? Yikes! Guess we weren't in Kansas anymore! My husband and I also at at the buffett a couple of times and really enjoyed the good food selection as well as the omelett station they had set up for breakfast and then again for Friday brunch. We had eaten at the Mirage buffet while in Vegas and Aria was hands down so much better than the Cravings Buffet at Mirage! Last note about food was we had room service and I thought that the price was comparable to the room service I had at Luxor during my previous stay in Vegas; and by that I was presently surprised and the food was awesome as well! So...one last thing. I've heard people complain about all the walking that there is to do at Aria due to its immense size. To that I have to say: it's VEGAS! If you come to Vegas and don't expect to do a ton of walking (even though it wasn't fun to have to trek through Crystals from the Strip just to get to the hotel!), then this is NOT the city for you. Vegas is all about walking everywhere so I guess it didn't bother me that we had to hoof it quite a bit around the place. Overall, I think we stay there again sometime if we got a good deal again. However, this trip was much more of a \"splurge\", and I'd rather stay somewhere right ON the Strip, so next time my hubby and I travel to Vegas we'll probably stay somewhere a little cheaper and that is more accessible to the Strip.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201coutstanding\u201d", "Author": "julze15", "ReviewID": "UR126691187", "Content": "Outstanding hotel.

The beds are a bit soft for my taste both others will love them. The water pressure in the shower was great and the rooms were really quiet. I wish there was a coffee maker in the room but most Vegas hotels don't have them. The pool area looked very nice but the weather was a bit too cold during our visit to try it out. GREAT STAFF - I generally don't comment on hotel staff since I'm a fairly low-maintenance traveller and don't demand alot of staff, but the Aria staff were spectacular! Every employee from the front desk, bellman, maids and waiters seemed genuinely happy to have us staying at their hotel and willing to do anything to help. LOCATION - Great location. It is only a few steps from Aria to the free tram which takes you to Bellagio (the centre of the Vegas universe) in a matter of minutes. FOOD - The Aria buffet is one of the best in Vegas (and I've eaten at many of them). In addition to the great food, it is one of the few with natural daylight and the waiters are very attentive.

All in all the two shows were well worth the price and you should not hestitate in going. So back to the Aria. The place is huge so plan on doing a lot of walking. The many dinner places and casino make it an adventure. Cafe Vettro was one of our favorites for breakfast and lunch. American Fish is right on and well worth the money. Taste and presentation are tops for this place. Like I said prepare to spend. For example since our \"deluxe room\" didnt have a coffee pot a large pot of coffee, one banana, two english muffins and the morning paper was $40. A little steep in anyones mind. We were sold on the idea of a \"deluxe room with two corners\". The first corner was the street facing window and the second corner was 18 inches of glass. Yeah right! Next toiletries. A place like Aria one would imagine items from France, Great Britain or the United States not \"Made in China\". Cheap and shows no class! Finally the telephone system in the room. We heard from a variety of employees that the phone system has multiple issues and has been a source of problems. There was a scheduled power interuption for our room that effectively \"locked\". This means we had to call the front desk, asst. hotel manager and housekeeping with our cell phones coming in through the main switchboard for such things as room service. This went on for 24 hours. After the front desk and the asst. hotel manager not answering their phone we finally got someone in housekeeping to get us out of \"phone system jail\" When we complained at checkout they deducted two days worth of resort fees.

Especially if Privacy is important to you!\u201d", "Author": "DrewCrew_515", "ReviewID": "UR126513904", "Content": "Let me preface this review with this: I have been in the Casino Industry for nearly 13 years, traveling to some of the best Casinos (Public and Tribal) throughout the United States. On an average I frequent Las Vegas about 3-4 times a year for business and usually spend a week there every winter for Global Gaming Expo (G2E). This was my first visit to Las Vegas for pleasure and no business. As previously mentioned I frequent Las Vegas quite a bit, staying at many of the properties, I now prefer to stay a block off the strip at a non-gaming hotel, but the hotel was chosen by the couple we went with as it was her Birthday and their Anniversary or else Aria would not have been my top choice. If you are looking for a STRIP VIEW, this is not the hotel for you! The hotel is quite a ways away from the strip, so if you are looking for that experience, stay somewhere like Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood etc\u2026. My room view consisted of an A/C unit on the top of the roof. Since we were approximately 10-15 floors from the rest of our party and didn't even ride up in the same group of elevators we asked to be moved closer to them, our request was NEVER met. The first time we were told that our request was in the computer and check back the next day. After checking back the next day, our request was NOT found, so we requested it again. We were informed that someone would contact us to inform us if our request could be met, NOPE! Never Heard from them. READ THIS: We are normally easy people to accommodate and usually never request our room to be serviced we had illuminated the privacy button on our room before leaving each day. On Saturday morning, while leaving the room for brunch we made sure our privacy button was on, as we did not need service and since the rooms DO NOT HAVE SAFES, I HAD LEFT A LARGE SUM OF MONEY OUT. Upon our return that evening, my wife and I noticed that our room had been somewhat serviced and our privacy light was no longer illuminated. We had new towels hung up; our bed was halfway made, etc\u2026. At first glance it did not look like anything was missing but it was still disturbing, but I was reluctant to say anything. The next morning we had a voice message on our phone, left at approximately 1:00 PM, about an hour after we had left, informing us \u201cthat since our Privacy Light was on, our room WOULD NOT BE SERVICED AND IF WE NEEDED ANYTHING, PLEASE CONTACT HOUSEKEEPING.\u201d With that message I filed an incident report with the Security Department on Sunday, March 4, 2012. I was informed that the incident would be investigated and I would at least be informed when my room was accessed and who accessed my room within 7 days. I JUST LEFT A MESSAGE WITH RISK MANAGEMENT on March 22, 2012 as I have NOT HEARD from anyone! ( I will try and attach a picture of my incident report) Last but not least, the restaurant service is terribly slow, even for Las Vegas and the drink prices are outrageous. On a brighter side, the valet is easily accessible and the staff is great! The Hotel Lobby smells absolutely HEAVENLY, and the Gaming Floor layout is easy to navigate. The electronics that control the room are cool and the bath is nice.

The people at the 800 number were quick and well-informed about our offer. In less than 10 minutes, we reserved a room, selected the night and performance time of the Elvis Cirque de Soleil show, made reservations for a limo pickup at the airport and received a confirmation email. If you go to Las Vegas often, it's smart to join your favorite hotel's afffinity program. As we played in the casino, we earned points through the MGM Resorts program and that translated into instant comps for us. The limo reservation was a bit indulgent, but it's not as expensive as one would think ($77) and there's no standing in a long line for a taxi, instead we were greeted at the baggage claim by our driver and went directly to the waiting car. During our ride to the Aria, we asked the driver about the hotel to find out what other people had to say about it. His friendliness was very helpful in navigating what was for us, a new hotel experience. Upon arrival, one is immediately struck by the immense size and very modern architecture of this hotel. Once inside the lobby, before we could even get oriented, several hotel employees greeted us and asked if we needed any assistance. In a matter of moments, we were directed to the \"invited guests\" counter and began our check-in. We were greeted like long-lost relatives and the front desk friendliness was refreshing! We asked for a room closer to the elevators with a great view (tips we found on Trip Advisor.) Our check-in clerk, Leah, was so friendly and helpful, we were compelled to mention her name here. Leah reminded us not to touch anything in the fridge, because if things are just touched or lifted up, that becomes an instant room charge. The hotel is immense, huge, large and vast! After check-in we wanted to see our room and unpack. Again, multiple employees asked if we needed help or directions, as we were guided to our specific elevator area. Note: Various floors are grouped together, for quicker elevator service. For example, if you are on the 34th floor, don't get into the elevators marked for floors 19-30. The room was very nice and everything seemed brand new. We learned how to use the much talked-about electronic control pad and were able to open the drapes, adjust the room temperature, turn on lights and select TV channels effortlessly. We pressed a few incorrect icons, as we were learning how to use the system, but overall, there was NO problem. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was well stocked with all necessary ammenities and the bath/tub enclosure was fun! One can take a bath while the other one showers, all within the same glass enclosure. Our only problem with the room was the lack, I mean almost complete lack of water pressure in both sinks. This was never fixed during our stay, even though we reported it 2x. The casino is large and there's the much talked about, scent of vanilla wafting in the air. We were not overpowered or bothered by it, in fact we liked it. In some way, the vanilla seemed to warm-up some of the coldness of the modern architecture. The selection of very modern slots is quite large and at many of the slots, one can select not only the game they want to play, but the denomination as well. This save your feet, because it cuts down on some of the walking! There's a lot of walking in this hotel - everything is on a large scale, so wear comfortable shoes - your feet will thank you. Be warned, like all Strip casinos, this one is just as tight as the rest of them. There is very little \"slot action,\" no mid-level \"hits\" and after 4 days on the casino floor, we can say we NEVER heard a single jackpot bell ring, nor did we ever see a single \"hand-pay.\" By the end of our trip, we had given up all hope of winning anything. We discovered the fixed rail tram to the elegant Bellagio and spent time there enjoying the casino and garden. There's a large, gleaming-new shopping mall at Aria, named Crystal. It's worth a walk-through, the shops are all high-end and very expensive. Most all of the shops were empty and the mall was rather quiet. The Elvis show by Cirque de Soleil was awesum. The theater is large, the seats are comfortable and the show was full of energy. This is the largest Cirque cast in Las Vegas and even Elvis haters will find something to enjoy about it. Don't miss it! For quick dining, consider The Jean Phillip patisserie. The food consists of quality snacks, fruit, sandwiches and pastry. The only problem with this venue is that it's too crowded, cramped and confusing. We wanted to order some specialty crepes that we saw being made by hand, but we never figured out how to do that, because of the confusing and very rushed ordering process. The patisserie area could be a bit larger and less difficult to navigate. We tried the Cafe Vettro for one lunch and one dinner. We'll skip this venue in the future. The wait staff was rushed, inattentive, distracted, slow and not very friendly. Our entrees did NOT arrive hot, but instead, at barely room temperature. If you complain, the waiter will shrug his shoulders and say \"it's not my fault, blame it on the chef.\" They won't offer to re-heat your food nor make an adjustment to your bill. Dining there during the sunlight hours means a lot of bright sun and harsh glare, so be sure to bring your sun glasses. We did enjoy the Lemongrass Thai food restaurant and Italian style Sirio Ristoranti. Everything was perfect, delicious and the staff was very friendly. These two restaurants quickly became our new favourites. Check-out was available on the electronic system in our room, but we choose to check-out at the front desk. It was quick and effortless. The lady at the check-out counter asked us \"how was your stay?\" We mentioned the problem with the bathroom water pressure and how it was never fixed. She apologized and comped all of our food charges, to demonstrate the hotel's concern for our problem. That's the moment when we became \"hooked!\" We will definitely be back again. The Aria is an excellent five-star hotel, the staff is incredibly friendly and they go out of their way to make sure each guest feels special. Try it, we think you will like it! :)", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Hotel in the World\u201d", "Author": "Montezsantafe", "ReviewID": "UR126467150", "Content": "I have travelled throughout my life (I started young and now in my 60s I continue to travel).

We would walk to the MGM or New York to gamble and drink. After the first day we left our room at 10am and had the room service light on. We came back about 8pm and our room was never serviced. I called the manager and he sent fresh towels up and it took 30 mins. They gave us a $50 dollar comp after being on hold for 10 mins with the front desk and hung up on twice. So we decided the next morning to watch tv and eat breakfast in bed with the room credit. Woke up out our TV was not working. Called the front desk and was placed on hold for about 5 mins. So we ordered simple room service (bagels and juice) and it took 35 mins. You get charged 25 dollars a day for wifi and gym services. The wifi only worked the first day. The ice machine was broken on our floor for 2 out of 3 days we were there. After it got fixed I went to use it and another man was walking out and said it is broken again. I went back to the room to call the front desk to let them know and it was busy for about 10 mins. So I finally had to go down to the lobby and speak to a manager in person. A plus...the bed was probably the best bed I have slept on. All in all I should have stuck to my gut and stayed at the Wynn again. I will never stay at the ARIA again.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous property\u201d", "Author": "mitsylavigne", "ReviewID": "UR126410203", "Content": "The Aria is a great location, right in the middle of the strip and set back just a little bit. It is attached to some amazing shopping, and there is a tram that will take you over to the Belaggio if you are in heels and dont want to make the walk! The property itself is so gorgeous, everything is shiny and clean and the hotel lobby has a faint smell of vanilla, which is lovely the first time you walk in. Keep in mind I was there over March Madness and Spring break, so there where alot of people, and alot of people smoking. So that lovely vanilla smell slowly turned into \"Eau de chain smoking gramma\", and was not so lovely as the trip went on. It basically smelt like those girls at the bar who go out for a cigarette and come back in stinking like cheap perfume to cover up. I would say the ventillation system is not as good as other hotels I have stayed at. I came home sick, and scratchy throat from the smoke, which has never happened before when we stayed at the MGM. Other than that, the hotel was amazing. The rooms where quite nice, and we got upgraded to the Sky Suites. When you walk in the room the curtains automatically open and the entire room is ran off of one panel. Once you get the hang of it, it is quite easy to use. It was my friend's birthday, and the hotel sent up chocolate covered strawberries and a couple little desserts up to the room which was a nice touch. The spa was amazing. It was really clean, well laid out, and the hottubs and saunas where fantastic. It was a great way to spend the afternoon reading a book and relaxing. The beds where fantastic, I slept like I was at home. The restaurants, all the food was amazing, but it was a little pricey. So check it out before you go.

The hotel holds a 5 Diamond award from AAA, and the property definitely lived up to this rating. We arrived Saturday around 6pm. Our bags were collected outside and brought to our room once we dialed down. Right away I noticed the attention to detail and outstanding architecture of this mega hotel. The receptionist Maria was extremely kind and checked us in very fast. She also helped us navigate the hotel using a map. As a frequent traveler to Las Vegas, I have come to expect long lines at Check-in no matter what hotel. Luckily, we did not experience any wait. However, I think it was due to the fact our plane arrived a bit earlier before the rush hour 10-11 pm range. We reserved a room with two queen beds. As we entered the room, the T.V turned on and the curtains opened to reveal a nice floor to ceiling view of Vdara and the Cosmopolitan. The room also featured a cool high tech touch screen remote that controlled everything from lights, wake-up calls, curtains and the T.V. The beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was huge. In terms of dining, Aria definitely has the most options out of any hotel on the strip. There must have been at least 8 fine dining and 8 casual restaurants including the buffet. We ate at both Cafe Vettro and the Buffet for breakfast. Both were pretty good. I also had the chance to enjoy the massive pool complex. The Breeze Cafe is a nice place to get a quick lunch, but it was only opened on the weekends which was a little frustrating as I could only get lunch there one of the days of my stay. I thought the gym was top class with a plentiful amount of strength and cardio machines. There was also a really nice lounge outside the gym with a nice fire place to relax. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Aria. I took advantage of Aria's central location and proximity to Crystals shopping mall. I believe Aria's location in City Center gives the hotel an advantage in comparison to other hotels like Wynn. While Wynn is a great property, its location is impractical for a visitor and not convenient. Lastly, the service at Aria stood out to me. Everyone was extremely kind and helpful. If I were to come back to Vegas, there is no doubt I will choose Aria!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, TX", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing - proceed with caution.\u201d", "Author": "wineismylife", "ReviewID": "UR126390433", "Content": "March 7th through 10th, 2012 UPDATE I reviewed the Aria Resort & Casino almost one year . A few things have changed since that review so I thought I\u2019d post a quick update based on this visit. Personnel Generally everybody I came in contact with that worked for the hotel was friendly and helpful, always taking the time to say hello, ask how I was doing and occasionally asking if there was anything else I needed along the way. The housekeeping staff did a good job cleaning the room again this time including at least one follow up call from a supervisor to specifically check in to make sure the room was being cleaned to my satisfaction. Front Desk The front desk has service issues. It was bad enough during this visit it made me think at least twice about staying here again. The biggest issue was the wait. There wasn\u2019t a single time that I needed to visit the front desk that I had to wait a fairly significant amount of time. It didn\u2019t matter how many personnel manned the front desk there was always a line that seemed to crawl at all times. I arrived 3 hours before the official check in time. After waiting in the long line where other patrons seemed to think they could move freely back and forth between agents when a spot opened regardless of the fact you happen to be standing in that line. I finally managed to get a very pleasant front desk agent that took all of my information, checked me into the hotel and finally let me know there were no rooms available at the moment. OK, I can handle being asked to wait if I\u2019m early (it wasn\u2019t a problem the year before) but I am dumbfounded and quite frankly annoyed when I\u2019m told I can\u2019t have a room while the patrons on both sides of me at the time did get rooms but the gentleman two agents down was also denied. If you don\u2019t have rooms available then OK, you don\u2019t have rooms available. But don\u2019t hand them out willy nilly according to some mystic assignment system that irritates half of your guests with that all important very first impression. I received my call two hours later (I requested a text yet received a call) so after wrapping up my leisurely lunch I returned to the front desk and once again encountered the long and extremely slow lines which included the dedicated key pickup line I was supposed to be using. Finally I managed to secure an agent from the VIP guest line (I was here as part of a trade show) so I grabbed my keys and headed off for the half mile walk to my room, irritation number two from the front desk finally behind me. I swipe my key and barreled into my room ready to finally get some much needed work done and quite frankly I was shocked at what I encountered: the room was already occupied. Open luggage in the corner, used bath robes on the bed and half empty water glasses spread across the room. Once it dawned on me what was happening I quickly vacated the room before somebody walked in on me and called security thinking me a thief or a pervert. So I made the half mile track back down to the front desk and you guessed it: I hit the long slow line for the third time. Ultimately I get not one but three very embarrassed front desk agents wondering how in the hell I was issued keys to the wrong room. I did eventually secure my keys to the correct room and made the half mile walk back to the correct room to wait on my carry-on bags to be delivered to my room which I wouldn\u2019t have needed to check in the first place if they had my room ready the first time. Strike three front desk. You officially hacked me off. So in summary I\u2019d say at the minimum Aria management needs to actually stand out there in front of their front desk for hours on end if need be and determine exactly where the system is breaking and take the corrective action before they start losing patrons. They probably have already lost some. Facilities The facilities continue to be in good condition showing little signs of wear and tear including the all important room condition. I still enjoy the rooms overall. Being a bit of a high tech kind of personality, I love being able to control all aspects of my room from the HVAC temperature to opening the curtains to watching the flat panel TV with a push of a button. If I have any complaints about the room itself it would be the HVAC seemed to have a problem with a sensor which prevented it from holding temperature right at 72 degrees. One degree above or below would work but 72 on the dot would swing constantly between 74 and 68 at times. The common facilities such as the casino floor, restaurants, lobbies and the like all seem to still be in really good condition. Clientele This visit was by far and away dominated by some of the rudest people I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of sharing a hotel with over the past few years. I couldn\u2019t believe the general state of rudeness I bore witness to by my fellow travelers. I have no idea why it was so heightened but it certainly was (could it be the NASCAR race in town this weekend? One wonders). I will be the first person to admit you cannot hold Aria reliable for the jerk behavior of their patrons but I only mention this because they need to be aware of it as well as you, my fellow traveler. It is something to be observed, monitored and if not ultimately corrected in some manner avoided by switching to other properties.

Like most Vegas hotels, you could probably spend your entire trip in just 1 hotel, because it has a casino, multiple restaurants, and lots of boutique shops. However, it is also centrally located, so it's easy to walk to Bellagio, Paris hotel, the Venetian, etc. Our room was only on the 3rd floor, so there wasnt much of a view, but it was very quiet despite its closeness to the casino and facing the street (FYI they wanted us to pay $30/night extra for a higher room, so we opted to stay where we were). As others have mentioned, the rooms are super high tech, with everything controlled with an ipad-like device, so you can set your thermostat, window shades, tv, and lights, all in one place. I found it a bit frustrating though, that you cant just turn on a lamp if you wanted to by flicking the switch. The room itself for a \"standard\" was spacious, the bathroom had 2 sinks, and areas for the toilet and shower/tub. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on in a hotel. They have valet as well as self-park, we ended up just doing self-park because we thought it was faster, but either way, there is plenty of parking. Note, from self-park to the hotel lobby is quite the trek all the way through the casino...it may be best to just do the valet. I have to take off a star because of the insane \"resort fees\" that alot of the hotels in Vegas like to tack on, and it apparently really only covers wi-fi and the pool - which wasnt even open when we were there!

Location: location cannot be beat. You are right next to the Cosmopolitan and Monte Carlo, with Bellagio, Paris, Caesear's, Planet Hollywood and other popular resorts within a very short walk. There is also a monorail (free) that will take you between Aria and Monte Carlo/Bellagio. Shopping/Entertainment: Among the finest in Las Vegas. More of a higher end clientele (Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc.), but fun to window shop non the less. There's also a few other shops inside the resort itself, but also higher end for the most part. There is a new Cirque du Soleil \"Elvis\" show that we did not get to see, but heard great reviews. Food: something for everyone. There's a cafe that caters to all tastes, but then you also have your quick bar-food restaurant, tapas, and a couple others.

There's also a very nice and cozy pastry/dessert bar for your favorite up of morning joe, all the way up to some of the most elaborate wedding cakes you'll ever see.

Very clean and well equiped for their \"standard\" (aka deluke king) room, having some interesting features like remote operated blinds, lights, tv, etc. We did get to see a room with a view - so if you can swing it, you should.

I do believe, however, that these 'resort fees' in small print are absurd and misleading. Just increase the quoted rate by $25 and be done with the games. This is a MGM scam (some other properties do this as well-shame on them too). The roon was decent, but not fabulous. Gripes: 1) At night, room dark even w/all lights on. 2) The lack of outlets near the bed was problematic, as we needed cellphones to be on charge near us, a CPAP, etc. (hint: if you take all 10 pillows off bed, there is an outlet centered behind the king bed: gotta reach down there blind & hope no sharp objects) 3) The electronics were cumbersome and rather silly.

Even the public bathrooms are beautiful! The breakfast buffet is well worth the money. We could not believe the fresh offerings on the buffet. There is usually a short wait for the buffet so budget your time wisely. There are several pools from which to choose. It appears that families frequent one pool, couples and singles the other pools. It was hard to find a lounge chair during the peak of the day, but the pools were crisp and relaxing. There is poolside bar service, but it is pricey!

Before I choose a hotel in Vegas I checked out TA and the reviews were mixed. I figured for my first time in LV to celebrate my BDay, I wanted to choose one of the best hotels and I have to say I was not disappointed. Yes you do notice the vanilla smell each time you step into the hotel, but after a minute or two you dont notice. Yes you do have to walk the Casio floor before you get to your suites, but I noticed that was with other hotels I visted, no drama there. Upon Check-In I asked for an upgrade and I got one, Level 17, my view was the M. Carlo not bad at all. The room was nice, clean, modern and bed was very comfortable. The only thing I didnt like was that lighting was not bright enough for me. Hotel is green & they use less watts. You can control everything by remote control, curtains, tv, lighting and check-out, not difficult to use, even for someone like me. I didnt open the mini-bar as all reviews mentioned as soon as you open the door you break the seal and upon check-out there is some sort of cost. Aria's location on the strip is very central. Upon check-out at 11am I asked if I could stay a bit longer and I got 1 hour complementary. When I need to confirm my flight dtls, front desk confirmed and checked me in for my Int'l flight to Sydney, all I had to do was collect my boarding passes upon check-out, this was great. I personally didnt enjoy the morning buffet here, I only went once. Over all I luved my first stay in LV @ Aria, I will be back.

We were Vegas virgins and picked the Aria based on the ratings on TA. Upon arrival at the resort we headed to check-in. The process took entirely too long in my opinion. Maybe it was just a busy weekend and it was first thing in the morning, but seriously we only had two people in front of us and it took like a half hour just to get to the front. After we had checked in we used the map they gave us to find our way to our rooms on the ninth floor. I will say one really nice thing about the Aria is how it is so unlike the other casinos. Navigating is so much easier. They have great signage and everything is in a straight line (for the most part). Getting to the room can be quite the walk though once you are upstairs. The room was beautiful. However, the greeting did not work for us. Apparently when you walk into your room for the first time the TV is supposed to turn on to the room controls, the curtains are supposed to open and lights turn on etc. Nada for us. Kinda disappointed, but not a huge deal. We had a few issues with the room. The first night I went to have a shower and we had no bars of soap. Tried using the shower gel and didn't like it. Barely made a lather. I left a note for housekeeping the next morning asking for soap, which they did leave for us. The next night the TV system was broken. We tried watching TV and it would keep going to a white screen and then back to the room controls. It was so annoying. Then the last night our curtains closed and that opened them on the other end a bit. I would say that the system while really neat has too many kinks that need to be worked out. Like when I press a button to close the blinds why does it turn the lights off on my wife who is in the bathroom. The great things about the ARIA are the staff, the bakery, and the beds. The staff are very courteous and poilte. We talked to everyone from restaurant staff to housekeepers, to front of house and pit bosses. The best of them though are the bell staff. When we checked out we gave our bags to the bell services to store for us. The guy (don't remember his name) asked us how we were getting to the airport. We told him we were cabbing it and he told us how we could skip the taxi line. He was a huge help. The bakery was delicious. We had crepes for breakfast one day YUMMY! And the last day there we had gelato which was equally as delicious. The absolute best thing about this resort are the beds. We came home wanting to find out what kind of beds they use. The pillow top mattress was super soft (which we loved) and the pillows they used were great. It was like sleeping on a cloud. The only thing I didn't care for was the duvet cover. The opening for it seemed to be right where my feet were and a couple times i got all tangled in it. All in all our stay was great, but it was filled with little hiccups here and there. We would stay again though.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay at the Aria\u201d", "Author": "RedFi", "ReviewID": "UR126140215", "Content": "I stayed at the Aria March 1st through March 4th. It was a girls' weekend celebrating two upcoming weddings, so we treated ourselves and stayed in corner suite rooms at the Aria. Here are a few of my thoughts on our stay: Corner Suites - The configuration of the rooms differed, and two were great (on the 300 wing and on the 000 wing), but one was only so-so (the 200 wing). The configuration in room 15246 was awful - lots of useless space, and the closet was in the bathroom and not in the bedroom. A real pain. Like many people note, the walk to the room can be quite far, and this is definitely true for the corner suite. However, the walk to the room on the 300 wing was significantly shorter - if getting a corner suite, I would request one on the 300 wing. The great thing for us was that the corner suite does include a refrigerator, which was nice for keeping water / pop cold. (Note - there are not any pop machines on the hotel floors!) My room (#22042) had a 'premium' view, and I think the mountain view is just as nice - it is definitely not worth paying more to 'upgrade' from mountain view. Staff - The staff was all great - very friendly throughout my stay - from check-in to check-out, they were excellent. Housekeeping / Turndown service - All of the rooms were in good condition when we checked in, although the mini-bar in my room had not been restocked by the time I checked in, and I was worried about being charged for a previous guest's snacks, but there was no issue whatsoever when I spoke to the gentleman who was restocking the minibar. The bathroom toiletries were great - they had a full kit of all you might need - including toothpaste and a shaving kit. (I'm not sure if this is only in the corner suite or not). The shampoo / conditioner / lotion was okay, but not great - not as high quality as I previously received at the Venetian, for example. The turndown service was hit or miss - we didn't get it every night. Food / Coffee - As many people have noted, there are limited cheap food options at the Aria. Like many resorts in Vegas, there aren't any coffee machines in the room, so you have to buy coffee in the morning. As I discovered on my first morning, the coffee shops at the Aria don't open until after 6:00 a.m., which is late for those who are jet-lagged and looking for coffee. I did find an open Starbucks at the Monte Carlo at 6:00 a.m. (in the food court, not in the mall - that one didn't open until later). The Jean Philippe Patisserie also had coffee once it opened - and is immediately adjacent to the guest elevators. The lines were always quite long, but you can get coffee at the store registers without much of a line. I was very unimpressed with the Patisserie - I had the worst almond croissant I've ever had there. We had some nice paninis at Sweet Chill - kind of expensive ($12), but very tasty. We also had a great breakfast at the buffet on Friday. The buffet is a good deal for weekday breakfast, but expensive for weekend brunch. We also ate at the Todd English PUB, which was good, but expensive, pub food. They do have a happy hour from 3:00-6:00, which would make the prices much more reasonable. For cheap eats, the best advice is to walk over to the Monte Carlo's food court, which is only about a five-minute walk away. Parking / Driving - The self-parking was very easy and we always managed to find a good parking space. Park on level 2 rather than level 1 and you won't have to take an elevator to access the casino. Check-in / Check-out There was sufficient staff working the counters when we checked in, as well as a manager-type person helping people. We managed to get our room a little early on Thursday (roughly 2:00 p.m.) and quite early on Friday (roughly noon). For an extra fee $112, we got a late check-out on Sunday, which was definitely worth it since we had the red-eye flight back to Minnesota. Pool - One pool was open for most of our visit along with the hot-tub. The pool area was very nice and not too busy because it wasn't super-warm yet. The staff at the pool were friendly and attentive. The pool area was really nicely landscaped and gave a nice view of the property. I was quite impressed with it. Location / Access to Strip - The Aria is back from the Strip, so it is a walk to get out to the real hustle and bustle, but it's not that far. It's a fairly easy walk from the Aria to Monte Carlo / NYNY to the south and to the Bellagio to the north. You can also take the tram to Bellagio / Monte Carlo, but by the time you've walked to the station within the Bellagio, you might as well walk the whole way! If you have any mobility concerns, this may not be the resort for you - there definitely is a lot of walking (but that's true of most places in Vegas!) Bed- I had heard all of the great things about the Aria bed. I thought it was okay, but not great - not firm enough for my liking. I also found it very hot to sleep on - I can't imagine what it would be like during the summer! Electronic Rooms I had read all about the fancy electronic controls for the Aria rooms. They're kind of fun, but not that big a deal. The panel next to the bed was kind of annoying because the screen was so bright, it had to be covered in order to get dark enough for sleep. The room descriptions claimed that you could attach an .mp3 player to the tv and play music, but we were unable to get the system to work in any of the rooms. If you want to play music, you may want to bring your own docking station. Casino - The casino is very dark, and quite quiet. The beverage service was hit or miss - depends on luck apparently. There is a good selection of machines, but they seemed quite tight. The table games all appeared rather sedate - this doesn't seem like a casino for a rollicking good time - more like one for sedate and elegant gambling! Overall thoughts - The Aria is a nice modern resort with a lot of (expensive) amenities. I'm glad to have stayed here, but I doubt I'd revisit. I far prefer the more luxurious feel of other resorts like the Venetian or the Wynn. It is very modern, which is just not really my taste - in some ways it felt very much like a larger version of a W hotel that you'd find in any big city. Not the easiest place to stay if you want to casino hop, but is a good location if you want to basically stay put within the City Center complex.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cnot happy\u201d", "Author": "Yodapeanut", "ReviewID": "UR126117387", "Content": "we stayed at the Aria again this year and we were terrible disappointed.

This time decided to give the Aria a try. So the comments that follow are purely by comparison to the other upscale strip properties. Stayed in a 1 BR Sky Suite where they limo you from the airport to the private drive and checkin- very nice touch, similar to Wynn and Encore. The room was everything one would expect for these upper tier properties. Pretty spacious, exquisite bathroom, bed super comfortable, excellent turn down service- the best chocolates in a little package. I'm not one for all the hi tech \"control-everything-via-remote\" extras (just give me a few wall buttons for the lights, curtains, temperature and I'm good), but I can see how this would add to the overall 'cool' experience for some. I never did figure out what 'room off' and 'room on' actually did! Not sure if I really liked the heated toilet seat or not. Also, at night I couldn't get the room bright enough for my liking, even with every lamp turned on high. While very similar, I would say that I would rate the Wynn LV and the Venetian/Palazzo rooms slightly ahead of Aria. Like the rooms, I found the overall property to be very dark and a little dreary contributing to a very dull and empty vibe, or lack of vibe. The casino is very much like this, dark lighting and all the tables very spread out which I thought really sucks out the energy. So didnt care for the casino at all. Very surprised that the sportsbook is fairly small. We did see Cirque du Soleil Viva Elvis which will be closing soon. Had heard mixed reviews but we felt it was pretty decent, well worth seeing, although not as good as Beatles Love, \"O\" , or Mystere. Did go for a massage at the Spa which was just ok and fairly ordinary- it has everything but nothing especially memorable I would say. Encore is the best Spa on the strip. It is a rather large property and has that sort of large cavernous feel to it, lots of high ceilings and big walls - much prefer the warmer intimacy of Bellagio and Wynn. Overall, I would rate Aria with Mirage and Mandalay Bay - behind Wynn, Encore, Bellagio (which desperately needs room renovations) and Palazzo/Venetian.

The standard rooms are a little smaller than average, but the bed was very comfortable, and our 21st floor room with floor to ceiling windows provided a stunning view. Water pressure in the showers was terrible, but that was the only real complaint about the room. High points: The pool area is fantastic and the restaurants are top-quality - we ate at Julian Serrano and Todd English, both outstanding. Service was great everywhere and the staff was very accommodating, even with our one bad experience - see below. The casino is huge and unlike many other places, Aria doesn't staff to the bare minimum, so there's rarely a wait for anything. Low points: Signage could be better. The casino, promenade, and Crystals (shops area) has an odd layout on two levels and it's very easy to get lost - we were there three days and still got turned around constantly. Stay away from the Breeze Cafe (outside the pool area). Our entire party either returned their food for a refund or threw it away. To their credit, no questions were asked on the refund. The $85 resort fee for a three night stay is exorbitant for what you get. Advice: If you're looking to eat and gamble on a budget, this is not the place for you.

The bar right of Casino floor and by cashier has excellent martinis! The sportsbook is very nice with a good little restaurant located near it. The buffet near pool is decent. Certainly not one of Vegas best. The Pool area is nice with the adult pool being excellent! I did not give this a 5 star because of the restaurants. Very disappointed in the food to be honest. Sirio , the Italian rest., very pricey and just not very good. American Fish, ok not great, and the steakhouse just not even worth going into IMO. Cafe Vettro is just not worth the money either. Outrageously overpriced for what you get. There are 100's of better options on the strip for eating and Aria needs to improve in this area.

We loved the audio/video control panel - very unique feature. It controls everything - TV, lights, curtains, even your \"Do Not Disturb\" notice! The staff were very helpful and courteous. The casino is not as large compared to other resorts in Vegas, but it still has everything you need to have a good time. Aria has a large selection of restaurants, with both resonably-priced and more expensive options. The Buffet has a great breakast/brunch. Lemongrass Restaurant is just amazing. The food was incredible and priced just right. Make sure you check out the adjoining City Center. It is simply amazing. So many high-end shops and more great restaurants to check out. As far as Vegas shows are concerned, you can't beat Cirque de Soleil's \"O\". So original - we were blown away! For those who want a break from the city, I highly recommend visiting Red Rock Canyon. We booked it with Pink Jeep Tours, who are awesome. It's a 4-hour trip and they pick up/drop off at Aria. What's great about Pink Jeep is that the tour groups are small - no more than 10 people.

Last saw this hotel on a previous trip when it was still under construction. The development looked special then and now it's finished it is beautiful. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. Any issues were responded to promptly and courteously. The casino floor is huge with many tables and machines. There shouldn't be a problem finding somewhere to play. The minimum play is usually $15 for things like blackjack which can get pricey if you're just playing for fun. We stayed in an ordinary room which is more than ample as a base. The bed was huge and so comfortable. Everything can be controlled from a panel next to the bed. You can open the curtains, change the lighting, tv etc without getting up. The shower space is big with a bath at the back. The minibar prices are steep. $5 for water or coke. Even a bag of crisps was $5 but there is a shop a short walk down the strip where you can stock up for much cheaper. The gym is lovely. Towels and water provided. There are many cardio machines as well as weights. There must have been 15 running machines so there shouldn't be a queue and when I went in the afternoon there were around 7/8 people there. The poker tournament is $125 at 1pm and 7pm. It's always popular and they can take hours. My husband played in a tournament of 120 and when he came back to the room 5 hours later the remaining 29 players were still going! Crystals shopping centre is very nice. Lots of high end stores for a treat. Beso steakhouse is a lovely place to eat. It's Eva Longoria's restaurant and the decor is elegant and the food delicious. I had the lobster and my husband had the chilli rubbed steak. One of the best meals we have ever eaten. Because of the lobster it cost around $220 but there is a selection of cheaper options which looked equally delicious. In the Aria we ate at Julian Serrano, a tapas style restaurant with a casual fun feel to it. The menu is extensive and you wont run out of things you want to try. There are seared scallops, lobster salad, paella, meatballs and so many more. Some of the dishes are very small, others are quite generous. Our bill was $170 for a bottle of wine and about 7 dishes. You can keep adding dishes if you wish. The food here was spectacular. It was beautifully presented and each dish was as delicious as the next. We have stayed in Vegas 5 times at different places and this one will take some beating. The location was perfect, very central. There is a free monorail to the Bellagio and you can walk under cover to the Monte Carlo.

Pretty simple. First and foremost, a hotels top priority is to ensure their guests can get a good nights sleep. It simply does not happen at the Aria. Not in my last 2 trips anyway. Let the review begin! The hotel: The only thing the Aria does well is greet their guests by their first or last name. It's sad really but you can tell the employees there are underpaid. They lack both common sense, and experience. Simple requests go unanswered, likely because they are not understood. I have NEVER gotten a good nights sleep at the Aria. This is usually due to some form of noise. The first trip the noise was due to the nightclub Haze. Knowing this I decided to book during the week when the club was closed. Would I get a good nights sleep this trip? Nope. This trip the culprit happened to be the housekeeping staff. Noisily cleaning rooms at 1am. Slamming doors. Slamming their vacuum cleaners into the wall. I understand the need to clean rooms at all hours due to the enormity of the hotel. However at later hours care should be taken to keep noise to a minimum. It's funny the rooms have such comfortable beds yet what good are they when you can hear loud banging noises even when wearing earplugs? Also be warned that everything is extremely overpriced. This hotel really is suckerville. $5.00 for Tylenol. $3.00 for a bottle of generic water. $8.00 for cookies. Mind you these are prices in their gift shop. You get 10 percent off if you are one of the suckers with a gold or platinum MLife players card (yes I am one of these fools). PS if you happen to have a players card and wish to get their oh so generous discount they ask you for ID like you're a criminal. Ya, I am trying to rip you off of a discount that barely covers the tax on your overpriced sundries. Anyway, I digress. I feel bad for anyone paying to stay in the hotel. I pay nothing due to the fact that I gamble, but likely will never stay again. On to the casino.... The casino: Tight, High Limits, Tight, You Can't Win, You Won't Have Fun That pretty much sums it up. Anyone who gambles more than $20.00 at the Aria is a complete and utter idiot. 90 percent of the table games have a minimum of $50.00 per hand, with many at or above $100.00. I guess the people who spend $3.00 on a bottle of water would likely play here. The slots are beyond tight. No payback whatsoever. Also terrible selection of machines. Get a roll of quarters and flush them down one of their electronic toilets. You likely will have more entertainment from watching the toilet overflow. The valet: Rude and indifferent. When I am picking up my car from valet at a supposed 5 star resort I expect to be both greeted and have my door closed. Not here. (yes I gave a tip) The valet guy might have well told me to screw off. I guess I deserved that kind of treatment it for being one of the suckers patronizing this place to begin with. Long story short. There is no fun to be had at the Aria. It's dark, depressing, and noisy. Setting your money on fire will yield far more entertainment.

We always had excellent experiences there from start to finish and there were certain areas of Aria that were disappointed. We arrived around 10pm and then have a long counter desk for checking people in. They had plenty of people working and helping people, but there was a line forming of maybe 5-7 couples, no one was standing around to direct. There was no velvet rope or anything to keep the line together and finally someone came over and said 'there's not one line, just go ahead and line up behind someone else at the counter' -- well this seemed a bit silly because you have no idea how long these people have been up there, who's going to finish first, etc. So we got behind someone and waited, and waited, I went to get drinks ($59 for 2 double red bull-vodkas!!!!) and came back and he still wasn't being helped. Finally we got up there and were given a room on the 4th floor - this seems crazy so we asked for a higher room and they said they were full but we could move tomorrow. We had paid for an upgraded room so we decided to suck it up and at least check it out. We sadly had to walk into the elevator bank for the lowest floor levels. We walk into the room and are overlooking a roof... what?! this can't be an upgraded room. My husband called down and after inquiring, they told us that we were in a standard room, not the deluxe room we had paid for, because they were sold out. Honesty is the best policy with me and this really rubbed me the wrong way, were they hoping we wouldn't notice? They moved us up to the 34 floor into an accessible room, which had a much nicer view, but only one sink in the bathroom, no tub, etc. They said we could move the next day. We had more problems the next day, with only rooms on low floors and finally decided to just stay in the room we were in. This whole process was disappointing though. They did end up comping us the difference between the standard room and the deluxe though. We had room service and that was very good. They brought a whole pitcher of water which was nice and the breakfast burrito was good and my husband liked his eggs. We went to the pool for a little bit, it took me 30 minutes to flag someone down for a drink. We caught someone's eye about 15 minutes in but she told my husband she wasn't our waitress... We got the big 32-oz drink which was like $60 or something crazy. The public areas are nice and the room were also nice (high tech with auto drapes and lights - the lights were hard to figure out though). i think it's a good option, but I don't like how they handled our room situation and you can definitely see a difference in service between this place and somewhere like Wynn.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel near all the action\u201d", "Author": "steveg007", "ReviewID": "UR125756765", "Content": "We had a wonderful 3 night stay at the beginning of March at the Aria.

First impressions were very positive, beautiful decor, very modern and attractive, but this impression didn't last long. Our room was lovely and clean, no complaints there, but subtle details detracted from the overall experience. The bathtub was in the shower stall (?), towels were on the rough and scratchy side, toiletries were sub-par (shampoo and conditioner left my hair a rat's nest). Technology in the room was unneccessary and confusing, would have loved to have just been able to switch a lamp on instead of having to search through the panel to figure it out. Accidentally hit the \"goodnight\" button and EVERYTHING in the room turns off, what a pain having to go around and turn everything on one by one again.... I soon realized that this hotel is just too big. With over 4000 rooms, there were line ups everywhere, often 50 people deep, just to get something at the bakery. It took forever to get anywhere and the crowds were annoying. I had to walk past 115 rooms to get to the ice machine on my floor. Crazy stupid. I wasn't too thrilled with the restaurants either. I don't eat rabbit or fois gras and avoid restaurants that serve it, which left me with nothing. We did have a meal at Blossom and it was great and they even gave us free dessert because we were celebrating our anniversary. Had dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse and was very dissapointed. We waited 45 minutes between our appetizers and our meal, and when our steak was served, not all of our sides were ready, but came out half way through our dinner. The steak was good, but not great, the fries were overcooked and dry. The brussel sprouts were downright nasty. the only good thing was the truffle frites. They did not charge us for our late sides and gave us a free dessert, but even the free dessert was unimpressive. All in all, way over-priced, way under-expectation. Staff were always courteous, helpful and pleasant and accomodated every request. But I found they were apologizing for many things. I very much appreciated the combined resort fee of $25 a day that covered all wifi services, parking and valet services - other hotels charge enormous separate fees for these things. Location was great, views, not so much. I'm not a gambler and was never in the casino, but it did seem lovely and fun. All in all, the Aria was just too big and too busy.

After calling down to the front desk, I was told that security would be up right away- they weren't. In fact, they took so long to come, they made me late for a meeting I was scheduled to be at. They then looked at my fresh bites, and said it was clear that they were bites- very possibly bed bugs- and said they would have to move me to another room. They apologized and said they would take care of everything. I was Ok with that, as I understand that, \"stuff happens\", and that they would do their best to make the situation right. They didn't. They proceeded to move me, but there was no, \"Sorry for your inconvenience\", or even a \"Here's a small token to help make this right\"- nothing. I called down and asked if there was anything they could do and eventually, they agreed to give me a $100 food and beverage voucher for my trouble. OK, not great, but I'll take it. Again, I'm not here to cause trouble or be obnoxious, that's not my nature. So I fly home. Then, on March 5th, I get a letter from the Aria and Denise Chilipka-Oltay who is in Risk Management, saying that they hope I enjoyed my visit, but they checked the room, didn't find bugs, and they will, \"respectfully deny all any and all claims associated with this incident.\" What a bunch of jerks. I hadn't planned on filing anything in the first place, but this response letter has me on a mission to make sure that any future business my rather large host company was planning will NOT happen. There's a right and wrong way to treat people- especially people that could have made a huge deal out of this and DIDN'T. This was their way of making this right- by sending me a \"CYA\" letter. Add to that, the Aria itself reminds me of an upscale suburban mall- while beautiful, it simply lacks character which would make the hotel interesting. If you wander it for any length of time, you can pretty much see it and realize there's not a lot to do other than eat and gamble and watch an Elvis show, which I didn't do. So in conclusion, while there I got bug bites of SOME nature, got moved and offered nothing in return, then told that if I did come home and have problems- which it turns out I did- that I was on my own.

My first impression was somewhat of a \"wow\" factor, with its contemporary looks and high reliance on technology. After being in the hotel for only a few moments, I thought that this must be what hotels would look like in the Jetsons era. But. High technology may be important to some people -- and I am truly a techno-geek, by all means -- but here it's beyond the point of user-friendly. From perfect key placement to open the front door to figuring out how to operate the lights, television, etc. it felt a little overdone. (Okay, a LOT overdone.) My first room wasn't \"functional\" in terms of the technology, so I had to be moved to another room where I encountered several other glitchy issues -- room phones not working, the remotes on the blinds, etc. working sporadically, lamps non-functional, inconvenience of outlet placement, and so forth. Yes, there are operations instructions in the room -- many of them -- but after a looong day on airplanes, it took a while to find the answers I needed. And even then, sometimes following the operations instructions didn't work. Some of my coworkers said they struggled with trying to figure everything out. The decor is beautiful. I love how the rooms feel contemporary and retro at the same time. The rest of the hotel is so eclectic, as parts of it feel like a traditional shopping district, while others are more like an upscale, modern mall. The casino itself it pretty much like any other casino I've ever visited, but it is pretty cool, nonetheless. As with most of Las Vegas, you'll spend some money at this place, even if you don't go near the casino; nothing is cheap. I have to say that service was good during my visit; everyone was professional, courteous, and helpful, although just a tad \"rehearsed\". But they did their jobs well, and that's what matters. If you want casual, warm and fuzzy, go elsewhere, right? So I still don't know what my final opinion is.

I have stayed at Wynn, Bellagio, & Venetian and preferred all of them over the Aria. Why go to Vegas and stay in hotel that feels so generic and corporate. We live in NYC and the Aria reminded us of the mall at Columbus Circle-all glass and metal-it\u2019s looks like a bank headquarters, modern hotel, or fancy mall that you would come across in any international city. It felt sterile and boring except for the entrance waterfall and the pool area. Since the hotel is set back from the strip the views are not great. Maybe they are better on the highest floors, but we had a suite on the 18th floor, and then a room on the 33rd floor, and neither had a great view of the strip. Many reviewers mention the technology panel as a negative-I agree-I wanted to take a vacation from my smart phone etc but found I spent way too much time dealing with the technology panel-it drove me nuts at times. And I took my ipod and the audio cable that I read you need to enable it to play it through their AV system (as there is no regular ipod dock) and I still couldn\u2019t get my ipod to work. The blackout blinds in both rooms we stayed in had gaps so light came in. In one room the sun would come right in my eye at sunrise. We had an issue with our room/customer service that marred our particuar stay. Read on if you are interested in the details. Otherwise stay here if you want a place that is sleek and un-Vegas like, that is located mid-strip; and stay elsewhere if you want a place with some character, color, Vegas pizazz. When we checked in for three nights we were told that the room we booked, a king city view-was not available and all they had for us was a two queen bed room on the 7th floor. So we ended up being upsold to a Crystal suite city view, on 18th floor, for $100 extra per night. In hindsight they probably should have offered us the upgrade for free. The next day we ended up repacking and moving to the original category room we booked, on the 33rd floor, as we did not like the suite. The suite floor plan made no sense, as all the furniture in the living room and in the bedroom was turned the opposite way from the view, and hundreds of other Aria hotel rooms could see right into our bedroom and bathroom so we had to keep the blinds closed if we wanted any privacy. And the room was dirty, for example there were noticeable stains on the couch and seat-it looked like someone had a 'party' before we had the room-definitely needed a steam clean-gross; and the technology panel that controlled all the lighting & curtains etc was covered in food/fingerprint smudges. They didn\u2019t have the new room ready for us until the end of the second day. They did say however that they would credit us back the extra $100 we paid for the suite on the first night. We had to go back to the front desk the day after we moved rooms as the $100 was still showing up on our bill (you can view your bill thru the TV). By then we had been dealing with this issue for two days-not good when you only have three days vacation.

Day one went well, but everything quickly went downhill from there. We arrived on the last Sunday in February and like everyone else were amazed at how beautiful the resort was. At check in we were upgraded to a city view room on the top floor and upon entering our room were blown away by our surroundings. We opened the door and the lights slowly turned on, music begins to play, and the curtains open revealing a breathtaking view of the strip. Things begin to go downhill the next. We were on our way to the parking garage to go drive out to the Mob Museum downtown, cross the bridge from the casino and start walking down the aisle to the car. We get to the other side of the garage and realize that we had parked on the floor below the night before and needed to take the elevator down after getting crossing the bridge. At this point we are right next to the stairs so instead of walking all the way back across the parking garage we decide to just take the stairs and be let out right next to our car. In the stairwell we go down a floor to find the door, covered in footprints from people trying to kick it in, is locked. We go to the bottom floor, where the door opens and lets us out to what appears to be the back of the resort. Looking around and not sure which way to go to get back into the parking garage, or at this point just anywhere we recognize, we see stairs leading up to the monorail and decide we can just take the monorail back to the casino. Halfway up the stairs a security truck drives and he by asks if he can help us get where we are going. Thankful that someone has driven by we tell him what happened, at which point he sighs heavily, rolls his eyes, and tells us that we can't get to the monorail because the gate at the top of the stairs is locked and the only way to get back to our car is to walk up through the service tunnel and then back down the main self-park tunnel to our car, which i realize neither of which have sidewalks. This supposed to be a AAA four diamond resort. What he should have done is unlocked the monorail gate for us or called someone to give us a ride back to our car if for no other reason than to make sure we got back to our car safety. Instead, he drives off and we start walking up the first tunnel. Coming out of the first tunnel I realize that he means for us to walk down the main entrance of the Aria self parking tunnel, which is off the left as you turn of Las Vegas Blvd, meaning we have to cross 3 lanes of traffic coming the opposite direction with no crosswalk in site, in order to get to the tunnel. Obviously, there is no way I am going to do this. We ended up having to jump the wall we were clinging to as there was no sidewalk, cross the planter that was on top, and then jump the glass partition to get to the sidewalk outside of the shopping center. While obviously we somehow ended up somewhere we weren't supposed to be, it is the Aria's job to ensure that their guests are enjoying themselves, help them find their way when they get lost, and at all time make sure their guests are safe but apparently the security guard that stopped couldn't be bothered with any of that and actually told us \"the only way\" to get back to our car was to walk across 3 lanes of busy traffic. The third day, as we were taking the elevator down to get breakfast, it decides to stop working around the 30th floor and drops us. My stomach drops and we are staring at each other frozen in place for what was probably only a few seconds before the brakes start to kick in. Trying to stop the elevator the brakes are screeching loudly and the whole elevator car is violently shaking. We are completely terrified, not knowing if the brakes are going to be able to stop is in time or if we are going to crash at the bottom. Finally it stops, and I press the help button. The screen which normally reads \"EZ\" as you are coasting between the 3rd & 30th floors now reads--, the elevator is bouncing up and down and we have no idea what floor we are on. For all we could know the elevator could drop again. For the 20-30 minutes it takes to open the doors the only thing the dispatcher seems to be able to tell us is that help is on the way. I have been stuck in an elevator before, admittedly never dropped in one, but as they are getting you out what they should have done is tell you what they are doing every step of the way so if they have to move the elevator to get you out you know it is the maintenance people and not the elevator malfunctioning again. This never happened. Anytime the elevator moved or there was a loud noise we asked what it was and she said it may be the maintenance people trying to get us out but she didn't know. Not helpful or reassuring at all. The lack of communication between us, the dispatcher, and the maintenance people was appalling and made an already terrifying experience even worse. Additionally the dispatcher told us that someone from the front desk would be there when they opened the doors, which she wasn't. We actually had to wait for her. When we got out I asked the person who opened the doors what had happened and he said he didn't know and after I asked him how far the elevator dropped his mouth fell open and dumbfounded he stares at me and said \"you dropped?\" Obviously the people in this hotel have no idea what was going on. Just happy to be out of there we go over to the ice cream shop around the corner to sit down and wait for the person from the front desk that was supposed to be there when we got out. Fully expecting our stay to be comped I was shocked when she finally arrived she and had the audacity to tell me that she was only comping one night and I had to pay for the other two nights. I was completely speechless, and when she saw I was not happy she said she would also add a $100 food and beverage credit to our room before quickly taking off. She was with us for less than 5 minutes and the whole time she would not stop looking at her iphone. Apparently she had somewhere more important to be. I was just so done with them that I filled out my statement and left. That night we get back to the room and the message light on our phone is flashing. We press the message button, but keep getting a busy signal so we call the front desk to find out what we have to do to get our message. We are hung up by the front desk 3 times before I finally demand to speak to a manager. After spending another 20 minutes on the phone with him he finally says they are having phone problems and we may not even have a message. He is going to comp us half a night for our inconvenience (and this is only after I tell him about what happened with the elevator earlier in the day) and he will find out if we actually have a message and give us a call back to let us know. We never hear from him again. The next morning we wake up and just leave, so happy to be out of there. When we get home I have a message from the assistant manager from the front desk (the person we had to wait for after getting out of the elevator) saying she was calling regarding \"the incident\" and wanted me to call her back. Thinking that she finally realized how badly they handled the situation and was calling to apologize and comp us the rest of our stay, which should have been automatic when we got of the elevator, I call back to find out she is not there. The phone number she left was for the front desk and they told me that they would make sure she got the message that I called. It has been 2 days since I called back and I have not heard anything else. At this point I am done dealing with anyone from the Aria and I am just going to tell my credit card company not to honor the charge. They could not pay me to stay there again. I got much better service at the Cosmopolitan next door and I wasn't even staying there.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville FL", "Title": "\u201cNice new hotel in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "FLtravelmom", "ReviewID": "UR125564424", "Content": "I don't go to Vegas often- it has been several years since I was last there.

The room is all wired and TV, lighting, Music and draperies can all be controlled by a small panel at the bedside. Ours was not working properly and after fussing with it for a day we asked maintenance to come and look at it. After that it was much better. At times it was kind of a pain though- techy things can be that way. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel- although several of them are very highly rated. We ate in the mornings ( light breakfast) at Jean Philippe Patisserie - all of the pastries that we had there were amazing-I looked forward to it every morning. Our first morning we were up early and did the art walking tour- it took about an hour and was very enjoyable. We kind of learned our way around the resort. There is a tram that connects the Bellagio- Aria- Monte Carlo but the tram does not actually stop at Aria- it stops at Chrystals ( the mall) next door. We found that you could actually walk via an indoor walkway ( take the escalator up in the self park entrance) to the Monte Carlo in less time than it took to get to the tram station at Chrystals. Also, if you walk outside and across Harmon Circle and enter Vdara, you can get to Bellagio very quickly as well. We enjoyed the new Chihuly gallery- and really all of the artwork on the property. our room was very nice- bed was very comfortable- shower was great. We rented a car and dropping/picking up the car at the valet was very easy and the service was very good.

The hotel is still very new and it feels classy. We tried the lounge by the casino floor, the bottle service there wasn't a bad deal and we had a good time. There are blackjack tables in the lounge but at $50 min bet there wasn't much action, the dealers just stood around most of the time. In fact, I'd have to say the casino part of the hotel overall may have been the weakest part of the whole. There are a limited number of tables, the casino floor is very small. All of the tables had a higher minimum bet compared to other casinos on the strip. The club downstairs was jumping when we went - I'm not a clubbing person but it seemed impressive in scale. The restaurants were plentiful - I have to say the cafe that runs parallel to the casino was great - open 24 hours and reasonable. I had a terrible experience at the thai restaurant though. An older waitress helped us and I asked for a 4-star spice (out of ten). She said they are very spicy dishes, so I lowered it to 3-stars. I think she singled me out to mess with me (I was the only white guy in my group) as the food that came out was easily 10 or 11 stars on their 10 star scale. My friends ordered more stars on their food and they had much milder dishes. She seemed to be smirking about it, I thought it was very unprofessional but I didn't want to make a scene and ruin my friends birthday. It was inedible. Not cool. Otherwise everyone else at the property was very friendly and helpful. The tram is convenient and close by. There is a shopping galeria adjacent to the hotel, but not many stores yet.

However, room was very dark even with all the lights switched on, made reading very difficult. And they had this touch screen panel which allowed you to control everything in the room, from lights to curtains, to tv, radio etc, which was cool to play witih for a while but became a bit of a hassle - i foresee older folks having some problems getting the hang of the touch screen. Bathroom was big, was almost the half of the room. However, the ventilation for the bathtub and shower area was not adequate, if you left the door closed throughout the day, there would be a musky smell. Also, the water flow from the taps at the wash basin was very high pressured, so much so that you will definitely splash water all over the vanity top when you wash your hands, no matter how careful you are. (I understand that this would ensure that less water is wasted, but the hotel should still look in to this). I must commend the housekeeping as they were very meticulous. They even arranged my toiletries neatly on a paper towel. Check out the next day was fast although the queue was long, it moved along rather quickly. They distributed bottles of water to waiting guests which was a nice touch. An additional thing that I want to point out was that we left our luggage with the bell counter when we left for the Grand Canyon and went back to collect it a few days later. The collection point was at a different lobby from the Aria lobby. I had to find a spot near teh valet to park the car and wait while my friends went in to collect the luggage. However, the valet drivers there had a very bad attitude and rudely insisted that I wait somewhere rather far away from the collection point, even though i explained to them why i was waiting there. And I wasnt even blocking the driveway! Not a good final impression of the hotel. All in all, I felt that Aria was nice, with a swanky exterior, lobby and room but somehow it just lacked the small things to make it truely good.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Aria!\u201d", "Author": "Travelinder", "ReviewID": "UR125371533", "Content": "We enjoyed a long weekend here with a group of friends. The hotel is new and modern. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Our view was excellent. Bathrooms are well designed and roomy. Our room was located near the end of the hallway and though it was a bit of a walk it wasn\u2019t as ridiculously long as some reviewers complain about. Seeing Vegas requires a lot of walking anyway and this took about 30 seconds longer than at most hotels. The hotel itself is very large so it takes a lot of walking to travel through the lobby or out to the pool area, etc. and we found this to be no different than at any of the other hotels were visited. Pool area is beautiful and spacious with three large pools, lush tropical landscaping and plenty of shade or sun. We were usually able to find loungers with no trouble except one early afternoon on a busy Saturday but even then we still found a group. Drinks were excellent and huge. Even though they seemed pricey they were actually a good value for the size received. Service was very good around the pool. We ate breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby on each morning and found the food and service to be excellent. There was usually a line but it moved quickly. We dined one evening in the restaurant on the other side and had a very good meal. Drinks in the casino lounge near the elevators were very good and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing. The lobby and casino area are dark and modern. Cigarette smoke wasn\u2019t noticeable unless you really paid attention to it. They do a very good job with ventilation here. We didn\u2019t gamble so I cannot comment on that. There are several good clubs in the hotel that we visited and had a great time. The location of the resort is excellent. Even though it is set back off the strip we easily walked to the Bellagio and also visited Vdara. A shopping center that is adjacent is convenient and also can serve as an air conditioned cut through to access the strip. The strip is so spread out it really is much better to take a taxi to your destination anyway and there are always plenty out front.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodland Hills,CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat as always\u201d", "Author": "freemaee", "ReviewID": "UR125369361", "Content": "This was a quick overnight on the way to Zion Park.

We had never stayed there before so we were looking forward to the stay. The check in was smooth enough. We checked in without any problems. The rooms are small but nice, Comfortable bed and high tech gadgets. The bathroom was ok but not great. Now here is my mistake. I read the mixed reviews on this place and many of the reviews said the same thing about the service. The service here is bad! The hotel itself though confusing in layout and far back from the strip is nice enough but the Hotel employees are rude and condescending. The first problem we had was when we called room service to order ice cream. The lady that took our order spoke very broken English and was hard to understand. We thought she said the order would take 15 minutes but after 35 minutes we hadn't received our order so we called. The lady very rudely said \u201cit's going to be another 20 minutes. I already told you it was going to take 50 minutes!\u201d This was at 1 am so ice cream shouldn't take 50 minutes but that's beside the point. If she spoke clear English and we heard her right we would not have ordered the ice cream. So she proceeded to scold us and told us we can cancel the order this time but if we do this again we were going to be charged! WTF is that how you talk to hotel guests that are politely calling to find out the status on our ice cream? Strike number two happened when we went downstairs to checkout and complain about the room service attendant. The checkout line was disorganized and no one seemed to know what line to get into. After 5 minutes of confusion a really angry black woman employee came out with a clip board and yelled at the guests to form 4 lines. She was really rude and unfriendly. She should try smiling and saying hello to the guests, not treating them like children. When we finally made it to the checkout line we asked to speak to a manager and the girl at the front desk told us we would have to explain to her what happened before she could do that. So see above for my gripe about room service. We proceeded to explain to her what happened and she had the nerve to tell us we should\u2019ve complained to the room service manager when the incident happened. It was almost 2 am and we were tired so we figured we would complain in the morning. She still wouldn't call a manager over even after I asked her to for the second time. She proceeded to call room service and told us that she confirmed that room service was busy and that\u2019s why it took so long. I told her that\u2019s fine if they were busy but the lady that answered the phone spoke very broken English and it's not our fault she's hard to understand. Second, she should not talk to the guest so rudely. She gave us an insincere apology and still refused to call a manager over! This is supposed to be a five star hotel. I\u2019m appalled at how they treat their guests.

All of the games and tables looked new and well taken care of. On Thursday I was able to play $15 craps. But, Friday - Sunday the minimum rose to $25. I saw the same thing for blackjack. I guess they figure that if you can afford the room then you can afford a minimum bet of $25. My bankroll was not large and at $110 a hand for craps (PL/1x odds + place bet on 6 & 8) it didn't last long. But, drink service was great. This is a great hotel with a nice casino.

Yes, the rooms were very nice..new, BEAUTIFUL views of the strip, (which we paid extra)...stayed on the 30th floor.(as other reviews, ask for highest room). nice...close to the elevator so very convenient....and all the updated amentities. Nice having two sinks in bathroom...a different bathroom with shower and tub combo (separate) but in one enclosure. Pictures on website are accurate of what you'll get. Nice electronic upgrades, however find that in many 4 star hotels/resorts (my understanding is that this is a 5 star). Downsides... it felt like the \"snack box\" and refrig were \"in your face\". Snack box took up a good part of counter space and they must have many people who \"dispute\" charges on their bill since at check in they give you a \"warning\" that refrig is very sensitive and you'll be charged. BUT, if you have a problem call immediately and they'll adjust bill. ...Not exactly a good first impression. ...Not enough outlets. If you use electronics, need phone/other chargers and bathroom applicances there are two outlets in bath and two at desk...limited. Housekeeping is late...as in most hotels in Vegas..our first night was after 7 pm. ..and then they did not replenish shampoo, shower gel, etc, no wash clothes and 3 not 4 bath towels. Had to call housekeeping the next day..which was remedied, however for a 5 star hotel should not happen. Overall the room, lobby, casino, etc. were nice, however you never got the feeling of being appreciated or happy that you were staying at the ARIA. The young gentleman, Paul, who checked us in was nice, but other than that you never really had any interaction with employees or if you did, (such as the personnel that monitored those getting on the elevators) they were not what I would consider \"top notch\". Also, for a top of the line hotel and spa, I felt the shampoos, conditioners, etc. were far from \"spa quality\" and the toliet tissue seemed like it was meant for a truck stop instead...guess they pride themselves in being \"green\" but I didn't think that meant \"cheap\". Overall, I think if you can get a room for a 3 or 4 star price, go for it. But if you have to pay a 5 star price I think there are better values for your money.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kelly0331", "ReviewID": "UR125160805", "Content": "Stayed here last march.

The location is central to the Strip, and it's an easy walk or cab ride to anywhere. The most consistent problems surround checking in and out. Check in lines are not only long, but unorganized. During times when east and west coast flights arrive, the staff seems overwhelmed with many of the positions at the desk unattended. While the clerks are friendly, the process takes an unusually long time. Check out is equally chaotic. While they tout the technology in the room, I have never been able to check out using the TV. I even proactively mentioned this to the concierge, who told me that sometimes the \"system gets overwhelmed\". I requested an email of my bill, and three days later still have not received it. Waiting in a long line to get a copy of my bill before going to the airport is not acceptable. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The housekeeping during my stay was outstanding, as was the service in the main lounge, Bar Moderno (thanks as always to Pablo, great guy and makes a terrific Mojito).

Got there about 2:00, no lines but our room wasn't ready so we were upgraded to a city view on the 25th floor which was great! Went to gamble for a couple of hours and lost quite a bit but that's not the con, it's coming. As many have already stated it is quite the hike from the elevators to our room but every time I step off the elevator I love the smell of the Aria, it smells so good. We walk into our room and again as previously stated the curtains open automatically to our arrival, that's nice. The room is modern and in darker colors. First glance the room appears to look exactly as it did online and that's good. I'm settling in and my husband says he can't believe that I haven't tried out the bed and that I was going to love it. I thought he was kidding so I sat on it and thought it felt pretty good. More on this later too. When you walk in you have two large closets on one side complete with white robes. There is a chest of drawers in between the closets. Across from the closets is the bathroom. There is a separate and private toilet area with a very tall heavy glass door, the toilet area is complete with a phone because we all know that's where we make our phone calls right? So now onto the shower/tub. I've read a lot about this and nothing I had previously read prepared me for the shower/tub combo. I was thinking it was your standard shower/tub combination that just about everyone has. Boy was I wrong. So I want to make sure you get this from my review. You open up the shower door to get in the shower complete with a rain shower head and there is a full size bathtub in there too! This is like a big closet that has a shower and beyond that is the tub and they are both separate. So if you don't get the picture you could be in the shower and someone else could be in the tub at the same time, it's just a big room with both a full size shower and a full size tub, that was a first for me. Not much else to say about the bathroom except it does have shelf space and one drawer for your stuff. In the room there is an electronic pad on one nightstand that controls everything, the curtains, the t.v., the lamps etc. All of this is up on the t.v. screen, think of the t.v. as your monitor. the room is high-tech and if you're not - well you better be a quick learner. Then there is the normal desk and bar area with a frig. All the drinks and snacks are on a sensor so you're charged if anything is moved. Later that night I finally got into bed and seriously I thought I had died and gone to heaven and that I was lying on a cloud, even the pillows felt heavenly. If you like a firm bed then this is not the hotel for you but if you like cushy then you'll be happy here. Find the M channel on your t.v. and you can learn lot about all the M properties, Bellagio, Monte Carlo, MGM, Mandalay Bay etc there's lots of good info about restaurants for a lot of M hotels. The only con with the room is that the light comes into your room at the very top of your curtains. The curtains are automatic so the light is coming in just above the track and it's bright enough to keep your room lit all night. This is really disappointing because the rest of the room is great. It won't keep me from coming though because I love the bed too much. Over-all the Aria is new, modern, and clean. I do like that you don't have to walk through the entire casino to get to the elevators but they make up for it once you get to your floor. The staff on the 25th floor was the nicest staff of any hotel I've ever stayed at. We never passed anyone that they didn't genuinely acknowledge us with a smile and a hello or good morning. I was so impressed that I called the floor housekeeping supervisor up to our room and gave her my roses that I had gotten for Valentines Day. I don't know where Aria got the flowers for my husband to give me but they were still perfect when I left. i couldn't take them home and I wanted them to be shared by the 25th floor housekeeping staff. The supervisor couldn't believe what I was doing and said I had given her chill bumps. People are not used to getting kind remarks only complaints but I like to give credit where credit is due and the staff is wonderful. I was leary of staying at such a big hotel but my stay couldn't have been any better, I guess I lucked out because it was actually very quiet while I was there. Slamming doors is a pet peeve of mine since I always try to be polite and hold my door shut but I only heard doors a couple of times. For the record, there were all age groups there. I read a review a while back that said there wasn't a safe in the room. I guess they didn't look in the nightstand drawer. Ahhh that's a new place for the safe! My other little insider tip is that their is an escalator in Aria that will take you to a tunnel sort of speak, it's not really a tunnel but it has shops and restaurants etc that take you all the way right into the Monte Carlo! It's very cool and there's not many people down there I guess because a lot of people don't know about it. My favorite thing in this tunnel is the Cupcakery, a great place to buy some cupcakes! Also a great pub with a large selections of beer. I bought a $4.00 cupcake and my husband bought his tiny little $16 bottle of beer and we took our goodies back to the room, yes he was able to take the beer with him. I loved the Aria and I hope you will too, I don't see how you can't.

The first 2 years we were pleased. This year it we noticed a major drop in the quality of the food. The buffet was the worst I have ever tasted, not to mention my assigned server \"Maria\" was to busy chatting up her friend to ever come back to give me a cup of coffee. I paid 27 dollars for a buffet that served beef brisket loaded with fat, dried out pizza and you only get one cup of coffee :( The service in the casino/gaming area wasn't any better. Every time we gambled, we waited for hours for a waitress to come by. Finally I had to cash out and go hunt down a bar just to get something to drink. The food they served us at the motorola party was even more disgusting and I didn't think that was possible. I was taken back by the attitude in the patisserie, when I asked for the barista to give me a hot sleeve for my coffee. Rolling your eyes at your customer is not exceptional customer service. I work in the service industry, so I fully understand how customers are supposed to be treated. When we 1st stayed here, the rooms were very nice, new crisp sheets, nice towels, etc. This time, the towels looked worn out and the sheets looked so old and dingy and I'm almost postive they were not changed from the last guest, for thre were some sort of crunchy crumb substance in the sheets. As if the last guest ate in bed. Our tech screen never worked, so every day we woke up hoping we were not late for meetings. This experience ruined our stay.

We noticed a BIG difference in the friendliness when we visited other casinos, not as friendly. 2nd the location of the hotel is great, you can walk to most casinos and also the free monorail located in Crystals is very convenient. There is also a taxi valet right in front of the hotel and we never had to wait more than a minute for a taxi. 3rd UGH the bed!!! Seriously this hotel bed was honestly the most comfortable bed my husband and I have ever slept in. Who goes to Vegas to sleep?? WE DID! The pillows, the sheets, the mattress...and the room was so clean and beautiful that it just made it so comfortable. Also the maid service really did an amazing job when they serviced our room. They even organized all my beauty products for me, just little touches like that stood out to us. 4th the grounds are beautiful and clean! It is obvious the hotel is new...the casino has very good ventilation and you barely noticed the smoking on the casino floor. My husband didn\u2019t even notice that you could smoke until we saw ashtrays on some of the tables. The outdoor pool and grounds is very well taken care of and has a great setup. There are I think 3 pools all situated so each one feels separate from the other. Also there are hidden Jacuzzis...very tropical feeling outside. 5th the restaurants and amenities at the hotel\u2026you never have to leave Aria. There are so many restaurants, bars, and lounges that you just don\u2019t have enough time to fit them all in. We dined at Sage our 1st night and very much enjoyed it. They have great drinks and the d\u00e9cor is very nice. Also there is the Jean Philippe pastry shop on casino level that has delicious pastries and sandwiches.

Very different than a Caesars or Bellagio. Various art is placed around the property, nicely adding to the decor. Our room was large and modern. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a good size. The soaking tub was very nice after a day of walking around. Everything in the room can be controlled remotely, from the curtains to all the lighting.....thought that was a cool touch. Housekeeping was fine, the room was thoroughly serviced every day although housekeeping was pretty late on one of the days. Wireless worked fine in the room too. The casino was superb. Any type of slot or poker machine you are looking for is bound to be there. Plenty of tables too. I used the sports book and it was impressive with excellent TV's. While there were plenty of people it never felt overly crowded as I've noticed at other casinos. Must be the layout. Dining options were plentiful but quite expensive, especially for dinner which we ended up eating offsite. However, we did have the regular breakfast buffet and it was delicious with a lot of options that were high quality. One other day we had breakfast at the cafe. Not as good and overpriced for what you got. The Jean Philippe Patisserie had some amazing treats. (Try the Nutella crepe, wow!) The fitness center was top notch with lots of machines, freeweights and treadmills available. The pool looked nice and while some people were swimming it was a little chilly outside for us. The Aria is in a great location, right in the middle of the strip. The Bellagio and Monte Carlo are readily accessible and the strip is only minutes away. We stayed at the Signature last year and, while nice, the Aria's location is better. Lastly, we had Viva Elvis included as part of a hotel promo. Fun show and worth seeing although we also saw the Beatles-Love at the Mirage which we liked even more. Overall, highly recommend the Aria. One last tip, if you want a nice day trip from the Strip rent a car and go to the Valley Of Fire Park, simply beautiful and well worth the drive.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shelby Township, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cLove it here!!\u201d", "Author": "Anthony A", "ReviewID": "UR124968278", "Content": "This is a great hotel, one of the newest in Vegas.

The Cafe was good, nothing to write home about but we ate there for breakfast 1 day. The bars were a good place to mingle and talk business as they had tables and chairs that you would just keep adding chairs as people walked past that you knew since it overlooked the casino. Very nice fitness center, is has around 50 treadmills/ellipticals/bikes and a decent amount of workout machines and free weights. The room was nice and everything (curtains, radio, TV, all the lights) is controlled by a touch screen which was cool. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have every slept in and you can buy them also for around $3800.

After spending 3 nights in Vegas, I can safely say that my opinon of Vegas hasn't changed, however the Aria was a gorgeous oasis of calm and a total sanctuary away from the mayhem of the Strip. The hotel is only a couple of years old and just off the strip (which I preferred - when visiting some of the other hotels (Venetian, Bellagio) I felt they were too full-on on the strip). The hotel is absolutely huge but managed not to feel too impersonal. Our room was absolutely wonderful - huge, gorgeous bathroom, amazing views and I could have quite happily spent my time in Vegas in the room! The pool area was lovely and the nicest I'd ever seen in any hotel - although by early afternoon it did become rowdy with pool parties and awful MCing. We had breakfast included one day and the buffet was one of the best I'd ever seen in a hotel, similarly we ate here at lunchtime on the day we left and the food quality was very good for a buffet and the selection was second to none.

You have a separate check-in area from the rest of the guests near the elevators for the suites and you need to tell your driver that you are staying at the suites as there is also a different entrance. The view I had overlooked the western horizon and the views are spectacular. The rooms are not over the top opulent in a good way, however they have everything you would want and more. You enter the room into a living room type area with a large screen television. plenty of seating and a half bath. There is also a refrigerator (no freezer). But what will hit you immediately is how different the room is from other rooms in the area. The building is LEED certified, basically meaning that it is very green. For example, everything is electronic, from opening the curtains, controlling the temperature, the lights and the television. It is all on a control panel that you can control from your bed or other parts of the room. when you leave, you push one button and all electrical items in the room shut down, the curtains automatically close and the service light will come on to let the staff know that your room is ready to be cleaned. The bedroom is spacious with plenty of drawer space (closets are in the bathroom). The beds are comfortable. The bathroom is large, with a separate whirlpool tub, shower built for 4 (up to you what you do with it) and two sinks. The toilet, which I would normally not mention, has certain benefits attached to it, and I will leave it at that, and the seats are warmed. Benefits: There is always food and drink available without charge to suite guests, but it is a little tricky to find. It is located behind a wall in the sitting area near the Sky Suite check-in desk. The elevators to the suites have 24 hour guards. The hotel itself has terrific restaurants, gambling, better than average shops and you must visit the sweets shop. It is also very conveniently located near Crystals shopping plaza filled with high-end shops and a CVS across the street. If you are a convention goer, this hotel was designed with the conventioneer in mind. Walks are not long. In that sense, the hotel is more vertical than horizontal which makes for a better convention experience. My only complaint is that I wish the hotel had more no smoking areas, including a no smoking lounge. If they had one, I could not find it and as with most casinos in Vegas, smoking is prevalent. I think they also inject some sort of aroma into the air which, if it was not for the addition of the smoke, might be pleasant, but instead it combines into a somewhat unpleasant small that some may find it at worst annoying.

Closing the blinds solved that problem. The hotel staff was professional and courteous. The gym and pool area was very nice. The biggest issue with respect to this hotel is the location and layout. The hotel is set far back from Las Vegas Blvd and they have designed it to make it difficult to get out. I am quite sure that this was intentional and not unique to the Aria, but the Aria has taken the manipulation of the hotel guest in this regard to new heights. You need to walk through a very large casino, and then through a connected mall to get to the strip (probably about a mile). I am fit, and I could laugh at the gamesmanship, but if you are not and want to walk to the strip, or if you are in a hurry to get between hotels, you should probably choose another hotel.

Upon check in my husband and I were discussing what to do for our anniversary dinner - much to our surprise later that night we were delivered chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate dipped macroons along with a note card from Shannon McCallum, Executive Director of Guest Services. What a tasty unexpected surprise!! Thank you! The room was nicely appointed, upon entering the lights turned on automatically, the curtains opened and music and our name was displayed on the TV set. Nice touch! Nicely spacious room with 2 closets, bathrobes, and an easy to use electronic pad to control the TV, curtains, room temp and lights. Bathroom was nice and roomy too, the shower had nice water pressure. Our only complaint about the room was the cleanliness of the bathroom, it almost appeared that the housekeeping staff was interrupted mid-clean. There was no toilet paper on the roll, but luckily there was an additional roll located on the back of the tank. There seemed to be missing towels and the floor didn't appear mopped. There was some debris and spots (we hoped they were just water)!! We liked the \"service\" and \"privacy\" switches located next to the door.....although it doesn't appear that the staff took much notice, even though we had the privacy light on when we stepped out, upon our return housekeeping had been in the room. Oh well. Biggest complaint about this place is that they don't have an in room safe. I normally don't care to carry my purse with me and will often lock it up taking cash and ID with me, but I was too nervous to leave it behind unsecured so I ended up toting it around all weekend. The bed was so comfortable!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I never once complained about having back pain after sleeping here, once we were back in our own bed at home - the back pain resurfaced. Time for an Aria mattress! Hotel and Casino are really nicely laid out, easy access to the tram on the back side of the hotel that takes you over to the Bellagio. Easy cab access right out front too. No in room coffee / tea makers here - so be prepared to stand in a long slow line for coffee downstairs at a none too cheap price. Also, buy bottled water from Walgreens across the street - we paid $2.59 per bottle of Fiji here compared to $8.00 a bottle in your room. Be prepared to walk if you stay here, it is a little removed from the general traffic area but we honestly didn't mind it. We were here over super bowl weekend and the temps were in the 60's so coming from the Cleveland cold - we were just fine walking! Check out was quick and easy, just make sure to double check your bill - we were charged $24 for some misc food items but once I pointed it out, they promptly took it off.

Who goes to Vegas to stay in their room the whole time? This was my first---and last stay I will ever have with Aria. I spent $600 on a 3-night stay and for that price, I expected a better experience than I received. My BIGGEST complaint was that I had absolutely NO CELL PHONE service there. I shared a room with my cousin. He has Verizon and I have AT&T. Both of our smart phones were not able to send/receive phone calls and txt messages nor go online when we were in our rooms. This was a major inconvenience for us because we consistently needed to check up on our pregnant wives at home in California. We were irritated with this so called the front desk to ask if we could use our room phones to contact our wives since we could not do so on our cell phones and asked to not get charged a phone fee. The front desk said this was ok. Upon checking my credit card statement today I found out I was charged 95 dollrs to make 3 eight minute phone calls!!! I called the hotel to complain about my fee charged and they only agreed to take off half of what was charged. So I am still stuck paying 50 for phone calls that combined were less than half an hour. Ridiculous. Also, the rooms are HOT not matter how low you turn down the thermostat and staff will still knock on your door and bug you even if you have your privacy light on. So very disappointed with this stay. Quite honestly I have stayed at $40 a night hotels and have had better service than I have at this \"5 star\" establishment. At checkout the front desk asked how my stay was. I told them I was disappointing that we could not receive cell phone service. The guy at the front desk made up some excuse about how cell phone service was bad because it was Superbowl weekend and they had too many guests staying at the hotel that weekend. So what does that mean???? Cell phones don't work when the hotel is at max capacity? My cousin and I are card dealers for a casino in California so we like to vacation in Vegas every other month just for fun. But this stay put a bad taste in our mouths. I will NEVER stay here again and will make sure my friends and family won't either.

I loved that almost anything in the room could be turned on, off, or switched with the touch of a button. * 2 cool things we noticed, if your door is not closed all the way there is a little notice that pops up on the handheld that lets you know that your door is ajar. The other is if you are using the deadbolt there is a notice on your tv that lets you know that you are using the deadbolt. Not sure if these notices come up on both the TV and the handheld but it was pretty cool. The tram is also a plus and it definitely came in handy as it takes you from Aria, Crystals, Monte Carlo, Bellagio AND back! I'm not sure if there is a time frame of when the tram runs but we rode it around 10:30pm just fine. The check-in staff were friendly and they were closing down check-out lines to accommodate people who were waiting in line to check-in. It made the line go much faster.

We booked a Deluxe King Room and received a Deluxe King Room City View without asking for an upgrade - loved that! The room was nice with a large shower area and a large bathtub inside the shower area - sounds bizarre, but it worked. Everything was controlled by the touchscreen remote on the nightstand (nice feature). There\u2019s a mini-bar area with snacks on top and a small fridge stocked with items. Also, there's a small desk next to the mini-bar with all the connections you need for your laptop, cell phone, and any other toys you may have (DVD/Blu-Ray, game system, etc.). The flat screen TV was right above the desk and appeared to be a 42\". There's a safe inside of the nightstand, which was large enough for a laptop and other valuables. Internet access was included in the resort fee, which was approximately $22/per day. The elevators going up to the guest rooms were staffed with employees checking room keycards. If you didn't have a room keycard, you couldn't enter the elevators. Our floor was quiet (19th floor), but one night we smelled smoke, even though we were on a non-smoking floor. Very annoying, but we couldn't tell what room the smoke was coming from or else we would have called the front desk to have them send someone to ask them to stop smoking. We tried the buffet for breakfast on New Year's Day. The food was O.K., but we thought the pricing for the buffet was high for the selection offered. We had a buffet credit from the package we booked, so basically we received \"2 for 1\" pricing. We didn't try any other restaurants in the hotel, but they all looked nice. The staff was friendly and helpful except for one incident on New Year's Eve in the casino with a cocktail waitress. We reported the incident verbally and received an apology and was given the manager's name and phone number. I filled out an online survey the hotel sent me after checkout and they responded right away, via email, with an apology. They also forwarded my experience to the appropriate manager.

This time I chose Aria and I must say the difference is seriously night and day. Check in was a breeze and our guest service agent Ashly (01-28-12) was extremely nice and accommodating. Very professional and polite. When we got to the room the curtains automatically open up which I feel is a nice touch. All the rooms come standard with digital/automatic controls for the lighting, and curtains which I love. Those options are controlled either thru the TV or the beside tablet/alarm clock. I can see where people not so family with technology would have problems with this but again I loved it. Also they incorporated the room safe into one of the drawers of the bedside table which i thought was really slick. Looking at the safe I saw 2 mini usb inputs which I figured are for people who forget their pin, which if true adds extra security as there isn't a master password floating around somewhere. Next is the beds. I know everyone has their own preferences on what they feel is a good bed and as far as I'm concerned these beds are phenomenal. I think its just right where it's not too firm and not too soft where you sink in. One thing I found odd was there was no coffee maker in the room. I understand they want you to purchase coffee from their shops but I felt like coffee and a coffee maker should be standard. Honestly with this place I was expecting keurigs in every room. Not even for coffee but if I wanted a cup of hot water to make tea it was pretty impossible. Also the only fridge in the room was the mini bar and that thing was pressure sensitive and already jam packed so I dared not touch or place in left overs or beverages in it. The bathroom for my room which was 2 beds I felt was aptly sized. Had 2 sinks and a stand up shower along with a deep tub behind next to the shower. Also the rooms utilize a sliding door which saves on floor space and just looks nice as well. Housekeeping was amazing. Not only did they replenish and clean they even organized our toiletries for us and neatly put away or suitcases and other random items scattered on the tables. Moving on to the restaurant and food portion of the hotel this place pretty much has all bases covered. Jean Phillpe (sp) is right next to the elevators so you can grab a cup of coffee as soon as you get off. The buffet for weekend brunch is amazing. I didn't try any of the other offerings but honestly if the buffet is that good I can only imagine. One of the things that did annoy me a bit was the fact that registration and the actual elevators are quite far from each other and a bit confusing to get to. This is really apparently when you see a lot of people walking thru the floors with the suitcases trying to find/get to the elevators.

The very first impression when we walked through the door was how nice the hotel smelled. For those of you who go to Vegas on a regular basis, this is unusual and very welcome! My friend said it smelled like freshly made waffle cones. The benefit to a new property is that they have obviously installed state of the art ventilation as they allow smoking, but you really don't notice it. Check-in was simple, and lines weren't bad even for a Friday afternoon. The room (15th floor and a long walk from the elevator) was comfortable, although next time I will request a non-city view as the lights from their small fountain shined into our room all night, despite the \"black out curtains.\" Hotel halls were nice and quiet - I never felt like we were in the midst of someone else's party. The Master On/Off for the electronics was great, but we had glitches each day we were in the room. The iPod connectivity had to be repaired, the outlet on the connectivity panel flipped a circuit off, and the television knocked out twice and had to be rebooted by engineering. Be prepared to bring your own audio cord for the iPod, or you'll have to pay for one in their mini-bar IT kit. And be sure you don't even touch or slightly bump anything on the mini-bar as it's all connected electronically and you're automatically billed for it. The fridge does not have any room for anything you might bring in, so fill up on ice on the way to your room. Beds were very soft and comfortable, but the room does sleep \"warm\" so set your thermostat lower than normal if you like a cooler sleep. It was chilly outside, so the whole hotel was a bit warm in general. Pools are beautiful, and one was kept open despite the cool weather. We used the spa both days. The $30 fee seems high, and for the short amount of time we were in there each day, I'm not sure it was worth it. We opted for salon services (hair, makeup) rather than a massage. If we had booked a spa service, the day fee would have been waived. Their steam and sauna rooms are wonderful, and the plunge pools (including a roof top one) are beautiful. Lots of amenities in the locker room, and the showers in the spa are several steps up from the low-pressure showers in our room. Spa staff was OK, but not the friendliest I've come across. A few seemed grumpy, and seem too fatigued to even speak complete sentences. The Salon staff was very friendly, and went out of their way to make us feel at home and comfortable. The fitness room was huge, well-equipped, and very friendly. The casino was a lot of fun. Craps tables and the slots were great - casino staff and waitresses very attentive and friendly. We tried two restaurants - the main cafe for breakfast, and Lemongrass for dinner one night. Both very good and reasonable. The room service was tasty, too - also very reasonably priced. The Aria is connected to the Bellagio, Vdara, the Monte Carlo, and the Crystals shopping area. Two Starbucks are located within walking distance (through the hotel) at the Monte Carlo, and the Aria Express Tram takes you to all the stops. We hit the Hyde Club at the Bellagio on Saturday night, and we're so glad we did! Although the Bellagio is an older property, they've hit the nail on the head with the Hyde club - a lot of fun, great DJ and music. Another cool thing about this hotel - they offer a reasonable half-day rate, which is perfect if you have a later flight like we did. Allowed us a lot of flexibility to go to the spa, have a leisurely lunch and rest, and spend more time in the casino without having to drag our luggage around or check it at the bell stand. Definitely worth it. All in all, we had a good stay. I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again with a few small changes.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cVery impressed!\u201d", "Author": "biztravler50", "ReviewID": "UR123889261", "Content": "I stayed at Aria in January and was very impressed by this hotel.

I especially appreciated the fact that the casino had NO smell of smoke. They pipe in a vanilla type scent and the ventilation system is so good that you don't notice it at all. If I had to say one negative thing, it's that there is no coffee service in the room so you have to leave the room and walk all the way to one of the restaurants for coffee.

We waited about 10 mins in line, and got our rooms and everything in about 10 mins as well. being with another group of friends, I was happy when they where able to put us on the same floor. Room- We had a corner suite. It was well worth the money. The space is just perfect, I didn't feel boxed in. The bed was amazing, i had no problem falling asleep. The view isn't the best on the strip, but for the location of the hotel, our view in the room wasn't that bad. It faced the Monte Carlo on one side, and the other side faced the highway with the back drop of the mountains. Like many hotels in Vegas we had room service twice a day. Everyone keeps complaining about the room technology, honestly people its not that confusing. Maybe cause I'm in my 20's, I don't know. but the main remote control is very easy to use, it turns on and off the lights in every room, as well as controls the curtains, privacy status, TV, and so much more. It took me 10 mins of playing around with it, till I became an expert. For those of you who are getting a corner suite, get ready for the LONG walk. Staff- our housekeeping lady, wasn't the friendliest person. She left her cleaning products in the bathroom, after leaving. took our bathrooms without replacing them, and barley mumbled a thank you after handing her money. Whatever I'm not one to dwell on the stupid stuff, but it was just an observation. Andre one of the security/door men made up for any rude staff we encountered. He was so funny, helpful, and knowledgeable. Chatting with him, was so great, always full of laughs. The casino waitresses are nice, but I was in utter shock when we handed a waitress 5$ Canadian ( we where out of USD at the time) , she looked at it and said I don't know what this is, and refused to take it. I was almost ready to bring her to the cashier and ask them to explain her the difference currencies of money. With the amount of Canadians that visit Vegas, I was at a loss of words to tell this lady. Location- Location of this hotel is good, right in the middle of the city centre, cant get any better then that Restaurant- we ate at cafe vettro 3 times, and every time there was a line, but when you finally get in the restaurant the first thing you notice are all the empty tables. Im convinced its a gimmick to have you wait in line; a way to make people think this place is happening, I could be wrong but that's my hypothesis. The food is good, nothing special to it. They have good breakfast, but like many hotel restaurants its pricey check out- We checked out on a Sunday, so I wasn't surprised when I saw the long check out line. It was to be expected, we waited about 30mins in line. Nothing more to say about that :) Overall its a good hotel, very modern. Even though we ran into a few hiccups. Somehow they made it up to us. my review may sound a bit negative, but my experience at this hotel is far from. I just want to point out some stuff that might be challenging for some people.

My biggest issue with the room is lighting - even with every single light turned on it is very dim, and makes working/reading extremely challenging. Now I know they prefer you don't stay in your room in Vegas, but I did need to get some work done and conditions were not optimum. Never had this problem when staying at Encore, Bellagio or Venetian. My other main issue with the room is the bed - I am a very warm sleeper, and never use any type of down bedding as it makes me very uncomfortable. Aria lines the mattresses with some sort of down mattress pad, which is impossible to remove if you don't want to sleep on a naked mattress. Even with the air conditioning set in the low 60's I was very warm and struggled to sleep more than a couple hours a night. Ended up going home with a cold after three nights of little sleep. From a service level everything was fine with our stay - check in took less than 10 minutes, we never had any issues with housekeeping and hallway noise was non-existent. All of the public areas were well maintained, and I was very impressed with the fitness center. Went down a couple of times between 7 and 8 in the morning, and had no trouble using whatever equipment I wanted. Internet speed was good in both the room and the conference facilities. Did not eat at the property other than the conference food, and was not impressed with anything served during the conference. Most of it was pretty bland, and looked like it had been left sitting out awhile before it was served. I am a big fan of the food offerings over at Cosmopolitan, and ate most of my meals away from the conference over there. Overall not a bad hotel, but I still think you can get nicer rooms that are not a half mile from the Strip for a similar price.

The hotel and its casino have more of a regular hotel atmosphere than other Vegas hotels that I've stayed in. This can be good and bad. Apart from the slot machines, it doesn't feel like Vegas within this complex. While this can be refreshing after spending a few hours on the strip, in some ways I enjoy the Vegas-like atmosphere in hotels like Ceasar's Palace and the Bellagio. Rooms are well equipped with electronics, however there are no tea/coffee making facilities. The bed was very comfortable and overall the room had a luxurious feel without being over the top. We had a City View room, however I think it may not be worth paying the extra price for these rooms as the windows are very dusty. The view is ok, but not spectacular. Overall, service was as expected at large Vegas casino hotels - obviously don't expect personalised service that you'd get from a boutique hotel. Front desk were polite and helpful. However, it can be frustrating to arrive back at our room at 4pm and find the room hasn't yet been cleaned. On one day, we got back to our room late afternoon, the room still was not cleaned. We were getting dressed to go out that night when the cleaners arrived. We asked them to return in 10 mins. However when we arrived back later that night the room still was not cleaned. We had family staying in another room at the hotel that had the same experience. This needs to be improved. I think they are either understaffed or badly managed. We used resort credit to eat at the buffet for lunch, as the other restaurants were closed at the time. I'm not a huge fan of buffets, however the food was quite nice. Like most places in Vegas - be prepared for long walks everywhere! Other than that, Aria is a good base in a relatively convenient location near the middle of the strip.

Small for sure, but the lounge chairs are cool. Negative: can't order food while watching the games. Skybox Grille has great buffalo wings. Room service is prompt and got the order right. The room has auto blinds and some other tech which was convenient. The blackout shades don't exactly black out the sunlight - FYI. On balance - I don't think I would stay here if I was paying.

Wonderful views -- even from the 19th floor from the full length glass windows. Concierge was very helpful, even called back a few times after doing further research on my needs. The casino on this property is not as large as some of the other hotels, but it is so much better in terms of smoke than any other casino I walked into. In some of them you could cut the smoke with a knife. In this one the ceilings are very high and they must have a better air filtration system (as it is a fairly new property) One fun fact -- the bathroom shower and tub are in a combined space with a cool design. Definitely use the tub and make sure you fill it fairly full. When you get in and it goes up over the lip of the tub it will drain straight into the shower (sort of like an infinity pool).

It is, in my opinion, far superior to the ubiquitous kitschy themed hotels dotting The Strip. The rooms are fresh and modern in their design. Public spaces a classy and well appointed. Staff is friendly and amiable. My wife and I stayed here January 18-22. We had a King Strip View Room on the 19th floor. Room Likes: The technolgy in the room was great. The bedside, touch-screen remote that controlled the room ambiance (drapes, lighting, heating/cooling, TV, music) was pretty cool. There was plenty of storage, and the bed was super comfy. Room Dislikes: We had neighbors on the last two nights, and I could hear them talking in the mornings. There is a fountain with dancing lights in the main driveway. The lights bounce around shine pretty brightly into the room at night (only really an issue if you want to sleep with the drapes open). Room Tips: If you are looking for the room safe, check the drawer of one of the bedside nightstands. I was a little stumped, and it was the last place I looked. Safe is fairly small. We had a laptop and a tablet in there and there wasn't much space left. \"Privacy\" and \"Service\" buttons are located next to the door and dispay a red or green indicator light to the hallway. We left the \"privacy\" button illuminated the first day, and didn't get room service as a result. To the resort's credit, there was a message on our phone that room service had been skipped, and that they would come and clean later if we wished Public Spaces/Dining: The Casino is a more muted and classy than the themed hotels. The clean, dark color scheme and a lack of garishness were nice. The lobby, though busy, never felt crowded. We ate at the buffet for breakfast/brunch twice. There was a wide variety of choices: standard steam table breakfast fare in addition to, sushi, prime rib, brisket, deserts, etc. The optional bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Marys are definitely worth the additial 6 bucks pp. My only complaint was that the beverage service was a little slow on Saturday morning when it was pretty busy. To their credit, the staff had their hands pretty full. We also had lunch with friends at Skybox, the sports bar on premise. The food was good, and the service attentive. We had breakfast at Cafe Vettro twice as well. Food is tyical american breakfast fare, and was pretty good. Be forewarned: as with everything on The Strip, it's spendy. Between breakfast for two of us and a Bloody Mary and Mimosa, we were out out 80 bucks plus tip. Staff: We were consistently greeted when we passed staff members in the hallway. The wait staff at all of the restaurants were friendly. The cocktail waitresses at Bar Moderno, which due to proximity to the elevator banks was our official meeting point for travel companions, were friendly and efficient. Overall, we both felt that Aria offered a great value for the atmosphere it provided. We will definitely be staying at Aria next time we are in Vegas.

We always feel so welcome that we sincerely miss the property and the people each time we leave. We spend about 40 nights per year at this hotel so it\u2019s safe to say we are regulars and know the hotel very well. With that being said, after staying in many other hotels in Las Vegas this one is by far our top choice. The Sky Suites are a great choice with excellent service from the driver and limo at the airport to the speedy check in and escort to the suites. The rooms are beautiful and inviting. VERY Comfortable beds, large roomy bathrooms, steam showers, wet bar, fabulous view\u2026 what more can I say. Well.. a lot.

Our most recent visit was during the very busy CES week. Our hotel was 100% full and extremely busy. There were a few times we waiting longer than usual for service at restaurants (which is understandable), but otherwise everything was wonderful. The staff is wonderful here.

We always enjoy visiting with them. While I have a hard time finding anything negative to say about this place we were disappointed with a visit to the Deuce Lounge on one particular evening. (this lounge is not owned and operated by Aria). We counted 78 customers in the lounge at 6pm and ONE server. That poor girl was running like crazy. The bar tenders and bar backs enjoyed watching the game while loading her with drinks at the bar and then continuing to watch the game. It was clearly the result of very poor management. Of all weeks to have no servers, this was not the one. Everyone came back from the conference ready for drinks before dinner. The bars were packed.

The most surprising aspect was the lavendar-vanilla scent that they pump in through the vents. Sometimes it smells good but sometimes it was headache-inducingly strong. If you are sensitive to scents in the least do not stay here. It permeates throughout the casino floor and event crept into our surprise $250 dinner at Bar Masa (those $25 rolls really add up.) Then our room. We had a perfect center view of the entrance and the strip but we had two major issues. Light kept streaming in from their stupid fountain. It was like a spotlight was being shown in the room. And then our room was freezing cold. We called up maintenance and the guy spent an hour tinkering (with us lying in bed just waiting for him to leave so we could sleep) and then it didn't even work. He did give us the interesting information that the hotel turns off the A/C and heat control in rooms to save money and basically waits for people to complain. So they moved up and gave us a nice $75 resort credit but then our new room was - I am not exaggerating - a six-minute walk from the elevators. If you have bags or any mobility issues you would never make it. Then the lovely strip view turned into a dirty window and a side view of the hotel. I will say that the rooms were pretty darned nice. Great bathrooms with deep sinking tubs and all the most modern amenities - curtains and lights you can put on a timer and a way to turn off all the electrics with the push of one button on your clock. The next most frustrating experience was checking out. We had signed up for loyalty cards and it took us over 20 minutes for the desk clerk to figure out how to credit our account with our points and split the bill onto two cards. Seems like a pretty simple operation and when you have a plane to catch, 20 minutes can feel like a lifetime. Our best dinner there was at Michael Mina's American Fish. I thought the spa was fine (but it pales in comparison to Qua Baths at Caesar's Palace) and the workout facility had everything I needed. I thought that Viva Elvis, though at times corny, was really fun and I actually liked it better than several other Cirque shows that I've seen.

The hotel is 2 years old and is in very good condition. I have used Trip Advisor a lot to choose hotels and sometimes I feel some people have highly unreasonable expectations and get put off by very insignificant minor things. Often I also find that what you put out you get back (in service and response from staff). Often people expect top notch service whilst dishing out rudeness themselves (I witnessed this 1st hand in my visit this time around). To the hotel - the rooms are large and comfortable. The beds are like sleeping on a marshmallow (can be good and bad however). The bathrooms are in good condition. You would be very unlucky to get a room that was not cleaned. We found the cleaning staff to be very helpful and pleasant and had a good chat with a few whilst cleaning our rooms (seriously, some of the demands from customers they have to deal with....wow!). The hotel is also not as \"over the top\" as some of the other hotels in Vegas are. The Aria is more of a standard modern casino hotel rather than part hotel, part theme park. Check in and out was fast and efficient and the concierge etc were all extremely helpful. Even though we are not \"high rollers\" or anything like that, we never got the feeling that we were not an important customer or ignored. The technology system in the hotel room is actually easy to use. It is no harder than using an iPhone, but I can understand that some people may find it daunting at 1st. You need to understand that if you press a button and it takes a second or two for the curtains to open, you need to wait. If you keep pressing it expecting everything to happen right away, you will not get a result. This sort of system is what is being installed in homes around the world (it is a Control 4 system) and many hotels...and is fun to use. They provide very good instructions in the Aria booklet as well and offer assistance if you need it. The \"room all off\" button is great to press when you are falling asleep...very convenient! The food - is ok. The best place to have breakfast is in the Buffett. It is the cheapest way for any eating in the hotel. Elsewhere, yes you are going to get fleeced, but I have been at few hotels in the world where food in the hotel is not pricey. The hotel is situated right next to Bellagio. However, it is still a decent walk to the Bellagio as these hotels all sit on very large grounds, but location is still very good. One down side is that the minibars are sensor activated and they charge if you want a fridge. I think that this is a bit much...especially when Aria is considered to be one of the higher standard hotels in Vegas. Also note that this group that owns Aria charges a daily fee for access to internet, gym etc whether you use it or not and it is not cheap (about $20 a day). This is generally on top of your room rate. The Aria is set a bit back from the strip, and to get to the north side it can be a bit of a trek after having to go via road bridges etc, but it is close to a food court (south of the hotel on the strip), a Walgreens and CVS, plus other cheaper food options. The only one other issue I would have is the room rate. Since CES was on, all the hotels hiked up prices massively (some by double) which is pretty rich. As I was told by a few locals this is a result of such a large conference, where attendees do not gamble as much as normal tourists or visitors. So the hotels all ramp up rates excessively to compensate for lost \"gambling\" income. I can understand during periods of high demand for rooms that rates will not be heavily discounted, but to increase them well above normal max rates is just rude.

There were many reviewers complaining about the walk to elevators and saying that you should ask for a room close to elevators. This is dumb. A room close to elevators will have a lot more foot traffic and associated noise (especially since this is las vegas and you have a lot of patrons in drunken state passing by your room late at night). Yes, it is true that if you get a room far from elevators then there will be a few minute walk due to size of Aria. But if this walk represents a problem then skip Las Vegas altogether. The traffic on strip is super congested. You will need to do a lot of walking whether you like it or not. Now to good points about the hotel. Aria was part of $8.5 billion project before recession when everyone was upbeat about the number and wealth of potential vacationers. The huge price tag really shows in the elegance and high crafts manship. It is really superior to all other hotels on strip. No expense was really spared during its construction as developers were expecting huge returns. Now, comes the weak points. Recession hits and there is no longer as much demand. Unemployed workers or people worried about job security do not simply book vacation in luxuary hotels in las vegas. This means Aria is not able to charge as high price as it was hoping for its rooms (for instance, it's cheaper than Bellagio). So, they are skimping on service. During my several stays there, I've seen dirty windows, under staffed room service not able to do its job in a timely fashion..etc. Having said all this. I still think Aria is a great hotel due to its innovative nature and architecture. While you might get unlucky and encounter a glitch or two in service but you will pay relatively low rates for fantastic rooms in a state of art hotel.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel- more \"calm\" than many on Strip\u201d", "Author": "jpm", "ReviewID": "UR123372921", "Content": "Aria is a nice hotel- LEED certified so it is very environmentally friendly- unique in LV.

Your not spending that much time in the room. For starters there are No Coffee makers at any strip room in Vegas. Once again it's Vegas they want you to buy their $6 cup of coffee not make your own. I did get mine at their small cafe every morning it was very good and not that badly priced if you are used to Starbucks prices. The beds are amazingly comfortable and have plenty of pillows. The room is technically advanced so if you can not use a smart phone or iPod with ease this will not be a spot for you. We found the technology fun and intresting being able to control everything without getting out of bed. Check in was smooth. We checked in around 9p and there was no line. They were helpful and friendly. The clerk directed us to their 24 hour resturant because we were hungry. We did rent a car and valet was quick and curtious. The bell service brought our bags up to the room within five minutes of check in and offered to show us around the room and even get us ice.

I first stayed at the Aria when it opened in January 2010. This is my third stay in the same week while attending CES and this time we upgraded to a corner suite with a terrific view. This property overall is a nice place to stay if you want to be on the strip yet at the same time, the hotel isn't too crowded in public spaces throughout. The real downside came with the room itself. I had to request that the room be vacuumed twice on check in. It's obvious that housekeeping was in and out as quickly as possible and while the room may look clean at a distance, when you looked closer it was downright nasty. The space behind the sinks hadn't been cleaned in months (if ever) and the bathroom remote was so disgusting neither of us wanted to touch it. It had never-ever been cleaned. Sadly there were already signs that the rooms are not holding up all that well and that the rooms will look very tired in the next two years. If you're going eat at the Cafe Vettro, two people will spend around $60.00 per meal just for breakfast so while the room may be well priced during non-convention weekends, expect to get soaked in the restaurants if you don't leave the hotel. I gave it average marks for two reasons, one was the lack of cleanliness and the continued impersonal treatment you get while staying there. Like all the big casino resorts along the strip, they have a way of making you feel like no matter how important you think you are, someone else there is way more important and therefore they can't bother with you.

Circa $3500 USD inc resort fees. My overall comment in relation to this hotel is that you can do better in Vegas. First; the good points of Aria. 1. Design, interior and exterior is outstanding. Aria inside and out feels classy and a step above many of the themed Hotels i.e. Caesars. 2. Smell. Aria does indeed smell like Vanilla. Initially it's odd but it's much nicer than cigarette smoke. 3. Location is OK however note that most of the strip action is around The Cosmopolitan. 4. Despite most likely being full or close to it for CES week the Hotel did not feel too busy - to me this is a mixed point because there was little buzz or positive vibe in this Hotel. Now; the bad points: 1. Service. My dry cleaning required two separate calls after it hand't arrived 24 hours after it was taken away. I understand it's busy but 24+ hours is unacceptable. 2. The rooms suffer from the same issue as many other Vegas Hotels. They are simply too dark. Not everyone is in Vegas to party endlessly and it was a frustrating experience trying to work at night time. 3. The bar areas and nightlife were very retrained. I stayed during the busiest time of the year and Aria still felt like a retirement village. 4. Bed sheets only changed on request. I don't this its unreasonable to change them every five or six days. If I was staying for two weeks, a month would I have to request a change or would they eventually change the sheets? 5. Resort fee of $20 to cover Internet i.e. WIFI etc which anyone who enters the Hotel also gets for free - odd. 6. No vending machines on the floors and few places to purchase drinks and snakes anywhere in the Hotel. 7. Very limited dining options in any of the restaurants for vegetarians.

The cons: First of all, the hotel was very smoky! I know it\u2019s Vegas and it's ok to smoke indoors, but we've never experienced how obviously strong the smell was at Aria. We've visited Vegas many, many times and stayed at other hotels, and never felt like we couldn\u2019t breathe. As beautiful as Aria was, it smelled like an ashtray. Second of all, we dined at 3 of their restaurants: Lemongrass Thai cuisine is typically spicy and flavorful, and even though we requested somewhat spicy food, it was not, and nor was it flavorful. Food at Lemongrass was quite bland. Skybox Sports Bar & Grill Our waitress was very rude. I'm not sure it was because we had a child with us or because she was just having a bad day, or some other reason. Our child wasn't running around or disturbing others. He sat with us the entire time like a well-behaved kid. After taking our drink orders, she returned with our drinks, (alcoholic drinks, that is) and asked what we wanted to eat. When we said nothing else, she scoffed and gave us a disappointed look. It is a crime to just want to sit down and have drinks? It is Vegas, people usually focus on drinks. Cafe Vettro Cafe Vettro was the most disappointing experience. When a hotel boasts about having world-class chefs and can't seem to make anything vegetarian for its guests, that's a problem. We asked our server (who was very nice) what vegetarian options they had cause we hardly saw any on the menu. He said would ask the chef if he can do certain dishes vegetarian, and kept coming back and saying that he can't. That was shocking! He suggested salad, but we didn't want salad, we wanted a proper hot meal. The only option was a margherita pizza, which by the way, had no basil on it! The chef couldn't even offer the pasta dishes which were on the menu and leave out the meat. Which can only mean that the dishes are pre-made! Very bad sign!!! When we asked for bread rolls because the tables next to us got them, our server came back saying that they ran out of bread rolls but he can bring us slices of sandwich bread with butter... again very disappointing!", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary", "Title": "\u201cNew Years Eve in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "NomadicCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR122982364", "Content": "This was our 3rd stay at Aria in the past year. We booked a corner suite through a Westjet package. Although we had a partial view of the Strip, we were a bit disappointed that we would not be able to see the midnight fireworks from our room (part of the reason for booking that way) Ended up watching from the other corner - end of hall. If it is a big deal for you - I would specially book a room where you could see the Strip. The fireworks are quite spectacular. We were on the 33rd floor & saw those from MGM & Aria's overhead. We had dinner in the Jacques Georges Steakhouse - will review that separately. Also ate at Julian Serrano and Lemongrass - will review separately. We have had the buffet in the past - breakfast only - it was good & extensive & not hugely crowded when we went in Nov. Cafe Vettro is good for a quick bite - pretty average fare but pleasant surroundings. Had one salad there that was not great in Nov. The rooms are lovely, modern, very well-equipped & have THE best mattresses & pillows I have found - and we have travelled a lot. The corner suite was great but probably over-kill unless you plan on spending lots of time in the room. One surprise was an electric toilet (heated seat & front and back sprays! A bidet/toilet !!) in the huge main bath (there is a powder room off the small living room) The bathroom has a great free-standing soaker/jetted tub with a partial view of the strip & a TV to watch as you soak. There is a large Room was clean and comfortable. The casino is huge, high-ceilinged and unless you were sitting next to a smoker, generally smoke-neutral. The complimentary cocktails are of a good quality wine/liquor & I even had a decent vodka martini on the rocks. Amazingly comfortable as you make your donation to the machines! All in all a very nice place - upscale and modern. Not at all \"old Vegas\". I will also review Julian Serrano & Lemongrass under restaurants. Rooms are all modern & it seems they have worked out the kinks from our 1st visit & problems with the drapes not operating. They have a great gym - it's been too cold to try out the pool when we were there - but looks nice. There is a $20 resort fee added to the bill each day - this bothers many people. I guess it makes the day-rate look better when people are booking. Personally, I think it is okay when you have a great gym as they do & would be great when the weather is warm to use the pools. The spa can be accessed for an additional $30/day. Worth it if you don't want a treatment but want to enjoy the outdoor infinity spa overlooking the pools, steam, sauna, and meditation rooms. We have had massages all 3 trips & enjoyed the Thai the most. All very lovely & a peaceful place in not so peaceful Vegas!

Some of my friends had stayed there before and raved about how wonderful it was so I was excited to check it out. Overall though, my stay was lackluster and not as good as other vacations I've taken to Las Vegas at other hotels. Check-in wasn't bad. We didn't have to wait in line too long and the front desk agent was very friendly. The selection of rooms wasn't very good. The hotel has like 60 floors? Well we were in their standard room and apparently the only standard rooms left were all on the 6th floor or lower so they wouldn't have that nice of a view. According to the front desk agent, the only thing higher than the 6th floor was a handicap accessible room on the 37th floor or something. I just found this really hard to believe because I work at a hotel. You're telling me that you have no standard rooms open on the 50+ floors above the 6th floor for someone checking in on a Wednesday night? I just find that really hard to believe. Anyway- we went ahead and took the handicap accessible room so we could have the nice view because I didn't really think I'd mind the lowered bed/closet shelves and the lack of the jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. With the package we booked, we were also supposed to get a complimentary city-view upgrade but when we actually got up to the room it wasn't overlooking the city and/or the strip at all. It was just overlooking the parking garage of another hotel or something. Either way- I didn't really care too much about the views to complain, but then my boyfriend walks into the bathroom and the main overhead light doesn't turn on. We try some of the other lights in our room and discover that both our reading lights above our bed don't work and neither do the lamps on each of the nightstands. I call the operator and let them know there are an abundance of lights not working in the room. They tell me that they will alert their technicians, then the technicians will call us with how long it will take for them to get to our room to fix them. That really wasn't acceptable to me when I needed to shower and get ready for dinner but was unable to because it was pitch dark in the bathroom. So basically they were telling me to just put off my dinner/plans for the night until someone could come fix the lights (and they didn't even know when that would be yet). I told them I really didn't want to wait around and asked to be moved to another room. They were able to move us to someone on the 6th floor (which also didn't have a good view by the way). We get there and all the lights were working but then the sink on the right in our bathroom wasn't working properly. The right pull for cold worked, but the left pull for hot did not. Also, the water that came out for the cold was almost dripping because there was no water pressure. Filling up a cup of water would take 5 minutes from that sink. We tried the sink on the left and alas, that one worked fine with strong water pressure. I didn't want to move rooms again because we were already running late for dinner and we could just share the one sink that worked but it was kind of a disappointment how many things were wrong with the two rooms we were in. Other random things: Blackjack/Poker minimums a bit high. Casino/Lobby floor smells like heavenly vanilla. The beds are so soft and wonderful. Buffet isn't bad but I prefer the Wynn's buffet. Gold Lounge is really lame. Haze is awesome- good sound/lights system. Would definitely go back. Ate at Lemongrass (their Thai restaurant)- very good food, highly recommend. Their rain type showers are awesome. Also their bathmats are so fluffy and soft. Gelato at the Chill cafe was very good. I feel like they need more dining options that aren't \"fine dining\". Our room was ridiculously far from the elevator and we got lost once. When I say ridiculously far, I mean it, I'm not just being a diva. Cocktail waitresses were very fast and friendly. Overall, it was an okay stay but I probably wouldn't go back.

I will try to contact the hotel and let them know of our experience there... Thinking we would have saved some money for doing the promo - 3 thousand dollars later we are very glad to not be in the Aria anymore.

There was plenty of space in the room including good storage with 2 large(ish) wardrobes and decent drawer space. Bed was large and comfortable. The service in the hotel seemed better this time around. For example there were less queues at check in and check out and any requests I had were dealt with quickly and efficiently. In fact I can't recall the nature of the requests which is either a good sign of the service being good or a sign that the late nights and lack of sleep impaired my memory! The bars within Aria are decent with the open plan View Bar being my favourite. The Deuce bar and Gold Lounge are also good. Haze nightclub is housed within Aria and is a decent place with various rooms and mezzanine areas as well as fantastic waitress service. There is also a good sized pool area but I only visited this to get some air and sun in between conference sessions. Overall Aria is a very good casino hotel although I'm not sure if it would be my first choice for a holiday hotel, but that could just be because I associate it with work and conference due to that being my reason for staying there twice.

It is a modern 5 star hotel and casino without the \"Las Vegas theme style decor.\" There's no Venetian canal, talking Roman statue's or Eiffel tower, just classy modern decor and architecture. We found that the Aria was not on the must see list of the hoards of tourists in Vegas and therefor a less crowded place to hit the casinos and restaurants. We liked the fact that we could fight the crowds at the Belagio, Caesar's Palace and the Venetian then retreat to the Aria for some elbow room and more attentive service. The rooms were modern and clean with a large window. We were on the back side of the hotel on the 18th floor and had a great view of the mountains. The breakfast buffet was around $15 and was excellent. The location is great, right in the heart of the strip and about a 5 minute walk from the Belagio for the CAN'T MISS fountain show.

I wanted to be sure that I had the best possible understanding of what it had to offer since it's a newer property and I hadn't been to Vegas in a couple of years. What I actually found during my stay is that some things travelers have reported are spot on - and some are rather rediculous. I'm a non-VIP, but non budget conscious (when in Vegas) traveler with a very positive attitude and reasonable expectations of other human beings when reviewing a property. Having said that, here's what you should know! I'll do it in a Good/Bad format with some important notes at the end - so read this in full! THE GOOD 1. Yes, the property itself is beautiful. The architecture is amazing and I found myself walking the casino and surrounding areas, looking around in awe. 2. The beds are as amazing as you've read in other reviews. I am a very tempermental sleeper and expected to be debunking the hype around these beds - but alas, they are that comfortable indeed. 3. I personally found most of the staff to be VERY friendly (ESPECIALLY housekeeping). There were a few exceptions (a young guy working at Jean Phileppe, several security people at the elevators checking room keys), but the overall feeling of the staff was warm - not 5 star service, but warm and friendly enough for my tastes (I don't require staff to gush at my feet for me to enjoy myself - but I know there are snobbish wanna be VIPS out there who do). The bartenders at both casiono bars we went to (on several different occasions) were also not only friendly but VERY funny and kept us at the bar ordering drinks just to shoot the breeze with them. Nice to see such personality at such an upscale property. 4. The restaurants (that I tried) on the property are EXCELLENT. This is one area I can claim expertise in and I would be more than happy to report if the food was lass than great. I ate at Julian Serrano, Jean Philleppe, Sage, Cafe Vetro (it's a 24 hour cafe - decent food for that standard) and even had lunch at the Buffet. Now I agree that Wicked Spoon (at the Cosmo) or the buffet at Wynn or Bellagio are all better in quality and selection. HOWEVER - the Aria buffet is STILL a decent buffet, I have NO idea where people who say it's bad are coming from. If you compare it to the aforementioned buffets, then yes, it's the \"worst\" of that group. But it's still on of the better buffets in Vegas, it's a few bucks cheaper than the others, and it will save you a trip off the property when all you really want to do is eat NOW. If you're a buffet connoisseur, the walk to Wicked spoon (next door - but still quite a hike) may be worth it. But if you just want a great buffet with PLENTY of food choices for your money, the Aria buffet is great. Okay, enough of that! 5. The touch screen panels in the rooms (that control lighting, curtain opening, temperature, TV, alark clock - even the privacy light outside your door) are indeed quite cool. Reports that they are \"hard to figure out\" or confusing are REDICULOUS. If you use a cell phone, ATM machine, or any other thing that requires touching a screen and following basic menus written in english, then you'll be fine. However, reports that the touchscreen can be slow responding on the TV are accurate. The TV is a satellite based system, so that doesn't help the response time to commands. Regardless though, it's a cool concept that's easy to use. 6. DO NOT believe other reviewers about the AWFUL, MARATHON-LIKE distance from the hotel to the strip. Rubbish. Yes, you have to follow a walk way down to the strip when you exit the casino. Approximately 1 1/2-2 city blocks in equivelent length. No different than staying at Bellagio, Encore or Ceasars. Not sure why Aria is getting a bad rap for not being DIRECTLY on the strip (like Planet Hollywood or Cosmo) but I love these people who will complain about the short walk to the strip - but then spend all afternoon walking 20 miles in each direction. Really? Okay, that was the east part... Now for, THE BAD 1. Personally I found it extremely annoying and a little insulting that the rooms (as reported by other reviewers) in fact do NOT have coffee makers (or refrigerators - touch ANYTHING in your mini-bar and you'll be charged for that item. But they'll be happy to RENT you one for $30 a night. No thanks.). I know, you already knew that, and maybe you don't drink coffee so you dont care. But consider this; it presents a glimpse into the misthinking of those who designed this multi-billion dollar property. It's an example of the \"quanity not quality\" aspect of designing a property with 4,000 rooms that has a sculpture in the lobby that probably cost more than what 4,000 $10 coffee makers purchased at wholesale would have cost. It shows the possibility that the money on this property was spent on getting people impressed with the impression because once you've checked into your room, your stay is non-refundable. Just sayin'... 2. So remember when I said the walk to the strip wasn't that bad? Well the walk from the elevator to your room IS (or I should say, MAY be - depending on what room you get). I had a room towards the end of the tower - I'm in my mid thirties, good health, good shape - but the distance from the elevator to my room really ticked me off. Not cause I couldn't do it, and yes, I am one of those people I mentioned before who spends the afternoons walking miles and miles up and down the strip anyway. So why is this different than the walk to the strip? Because there is a VERY reasonable expectation to walk long distances on the strip - or through the casino - or from the airport security to your gate - or whatever. But as a guest who's conveniences and comfort should be top of mind to the property, the designers dropped the ball on this part. Granted this is a moot point since no matter how many people complain, they're not going to tear down the building and rebuild it - but you should know, especially if you have elderly or handicapped people in your group, that you HAVE to spell it out for the front desk that you want to be close to the elevator bank (the ONLY elevator bank) on you floor. I didn't and ended up grumbling every time I walked to and from my room. 3. I was sooo looking forward to the famed \"room greeting\" that was to take place upon enetering the room for the first time. I unlocked the door, walked in and (as reported by other reviewers) - NOTHING. The curtains didn't open, TV didn't come on.... now this may also seem minor - but AGAIN, it speaks to the details and in this case, details that the fropnt desk clerk had JUST bragged to us about upon checking in (\" wait until you see the way the room welcomes you!\" she said...). Also, upon picking up the touch screen panel for the first time and truning on the TV, BOTH displayed the name of the previous guest (another thing that I had read other reviewers complain about). When I mentioned it to the front desk on our way to dinner, the agent said \"oh they just didn't update the room info, happens a lot\". REALLY? I wonder if them neglecting to update the guest info for the room also led to me not getting my \"room welcome\". I also REALLY dont like the idea of the NEXT guest after me, seeing my first and last name after I leave (should they again forget to updaste the info). Not good. 4.The table limits are indeed high. If you are a \"just for fun\" gambler (like I am) or you're on a budget, you'll most likely be going elsewhere to play table games (slots however, provided plenty of penny options if that's your thing). Our first night in town was a Monday and the lowest BlackJack was $15 and lowest Pai Gow (my fav) was $25. Now these table limits are not any higher than The Bellagio or Wynn - but they aren't offering specials on roiom rates to the extent that Aria is. So if you book a discounted rate online, don't think that the casino table limits will be as kind to your budget. 5 There is no \"elevated\" level of service at Aria. People are friendly. Professional. But when you arrive, there will be no one to greet you at the main entrance. Need help with your bags? Too bad, no bell hops. Want the two consecutive heavy, glass doors leading into the casino opened for you? Nope. Want a smile when you comply with security at the elevators and flash your room key? Don't think so - but they will snap \"room key!\" at you should you neglect to display it inbetwen holding your shopping bags, diet coke and camera (or what have you). As I said before, I don't personally NEED any of those things to enjoy my stay. But the Aria NEEDS them if they want to be taken seriously as a 5 star resort. 6.Okay, here's my biggest bad point (for some people it won't matter). I read several reviews complaining about a lack of theme or \"energy\" to Aria. I was fully prepared to find that to be a silly, self-fulfilling profecy of people who really just belong staying at The Palms or some other place that sepcializes in leasing suites to reality shows for months on end. BUT... I regretfully have to agree with those reviewers. Aria is gorgeous. It's an awe inspiring nod to human design and engineering. But I walked through the Cosmopoliton while on my way to dinner there one night, and I was instantly jealous. The place was alive, fun, colorful and so very VEGAS. For the most part, Aria is none of those things. For families, older travelers or people wanting the luxury casino experience that you would perhaps experience in a James Bond film, then the Aria would suit you just fine. But if the energy of Las Vegas is something you enjoy - the lights, the colors, the feeling that this is the only place in world where you could experience this - I'm sorry to say that Aria will most likely not fulfill that for you. I should mention that I was on a \"couples\" trip with my girlfriend and I don't drink or smoke - so I wasn't exactly looking for a wild party every night - but the Aria just goes too far the other way for my taste. Lastly, I should mention - I've seen a lot of conflicting reports on housekeeping. The quality of it, the timeliness, etc, etc. Although we were there for 5 days, we elected to NOT have housekeeping service, so I cannot comment on it. My girlfriend was troubled by the number of reports of theft, and not everything would fit in the safe - so we made our own bed and didn't live like slobs. I again should mention that housekeeping were the friendliest group of staff we encountered (including the front desk - which was friendly). We passed more housekeeping staff in the halls than I can count and I kid you not - EVERY time the staff member looked up smiled and warmly said hello or good morning/night. They were also happy to provide more \"supplies\" (shampoo, towels, etc) even though we requested to not receive housekeeping service. IN SUMMARY Look - at the end of the day, I can't tell you to stay at Aria or not. It's EASILY one of the more impressive properties on the strip from a sophistication and architectural stand point. But what will ultimately determine if you stay at Aria or not, is what type of experience you want from your stay in Las Vegas. I'm giving Aria 4 stars. Triple AAA will give it 5 stars because they haven't stayed there for a full week like I just did and they're grading it against every other hotel in the universe and not against other resorts on the strip. I hope this info helps anyone trying to decide where to stay for your next trip to Vegas.

We were connecting with a group of 3 other couples (who also stayed at Aria) for a weekend escape from the still-cold Midwest. This was my 4th trip to Vegas over the last 15 years or so, having stayed previously at MGM, Mandalay Bay, and the Palms. We picked Aria because they were running a promotion and the rooms prices were good. At the time of our visit, the Aria had only been open for a few months. In fact, I'm pretty sure the pools had only been open for a week or two. That did not turn out to be a problem at all though, as I thought the Aria was running pretty smoothly overall. There were some minor delays at check-in, but given how newly opened they were, we almost expected that. In my opinion, the delays had more to do with inefficiencies in the check-in setup and process, and not the staff. Furthermore, the check-in staff was friendly and courteous, so we just took the whole process in stride. The overall decor (from the building to the lobby to the casino to the rooms) was nice and clean and modern. It's not necessarily the scheme I would want for my home, but it's very nice nonetheless, and it should be able to stand the test of time. The lightly scented vanilla-ish aroma in the lobby was noticeable (and a little odd for this Midwestern boy) and ever-present, but I never found it annoying or bothersome. The rooms very very nice and modern. Everything was meticulous, which is to be expected with a brand new. billion-dollar(?) hotel. The whole-room remote was fun and unique, albeit tempermental at times. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was nice, big, and clean. The main pool was nice. Easy to find a lounge chair. Poolside bar was accessible and fine, but predictably overpriced. Only ate at one restaurant in the Aria. Can't remember the name. I believe it was Asian-themed. It was fine, but unremarkable. Much like the rest of the hotel, the casino was modern and, consequently, it felt different than any other casino I've ever been in. That's probably mostly a good thing, but it felt a little sterile at times. The table minimums were predicitably high for a hotel of this quality. For me, that just made me want to head out to the strip to find something that better suited my budget. (I prefer to go to a casino where I can play craps and, hopefully, make a couple hundred dollars last for an hour or two, not 10 minutes.) Overall, my experience was good. Would I go back? Maybe, if they were running another promotion. But, I wouldn't choose Aria if I could find a less expensive room at a hotel like Bellagio, or Mandalay, or Venetian, or Cearsar's.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Niguel, California", "Title": "\u201cOne great place for families in vegas\u201d", "Author": "workingmama28", "ReviewID": "UR122599928", "Content": "We stayed here once in the summer and this past Christmas.

While I was there, my iPad disappeared from the hotel room when the room was cleaned. From reading many of the 1-star reviews, I have seen that this type of thing seems to happen frequently at the Aria. Shockingly, the hotel staff was completely unhelpful in the aftermath of the theft. Usually, at a hotel of this caliber, staff would bend over backward to assist in this circumstance. I found every single person I dealt with to be unhelpful, unapologetic, and unwilling to make any real effort to help me. The first person I dealt with, a member of the hotel's \"security,\" failed to even suggest opening a report and told me that it was impossible that a theft could occur. He then told me to go to the front desk and speak with a manager if I wanted anything to be done about it. I then went to the front desk and was told that I needed to deal with security. When the case was finally opened, the hotel took a full 30 days (the amount of time in which they are required to submit a report) to make a determination. During this time, they told me that would call me and let me know the status, but failed to do so. I had to correct the phone number that they had on file for me at least 3 times. Additionally, NO ONE apologized that this happened. When the final report was made, the hotel told me that there was no evidence that I even had an iPad and that they had asked everyone who was in the room and no one had seen it. They told me that according to Nevada law they are not responsible. That may be the case. However, generally, a hotel of this level, will do the right thing in a case like this and make some attempt to make up for the loss.

Luckily the Monte Carlo / McDonalds is close by, so if you want to eat on the cheap, that is available (its just a bit of a walk). However, all the quick service, restaurants and buffet are expensive. We were able to get a nice deal on the room, but normally the price they've listed would be out of our budget. Also, presenting your key to access the elevators is understandable but it got to be a nuisance, especially when carrying coffee or what not.

The food was not very good. I don\u2019t really understand this. I had the breakfast buffet. Please don\u2019t spend your money for this buffet. The breakfast buffet at the Bellagio is so much better, and even though it is inconvenient to leave this huge hotel complex, take a cab to Bellagio for the breakfast buffet there. I also age at the Lemongrass Thai restaurant. I\u2019ve had more authentic Asian food at much lower prices. I was definitely not impressed. I had room service one night. It was a long wait and although the service was lovely, the food was mediocre. I left some personal items behind, and was able to recover them on my way back.

Not as large as the Palazzo though... the Palazzo has a separate space where they have couches, a desk, and entertainment center however at the Aria it's all one space. The beds are amazing. We had a little bit of trouble with the housekeeping so make sure you're on top of that. The cool thing about Aria is it's location. There is a large upscale shopping area called Crystals connected to the casino. There is a underground walkway that connects to Monte Carlo. There is a bridge that connects Crystals to Planet Hollywood across the street (but beware that the elevator wasn't working when got to Planet Hollywood so we had to get people to help us bring our double stroller down the stairs). Planet Hollywood has a huge mall with more affordable stores and tons of restaurants. We took a trip to M&M world (walking distance) and the kids really enjoyed it. It's four stories and has a small theater that shows a 3D 10-minute movie... very cute! At the bottom floor of this building there is a huge gaming center (arcade) that would be fun for older kids.

I guess the theme is \"trees\" because we saw them all over, and the overwhelming color scheme was chocolate brown. If you are sensitive to smell, be warned, the vanilla scent is pretty strong in the casino area. There is lots of art and the Christmas decorations were very pretty and matched the \"tree\" theme. We stayed over the Christmas holiday, and the casino was pretty busy, which I was pleased to see, being a local. Check in was swift, and I requested a nicer room on a high floor. We got 21st floor with a view of the Cosmopolitan pool, so I guess that qualifies. The room definitely has all of the technology bells and whistles. Wave your key over the door panel and it unlocks the door. The tv remote controls everything from the curtains to the lights to check out, and there is a panel near the bed which controls l everything in the room as well. The curtains opened and the tv played music upon your entry. At times it was a bit confusing, but we figured everything out pretty quickly. However, I was not in love with the layout of the room. I much preferred Vdara in terms of layout to Aria, actually. The entryway seemed to be a misuse of space, and the bathroom was a bit strange. The bathtub was enclosed in a \"room\" with the shower instead of having the separate shower and tub. The water closet (ie toilet room) was surprisingly large, but had a frosted door rather than a real one, so if someone was washing their hands or putting on makeup, you could see the person in the toilet area handling their...business, which was kind of icky. There was no fan in the water closet, either. The bed seemed a bit too soft when I sat on it, but it actually was very comfortable. It was like sleeping on a cloud. Now for the bad... We left our room to do some post-holiday shopping at about 9:30am. We turned on the \"service\" button on the panel by the door. As we left, we noticed that housekeeping was servicing rooms right near ours (we even spoke to them) and figured that our room would be cleaned shortly. We returned back to the room at about 4:00pm to find that our room had NOT been cleaned, which was really annoying. I called down to housekeeping, who apologized and said they'd send someone right up. 30 minutes later, no one had come. We went downstairs to the front desk and put in another request for service. They said they'd spoken to a supervisor and would send someone up. We went back to the room, 20 more minutes, no one had come. We found a housekeeper on our floor and asked her, getting more and more annoyed. She radioed a supervisor, and FINALLY after another 15 minutes someone came to clean our room. Getting our room serviced at 6pm is a bit ridiculous, especially since we'd been gone all day!! Cocktail service was pretty nonexistent. I only played for about 30 minutes at a time, but never was approached by a cocktail waitress. The Spa, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. I will write a separate review for that, however. MGM and their resort fees...Whew! Tax and resort fees (which include free access to the gym and free Wi-Fi) totaled almost an extra $40/night. Make sure to factor that into your calculations.

We asked for a late check-out because of this, but we were declined. Be aware that this hotel has only high priced food options. And they are not very good either. During our 4 days we ate off-site as the prices were too high and the quality was low.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201c5-star Resort\u201d", "Author": "Self_Guided_Tour", "ReviewID": "UR122096088", "Content": "Stayed at Aria the week before Christmas. The good thing is that there were not a whole lot of people staying there on a weekday before holiday, so casino, bar, restuarants were not jam packed. Tje reort is slightly off the strip.

The building is a little recessed - connected to the strip by Cosmopolitan and Cystal (a high end shopping center, plus bar, plus club). I really enjoyed my time there, the room is very sizeable. The bed is particuarly comfy, comtemporily decorated. Full touch control is cool, I experimented and played with it time and again. It is very high tech, although it can be a little inconvenient at times. Bathroom is huge, with dual sinks. The tub is deep abd right next to the shower, which is convenient. Best expereince: when I walked in the room, the shade was open, light turned on and TV started light music, with my name on screen. Very nice touch. Worst expereince: I was charged $22 resort fee for parking, wifi, etc. Although it is not a gimmick, still a little steep on the price tag.

The check-in process was very efficient and the front desk agent noticed from my ID that it was my birthday and wished me a happy birthday and said she would send something up to the room. Like usual, we tried to check in early (around 12:00) and we were given a room right away, which was very nice. Our room was on the 12th floor and had a nice view of the Cosmopolitan. Nothing special, but better than looking at a parking lot or the I-15. There is so much technology in this room, it is a blast. You walk in and there is the usual on/off light switches, but there is also a Master On and Master Off switch. Hitting the Master On turns on all the lights, and opens up the sheers and the blackout blinds. That was very cool. Next to your bed there is also a tablet style touchpad that controls just about everything in the room. All of the lights, the temperature, the sheers, the blinds, the tv, the music. It is awesome. You can also set your DND for the door from the bed. You can also set a wake up alarm like no other. It will turn on the TV, open the blinds, turn on the lights and/or change the temperature. You also have a goodnight button by the bed which turns everything off and closes the blinds. If you are not ready for bed you can set the goodnight timer that will do all of that after a certain amount of time. Other positives about this hotel, they do NOT charge for Valet, which is very nice, but if you aren't in the mood to have someone else park your car they do have self park as well. The casino is fun to play in, but beware, a nice hotel means higher limit tables. Don't expect to see anything below 10 dollars, and the average table is probably closer to $25. One negative, and it isn't the hotel's fault is the location. As with any hotel in the city center, it takes a little bit of a walk to get to the strip. Or you can walk through the casino, and go through the Monte Carlo, or take the train to Bellagio and go through there. All in all ARIA completely lived up to its expectations. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and spacious. It is a great atmosphere and there aren't snooty employees like some nice hotels.

As far as the cleaning service, its really bad. We were there for 4 nights and the first day our room was not cleaned until 9pm and the other 3 days it was not until after 4. There is a button you push called \"service\" that is supposed to let them know you are ready for them to come in your room. I had to call the house keeping line as well as hunt the cleaning ladies in the hall so that the room could be cleaned. The room was also very dusty, not sure how often they clean the counters Don't bother with the Buffet (there are better on the Strip) but do try Julian Serrano. Food and service there was amazing- Loved the PAELLA, CEVICHE, AND CROQUETAS. The pastry place (JP) as well as the Coffee Bean are good places for a grab and go breakfast/snack. We ordered room service one morning for breakfast and it was delicious. If you are not a fan of cigarette smoke, this is the place to stay at. It doesn't smell like it at all (unless you are sitting next to someone blowing it at your face). The spa and salon were both really good, a little pricey but its Vegas so that is somewhat expected. If you are planning on using those facilities, book your treatments earlier in the day so you can use the rest of the other facilities for free for the rest of the day.

We loved The Aria's ultra modern theme, in sharp contrast to the classic, but now tired elegance of the Bellagio,and instantly, despite it's size, we felt at home there. Ideally situated in the heart of the Strip, access to other nearby hotels is achieved via the over head walk ways, the trams connecting to various hotels so as to save crossing the busy roads. Even that's no problem .......and I'm no spring chicken Check in to the Aria for us went very smoothly, quickly and efficiently and our request for a low floor room due to my fear of lifts was accommodated very easily. Our 3rd floor room was spacious, very clean, the large double bed extremely comfortable, toiletries stocks/towels were replenished daily and even the view was passable. I am sure the higher floors afford a more spectacular view of the Strip but for the time we spent in our room it didn't bother us in the slightest. There are numerous pools and recliners on offer so finding a suitable spot at any time of the day was no problem. The pool opens promptly at 9am. The only down side for us was the loud thumping music coming from the pool/disco on certain days but once warned of opening times it was easy to adapt our own schedule to avoid this. The pool side waitress service was 2nd to none, the girls were delightful, helpful and efficient, as indeed were all the staff we encountered throughout our 2 week stay. For health and safety reasons I had to ring for a security escort up/down the stairwell and again the security guards were all personable and very prompt to arrive at our door. We ate the breakfast, lunch evening meal buffets and were most impressed with the vast selection and high quality foods on offer. Highly recommended. I am at a loss to read how fellow travellers failed to notice that there is a hotel resort charge of approx $280 currently I believe. This was clearly detailed in all my holiday documentation at the time of booking and in confirmation docs. So as to avoid any unpleasant surprises always read your booking form very carefully. If you are a gambler it is essential to join the players club. By using your members card when playing the slots/tables, points accrue which entitle you to substantial discounts on items charged to your room and also free dollar slot play. The Aria's card can also be used at many of the Vegas casinos so, unlike the Wyn/Encore, you are not restricted to gambling at any one hotel casino. Reception staff also booked us in on line for our flight departure thus saving us any hanging about at the airport. Whatever your request, just ASK and everything will be done to accommodate your needs. Overall we cannot rate the Aria experience highly enough and are counting the days to our return. By booking this holiday via Ebookers/Topcash back site I also saved a substantial amount on what was already a great deal. We're getting 2 free buffets as well ! A superb hotel which we highly recommend to everyone.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat more can you want?\u201d", "Author": "robinvn", "ReviewID": "UR121822053", "Content": "Checked in here around 6.30pm and was nice and quiet then. Check in was quick, easy and friendly. Have to walk through the casino to the elevators but gives you a chance to take a look. As soon as you enter the room, the lights come on, the curtains open and the TV comes on and a greeting on screen with my name there. A nice touch! The room was really very nice and the bathroom large, with a bath and shower. The shower gives instant heat, which is nice. There is a very well stocked mini bar but as you would expect in a 5* hotel, the items in there are quite expensive. A word of warning..I saw in the welcome book that you could be charged, just for moving items around in the mini bar. I did take a few bottles out, just to see what they were but after contacting reception, was pleased to see I wasn't charged! We stayed in the room with 2 relatives and the room doesn't seem too large with 4 people in there but is was still comfortable nonetheless. There is a small console on the bedside table, that will control everything in the room, from lights to curtains, temp and TV. I played around with that a bit but my wife wasn't too happy when I turned off the lights when she was showering! The inside and outside of the hotel are really quite stunning. The hotel staff are polite and friendly and always happy to help out and one of them approached me when I was queuing at the Concierge desk and saved me a long wait, by offering advice. We had breakfast at the buffet and there is certainly a large choice on offer and the food is great. We were on the 21st floor and not even half way up, so a big hotel!

I arrived at the hotel at noon and was glad that they let me check in right away. I went up to the 21st floor where my room was located, and upon entering the room, it amused me to no end to see the curtains open up, the lights come on, and the in room TV turn on. All controls for the room lighting, temperature, and curtains are located on the TV set or on the standalone controller that sits on the bedside. How cool is that? The room had 2 Queen beds as requested, 2 roomy closets with actual hangers (not the ones permanently affixed to the rods), and a beautiful bathroom with 2 sinks and a separate water closet for the toilet. Just beautiful! Nice, too, that everything is so new. The room didn't have much of a view, just the other buildings nearby and the mountains in the distance, but to get a Strip view, most hotels charge a premium. I used the hotel gym facilities, and found them to be excellent. Plenty of cardio machines, friendly staff, towels, water, and a separate space for folks wanting to use the floor to stretch or do work with balance balls. As an aside, there is a beautiful sitting area right outside the gym, complete with a built in fireplace that spans the wall! If you're looking for a space to escape the madness of the casino, that's the play. That said, the Aria casino is among my favorites! It's fairly quiet, good machines, lots of table games, adequate support staff working the floor, and plentiful Ticket Redemption machines. I ate at the fancy Italian Restaurant on the Promenade level, Sirio - very good food and service. Also tried the Skybox Cafe outside of the Sports Book (had a hankering for soup!), the food was good and the service was quick. Finally, I ate at the Buffet on Lobster night. The Buffet was fairly expensive (well over $30), but that includes a lobster, a glass of wine, and all the food from the buffet you care to eat. The lobster was rather tough, but the buffet in general was good. All told, I loved the Aria and would stay there again if I got a great deal on the room. It's rather expensive, but I feel it's a good value for the money.

We had a great view of the strip. Separate bath/shower area. The lights, curtains and audio is all controlled from a panel by your bed! It's wonderful. The bed is very comfortable and they offer a turn-down service in the evening. Lots of closet space for clothes. There is a in-safe box in the room to secure any valuables. The large reception area is well serviced and smells amazing! The check-in was swift and painless. There are various lifts to take you to your floors and we never found we were waiting for a lift. There are various eateries within the hotel from main meals to snacks and drinks. I did not use any of them as wanted to explore the surrounding area. The ARIA is set slightly further back off the strip so is a quieter option. To enter into the hotel you have to walk through a shopping area, therefore, you have about a 5 minute walk from the strip before you enter into the reception area. Whilst in Las Vegas I did see Jersey Boys which was excellent and well worth seeing if you have the opportunity. We purchased our tickets on the day from one of the many discounted booths which are dotted at various points along the strip. Try and take a visit to the Grand Canyon. We did a flight with Vision Airlines to the South Rim which was just magical. A highlight of the trip. We also did a visit to Lake Mead (which included a ride on a paddle boat) and a visit to the Hoover Dam. Again, a great day out and worth doing if you can. The hotel is close to the Bellagio (approx. 5-7 minute walk) and a visit to see the fountains dance to the music is a nice touch. They run every 30 minutes from 1500 - 2000 and then every 15 minutes from 2000 - 0100. The hotel offers free wifi in all areas which is great. Not that you will want to spend all day on the internet (!!), but good for being able to check out where places of interest are and also things such as online check in. The hotel is central on the strip and therefore is a perfect choice for visiting all that Las Vegas has to offer. There is a bus which operates up the strip and cost US$7 for 24 hours or US$20 for a 3 day pass. Well worth it and saves your legs (!) but it is great to walk the strip and see the various hotels. On day of check out they will hold your bags for you before the flight but there are no shower areas to freshen up before your flight. This would be a nice touch. Would suit anyone.

The rolls are going 3 to 4 feet at best. I bring this to the attention of my nearest dealer and he advises me that they have no rule to take the dice from the shooter should they continually not hit the wall (illegal rolls), and they can do is ask them nicely to do so. Getting no help from the dealer I directly and very pointedly as the Boxman to do something about the illegal rolls and he is obviously paying no attention as he has to ask the dealer if the person had been missing the wall. Nothing is done and the shooter keeps throwing short. How does an experienced Boxman miss 10 bad rolls when he is not distracted by anything such as a fill, a marker, or anything out of the norm and there are 3 people at the table and the action is minimal except for my play which is multiple black chips? How can this casino in good conscience take a Players money resulting from illegal rolls? Being the table I was at was not being ran professionally I picked up my chips and left for another table. In 20 years of playing Craps I have never had to do this.

The Aria brochures boast of their technology, but... The room-controls on the TV via remote were surprisingly slow, and limited in what they could do. (You could not program the music to greet you when you enter the room, for example.) In both rooms, when everything was turned off, the blue LED's from the room control system panel left an annoying noise, which we had thought was the buzz from the fridge. Maintenance brusquely unplugged the fridge in one of our rooms, when the front desk was unable to unlock it (the TV controls for un-locking the fridge was also defective). The first room - the wedge room had a tiny window - less than 1/8 the size of a proper city view window. We were put into this room when the front desk assured us it would be quiet, due to its having a smaller window surface. It turned out to be far from the case -- foot traffic from the three hallways that intersected right outside the wedge room. We were also placed on a floor that was not high enough from the HVAC above the first few floors of the hotel's city-side entrance. The second room had a TV defect with a long dead pixel line running down through the TV screen. The bathtub had a filthy old toilet smell to it. There were dark stains on the un-washed bedding. The bellman was very punctual, arriving five minutes early. He was also both courteous and competent - a very good combination, and the only redeeming quality to help Aria service's rating from receiving an abysmal 1 star. Amenities: The shower-tub arrangement in-room was interesting with the shower acting like an anteroom to the bathtub. Filling it up with hot water before a shower created a sort of water-based sauna. The fitness facilities had most of the usual. It was odd to find the lifeguards at the pool in parka's. What happens if they have to jump in? The in-room dining selection was limited, but there was a good selection of mid-level fine dining in the hotel. There was no in-room coffee maker. When we called about this, the front desk was bold enough to lie to us saying that, \"There is no in-room coffee maker at the Aria because it's a fire hazard.\" At this point, it just seemed ridiculous -- given the fact that Aria is LEED-certified and some sort of bearer of cutting-edge hotel technology, how can they not figure out how to appoint coffee makers that won't burn down the hotel? As for Aria coffee shops... it's the similar experience of disappointment you get at a casino-owned Starbucks, where you overpay for a badly-done cup made by the barristas who are not properly trained. Conclusion: Aria really ought to train their staff in knowledge of what constitutes a quiet room, and where the HVAC is. Also, for a hotel that claims distinction in its technology, Aria could also function better by having a tech check done each time a room is turned over -- this would account for TV's not having dead pixels running through it, for example.

Initially we had the basic room, which was comfy but had an adjoining room. This became a problem part way through the week when they placed a family with young kids next to us & the kids were out of control. We were moved the next day to a mountain view room. It was equally comfortable, much quieter, and the view was good. The property is huge-don't plan on getting around in a hurry. Check in was quick and easy. When we switched rooms, our keys were switched automatically, with no trip required to the front desk. We made dinner reservations each night, that morning-they were all honoured on time. We ate at Jean Georges Steakhouse twice-the food was fabulous both nights. I order my steak in between two of 'the norms'. Not only did I not get a funny look like I normally do, they actually had a name for it-and cooked it exactly how I enjoy it both nights! We ate at American Fish, and both enjoyed the food-although the menu is fairly different than 'normal'. We ate at The Buffet, and it was okay-pretty much what you'd expect for buffet food. We used the gym numerous times. It was well kept, spacious and easy to navigate. When I didn't see an item I wanted, they provided me with it from a hidden spot. The equipment was all well kept. Being from Canada where the no smoking by-laws are plenty, it was difficult to walk through the hotel anywhere near the casino. While it didn't smell as bad as I anticipated, it was still definitely noticeable. Location was fine-it was about a $15 cab ride to/from the airport. Ask drivers to use Tropicana. We saw the Elvis show and while it was okay, it wasn't great, and wasn't worth the price of the ticket. There were very limited amounts of Cirque-ish acts-so that was misleading. The other major beef was that they had women singing Elvis songs-HUH?? They sang along with a recording of Elvis sometimes, as accompaniment, and other times, just sang the song. This was hugely disappointing!!

It was only my second visit to Vegas - my first was 10 years ago (stayed at the Venetian) and things have changed quite a bit with business focusing more on dining, shopping and entertainment than gambling. The new City Center complex with the Aria is very attractive and sleek, but the overwhelming vanilla scent pumped through the lobby of the hotel is enough to give you a headache. The pool area is nicely laid out, with three separate pools, but be prepared for very loud music pumping through the speakers constantly. If you want a cabana, you may well be on a waiting list and not know until as late as noon (the pools close at 5 pm) If you do score a cabana - which I definitely recommend if you are with friends, you will have a lovely day with great service and some semblance of VIP service. Rooms at the hotel are not as big as I had expected. They are decent size - we stayed in one with 2 Queen beds and a view of the strip, but not large. The bathroom is nice, but not special and there was a dirty towel in the bathtub that I noticed when I took a shower - eeww! The fridge is one of those that if you move ANYTHING you will be charged, and there is a room fee of $35/day if you want to rent a small fridge for your own items. My traveling companions staying in another room just bought a cheap cooler and used that for beer and wine. Let's face, Vegas is not cheap anymore. You do get the feeling you are at the mercy of the resorts when it comes to food and drinks. You can get resourceful however and hit the liquor store on the way in from the airport, McD's for breakfast and splurge on dinner. The food at all the dining venues is VERY average and totally overpriced ($7.50 for a yogurt parfait) and since all the food kiosks are owned by the same company, there is no pricing competition. I visit NYC on a frequent basis and most corner bistros there provide better fare than anything I had at the Aria. We ate at three restaurants in the complex, Sage, Julian Serrano and Blossom. Blossom was by far the best experience. The food was delicious and the service was quite attentive. I think the better restaurants are chef/owner run rather than the larger corp. that owns the complex. Service at Sage started out fine (we had an early reservation) but went down hill very quickly once the place started to fill up. One of our dishes - I can't remember which, was poorly prepared and we couldn't get the waiter's attention to address it. By the time he returned to us (20 minutes later!) the rest of our party had finished their meal. The wait staff could not get us out of the restaurant fast enough after our expressing displeasure with our meal. Really, really awful customer service. I worked in the food service business for many years in my past incarnations, and don't think I ever witnessed a worse experience. Dinner at Julian Serrano was just ok. Nothing notable, but not terrible either. The best meals we has were actually at two Wolfgang Puck restaurants. We ate at the MGM twice and the restaurant in City Center once. The food was consistently good, fresh and creative; the service was wonderful and the prices reasonable for the quality of the menu. I would highly recommend either of those restaurants and would definitely go again. Last day at the Aria was spent at the Spa. With an early checkout (11:00 am!) and no flight until 10pm, it is well worth paying for the daily facility fee ($30) As a matter of fact, I think this is the BEST DEAL GOING. You have full access to all the spa facilities - including the gym and outdoor heated pool.(Be aware that the pool - co-ed - overlooks the party pool area called \"Liquid\" with really thumping party music playing all day long - not too relaxing for your spa experience- someone should have thought about that when planning the layout) You can shower and change there using all their products - great if you've already packed your luggage and don't want to tote all your toiletries. You can also go in and out of the spa area all day, so you are not restricted to staying there. A definite plus if you have to spend the day without your hotel room!! Overall, I might go back to the Aria if I were going to party with friends. But if I were going for a special occasion or with 1-2 girlfriends, I think I would check out the Mandarine.

The dinner buffet was nice but the breakfast buffet wasn't great,found the scrambled egg really buttery,not that warm and the pancakes tasted like they had been cooked in old oil. Also strange trembling sensation where we were seated the second time,not sure if it is located near the tram,but wasn't pleasant to sit and eat comfortably. Should have asked to be seated elsewhere,but didn't want to make a fuss. The casino seemed pretty busy but we aren't big players so we didn't spend much time there. We went to see the Elvis Cirque de soleil which was pretty expensive, $110 each,show lasted about and hour an a half. The theatre is lovely, some of the acrobatics was amazing but the actual story of Elvis's life was disappointing.Not worth the money. The maid service was variable.our first day the room didn't get cleaned until 4pm,the second and 3rd day before 2 and on our last full day,we were so exhausted that went back to the room to chill at 3 and the bed etc had still to be made,so we ended up just putting the private light on and made the bed up ourselves.

MOTEL like Check In There was no bell hops curbside when we pulled up in the cab to a) open the door b) take the luggage (5-star service?). When we got inside the check in area was an unorganized mess, no lines just a big blob of people and it was difficult to tell who was lining up for what or who was next. Waited about 10 minutes and finally got to the desk. When I presented an email that I had received a week before I arrived that said I have qualified for a free upgrade the clerk looked perplexed said 'Ummm' and asked me when I got it. I told him last week and he said sorry but there wasn't an upgrade available and that he wasn't even sure if he had a king suite like I had booked 2 months in advance. Finally after about 5 minutes of just standing there watching him type and stare at the computer in silence he said 'good news I found you a room'. A nice stressful check-in. Then after all that confusion you are expected to see yourself to your room (if you can find it on your own) and carry your own bags the half a mile (literally). No bell hop and they didn't even have a luggage cart available for us to use. In any other 5-star hotel in the world they carry your bags and show you to your room but not in this place. Room was attractive but DIRTY The room looked sexy and was over looking the pool but once the initial cool factor of the blinds opening and the TV turning on automatically wears off, quickly I might add, its just another hotel room and a dirty one at that. Housekeeping had definitely not done a good job as the room was dusty, had water marks on the end tables and there was bits of paper on the floor and papers from previous guest still on the dresser. I looked behind the chairs and end tables and it looked like it had never been cleaned, ever. I called down to the front desk to request housekeeping and got an automated recording that all the agents were busy and to try again. After calling 4-5 times over the next hour and could not reach the front desk. Also the lighting didnt work properly and some lamps didnt turn on or would turn off at random. Not 5 star. The housekeepers should be FIRED The next morning we ordered bacon and egg breakfast for two to the room and although it came quickly it was $84. Definitely 5 star prices. The cart sat outside our room for all of the next day despite the fact that we called down to let them know we were finished. We noticed alot of plates with old food, carts and empty beer bottles sitting in the hall for more than a day on our floor everyday. Not 5 star. When we returned to the room that afternoon 2 housekeepers had just gone into our room. Instead of going downstairs we decided to chill out at the end of the hall a few doors down and just wait for them. After all it was a 7 minute journey to get downstairs, one way from the room. We heard the vacuum turn on and then go off after 8 seconds. No joke I timed it. Then the housekeepers left our room after being in there for only about 2 minutes tops. We went into the room and they had left garbage in the garbage can, empty water bottles on the end tables and they had obviously not vacuumed. I called them back and pointed the things out and they made a brief and obviously for show effort to care and ran the vacuum for another 5 seconds. Ive stayed in Motel 6's on the Interstate that have better housekeeping. Not 5 star. Much of the staff had a serious ATTITUDE PROBLEM and they act like the guests are a bother Perhaps its the economy, perhaps its the fact that the place isnt making money and the staff arent getting their profit sharing checks but there was a real noticeable rotten attitude with alot of the unsmiling, miserable looking staff. Now thats not to say we didnt meet a few great smiling people working there but there is something wrong with alot of the Aria staff. First the burly security guards are intimidating and you get shaken down regularly in the halls for your room key with just a gruff 'room key' and a hand out. No 'please', 'sir' or 'thank you'. I'm glad they check but the fact that anybody can just walk up or ride the elevator up to the rooms without actually inserting a valid room key shows me that the shake downs are just for show and they get annoying after the three times in the first day. One evening we wanted to watch a sporting event and called down to the Deuce Lounge and asked if I could reserve a table. I was told that they weren't taking reservations and that it was first come first served for seating. We headed down with lots of time and went to walk in and was stopped and asked for our reservation. I told them I called down and said that I was told that I didn't need a reservation and that guy told me I could only get a table if I put a $300 non-refundable deposit towards my tab otherwise we had to stand. Not being sure if we were going to drop $300 on a few drinks and an appetizer or two I asked if we could sit at the bar and was told yes but when it gets a bit busier you will have to move. Nice way to treat guests. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers anyways. After about 30 minutes the place wasnt even busy and the manager type looking important guy came over and said 'Sorry but you have to move'. I told him that we just ordered food and that the place wasnt even busy he thought about it for a second and said 'Ok but youre going to have to move at some point'. Huh? Talk about treating your guests like children. Then finally as we were eating our second round of appetizers that we ordered the guy came back and told me he had to 'take' our stools. Now I was angry and reminded the schmuck that we were guests of the hotel, that we were paying good money for our suite and that in case he couldnt tell we were in the middle of eating and that we were not moving as it was completely unnecessary seeing as the bar wasn't packed, everyone had seats and there were people who had seats that weren't eating. He just walked off in a huff and didnt even say sorry or youre right or no problem. After that we stopped getting attention from the bartender and our drinks sat empty for a while, the bartender even cleaned our ashtray right beside the empty drinks and didnt bring us new ones. I knew that we werent going to get another beverage in there that night and left completely aggravated at the horrible treatment by staff after dropping $220 on drinks and a couple small things to eat. The next evening in the Gold Lounge we had a a mix drink and a beer and I tipped $5 on the $23 and we over heard the bartender say to the other bartender \"Cheap b*stard\". At that point we decided to not spend any more money at the Aria bars and instead went elsewhere making us really wish we hadn't stayed there. I could go on about how the service at the buffet stunk and we couldnt get a refill on our drinks for 30 minutes and how one of the security staff used the F word with my wife because she forgot her key upstairs or the fact that place just has NO SOUL and was the biggest regret and disappointment of my 11 years of going to Vegas but I don't want to write a novel the size of War and Peace. The Aria is definitely a sad addition to Vegas and if that is the future of hotels then Im not sure if I ever want to go back to Vegas at all. Its not fun, the un-inviting casino is like a funeral home and lacks that exciting Vegas feel. The Vanilla scent they pump into the place gave us a headache and permeated our clothing and hair. I could still smell it in my suitcase weeks later. Gross. Oh and check your bill carefully. They tried to charge us for a bunch of items in the mini fridge that we didnt even touch let alone use. Bottom line is I WONT BE BACK and the Aria should stop calling themselves a 5 Star resort because IT CLEARLY ISN'T. And if any Aria management reads this: Go and visit a real 5-star hotel and you will see all the things that you are missing, train your miserable staff on how to treat guests and clean your FILTHY rooms.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque, NM", "Title": "\u201cThe Good, The Bad & The REALLY Bad\u201d", "Author": "toxypharmgirl", "ReviewID": "UR121472854", "Content": "Just returned from 4 nights at Aria in a Standard King with Mountain View Good: The room is very modern with a great view of the mountains (not strip), awesome bathroom.

Prices in the casino for food are really high---paid $16 for a small coffee, a 16oz bottled water and a plain grilled ham and cheese sandwich---WOW!! REALLY BAD: Oh where to start, housekeeping needs to be seriously retrained. Day 1: On arrival the bed sheets were stained with make-up and there was hair on the pillows. Called for replacements, had to wait approx. 1 hour for replacements to be brought up and low and behold there is still hair on the pillows. Day 2: Blanket on the foot of the bed has a large crusty white stain on it when we return to the room. Called for a replacement, waited approx. 30 minutes for replacement and then they brought the wrong blanket so had to wait another 30 minutes for the correct blanket. Told that the foot blanket and bedspread are not changed with each new guest. We must not have noticed the stain on night one due to the way it was folded----should have looked closer that first night. GROSS!! Day 3: no housekeeping problems, sigh of relief Day 4: Leave the room at 1:00pm, left the service light on, returned at 11:00pm and the room had not been cleaned and service light was still on. Called to have someone at least clean the bathroom and bring clean towels which occurred about 45 minutes after the call making for a very late night with early flight the next day. Told by housekeeper that if you want to make sure the room gets cleaned you have to call before you leave the room (WHAT??????) Overall impression: Wanted to love this place because the room is really nice but the housekeeping service is so severely lacking that I cannot in good conscious recommend this hotel to anyone. Have had better housekeeping at $60/night hotel and this was $180/night, I expect a better than average housekeeping experience in this price range which was in no way met.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Kelowna, Canada", "Title": "\u201c5 star rating all the way-------\u201d", "Author": "peacefullduck", "ReviewID": "UR121470387", "Content": "arrived las vegas airport early ..taxi ride to the hotel.check in line for invited guest was very short.desk clerk was very polite and we were on our way to our room with-in ten minutes.bell hop was up with our luggage about twenty minutes later.extremely happy guy and wanted to show us how all the features operated with the electronic aspects.how ever as this was our 4th stay at this hotel it was not necessary.maid service and turn down service every day.we had a room on the 25th floor and the view was excellent.we had breakfast buffet every morning and was good.sat was a bit heavy price wise.approx [55.00] dollars for two people.for the extra bit off seafood and who wants that at 7 am.sevice for drinks on casino floor was no problem.the tram that runs -ballagio-monte carlo a great boost.we did some shopping at the fashion show mall-cesars and the mile at planet hollywood.also the outlets down town.went down town by the duece bus. always lots to do in vegas.love the HYPE.also did some casino hopping on the strip.stay at the ARIA and you will not be sorry.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Clair Shores, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNeed better cleaners\u201d", "Author": "Dancer9265", "ReviewID": "UR121463782", "Content": "I sent my parents to ARIA for their 30th anniversary and unfortunately they were displeased with the first two rooms they entered.

This stay was my second at the Aria, and like the first, was fantastic. Check-in was simple and quick, and their automated check-out process made leaving for an early morning flight simple, even though their systems were down when I checked out. Despite the many floors and room volume, you rarely have to wait more than 10-15 seconds for an elevator, a surprisingly critical positive in the Vegas experience. The room is five-star in every way; the automated nature of everything from the blinds to the television to the bathroom lights appeals to me (although judging from some other reviews, may cause a notch down in star rating for others). The room was exceptionally clean, and I noticed very few, if any, signs of wear in the hotel's second year. Due to the conference schedule I kept while there, I appreciated the any-time-of-day room cleaning; whenever I set my room to 'Service' it was clean upon my return. The only small nit (very small indeed) was that the bed was a bit too soft for my personal taste, but the pillows/blankets were plush and in excellent condition. Across all my travels - of which my TripAdvisor reviews provide a good glimpse - this is one of my favorite properties for lodging and would continue to return here for future events.

We arrived at the hotel at about 830 pm Vegas time. The bell hop was very nice, and our luggage was brought to our room promptly. Check in was incredibly quick and pleasant. All of the employees seemed very friendly. The hotel is beautiful, and very modern. Yes, there is a vanilla smell throughout the hotel, but not in the rooms. I thought it was nice, no complaints about it. The rooms are beautiful as well. We stayed on the 9th floor, and asked to be close to the elevators. It did seem that the hallways were quite long, so being close to the elevators is convenient if you can. I didn't hear any noise at night. There is a control panel next to the bed, which controls pretty much everything- lights, curtains, TV. Very high tech. The bathroom was great- separate tub and shower right next to eachother. There were plenty of hangers and drawers. There are robes to enjoy also. Being only on the 9th floor, the view was still cool in my opinion- the mountains were very nice, and we could still see some of the neighboring hotels. If you want a really good view, I assume the higher up the better. The beds are amazing! I slept like a baby indeed. There is a fully stocked mini bar that is pretty sensitive from what we were told, so it's probably best not to touch anything you don't want to be charged for. The safe is in the nightstand next to the bed. Housekeeping was certainly lacking. The first day, our room was not cleaned at all. We didn't really mind, because we just called and had more towels sent up. Day two, we were gone again, came back to our room at 230 pm, and the maid was just starting our room. We were surprised that they came so late, after having not cleaned our room the day before. Not a deal breaker, but could certainly be improved. It's still pretty new, so I'm sure it will be more efficient in time. As far as food goes, we only tried the buffet and Jean Phillipe Patisserie. The buffet at the Aria is pretty bad for the price. I think it was around 30/person for dinner. We expected so much more, and the food and setting were just bland. Jean Phillipe Patisserie is absolutely phenomenal! You can get up in the morning and grab a coffee and delicious pastry. (There isn't a coffee maker in your room.) We did that every morning, and the prices were not bad at all. Don't forget to grab your free paper across from Jean Phillipe, as it is included in the resort fee. Speaking of the resort fee, it's 20 dollars per day, so add it in to your rate per night to get your real price. The pools seemed nice, but it was a bit too chilly for us to go for that. The attached Crystals mall is one of those very pricey malls, with the fancy pants stores, so unless you plan on spending $600 on a shirt, it's not a great place to shop. However, it's great for the tram, which takes you to Bellagio and/or Monte Carlo. We loved using the tram- it really eliminated a lot of walking. Todd English Pub is also a great place to go for happy hour, and it's right in Crystals as well. We really enjoyed the food and drink specials. The location is very good. It's pretty centrally located. All in all, we were very pleased with our first Vegas trip, staying at the Aria resort. We are in our late 20's/ mid 30's, and this hotel seemed perfect for that age group, in my opinion.

And funnily enough even as active persons we found a bit boring the short walk you have to take to reach the Strip once you leave the hotel.

Online pictures showed it to be a beautiful new hotel on the strip with lots of amenities so we figured we would give it a try. We arrived at the hotel at about 7:00 pm after clearing customs and our shuttle taking us to the hotel. We were dropped off in the basement level of the hotel and met by a bell man right away. We asked him where the lobby was to check in and he gave us the option of the escalators or the elevator, both of which would take us to the lobby. Well we chose the escalator, and quickly found out it did not take us to the lobby. Instead we were outside along the edge of a road with many people hurrying around to get taxis and limos for people. They were far to busy to answer us when we asked where the lobby was. So we went through the doors to where we could see the elevator. There was a sign in there saying entertainment lobby and pointing up another escalator. Well that was just for shows. So back down we came. We went into the casino which we could see through the glass doors. No where could we see a sign saying where the lobby was so we went in search of one. Well about two minutes into the middle of the slot machines we saw a sign saying lobby. So we followed it back the way we came.... which was not the lobby. Then after a little more wandering around and trying to ask staff where the lobby was we started back into the casino floor again. We finally came across some signs, but looking at one sign it would point to our right and you could see another sign further down that would point straight ahead. So after following one set of signs we found ourselves back at the exact same spot! So now my wife was pissed. We had been dragging our suitcases through the casino for 10 minutes not, no one would help us other than to point and the signs were crap! Well, we finally found the check in desk after about 10 more minutes of wandering around following different signs. I was on the complete opposite end of the hotel from where we came up! Check in was a breeze, the girl behind the counter understood our frustrations since we were not the only ones who have said this to her and she got us checked in nice and quick. We finally got to our room and even though it was on the back side of the hotel on the 15th floor, the view was spectacular and the room was amazing! So we settled in and learned how to use the touch screen to operate the room (it was amazingly automated) and then wanted to go look at the strip. So back down to the lobby we went. We arrived at the lobby and asked how to get to the strip. We were told to just go out the front doors and we would be there. Not. We stepped outside and were at the drop off in front of the hotel, but there was nothing but a road leading to it with ramps coming up and down and cars buzzing all over the place. So we walked one way along the sidewalk until we reached a pinch point that was quite narrow. So we stopped, this could not be the way to go, we must have turned the wrong way. The only things we could see was a big residential tower in front of us, so we turned back and went the other way until we ran into the roadway with cars coming and going so fast we didn't ant to cross. Still there was no strip in sight. We tried asking a bellman, but again we were ignored. So we gave up and went back inside to look around. We looked through some shops and laughed at the gouging prices of items. We looked at some restaurant menus and almost died at the prices they charged for food. There is no such thing as a quick or easy snack in this hotel, it is all high priced and \"inspired by chef so and so\". Blah blah blah. This is all this place had, overpriced stuffy places to eat! Well we were hungry so we decided to try Lemon Grass, the Thai restaurant (I'll be doing a review of it as well) and it was amazing! The food was fantastic and the service was very good. The bill at the end on the other hand was kind of ridiculous. or the two of us to eat our favorite Thai dish (Cashew chicken and Yellow curry) cost us over $100 including a glass of wine for my wife. Back home in Canada, we have the exact same thing for about $35 not including the glass of wine. So after dinner we decided it was time to wander some more and try to find the strip again. We ended up in the Crystal Center, a shopping mall filled with high end stored (Louis Viton, Gucci, etc) where there was nothing remotely practical about the items being sold. The one good thing we found was Mastro's Ocean Club (another review to come). Well we finally found some decent signage and found our way to the strip! Once out there it was fun to check things out. The rest of the stay had us cruising the strip and checking out other venues(which I'm hoping to do some reviews on). We really did not spend an time in our hotel as the food was way over priced compared to other places on the strip, and the entertainment was not there. We did find out in short order that because we dressed casual, the level of service was not there for us. I hate to think that it was because of our ethnicity too, but we had a few occasions where were were in line where other ethnicity were taken out of line or moved to the front. It always happened with one group. Even the dealers were catering to that group. I sure hope it was because I like to dress in shorts and t shirts that I could not be catered upon in this hotel. With that being said, I would never go back. Although the facility is fantastic. The staff and amenities were severely lacking.

I was traveling with family who had been to Vegas before and they said the hotel was one of the newest on the strip and was among one of the nicer ones they had visited. But the service is not that great. I had a long wait from when I arrived to when I could check in. It takes a long time to get the rooms cleaned and they seem to intentionally leave long line-ups to the buffet but when you get inside there are tons of empty tables. The waiter I had at the lunch cafe was very nice but he took forever to bring me a menu and to take my order and then to bring the food. And a sandwich and a coffee cost me $20. Yikes. The checkout process was a disaster. I tried to do it on the TV but after scrolling up and down to enter in all the info it said that system was down and try later. So I phoned the front desk and was put on hold for 10 min. I phoned other numbers to ask if they could ask the front desk to give me a call. They said they could not help and told me to phone the front desk back. So I did and again could not get through. By this point I had wasted over 20 min and had to hang up so I could rush to get to my airport shuttle. Didn't get a copy of my receipt. I also thought that for the cost of the room and considering they also charge a $20/night 'resort fee' that they could stop 'nickle and dime-ing' people. Maybe it is a Vegas thing because I think that if they could find a way to charge for air they would. Turns out the mini-bar is programmed so that if you touch anything in it you will be charged for it even if you don't take it. I rearranged some items to try to make room to chill my own water bottle. Good thing I thought to check my bill the night before check out because otherwise I would not have had time to dispute it and I would have been charged for over $50 worth of water and snacks I hadn't touched. They sent someone to 'audit' my mini-bar who told me I should have read the room manual where this was explained and lectured me that the refrigerator was not for my personal use. Oh really? I went to the business center to print out my boarding pass (included in my 'resort fee'). The computers I was allowed to use to do this were in the main room sitting on a tall counter but they were not working. I saw other computers in private rooms but was told that you had to pay to use them. They did let me use them but cautioned me that if I did anything else I would be charged. What would it cost them to let that go given the others were broken and the place was virtually empty. Just cheap. I am not sure if I would go back to the Aria.

The staff are excellent too - the hotel has 5 star quality but without behaving in a pretentious way. It has a modern approach to hospitality and doesn't have a formal feel to it, but equally you wouldnt feel out of place if you prefer that approach. If you don't like big hotels and you're looking for a personal meet and greet boutique experience, then maybe you'll struggle to find something in Vegas, but worth noting this place is MASSIVE and could be deemed in-personal!

I travel to Vegas a few times a year and have stayed at the Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, etc. I decided on staying at the Aria because I got a good deal on priceline. The hotel location is good - it is in the City Center complex in the heart of the strip. It is a very easy walk to the brand new Cosmpolitan, the Bellagio, etc. Self parking is free and the walk is about 5-10 minutes to get from the parking to the hotel - about the norm for Vegas. The decor is modern, dark and the hotel is filled with a vanilla scent. I don't mind vanilla, but I could see how it could bother some people. We had a standard king bed room on the 28th floor. The room is a good size and nicely appointed, though not up to the standards of other 5* hotels in Vegas. The room is entirely controlled by a digital ipad-type computer next to the bed. While the technology is cool, it isn't particularly intuitive and the touch screen is not particularly responsive, making it hard to use. The bathroom is nice but the frosted glass between the sink area and the toilet vault takes some getting used to. Oddly, the glass in our bathroom appears to be installed backwards. The glass is designed so one can see out but not in, giving some minimal privacy. Oddly, our glass one could see in, but not out. Oops. Also our bathroom, while clean, had shower head issues in that the shower head was not installed properly. A call to the front desk had it fixed quickly. The soaps provided by the hotel suck. They are some low quality chinese soap in Aria packaging. The other 5* hotels in town have fancy toiletries (i.e., l'ocittaine). So this was a big let-down. Also, the towels are small and are not soft. I was spoiled with the large soft towels at the Wynn and Venetian. These were mediocre towels at best. The rest of the room was ok. The bed is very very soft. If you like hard beds, do not stay here. I like a firm mattress and found the bed to be a bit unbearable. Also, we had issues with the phones in the hotel. Every once in a while they would short-out and reset, causing dropped calls. The front desk seemed disinterested, as if it occurred a lot. We used the spa which was nice. The spa was clean and modern. We had to pay a daily $20 amenity fee with our reservation which is a huge scam. It is supposed to include phone calls, a newspaper and internet in the fee. I never once saw my free newspaper and the internet only worked when there was a low load on the system - i.e. early morning or very late at night. It was nearly impossible to connect and use the internet between 5pm and midnight. Also, on weekends, there is a club that plays low bass-thumping music. We could hear every beat on the 28th floor. So keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper. The club isn't open weekdays so there was no noise except on the weekend portion of our stay. Overall, Aria is ok.

Checking out, there were front desk employees walking around with iPads reviewing the charges and checking us out on the spot with an email confirmation. It was just so easy. If you are going to stay at this hotel, spend the extra $50 and upgrade to the corner suite. There are always promotions going on and it really is so worth it. I took a bath looking out onto the Las Vegas Strip and the floor to ceiling windows make you feel like you are actually on the strip. However my favorite part was the bathroom. I never needed to use toilet paper during the whole trip and wouldn't go anywhere except my suite. In the bathroom, they had a wash and dry station for your derriere. I want to get one installed at my house! As far as dining, the only meal had at the hotel was at The Buffet. They had any and everything anyone could ever ask for. I just wish I was more hungry, but when I left, I thought for sure I was going to pop. The food was fresh and tasty from traditional breakfast items to Asian/Kosher/Italian/Southern cuisine as well as fresh fruit, made to order omelets, and pastries. They also had lunch items if you weren't in the mood for breakfast. I could go on and on about how nice the hotel was, but you just have to see it for yourself. And while it is a walk from the strip, it wasn't bad and you could take the FREE tram between properties.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cAmazing as usual!\u201d", "Author": "seattledude01", "ReviewID": "UR121084813", "Content": "Our 2nd time staying at Aria.

I reserved 2 corner suites and we were all very excited about staying here. I paid an extra $284 per person to book the corners!! (Since this was such a special occassion, I didn't want to risk not being offerred upgrades upon check-in, which is the route we normally take and yes, it is generally much cheaper.) -Check in: Having done my homework, I requested rooms above the 25th (the towers are not as wide, requiring much less of a hike from the elevators) and a city view. The COLD gentleman behind the counter took a call and talked for a while, then casually handed us our keys--my parents were on the 10th floor, not city view, we were on the 17th, with city view. He claimed I only \"paid for\" one city view room and that he apologized for the lower floors, but that's what was available. Of course I wanted to trade rooms with my parents, but my father wouldn't hear of it. No upgrades were offerred and the clerk could have cared less that neither of our requests were honored. (I actually had tears in my eyes!) I must admit that this experience alone is the MAIN reason for only 3 stars. -The HIKE to our room: It was a loooong way to the room! The first few times we walked it, it seemed to take forever. After a while though, we just accepted it and it didn't seem as long...but it IS! -The first entering of the room: After all the reading and reviews, I expected this wonderland delite of lights coming on and curtains opening up, and the TV greeting us, and, and, and....NOTHING. We had to fumble around to hit light switches and turn things on. Disappointment #2 in only a matter of minutes. -The room itself: Our view was nice! I loved curtains in all rooms. It was like a mini apartment! The robes and slippers were awesome. The living area was comfy and I liked having a refridgerator...great for keeping that 1/2 a sandwich you couldn't eat earlier and some beverages. We didn't touch the mini-bar, but it was stocked up! The bathroom was interesting. The sinks take up too much of the counter space for my liking and I found putting curling irons and makeup places a bit awkward. The bidet brought lots of curiosity & laughter! Loved the heated toliet seat :) The bed was VERY comfy--I do prefer a softer bed and have a sleep number at home. (I'm a 35 and hubby a 40 on the SN and this was comparable.) The linens were soft and cozy. The pillows were absolutely wonderful and we are ordering 2 for home! (You can buy them in the gift shop if you have room to carry them home. Otherwise, you can have them shipped. They are $20 for a queen and $28 for a king, plus s/h.) The full room controller: I have an iPad, etc., so am comfortable using a touch screen and navigating around. It wasn't that navigation was difficult, but there were simply too many buttons to have to select to make things that you want to happen, happen...meanwhile, all sorts of things you don't want to happen, would happen! It was quicker to just walk over to a switch, but even then odd things happened. One morning I watched the sun coming up from the living room while hubby snoozed. I wanted more lights on, so I hit \"room on\" and the next thing I know I had opened up the bedroom curtains, etc. and blinded him awake! Oops, so sorry babe! (He hit a switch on the controller at the precise moment I decided to try the bidet, and I didn't know how to turn it off in the dark...yeah, it's funny now :) The pad in the room was also too bright! I prefer it dark when I sleep, so I told my husband to lay it down...he did and lights and the TV popped on....so much for that! My father said he had to lay a towel over theirs. -The casino: They do a great job with the smoke and smell! The slots were mostly digital, but there were a few fun ones that entertained with extra spins, etc. The dealers seemed nice enough, although many were a bit stuffy. The woo-hoo atmosphere found at many casinos when tables are full was few and far between. The most fun we saw people having was playing casino war! We had as good of and even better drink service here as anywhere else we went. -The food, etc.: We just did coffee downstairs at Jean's each morning and it was tasty. They also have an assortment of pastries. We also had the ___Vetra (?) cafe one morning and had the eggs benedict with lump crab--yummy, and super nice staff! We had the buffet one evening b/c we wanted to try the king crab legs. They are on ice, but you can get them heated up. They were tasty, and I loved they were split, but I would take the meat out and then squeeze it and water would just pour off--my plate was almost spilling over with water by the time I rang out about 7 or 8 legs...rather unappealing. The beef from the chinese section was my favorite part of the meal! They did have a nice selection, and to have king crab included for $29.99 really was a good deal! -Maid Service: They did a great job keeping the room tidied each day...no complaints there. They did take our robes on the last day and did not replace them. (I told my husband that this may be customary on the last night so people don't steal them...of course not so!) The evening turndown service made it so nice to come in and slip into a robe & slippers and look out over the city lights from the couch or bed. They leave chocolates and have soft lights & music on. (One evening they didn't turn down at all, which was a little disappointing.) I liked the service & privacy buttons inside the door--much easier than fumbling with a tag with the door open. -Boarding Passes: The concierge was sooooo friendly and gladly printed our boarding passes....thought we'd take advantage of the service since it's included in the resort fee. -Checking out: You can easily view your charges on the TV and check out. You just fill out a card and put your room keys with it and drop it at the elevators. HOWEVER, the charges are all broken down in ways that I was confused so decided to look over my bill at the desk....the charges were not broken down on that print out and made more sense. I also became a bit paranoid about not having our robes replaced and wanted to bring it the hotel's attention so we weren't charged $60 each for them. (That's how much they were in the gift shop anyway...) The clerk looked at me a bit suspiciously, but said she would note it. Good thing I checked out at the desk, or we would have been charged for stealing robes! In spite of a sour beginning and end at the front desk, we did enjoy the hotel and our room. The guys at the elevator were friendly to us and it wasn't a big deal to show our room key as others have complained about. (I certainly wanted to ensure I had it with me anyway before making the trek to the room!) The walk to the strip isn't that bad, although it is not \"on the strip\" and does require some effort. We cabbed it a few times to save energy...speaking of which, don't think you can go to the front desk area and get a cab--that is a drop off zone only and you have to go all the way across to the other side for pick up. Hopefully Aria will work on making guests feel more welcome upon check in & strive to meet (reasonable) requests.

You can shut the bathroom off (close the door to the toilet and then the sliding door to the bathroom itself and that keeps the air out fof the suite but still so irritating.

Only other oddity is that sinks cannot be stoppered, so hard to shave in the morning - modern design going one step too far. otherwise, a great hotel.

The quality was very high. We found the casino floor very smokey but that could be that we are Canadians and not allowed to smoke in our casinos but we were prepared for that from previous visits. That did not hamper the urge to play the slots. The Viva Elvis show was also very enjoyable and the time went very quickly as it was very fast paced. The seating in the theatre is so comfortable you would think you were sitting in your own living room with excellent leg room. There is a tram running from the Monte Carlo to the Bellagio with a stop at the Aria/Crystal, similar to the one that runs from the Mandalay Bay to the Excalibur, but you still need a very very comfortable pair of shoes.

The Casino has a nice vanilla smell to it, not smoky like others which is great. However it is hard to win here, the money was flying out of my hands!!! The hotel is big.

I was never notified by Aria about exposure to the disease. NHD said it was Aria's responsibility to contact everyone who stayed there 2 weeks before the discovery of the bacteria, and 2 weeks after. That was in late July and Aria has still not contacted me. I always like to soak in a tub and read a book, then shower after the bath. That made for long exposure to steam.

A five star hotel typically also has name brand shampoos and lotions in the bathroom, The Aria instead chose to go with generic private labeled stuff. A five star hotel makes sure that all of their staff from the valet to the guy at the gym check -in are friendly and helpful. We encountered several people who were less then this when asked for simple questions regarding directions or program options. Also the bed was a bit too soft for my preference. What I did like about the place was the many dining options on site, although if you are a foodie avoid the Buffet. While the food is plentiful, the taste and quality is less than what you can find at the Bellagio Buffet The building's Green status with LEED Gold certification should be commended especially in a place as full of waste and excess as Las Vegas. Overall I think you can do better for a 5 star experience at the Bellagio, Wynn, Encore or Cosmopolitan.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guelph, Canada", "Title": "\u201cContinued Improvement\u201d", "Author": "MortyCanada", "ReviewID": "UR120580691", "Content": "We have stayed at Aria several times, with the first stay not long after the hotel had opened.

We have also stayed at the Palazzo, Venetian, and Bellagio. Good: - Location: Aria is next door to Crystals upscale shopping center (Tiffany, Louis Vuittan, Cartier, etc), in fact we walked through the mall to get to the Aria. It is also next to the Mandarin with Monte Carlo, and then New York, New York to the right. to the left is Veer Towers, Vdara, Harmon, then Cosmopolitan, Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. We walked to New York, New York and also Caesar's Palace. - Room was high tech with the TV doubling as a command center to open/close curtains, dim the lights. When we first walked, the curtains opened! We had a room with a view of the strip, Planet Hollywood and the pool at hotel next door. The windows were about floor to ceiling. Bed was very comfortable. Two chairs and a desk. There really wasn't a chair that you would want to curl up in and read a book though. Mini-bar with some items displayed on top as well. Don't pick them up and look since they are on a pressure sensitive platform. - Double closets with chest of draws between them. Nice, thick bathrobes. - Bathroom had a double basin sink and to the right was a large glass shower with tub behind that. Toilet was behind a glass door. The Aria toiletries were nice quality, less bad chemicals like SLS in other hotels but they did not have much smell. You can buy bigger versions at the gift shop. I should have bought some on Wed when it was really cheap because on Thursday, it was will on sale but for for a few dollars more. - Cupcake bakery was good. I got the Red Velvet and Creme de Menthe cupcakes. - Large pools and big, big drinks you can buy, like 32 oz. We got a mojito to split and it lasted us several hours. It was good but the big drinks were not very strong. We didn't get much of a buzz, but it was nice to have something cold and wet. - Julian Serrano tapas restaurant - so many things to choose from! We enjoyed our tapas. I tried the absinthe drink which was a dark green liquid dripped over a sugar cube. I did it for the novelty and to try something that used to be illegal but also enjoyed by Fitzgerald, Hemmingway, and other famous writers. It was a good value for the money in terms of getting a buzz if you could stomach the taste. It had a strong, burney alcohol, green taste - definitely a sipping drink. My husband said, \"it was the worst thing I have tasted in my life!\" with the appropriate expression to match. - \"The Buffet\" was really good and a good value. I thought the food was higher quality than at Paris, Paris, and it was very considerate that the cold Alaskan crab legs came split. Several meat choices (roast beef, chicken, fish, hamburgers, shrimp and some carving stations), fresh Indian naan bread, side dishes, and many delicious small desserts and cookies and gelato. We ate three lunches at \"The Buffet.\" As a tip to you, I would suggest going for the late breakfast so your time overlaps with the lunch time, so you can eat for the lower breakfast price and then still get the lunch hot meal items. We timed it right although we had to wait in line to get in. Not so Good: - Funny, upscale subtle perfumey/expensive talcun powder smell at the Crystal mall and in the Aria. If you are chemically sensitive, this might not be a good place for you. I did notice it but fortunately, it didn't make my eyes water or cough. - It look a good 30-45 minutes to check-in. On the Wednesday, there were only 3 or 4 people in each of the several lines. It took an abnormally long time for the people ahead of us to be processed in and for the couple to the left of us. The front desk clerk stood there staring down at the monitor and I was watching to see if they fell asleep or not. For us, I had my credit card out and other than the short delay for them to find us a room, it didn't take as long for us to get checked in. - The Casino was done in dark browns, so as some reviews have said, it is like being in a cave or at least a modern one. - The Buffet service - it can take a while to get your first drink from your server. The first time, we were mid-way on our 2nd plate of food before someone finally came by. Pretty much, you can bet on no drink refills or a long wait for your refill unless the server brings you two drinks at once. Tip: You may want to ask for two drinks at once if you like to drink a lot with your meal. We were able to get coffee once for dessert but even then it took quite a while. It can also vary on how long your dirty plates stay on your table. Some of the wait staff are more attentive then others.

I saved up for months, and got a deal through a Vegas travel website for the Aria, which looked really nice from their website. I got a good price on a corner suite. I decided to share my room with a friend, and when I added her to the booking and asked for a rollaway bed, I asked about an upgrade to a larger room. They said an upgrade to the level of suite just above a corner suite was not available, so they gave me one level above that, for only the additional charge of what the unavailable suite would have cost on top of the regular price for the corner suite, not my lower special price. Basically, I got the suite two levels up for barely more than the normal corner suite price. When we arrived, they said the room wasn't ready, and we could wait 15 minutes for cleaning, or take an upgrade. I asked how much, and they said no charge. We ended up with a MASSIVE suite, with a nice bedroom, huge master bath, giant shower, huge jacuzzi tub, kitchen with a sink and mini fridge, dining room, nice living room, big flat screen TVs in nearly every room (4 total, including the master bath), and another small bathroom. The decor was sleek, modern, and everything was clean and stylish. Everything in the room was high-tech, including the toilet. You could control lights, temperature, curtains, music, and TV in any room with the TV remote or light switches in any other room or the control panel by the bed, and set all those things to activate as an alarm clock in the morning. The only downsides were that the sink in the wet bar/kitchen area didn't work, and the toilet bubbled alarmingly at random times. Huge, loud bubbles would suddenly start coming up in the toilet for no reason. The staff assured us that this was due to maintenance and would be fixed on a certain day, but it did not stop on that day. I suspect that like most Vegas hotels, constructions was slap-dash in order to make a quick buck, and that there are just flaws in the way it was built. Also, the light switches were way too complicated and we never quite figured them out. We were constantly closing curtains in the next room when we wanted to turn a light on in the one we were in. All the technology was cool, but when you need instructions for light switches, it's a bit much. The air conditioner worked a little too well, and despite being there in summer, we kept having to turn the thermostat up to stop the air from coming on and freezing us. The restaurants were pricey, and just OK. We got tickets to Cirque du Soleil's Ka, which was excellent, through the concierge desk, and they seem to have given us a big discount because of the plumbing problems. Staff was always extremely polite and helpful. The M club was an excellent deal and better than any other players' club we looked into or had used recently. The location in City Center was gorgeous and felt much nicer than the gaudy Strip, but it was right there in the middle of everything where we could just walk right to any Strip location we wanted. Pool area was absolutely beautiful, with several pools and nice private areas where you could get away from all the people.

The waterfall feature out the front is really pretty, especially how the water falls in \"waves\". The check in and check out was fast and the staff are really nice. The room was incredible! It was a corner suite. The bed was so soft, apparently they are custom made for the Aria. We'd just come from this terrible apartment in New York where we had to sleep on a little futon, so getting to lie on this enormous, pillowy bed was just amazing. We had a separate living area with comfy couches and a huge TV. There was no view though, really. Out the bathroom window you could see the monorail track, and out the bedroom and living area windows you could see down onto the roof and the front of the hotel. Wasn't a big issue to me as I've been to Vegas before. The bathroom was out of this world! The toilet doubled as a bidet and it had a heated seat - no joke. The shower was huge and the bathtub was really big too and had built in spa jets. I ended up having a bath every day because it was so nice. There's a restaurant near the lobby with these weird greenish glass cones at the entry. The breakfast there was delicious. The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel was the security staff. I accidentally left my pajamas in the bed and the cleaning staff must have picked them up with the sheets. I called housekeeping and they were really apologetic about it and said that they would get Security to call me so I could put in like a stolen goods report. I told them this wasn't necessary and it was obviously just a mistake, but they insisted. Someone from Security called and asked if they could come to the room the next morning at 9. We waited til 10am, and no one showed up. I called the front desk and they said that in fact I didn't need to talk to Security, I could just put in a lost and found report, and they would get someone to call me about it. The woman who did call me was so rude. She kept saying I needed to put in a stolen goods report, and I kept saying I had been told I didn't need to. Then she said someone would have to come to the room to take a lost and found report, and I said \"but isn't that what you are calling me for?\" Then there was just silence on the phone. I asked for her name and she got really nasty then. Turns out she was actually from Security. So I have no idea what was going on. She took down some of my details and told me that I needed to call the hotel in a few days to see if they found my pajamas. I asked then why she was taking my details, because wouldn't they call me if they found them? She started yelling at me, saying really slowly and loudly that the laundry was done off site (well, of course I knew that) and I would have to call back. Oh my goodness...don't lose anything in this hotel, you don't want to have to deal with these people. Needless to say I never saw my pajamas again.

This was an extra special visit as I had arranged to take my parents for a suprise celebration of their 40th anniversary. A number of the TA reviews had worried me although the comms I had before with their guest relations over requests I had made over my parents room reassured me somewhat esp as we were staying for 7 nights. The last time I was in Vegas was 3 years ago where I stayed in the Bellagio and along with the Cosmetpolian, Adara etc were new additions to the Strip. First impressions: super modern and the rooms where better than anywhere else I had stayed in espcially with all the high tech gadgetary. Unfortunately and despite a number of comms with them about being next or near to my parents rooms, they put us opposite ends of the hotel albeit on the same floor. This wouldnt have normally been a major problem but as the hotel is so big it took 10 mins to get to each others room. When I said that I wasnt happy to the check-in staff member - they asked me to come back in the morning to get a closer room. When I went back in the morning - they asked me to come back after 11am. As I was getting frustrated, I asked my wife to sort and she rang the manager who took 5 mins to confirm the next door room would be available in 2 hours (this is the reason for giving them a 4) as they clearly dont have any proper system to ensure special requests as properly actioned. Personally, I really liked the location of the Aria and whilst it is slightly set back from the strip in comparison to the Bellagio for example - I think it would be harder to get a better location (within the best part of the strip). The casino area was spacious and modern although to be honest they are all very similar (esp the newer ones with part marbled floor as opposed to purely being all carpeted which I think look more dated). The only aspect which I think could be improved was the Crystals Shopping Centre which was linked and adjacent to the Aria. I can understand why they have put all top end boutiques and jewellers there but it didnt help to make a particularly good atmosphere due mainly to the lack of shoppers. We preferred the amphoshere across the road in the Planet Hollywood Shopping mile precinct and could at least afford to buy a few bits and pieces!!

The concierge fees are built into the daily resort fee so use them! They handled all my requests in a timely, knowledgeable and friendly manner. We asked about restaurants, shows, they even printed our boarding passes. Location- be aware that this is set off the strip just a tad. It is located right next in line from the Ballagio, Caesars and Cosmopolitan. This is in the heart of the strip near all high end Vegas hotels and the Aria fits in their category although maybe a little less \"buzz\" at the Aria when we walked the strip on Saturday night. Restaurants- Jean Phillipe Pattiserie should not be missed. Grab a coffee and a pastry. We also hit the Tapas place and was good. Right next to the hotel connected to the mall is a place called Todd English Pub. Excellent beer selection and good bar type food (and raw bar). Good vibe in there too. Go early and get the 10.00 beers at half price (ha! its vegas everything is expensive). I would give it 5 stars but cant due to the hotel bars and nightlife. I did not see a bar in the Aria that looked like drinks didn't cost 15 bucks apiece. And they are all on the casino level and look like they cater to the gamblers (we were not there to gamble). And the nightlife, there are 2 clubs - but you get the typical Vegas huckle buck when trying to get in the door. The bouncer wanted to charge us 30 bucks cover charge. As other \"younger\" folks were getting in no problem.

Right next door is The Crystals shopping center (bring the platinum card; it's more Gucci than GAP) and the Mandarin, Vdara, and Bellagio are all a tram ride away. We stayed in a Corner Suite and it was, in our opinion, a decent value. (Prices have gone up since our stay, however, and if having a casino on the first floor is not a requirement, the Vdara might be a better value.) Beds were comfortable, the room was quiet (being at the end of the hall helps), and the electronic room control was kind of neat. Food and drink are good, but expensive. The Tapas place was probably the least-impressive; we would not eat there again. There is an Italian restaurant on the floor above the lobby that was quite good. The gaming floor is less bright and garish than some other casinos, which we appreciated. Gaming limits were high, as you would expect for a 5-star hotel. You can get to several other casinos via tram or short indoor walks, to find cheaper tables. This year we're staying at Vdara, since their Corner Suite is significantly cheaper right now than ARIA's, but appears to be of the same quality. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at ARIA again, however.

We - my business partner and I attending devlearn booked 2 single rooms and waited 20 minutes to check in, and where then allocated 1 room, despite our paperwork clearly showing we had arranged 2 rooms, this then took another 10 minutes to sort out, and after 20 hours travelling was not good. Getting Concierge to check us in and print boarding passes for our return flight journey was equally frustrating, - not able to print boarding passes, though we were assured by concierge we were checked in on our flight - we were not! You really need to check what they are doing carefully as competence is in short supply. Overall this is an odd hotel - from the aroma to the layout, which is all very disorientating indeed. You have to drag your luggage through a casino to find the lifts on arrival, and the darkness and poor signage means it is very easy to get lost! (take a right at a roulette table I think). I would sum up the layout and style as an expensive mess, totally in-coherant in style and ambience, I realise hotels in Vegas are over the top and seek to differentiate themselves, but whoever designed this one inside really lost the plot as differentiation equals disorientation in my view. The rooms are OK, well equipped if the stuff works - you are rather dependant upon the TV controller (which in my colleagues case did not work) - so bring your own batteries, the light switches are temperamental and take some getting used to, and the plastic surrounds have a habit of falling off! Room service is OK but it seems that you can return to your room at 4.30 and it still has not been serviced. Beware of the fridge full of goodies.... a kettle to make a tea or coffee would be of much more use. Food in the buffet is very good indeed and the staff very helpful indeed. Other restaurants tend to be very expensive. I had a walk in a few other hotels and would say they were much better in layout and ambience, - especially the Bellagio - it had gardens and a coherent style.

Check in on a Saturday morning was busy, yet it all went very smoothly. They had enough lines open and clerks working, which is always a good thing. I was totally wowed after entering room 31-131. The curtains open, the TV turns on to some music, and the lighting comes up. The room had a view of the back of the CityCenter campus and Vdara. For a standard room, it's VERY roomy. I believe it's around 520 square feet of goodness. The bathroom area was equally as rich, with a BIG shower and tub (they are not combined, but located behind the same door), his and her sinks, and separate toilet area. I love technology, so Control 4 was definitely a treat. You can literally control everything - the TV, curtains, lighting, temperature, making service requests, and even the Do Not Disturb sign - from the television as well as a small tablet located on the bedside table. Loved the Wake Up scheme, which opens the curtains and turns on the TV at whatever time you set in the morning. I also enjoyed the turndown service at night, since that big bed has a lot of comfortable pillows!! My offer came with a comped buffet, so I went there for Sunday Brunch. I enjoyed it a lot, and would certainly go back. Service around the resort was top-notch. Everyone was very attentive and friendly, from the housekeepers, valet people, bartenders, Front Desk staff.

This is one of the LEED Gold buildings of the City Centre, I feel it is important to choose a hotel that has sustainability awareness. Next time going back to Vegas, I will either book this or try the Vdara. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, and it smells sooooooooo good. I actually went to their shop and bought the scent stick that has the Aria smell. Service is superb. When I check in, I picked a line that the front desk person is in training. It is actually his third day of work, yet, I think he was doing amazing. It was a bit slow, but I am on vacation, I have no problem be in his line for a little wait to help him with his training! We called for service several times, and it all went well. They have Privacy and Service button as well. I think the last time I stayed at Trump, they have it too. I like them, you know you won\u2019t be disturb by housekeeping in the morning when you are in Privacy mode and the Service mode make sure you get your housekeeping done! But if need any type of delivery or service, make sure Privacy is off, else they won\u2019t even knock on your doors. I love their one click button in the room and it will turn off all lights and close your blinds before you leave, it saves electricity and lower the cooling energy use \u2013 very green and convenient! Their bed and pillows and bed sheets are like heaven! I want to take them all home! I LOVED them. I travel a lot. My best hotel is the Ritz @ Orlando. And I have to say Aria is now my 2nd favourite from all the hotels I have been @! If I have to point out bad things, here they are: - The Buffet isn\u2019t that great for the price. - Check in / Check out line could be a bit messy, as they are all individual lines, and they are close together, it is hard to know which line you are lining for. It would be better if everyone all line up together and we can go to the next available counter. \u2013 but a lot of other hotels like Bellagio has individual lines too! - The in-room control panel touch screen isn\u2019t sensitive enough (I know, it is not Apple product!), need a bit of patience to use it. - For one day, housekeeping change our towels that were NOT on the floor. And two days, housekeeping turned on our lights and did not switch off when they leave. I was expecting a Green hotel would do extra to make sure all department do their best to maintain the sustainability commitment. - It is a big hotel, and there is only one location for elevators (they are fast thou). So if you live near the end of the floors, it could be a long walk. - The Self park is quite a long walk \u2013 but it applies to ALL other Vegas hotel anyway\u2026", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat but is it really worth it???\u201d", "Author": "Localdj77", "ReviewID": "UR120134759", "Content": "This hotl is great in every way but I'm just not sure it was worth over 300 a night.

Our wait was no more than 6 or 7 minutes. We had a standard king non-smoking room. The decor of this hotel is awesome. From the floors to the celling you can tell there was a lot of attention to detail in how this hotel was decorated. You have to show your room key 24 hours a day to gain access to the guest elevators which I think is great. I also like that you just have to put you key in front of the lock to open the door. Very cool. The words I would use to describe the room are; clean, cool, modern and hip. When we first opened our door the drapes and sheers opened automatically and music started playing, now that's what I call wow factor. There are his and hers closets in the entry way along with a big four drawer dresser. The room itself is spacious with a desk, and mini bar area, bed, side tables, 2 chairs and a small side table. The bath had double vanities, and shower and tub area. You opened the glass door and there was the shower area and right behind it was the soaking tub, pretty cool set-up. The toilet area was also enclosed behind a frosted glass wall and door. You are able to control everything in the room either with a bed-side remote or through the television. I mean everything, drapes, sheers, all the lights in the room, TV, music, housekeeping, check-out. If you are a techie you will love this room. The only place we ate in the hotel was the buffet. We found the food to be very good and thought there was a good selection. We like the lay out of the casino, most of the slots are new and the touchscreens are great for accessing your player information. They also had $10 table games during the day and some $15 dollar tables at night and this was on the weekend. The sports book is on the small size but worked ok for me. Cocktail service was fine. I have had faster and I have had slower. The have 3 pools and 2 hot tubs which are accessed from the promenade level which is the second floor. Again, you must show your room key for access. I can't say enough about the service. We never passed an employee who did not greet us. We put the privacy light on and we were contacted by housekeeping and they told us that even though we requested privacy if at any time day or night we wished our room made up to just call. On another occasion we had stopped to ask an employee in the lobby for directions and rather than give the turn by turn directions, he took the time to walk us for about 3 minutes through the hotel to make sure we didn't get lost.

Again after the text was received that our room was ready we went to pick up the keys for the third room and were told that the room was on a totally different floor from the other two.

You have to use your money to get the slot working with the free play and it is difficult to keep up with the play during the process and at the end, won nothing plus the money I put in I lost. Study the instructions before you do it. Second the 50. food credit was certainly required. Minimal dinner (small steak and she had a pasta dish) in the cafe was $80.00 but less the 50. credit now its down to market value. 1 coffee, 1 OJ and 2 yogurt parfaits were 26.00 for breakfast. Ouch. On the other hand the buffet was close to 40 a person but hey it was WORTH it and the best! Lobster, crab and everything imaginable. Fantastic.

Our first stay was right after it had opened and we didn't have a very good impression at that time, but we gave it another try in May of this year and were pleasantly surprised by how well the resort had come together. When we decided on another weekend in Vegas this past month we once again chose the Aria and were not disappointed. The Aria is an ultra modern glass and steel creation with exquisite and varying marble floors throughout. This does tend to give it an austere feel at times but mix in a casino, night life and your usual Las Vegas crowd and that quickly goes. The rooms are certainly one of my favorites on the strip, full of high tech toys and high quality fixtures. Everything in the room from lights to curtains to entertainment is controlled through a bedside tablet device along with the usual switches on the walls. This is both convenient and just fun if you like electronic gadgets. On the other hand I could see that getting to be a pain for some people. In addition to the cool controls there is a full blown A/V interface panel on the desk to the rooms TV and sound equipment including iPod dock / USB. Be sure to bring your own cables or you'll be stuck purchasing the cable kit in room for $50. The Aria features quite a few quality restaurants with prices in the mid to high range for dinner offering every kind of cuisine imaginable. The buffet as well is one of the best I've been to on the strip. On the down side prices are high and there are very limited options for quick or inexpensive food. At the Jean Philippe Patisserie a cup of coffee and a pastry will set you back $15. For those looking a better budget option, you can take a walk through the connected hallways into the Monte Carlo next door which has a food court similar to what you would find in any mall. For gambling experience, the Casino at the Aria is a solid choice. On each of our 3 visits we've found that the odds are good and that machines regularly pay out a reasonable amount of money to make your entertainment / gambling dollar go farther, which let's face it, is what it's all about. Lastly, I have to also recommend the new MGM players club \"MLife\" This is a much needed overhaul of the MGM club that still has a ways to go but their new tier system and features are certainly drawing us away from the now aging Ceasars / Harrahs club which we've been active participants in for the past 10 years.

The rooms were well lit, clean (no nasty carpet stains), prejection systems were great, bathrooms were everywhere and large (mouthwash and hand lotion were stocked at the sinks), and the view from the common area was great.

The only things I didn't like about it are things that you would find anywhere in Vegas so I guess my issue is more with Vegas than with this hotel. For example: - I hate that you have to walk a mile from the elevator to your room, and the Aria is no exception. - I hate the breakfast buffet, being in a mess hall with 1,000 other tourists, lining up to get sloppy tasteless food. The Aria does it no better than the other Casinos. The breakfast was gross. - I hate having to line up to check in, and line up for anything you want to do. - And I hate that self-parking seems like its in another suburb. But these are all qualities typical of Vegas. Vegas is big, overcrowded, tacky and filled with American tourists who love the tizz. Bless them. It is what it is. That aside, the Aria is definitely the pick of the bunch. The rooms are beautiful. The hi-tech elements are great (and definitely not difficult to navigate - ignore what others have said here - they must be technophobes). The rooms are huge. I had an amazing view of the strip, the Bellagio, and Planet Hollywood. The bathrooms were beautiful, complete with huge tub and separate shower. And there's no tizzy kitschy theme to this hotel - it's just style. AND I was worried about the location of this hotel based on the reviews here on Trip Advisor. Now having stayed there I can not believe that people have written that it is off the strip. It is in the dead center of the strip, but just happens to be set back and has a driveway that leads up to it. It IS on the strip, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The location is perfect.

Also, the sliding door, while contemporary, doesn't provide much sound insulation from the bathroom, which is something I like to have.

The Property is new and beautiful. To a person, the staff were friendly, ever-present, and helpful. When you call down to the desk, they even know which guest in your room is calling! The food is pricey, since this is a five-star hotel, but good. One disadvantage to the property being so big is that there are a lot of long walks, from the casino to the pool, etc. Also, it's a little challenging to get down to the pedestrian part of the Strip even though you're right on top of it. City planning and the casinos make sure you only walk where they want you to! I think the most outstanding part of Aria besides the beautiful property is the friendliness and great service we got from every staff member. The property is beautiful and clean, and our corner suite had amazing views. The only drawbacks were that our supposedly \"non-smoking\" room smelled very smoky, but it's Vegas so I'm sure a lot of previous occupants had broken the rules. Some might enjoy everything in the room being remote controlled (lamps, toilet, tv, curtains) but I found it a little complicated and annoying. The bath was absolutely sumptuous, I took a soak in the tub before going out, while enjoying the breathtaking view of the strip. One more annoying thing was when we were getting ready to check out on Sunday, my girlfriends and I had spa appointments and so wanted to do a later checkout, but they wanted to charge us $99 for this. Not worth it. I would think letting us check out late wouldn't be a huge inconvenience since I imagine there aren't a whole lot of new guests coming in Sunday night, so I was surprised they wanted to charge us.

Location... The hotel is located in the City Centre complex, with a free shuttle which runs regularly between the hotel and Monte Carlo, Vdara, Cosmopolitan and Bellagio hotels. Bedroom... Everything about our stay there was smooth running. Our room faced out onto the New York New York hotel, and had 7\" touch screen control for the temperature, TV, music system and curtains. The towels were changed each day, along with the toiletries, and the mini bar re-stocked. NOTE: Just be careful when taking anything from the minibar, as each item is on a pressure-sensitive pad which registers when you've taken the item, and it's charged straight to your room (you can check your balance at any time through the TV using your control pad). If you knock any of the items on its pad (as we did), the touch pad will sense that it has moved, and charge you for the item, even if you don't actually take it out! The bed was SO comfy, it was hard to drag myself out of it every morning, and the room itself was quite spacious. I think it was a King City View room. There was also an iron and ironing board, and plenty of hanging and drawer space. The hotel... is HUGE! Like many of the newer hotels I guess, it seems to have everything! I'm sure we didn't even get to see some parts of it, as we were too busy out exploring, but as with all the hotel/casinos, it's always buzzing. The buffet breakfast was $16.50 (I think - more expensive on a weekend), and was a great way to stock up for the day ahead. There is everything on the 'eat as much as you want' buffet, from pastries and cookies, to Chinese stir fry, to bacon, sausage and eggs, to pancakes and waffles, to rotisserie chicken, to omelettes, to salads, to fruit, to seafood.... the list goes on. Plus coffee, tea, juices etc. It's really good value if you like to stock up at breakfast time to see you through the day! The pool... There are 3 pools, and all had plenty of beds on the week days when we were there. There are always bar waitresses walking around to take your order, and there are a couple of water dispensers located around the pool areas too to use free of charge. We noticed on the Friday and weekend that all the pools were MUCH busier, and it was difficult to get a sunbed. There were also a couple of hot tubs, but we didn't get chance to use them. Other... There is an AVIS car hire desk located down in the bottom of the hotel, which was very convenient, and this is where the trips pick up from too. We were told at the check-out desk that check out was 11am, but as we weren't flying until the evening, asked if we could extend that. We were able to extend until 1pm free of charge, anything extra would be charged at half daily rate. The staff were always friendly and courteous, and there was always someone around cleaning and tidying.

Our response was, \"we don't want to pay cash, we have a resort credit.\" And he basically implied that we had to pay out of pocket or he wouldn't be able to sell to us. He didn't think outside of the box to find a solution, didn't call anyone, and didn't try to rectify the situation. We left without the pastry and I called the front desk. They said there was another solution, and the server could have had us fill out an authorization form. So big deal, we left without the pastry\u2026 but it's just an example of the lack of customer service at this resort. Anyway, if we continue to get decent deals to come here, we probably will.

The bathrooms are weirdly set up and poorly planned (the only place to plug in a hair drier knocks everything over on the sink). The elevators appear very beat up for a newish hotel.

Both days we left the room by 10am with the Service light on, and when we returned (5:30 pm and 4 pm) the room hadn't been serviced.

The second night we came in, changed, went back out, and when we returned at 11pm the room still hadn't been cleaned. I have never had this happen anywhere else, and while one day may be a fluke, two is inexcusable. Despite its supposedly high rating, the breakfast buffet was poor.

That was okay with us because it was certainly not our first trip to Vegas. The room was beautiful and modern with dark wood but not very big. I loved the electronics and the floor to ceiling windows and agree with some other people about the dirty windows. They had spots on them but I think that could be because they were clear glass a not darker like some other hotels. The bed was very comfortable but the reading light was dim and no way to make it any brighter.

The housekeeping is not the best and there was no turn down service in the regular rooms but we we okay with it as long as they cleaned our rooms everyday.

Very nifty modern architecture. You feel like you're at the Space Port with all the hip design features throughout. Our room, one of their standard ones, was adequate but nothing to write home about. I would love to see the Sky Suites. The worst aspect, as others have pointed out is the very poor low level lighting. Our desk light was out and thus, we could see nothing in that area of the room which included the space where we had positioned the luggage racks. I called to have them fix it and suggested that they needed to increase the light level in the room. The response was \"many people have complained about that.\" Really!? Perhaps they should address it. Oh, and the light on the make up mirror didn't work. I was happy that there was free internet, or rather that the daily resort fee covered that. This is a personal pet peeve for me, particularly in higher end hotels who charge an outrageous fee of $20 + per day for internet access. I mean, if Motel 6 can offer it for free, shouldn't they include it when you're paying for a 4-5* hotel? Other small complaints. For no reason whatsoever, twice, all the lights in the room went out and the curtains closed. I might explain that all of these are controlled by nifty little touch pads on the wall, and on the tv monitor. However, whatever ghosts were in the room to randomly trip this was more than a nuisance as I was putting in my contacts and my honey was reading. We did see the new Cirque de Soleil Elvis show and were not disappointed. Lovely and fun. We did try out several of the bars and restaurants and all were outstanding, with great help except for one. Breakfast at the main Cafe, Cafe Vettro I think it is called was a huge disappointment. I ordered a cappuccino which I am almost certain came out of one of those automatic machines and is simply terrible. I asked our waitress to replace it with a regular coffee ($4) which was equally bad. The break with breakfast was also terrible and I can't say much good for the eggs. On the other hand, the little French bakery near the elevators is simply lovely. Great coffee, croissants, quiche, etc. But, if you want a more substantial breakfast, leave the property. Another somewhat confusing thing is that there are two valet locations. The main valet and the north valet. Pay attention to where you park or you may end up walking the endless walk to get to your vehicle. Hint: your valet ticket says which one it is for. Another example of bad planning is the very long distance to either of these valet stands which means dragging your roller bags a very long way across carpet - not an easy task. Would someone tell the architects that most of us travel light with roller bags and it would be nice if they considered that when they look at the traffic pattern from door to elevator.

There was no way to increase the luminosity in the room and the automatic controls were confusing to operate. Secondly, the bathroom shower and jacuzzi tub area is truly dangerous. When my wife went in to shower, she stepped back and almost fell into the raised marbled tub area. If the back of your head hits the tub, or its surround, you just may find yourself on the next episode of \"1000 Ways To Die.\" The proximity of the tub to the shower stall and the knee-high level of the hard surround are lawsuits just waiting to happen. Thirdly, the on-screen programming for wake-up calls and TV channels is frustrating due to the extremely SLOW reaction time when pressing the remote keys. Also, twice when the wireless network wasn't working, my wife called the front desk to hear that the network was \"down.\" Later, when paying the Resort Fees, I mentioned this to the front desk clerk and stated that a modest reduction on the resort fee would be fair.

The room is a standard size room for this category of hotel; however it is nicely appointed with modern dark wood furnishings (nightstands, dressers, etc.) and textured beige walls with modern artwork. The bathroom has a shower and tub enclosure sporting floor to ceiling marble tile. The hotels is Las Vegas have water flow restricting shower heads. The Aria is no exception, however the shower head allowed more water flow than most other hotels I have stayed in, making the shower a very pleasant experience. The tub is very large, another great amenity. The room is tastefully decorated, reminding me of a boutique hotel with a modern, almost European feel. Although I did not use the pool area, I did walk around the pool deck and saw three large sized pools set on a rooftop on the second floor. The pool area was ringed with palm trees and modern art pieces. My wife and I walked around the City Center and were very pleased. High end restaurants and shops are within walking distance of the Aria; in fact, my wife wanted some sundries from CVS (as the selection of goods at the gift shops located within the Aria was limited). On of the staff directed us to a CVS store located within 200 yards of the north entrance. The great thing about the Aria and the City Center is that all of the shopping and restaurants you need are within walking distance. You don't have to leave the property, unless you want to. I highly recomend the Jean Philippe patisserie, located adjacent to the casino floor. The cherry danish is fantastic, as is the coffee. (I take my coffee black; not sure about the coffee drinks.)

How can you possibly run a hotel like this with all these people checking in and no one can get into their room until 3pm? She \"found\" a room for us. The room was dirty, the bed sheets looked like they had not been changed, and they had makeup stains on them.

Sidenote: you can purchase a mattress and pillows if you like, they ship it to you and the price isnt outrageous. All the lights including the TV is powered by just one touch by a touch screen pad on the night table, this was SO convenient when the hubs and i were already comfortable in bed and forgot to set the privacy sign on the door and didnt power off the lights, all i had to do was reach out to this nifty touch pad and controlled it all from there. Absolute genius! My husband and I booked this trip to celebrate our anniversary. we mentioned this at the front desk when we checked in because the agent asked us if it was our first time in Vegas. Sure enough they brought up some chocolate covered fruit and a sweet card from hotel management congratulating us on our anniversary. I thought it was a very nice gesture.

We had room service one evening. I was expecting meals on a tray, however in came the waiter with a table, fully laid with our meal.

For a Vegas hotel the ARIA has it all, a good Casino, superb wellness centre including large outdoor pools top end gym facilities/spa and a supern choice of restaurants and bars. Rooms were of a decent proportion and came equiped with everything you would expect of a five star, only negative or advise is to watch out for mini bar expenditure at 6pounds for a bottle of water you may want to stock up. Location is central and a short walk to the Bellagio and nearest mall and transport links. Main lifts to rooms are located a short distance into the hotel something to be wary of with many large Vegas hotels, the MGM for instance main lifts are a good 5mins across the hotel. Whether you want to party by the pool at one of Vegas top day parties or relax in tranquil pool gardens and hot tubs, gamble the night away or shop til you drop the ARIA has it all and has the service to match.

We have stayed at other five star Vegas hotels before. Myself, my brother, my father and two other couples all got rooms there. I am only going to list only the 5 MAJOR service issues. 1st issue check in 2 lines were 6-7 deep with people waiting to check in/check out. Behind the counter were 6 people holding cash drawers waiting to take stations - only problem was with a lobby full of people checking in and out and plenty of open counter slots (8) these people stood there and chatted or looked at people in line for 8 minutes until it was the top of the hour. 2nd issue although there were 4 groups in our party we were not given rooms even close to each other (floors 52 22 12 and 4) what a pain - not only that since each room was in a separate elevator tower you had to go all the way to the main floor to go to another room. Staff was just not able to accomodate us. 3rd issue my Dad when he made reservations made them for a handicapped room - at checkin even though he is standing there pushing his freind in a wheel chair he was not given a handicapped room. We had to call down and request a handicapped room - no apology - the only good thing was we did not have to go to the lobby to get a new key but had to go all the way to the lobby to change rooms - wheelchair luggage & all. 4th issue - once couple felt the bed was too soft for them they needed a harder mattress - the staff told them that everyone loved the beds - it was not the bed but they would see if they could maybe find a BOARD to send up - they really said a BOARD - again not apologies. 5th issue and this is the one that caused us all to decide that even though we had 2 days left on our stay none of us would spend or gamble another dime at the Aria - it was Sunday morning 7:30am My dad and his guest, myself and my guest & my brothers and their wives were meeting for breakfast at the buffet. My Dad is 78 years old and was pushing a wheelchair - he got there first the buffet was basically EMPTY - he paid and was seated. My brothers & I show up a few minutes later and were waiting for him when my Dad calls and says he is already seated. We go in, pay and approach the host and tell them that we want to sit with my Dad (he is in one of those long booths at the side chairs on the other side seating area (would set probably 20 people on each side). The host basically has a scared look in his eyes & says groups of 8 require notice at the cashier and a 18% gratuity be paid - it has to do with server stations. So we get seated across an aisle from my Dad because even if we pay the 'BUFFET gratutity' in an #$&@ empty room we can not sit with him. Then the kicker is that we have the same flipping server! After we eat my brother asks to see the manager who is steadfast in the fact that it is policy and next time we need to pre-announce. Well guess what there will never be a next time and we will NEVER EVER recommend anyone stay at the Aria. It made us miss the Bellagio even more. If you want service and expect to be somewhat pampered forget the Aria.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel but the wall is thin\u201d", "Author": "R H", "ReviewID": "UR119536793", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel twice.

The second time we decided to stay at this hotel because they had larger swimming pools comparing to Vdara--we stayed at Vdara on our first trip to Las Vegas. We liked it there but we thought the pool was small. Anyway, our room for the second stay faced Vdara pools and we noticed there were more than 1 pool there, unlike in our first stay. Vdara was definitely quieter both in the room and in the lobby (there is no casino). The bathroom layout of Aria was better than Vdara since the shower and bath tub were in the same enclosed area but still separated. Also the shower door was sealed better than Vdara, so we didn't have water leaking out through the shower door during shower. The casino was okay and there were many choices of restaurants both in the casino floor and the second floor. Another good thing about Aria than Bellagio or Monte Carlo was it was not as crowded as those 2 hotels in the casino, restaurant, and lobby areas.

Couldn't even turn the lights or TV off as there is no \"manual\" backup. Food - average and overpriced.

This was my 6th visit to Vegas, and I like to try a new hotel each visit. Check in was prompt & easy, with friendly staff greeting you upon arrival. We had all 3 rooms upgraded without even asking. When you walk into the room, you are welcomed, lights automatically turn on, and the curtains open to show the strip (a nice gimmick). The room was as clean as you would expect and full of all sorts of fancy buttons & controls to alter the slightest setting in the room. Although the room was certainly not small, it seemed smaller than the rooms in both the Bellagio & The Wynn. The rooms were more modern than Bellagio's but I wouldn't say 'nicer'. And I certainly preferred the actual rooms at The Wynn. The hotel was clean and full of friendly helpful staff. The swimming pools were nice and were not too crowded with idiots. The casino floor is relatively small in comparison to other Casinos. There were several nice restaurants inside the hotel, the Tapas one being the best. The location was a major positive but also a big negative. The positive is that it's slap bang in the middle of things, which is The Wynn & Encore's biggest downfall in my opinion. It has the 'City Centre' complex around it, it's next to Bellagio, and there is a concourse service connecting it to other Casinos. But if this was my first visit to Vegas, I could easily get lost and disorientated with the location of the hotel. The hotel is so big, and then you have the City Centre complex, as well as walking through hotels such as Cosmopolitan & The Mandarin. It's almost like its a little bit of a vacuum. If you know where places are, and where exactly you want/need to go then it's fine. But it did seem like it was quite separate from the rest of the strip even though it is so central. I don't think you would truly grasp what Vegas was all about if Aria was the hotel of your first ever visit.

The hotel is brand new and looks incredibly well finished. We checked in without any queue and headed straight to our room which was kitted out with all the latest mod-cons. Everything was controlled by a hand held terminal which operated the radio, TV, curtains, lights etc. The room was a really good size and the bed was extremely comfortable. The only complaint I could make (and hence why this is not a 5/5 review) was that the rooms were not that well sound proofed and one night in particular the noise was very disturbing. However, this is to be expected in Vegas I suppose. The hotel has some great places to eat including the sports bar which did burgers and mexican food, a tapas bar and there is also a really good pizzeria in the conference centre next door. The hotel operates a train that runs to the Bellagio which is also really handy. The casino has a great atmosphere and the croupiers are very friendly. However, if you are on a budget all the tables are very expensive to play and you are better off heading to Paris or even the Stratosphere which had cheaper tables. ($5 blackjack), The hotel buffet was rated one of the best in Vegas and I can see why! We went for the brunch option which had unlimited champagne (which they were very liberal with!). The buffet catered for all tastes and the food was of a high standard. We also bought tickets to see Viva Elvis at the Aria which was expensive but worth every penny.

The pool is the jewel in the crown i feel, great beds, towels, music not too loud, free water, the beds aren't crowded, there are parasols (very rare in Vegas), shaded areas - I could go on & on, so well designed and a beautiful place to spent a few relaxing hours away from the madness !!

My room and food is always comped because I gamble a lot of my stay. Most of the reviews I have read about Aria do not mention much about the casino, so I will focus my review mostly on the gambling part of the trip for those of you like me that come to Vegas to GAMBLE. The Casino is avgerage size. Not as big as MGM, but bigger than Bellagio. I never found myself bored in it with many options on the slot machines. A lot of old favorites like Blazing 7's and Quick Hit, but a lot of new machines that I have never seen before as well. The thing I noticed the most was that no one was hitting the smaller progressive jackpots ($1000+). The biggest pay out I hit was $600. That is very unusual and I would have thought I was just unlucky this trip, but no one else was winning either. I heard other people talking about it too. I did not play the tables, but the minimums I saw were $10 during the day and $25 at night. I had a corner suite and it was wonderful. I had no problems with all the controls for drapes, TV, etc. You just need to take a few minutes to figure it out and you will be fine. I wish I could have taken the bathroom home with me. It was perfect. I have read a lot of people saying that it is a 5 minute walk from the elevator. They must have been crawling on floor if that was the case. I had the room furthest from the elevator and it took 62 seconds to walk to the elevator. I spent some time at the pools. I was surprised the chairs did not have cushions considering the high quality of the hotel. There are 3 pools. I suggest if you do not have kids and do not want to be around them... go to the last pool down the walk. It seemed like all the families stayed at the first two pools. Service for drinks was great. They came by aften and brought your drink back quickly. During the week you can get a cabana for $200 (weekends $350) which is a pretty good deal. The only thing negative was that the only food the servers would bring to you was a turkey sandwich or a chicken wrap. If you wanted anything else you had to walk to breezes and get it yourself. they could make a lot more money if they served a better selection at the pool. I ate at several places at the hotel... Julian Serano, American Fish, Union, Cafe Vettro and room service. All were great. I went to the buffet one morning for breakfast, but they wouldnt let me in because I didnt have my I.D. with me which is crazy because in all the other places I ate in they never asked me for I.D. (Long walk to the buffet, so I just went back to my room and ordered room service). Overall, I was satisfied with my stay at Aria.

While it was nice to have electronic controls for pretty much everything, I felt that the controls could be far more intuitive. Being in my 30's, I couldn't see anyone over the age of 55 being able to navigate the multiple menu options. The bathroom was nice, but the water pressure in the shower was lacking. Overall, it would be hard to be unhappy here, but I personally prefer the Bellagio, Wynn, or Venetian/Palazzo over the Aria in terms of the hotel.

I worried a bit about parking and being set back from the strip, but it was never an issue. The self parking was super easy. If you park on the 2nd level you can walk right into the casino, otherwise you take an elevator down to the bridge. We arrived at around 9pm and had booked a non-smoking King room. There was no line at check-in. We had an older male clerk who was super friendly. I\u2019d mentioned in the reservation it was our anniversary and he said happy anniversary. He said all he had available in non smoking was 2 queens or a King smoking on a low floor. I was very worried because we had to accept a smoking room last year for one night and it was unbearable. But he made a call and got us a King non-smoking on the 39th floor. (I was so happy at the time and just loved the room, but now that I think about it, why did he have to make a call instead of just being able to give us the room we booked? I don\u2019t understand hotels sometimes.) We both just adored the room. It was very, very spacious. We loved the bathroom layout and the electronics. We were able to master it quickly and had no trouble until our last day when we couldn\u2019t get the TV to work. No big deal though. Our view was of Vdara, Cosmo and Rio and the Palms in the distance. During the day we could see the Vdara and Cosmo pools below. We loved the robes and the bed was very comfortable. Service was great we had tons of towels. We generally left the room between 9 and 11am and when we came back after 5 our room was always clean. Except one day we were in the room until almost noon and it wasn\u2019t cleaned by 6 but we went down to the pool for \u00bd an hour and it was done when we got back. The pool was nice. The first morning we went down at 8:30 thinking it would be open but it didn\u2019t open until 9. There was a big crowd lined up when we came back at 9. The 3 pools are all about 3.5 feet deep. Early in the week they were not too busy. On the weekend they were much busier but we never had a problem getting a seat. We only went after 4pm though. I used the spa, just the facility pass, and I loved it. It was just gorgeous and the service was excellent. We ate at Sage for our anniversary. We had a great prix fixe menu with wine and beer pairings. It was a wonderful experience. Delicious food and great service. We also got coffee at the coffee place and had Happy Hour at Todd English PUB next door. We would pop through the convenient entrance to Monte Carlo and use their food court just for a snack occasionally. The casino at Aria was really fun. Drink service was the best we had anywhere on the strip and the drinks were tasty! They have lots of new, fun slots in the casino. We also used the tram to get to Bellagio and cut through the Crystals mall to get to Cosmopolitan and across to Planet Hollywood.

Room - a five minute walk from the elevator to our room. Comfortable bed (the only good thing), filthy windows, high tech but nothing works properly. On the second night, everything (lights, curtains, television) stopped working. Nothing would turn off. Called front desk at around 11 and they told us that it will take 15 minutes to \"reset\" the room. 30 minutes later, still not working.

We booked a corner suite through hotels.com, which was half the price of booking through the hotel directly. We also received a $75 credit that we could us at certain places such as Elements and the buffet. The hotel is off the strip a bit but not too far \u2013 just a couple minute walk. I love the location as it is close to City Centre, the Vdara (where our friends were staying) and the Cosmopolitan, which is also a super nice hotel. You can also get to the Monte Carlo quickly through the back of the casino. We arrived at the Aria on a Saturday around 6pm by limo (we were celebrating my hubby\u2019s 40th!) and were able to walk right up to the counter to check in. They gave us a beautiful suite on the 17th floor with a lovely view. The room did not come to life as we walked in like some other people experienced \u2013 the curtains did not open and the TV didn\u2019t turn on and welcome us, but that was fine. We just hit the master switch and these things happened along with the lights turning on. The room is very hi-tech which is very cool and takes a bit of time to figure out but once you do it is great! You can turn off the TV, the lights and close the curtains all with the touch of one button. Pros: The staff is friendly and extremely helpful. The king-sized bed is ultra comfortable and was such a welcome after a long day of walking. The bathroom is huge with a jetted tub, a TV, two sinks and a toilet with special powers. The bedroom is huge and has a TV. The living room was great since we were there with another couple and we had them over for drinks prior to going out. It also has a TV. The resort has several excellent restaurants, a buffet, a coffee shop, a caf\u00e9, a large convenience store and many other amenities. I loved playing Batman in the casino. We ordered room service once and it was prompt and delicious. The pool is beautiful. Cons: I had to knock a star off just because there was a broken curtain in our room so when we tried to close it we had to keep hitting the button until it went all of the way. The TV in the bathroom did not work which didn\u2019t worry me, but you\u2019d think they\u2019d fix these things. The maid service was inconsistent \u2013 they did come every time we put on the service button (I read other reviews about absent maid service, however, you do have to remember to put the service button on). However, they didn\u2019t always put a towel in the spare bathroom for some reason, sometimes there was mouthwash, sometimes not, sometimes there was a paper on our front door \u2013 sometimes not. The first day we called for extra glasses and they brought us a menu instead. We did get the glasses so, no big deal. That\u2019s about it for cons. I would definitely return to the Aria.

The Aria is in a great central location and is connected to the Bellagio Hotel by a tram ride, , City Center with residential and other high end hotels and a high end mall. The Aria is the only hotel in City Center with a Casino.The Aria Casino is warm, inviting and vibrant. It is larger enough to play what you want,slots & table games,etc... without being too large, overwhelming or crowded.

Also no one available on the lobby floor assisting guest, i.e make sure quests on right line or assure that ONE line for all check-in/check-out staff.

Hope they work on this and make some improvements. The Aria has the potential to have a 5 star rating with some service improvements. I have found that if you are a gamer and have a host, you will fare better in terms of the room choice, amenities and benefits. Also look out for special offers throughout the year.

It wasn't a huge problem since we are rarely in the room during the day. For those who may need to be in the room during the day, i would request something on the opposite side of the hotel.

We looked for the safe and were not able to find it in the room--in retrospect, we should have called downstairs but, thinking its a 5 star property we were not too worried. Note: the safe is located in the nightstand. So we took our gambling money for the night and left $1100 in our suitcase. Thankfully the remainder of the cash and our passports were hidden in my boyfriend's shoe---again we should have looked for the safe but didn't think much of leaving it inside our suitcase for the night. The next day I we went to grab a coffee and my boyfriend went upstairs to get some more money. Housekeeping was in the room so he asked him to leave while he went to get some money. When we went into the suitcase it was gone!! We were literally downstairs for 30 minutes! We called hotel security who took our statement and said they would investigate and give us a call back. Today is the 12th and I still have not heard back from anyone at ARIA. We will definitely NEVER stay here again.

This first contact with the hotel was so positive that we looked forward to seeing if the rest of our experience would be the same. We were astounded by the upgraded room we were shown into as the curtains opened to reveal a gorgeous city view - it was like looking at a HD screen, especially at night. A lovely gift of chocolate-covered fruit also greeted us, as did a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket. After negotiating the \"electrics\" of the room (everything is remotely operated by buttons/switches) we quickly settled down to enjoy a truly lovely room. Surprisingly though, there were no in-room coffee/tea making facilities. We found the casino and restaurant staff friendly and genuine and appreciated the rapid response of staff on the casino floor, be it for slot help or drinks orders. While I seemed to have \"recycled\" most of my winnings, my wife and our friends reported a somewhat more profitable experience! Access to the amenties was excellent and we especially enjoyed the beautiful pool area but could have done without the loud booming music emanating from the Liquid Pool. The Aria has succeeded in creating a beautiful and pleasing atmosphere with its decor, furnishings and a host of seemingly \"invisible\" improvements which all add up to a great resort experience.

Having reading many positive reviews online, I decided to give it a shot, although I, myself, have always been a loyal customer with Wynn. This was our FIRST family trip, and it was also my mom and aunt's first time to Vegas, so I was expecting Aria, as a \"5-star\" hotel, would be able to provide great customer service and give my mom and aunt a very pleasant LV memory. Sadly it was all disappointed!! 1. It was a Friday, and I expected that hotel to be super busy. However we reserved two rooms with two beds. Then they said there was no availability for tww-bed room! I paid for the price and I paid for my rooms!!! Okay, my for the other room. They said they needed charge EXTRA!!!!!!! In general that's the case, but not when I paid for the price of TWO-BEDS ROOMS!!!!! 2. When we went to our rooms, several lights were out at both rooms. They had their technician came up in 30 minutes and changed the light bulbs. We found out there were no coffee machine in the room, so I called and asked if we could have one. They said they would need to charge for \"renting\" that coffee machine! 3. The following night, we decided to try the buffet at Aria because it did look like a good buffet at around $35 per person. Well food was not bad, nothing too surprising, but Wynn is still the BEST among all. It was the SERVICE that drove me nuts! My mother and my aunt went in and got their seat. My uncle, my sister, and I then went to the buffet restaurant and joined them. First the cashier lady told us we needed to get a ticket before going in there. I understood, so I told her that I would like to find my other parties and made sure that they had arrived. The cashier lady was nice and fine. My sister followed me, and there was an American-African lady came out and stopped her and said, \"This isn't a shopping mall, madam!\" to my sister!!!!!!! That was very very rude of her to say such thing! When my sister asked for a manager, she said she was the one! Oh well, I calmed my sister down and told her to let go for the moment, since there wasn't anything we could really do at that moment. 4. That same night, when we were heading back to our room, passing the check-in counters. I went and asked for a band-aid, thinking it would be a quick easy thing that they could do. That girl told me there was a \"store\" next to whatever that name was and told me that I could get band-aids there! WTF! A FIVE-STAR HOTEL???? REALLY??? You dont have ONE band-aid?????? I was very upset and disappointed. It was supposed to be a very unforgettable and pleasant trip for my mom for her birthday and for my aunt who just survived through breast cancer! And it was ALL RUINED!!!!!!! The very last day when I spoke to their Assitant Front Desk Manager, she seemed nice, patient, and understanding, she then promised she would get back to me personally and would investigate the whole thing. Well I did receive the email few days after the trip, and it offered a \"free ungrade\" to the corner suite and is \"based on availability and excludes holidays.\" Look I receive such special offer from Wynn all year round!!! All I can say, Aria is NOT worth the money spent!!!!!! I am VERY DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED at Aria's customer service! It should NOT be rated a 5-star!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cARIA Resort & Casino\u201d", "Author": "Vivian V", "ReviewID": "UR119163842", "Content": "We just came back from Vegas, staying at Aria for 2 weekend nights,10/8-10/10. Used to stay at Vdara in previous trip, was impressed about its delux suit's contemporary high-end design, we chose Aria since it is rated better than Vdara, just for a trial. Pros: - Delux room, to compare with Vdara's, has almost same contemporary design, clean and spotless. - Room service is OK, down turn service is OK, provided more than enough towels for party of 2. As long as all used towels are on the floor instead of being hung on the hooks, they'll replace them. I was a bit concerned when reading the previous reviews, but somehow I believe hotel room service is quite standard. - Check-in service was OK with, no complaint, we were able to check-in quickly because I was calling in earlier for reservation. Front desk was nice, helpful, same as concierge, especially Lisa. Cons: - Delux room, to compare with Vdara's, is quite smaller, narrow space, and no options for strip view or Bellagio's fountain view at all. I requested upgrades with strip views or higher floor , both by phone, before and at arrivals, but failed. Corner suites were also booked up. - The buffet has poor quality, almost same price with Bellagio's and other 5-start hotel's but not same quality. We had lunch buffet around noon time, not off-hour but option was quite limited. - The Wifi was slow and same as TV. Spoiled by Vdara service (intranet cable was provided in the room, wifi was pretty fast), I didn't bring extra cable this time. Guess what, you'll have to pay if want to use intranet cable for faster service. I ended up using Iphone to check work email. If you're not going to Vegas for gambling, or preferring nightlife activities, but love high tech design, go with Vdara.

When traffic is heavy on the strip there is a road that runs paralell to the strip that has an entrance to Aria as well as City Center. This entrance has a Valet and proved to be quite convenient!!!! I wish though I could get the air freshener that they have in the lobby here in Afghanistan!!!

My fault for not asking what the benefits of the Sky Suites were but a little more explanation would have been nice too! The dreaded \u201cscent\u201d in the hotel. I noticed a slight aroma of vanilla but it was not as over powering as some make it out to be. It gently masked the odor of cigarettes so I didn\u2019t mind. Even though there was smoking in the casino area the smell was not as bad thanks to good ventilation and the nice vanilla odor. The Room: We had a 52st floor Panoramic Corner Sky Suite. The room while at the end of the hall was not that far from the elevator. I\u2019m really not sure why so many people complain about the hike from elevator from the room. From the moment you enter the room you really appreciate the effort put into the d\u00e9cor and layout. The entire exterior wall of the room is floor to ceiling windows. We had amazing views towards the airport, the strip and the pools. - The room was very clean. No complaints there. The d\u00e9cor is clean and modern. Interesting art work and sculptures. The couch in the living room was comfy as well. There was a 4 person table, a sitting area between some pillars as well as a desk behind the couch, facing the TV. The wet bar area had the full compliment of snacks and drinks but we did not use any of them. I had a slight heart attack when the room service lady placed a huge dish that was on the table on the wet bar, dislodging some of the $12.00 nuts from the sensor plate. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t enough for me to get charged, crisis averted. The room had complimentary Wifi which worked very well for us and all our Apple technical gadgets. - We had room service several times and the food was good and delivered quickly and hot. Server\u2019s were always pleasant and helpful. They tell you to call when you are done and they will pick up the dirty dishes but we generally left them for housekeeping when went out for the day. - As many have observed, there is no coffee pot in the room, nor is there a microwave. We did have a small refridge in the wet bar for our drinks. The fridge wasn\u2019t cold so I called maintenance who promptly replaced it with a working model. I planned ahead and had a coffee press and water warmer so I was able to make my own coffee in the AM before I had to face the day. - Bed: Very comfy. Not much that I can add to what others have previously mentioned. Very comfy. - Bathroom: The Bathroom was absolute heaven. The jetted bathtub was wonderful and the steam shower was heavenly. Unlike the Vdara, the large tub was designed with the drain at the end of the tub rather than right in the middle. There was a small TV in the bathroom that allowed you to soak and enjoy a show at the same time. Of course the toilet had the bidet which my dear husband really liked. Have to see about getting one for him \uf04a at our house. - Noise. The room was so peaceful. Never heard a peep of noise from any other room or even in the hall. The only noise came from the pool bars during the day but by night time it was quiet. Not sure what it was but there was a strange popping noise that occurred during the night. We think it was the glass as it cooled from the hot desert sun. - Location: Well much as been said about this already BUT we really didn\u2019t find it that bad. We walked through Crystals and ended up right on the strip. Pretty easy. No complaints from us. I can see why some people found it annoying but we really didn\u2019t mind. - Dining options: Other than room service, we only at in the hotel once. We had nice dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse. I originally tried to make a reservation on line and then by calling the main reservation number, not realizing (once again) that we could use our private concierge for this. The time we wanted was not available via either the regular number or the online option but the \u201cSky Suites\u201d concierge was able to get us a table. Since we had a reservation just as they opened we were one of the first seated and until much later we had a wonderful, quiet and intimate meal (very refreshing and hard to find in Vegas). I think that we were in a special section for sky suite visitors because while part of the restaurant was filling up, our section remained empty until just before we left. Our meal and the service was AMAZING! - Security: There was a doorman at the entry to the Sky Suite elevators and while he kindly held the door open for us, he never asked to see our room key. The alternate entrance required that you swipe your key to get the door to open. - Rental Car: If you rent a car through Alamo and pick it up at the Aria, make sure you know where you are going to pick it up. The office is located past the main Valet and down a level and around a corner. You won\u2019t find a sign to direct you until you are right about to go down to the garage access. Thankfully one of the kind event security guys took pity on us and walked us to where we needed to be. - TV Check-out: Tried to use the TV to check out but it was not working. I ended up using the \u201ctext message\u201d option and that worked like a charm. I immediately got an itemized PDF bill sent to my registered email address. Again, no waiting in line, just headed for the door. - Bellman: We called and asked for a bellman to get our luggage because we had quite a lot to get down to the lobby. I asked for him to come at a specific time and he was there on time and quickly loaded our stuff. As stated earlier there was some confusion as to where we were meeting our limo. The bellman does not bring your luggage down in the elevator with you so be clear where you are meeting especially if you are on a time crunch. Overall we really enjoyed this property and all that it offered. The Sky Suites are amazing and well worth the extra expense.

I was already a little peeved due to the extra $170.00 we had to shell out to ensure there were two beds in the suite, but I was sincerely hoping that it would get better. Well, here are the positives and negatives. Room - well, it appeared clean, but we found many random \"porn ad cards\" that people are snapping to you on the strip in random places - gave me a willy feeling that the didn't clean the room as well as the could have. Beds were way too soft, pillows were crappy. Bring your own. Floor was sticky in the main foyer. Technology was fine (not like other reports) but so unnecessary. The TV ended up being hard to control to actually get to the TV. And no food network. TV was very slow and faded in and out. We could plainly hear the neighbours in the ajoining room - They were loud in the day and went out to party, coming back at 3am. We had to call to get them to quiet - but you can definitely hear the noises. And this ticks me off - no coffee machine. It's a 5 star. Would it break the bank if they put a Keurig or a Tassimo? The coffee in the hotel is bloody expensive. Closest Starbucks was in the Monte Carlo. I paid $5.75 for a mediocre latte. Also, the fridge situation. If the food is expensive, I'd love to buy yogurt and little things to stash in the fridge, but here you can't. It's weight sensitive. As soon as you remove something, it goes on your bill. One morning I went to get the free paper at the gift shop (which they don't really tell you you can get) and there was a nasty waste basket filled with vomit in the hallway - it was so gross. I called and they did get it right away but I went down at 10 - really? It took that long for someone to walk the halls? Casino/Hotel - The vanilla smell they pump in to counter the smoke from the cigarettes and cigars was plain nasty. I hated vanilla before and loathe it now. It made me nauseous. Shops and food were very pricy. Go elsewhere. CVS for liquor is just outside the hotel on the strip. Pool - The weather was fantastic so the pool was a very nice thing to have - except for the hours. 9am-6pm? We tried twice to go out after dinner to put our feet in the hot tub, but they closed so early! And even earlier on the Tuesday night for a \"private party\" which had no warning. Drinks by pool were pricey - stick with the cans of beer. The servers are far and few between - they come back every hour or so. Buffet \u2013 Was just ok \u2013 Bellagio is better. The only decent thing was the crab legs \u2013 it makes up for the cost if you eat your fill. Server was a little off and not helpful. I didn\u2019t get any such deals for a free show etc \u2013 which I think was crappy \u2013 we stayed 4 nights and had no perks. Bottom line \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t stay here again and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.

This year we returned for a quick one night business trip. My impression of the Aria Sky Suites remains the same - it's good not great. Room On both occassions we had a penthouse category room. A nice large living room and a bedroom. The penthouse suite rooms are large and well designed. Comfortable and stylish. One category up is basically the same suite with a large dining room and bar. Not necessary unless you're entertaining as they are basically the same suite with the addition of a dining area. Room is solidly 4 1/2 star. Why not 5 star? It lacks some quality details that make a 5 star hotel genuine. The telephone is super cheap and the speaker phone doesn't work. Petty? Yes a petty detail. But the difference between 4 and 5 star hinges on the details. Also the internet connected television is slow and clumsy. Difficult to change channels. Slow to respond. Again, petty detail but it adds up to be an irritant and detracts from enjoying the experience. On this most recent stay the water was shut off to the bar sink tap. Silly and irritating. Service In a word - SLOW. Service is not 5 star at the Aria. Not by any measure. Room service, housekeeping, engineering - all requests were slow to be fulfilled. Overall the Aria - especially the Sky Suites - have the potential to be 5 star. What's needed? More staffing, quicker service times and a bit of refinement added to the rooms / suites.

We had a choice of any hotel in Vegas. We chose the Aria. Check-in took a longer than usual (1 hour) because our company President used the company credit card to pay for the room and all room charges. The information was faxed and we confirmed Aria received our fax, we had a copy of the paper work and the card used with us. We get checked in and make it to our rooms and was impressed, until we got a closer look. The room was dusty, there was hair in the shower, and the bed looked like a child made it up. After calling house keeping we made it down to the casino. The was a wide range of slot game to choose from. We played a while and when a waitress came by we ordered drinks, which took a while for them to return with them. We noticed during our stay that this was the norm. Several times when we flagged a waitress we got comments like \"this is not my area\" or \"My shift is over\". Once when we went to the buffet we asked for a window seat and was told by the hostess \"go see if you can find one\". The service from all staff varied from great to lack luster.That is the negative. The positive: I wrote a customer service letter regarding my stay and I received a phone call from the Vice President of Operations. He apologized and invited us back for the same length of our previous stay in the Aria Sky Suites he also ensured me that he would forward my letter to the department heads of each department that I complained about and the issues would be addressed. My second trip to Aria was September 18, 2011. From the moment the Limo picked me up at the airport my stay was amazing. I was greeted by name when I walked in the door to the private check in area. When I arrived I was told my room was not ready, but the time we finished check in the had a room for me on the 52nd floor with an amazing view of the strip. We had a 1 bedroom suite that was beautiful. It had 1/2 bath, living area, bedroom and a huge bathroom with footed spa tub, seated shower, toilet with heated seat among other things. I requested an ashtray which was brought to me in less than 2 minutes and 5 minutes later someone check to make sure i had received my requested item and asked if I need anything else. On the casino floor you could find a waitresses everywhere, when I request a window seat at the buffet they were more than happy to seat me, and I received great customer service from everyone I encountered. My overall opinion is that Aria is a great hotel with great customer service with a handful of employees that was not aware of that, once they were called on the carpet regarding their level of service they had to shape up or ship out.

The elevators are divided into about 5 banks (floors 1-12, 14-19, etc.) which was a tad annoying as we were travelling with about 40 people and if you wanted to go to someone else's room you had to go all the way down to the lobby, change banks and go back up but since it was our wedding week people came to us :). We got checked in which took about 15 minutes or so but the whole process was pleasant and easy and the employees are so nice! We ended up switching rooms halfway during the week before the week because we wanted a suite and twice we got champagne and choc. covered strawberries and macaroons (to die for!) delivered to our room which was awesome. The hotel is visually stunning... naturalistic with neutral colours and so many interesting pieces of art and water fountains. The rooms are gorgeous, so spacious and the beds are incredibly comfy. I loved the techy stuff in the room but the phones drove me nuts. Ours wouldn't work about 4 out of the 7 days which was really annoying as I wanted to call the rest of our group a lot... Everyone we passed by in the hallway as well would say hi and ask how we were. One man was even cleaning the carpets and as we walked by he turned off the machine and stood to the side - amazing! There is no room in the fridge that is in the room but if you have medication like I do *cough cough* they will bring a fridge up to your room free of charge. The walk to the strip is not as long as people say especially if you walk through Crystals and there is plenty to look at on your walk through there. ARIA is also very central on the strip - so close to Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Caesars and Cosmopolitan! We ate at the Cafe Vettro probably 6 out of the 7 days we were there, my favourite item off the menu was the breakfast parfait. Portions are huge and prices were pretty good. We also ate at Lemongrass one day and it was delicious - highly recommend! The pool area was gorgeous with plenty of seating, even on Labour Day weekend. The poolside cafe also had great food (same prices as Cafe Vettro which weren't all that bad considering you're in Vegas).

Aria was a very nice hotel. The girl that checked us was not friendly at all, but everyone else was super nice!!! The room was nice, bathroom was small...however, I loved the shower and seperate toilet! Food was very good, but expensive. I would recommend the breakfast buffet, very inexpensive and has everything you would want.. We ate there twice. Make sure to ask for two drinks, you will not receive refills...the service here isn't the best, but it's a buffet!!! Lunch and Dinner buffet are the same menu. I would say go one time, but not for both. Food was good for a buffet. Casino was nice, but didn't pay at all. I would recommend the Belagio or Mandalay Bay for their casinos. The location was perfect. I highly recommend Zumanity!!! This was an awesome show, very funny, very sexual! I would not recommend KA...it was very slow and boring. The best part was the last 20 minutes of a 90 minute show. Ohhh...if you take a taxi to and from the airport, it should only be $14.00. We asked the one driver to please take the shorter route...ummm, he took us on the highway...$25.00...

After reading the mixed reviews prior to our trip I wasn't quite sure what to expect and was entering into our stay with a bit of intrepedation. Apparently, Aria management have been digesting and acting upon guest feedback as many of the issues called out by other guests have been addressed and/or were non-existent during our stay. First, valet parking was great. There was no wait as we pulled up, the valet person and bell check were both very helpful and friendly and our car was unloaded immediately. Check-in was immediate with a guest relations person assisting people in getting to the most readily available clerk. Our front desk person was very friendly and knowledgeable and we received the room we requested. It was ready despite that fact it was only 1:00pm. Our room was absolutely beautiful, immaculately clean, fully stocked with toiletries, ammenities, lots of plush spa-like towels, spa robes and a well-stocked snack bar. (Warning, don't touch anything in the snack bar or you will be charged. We knew this so we didnt' touch anything). When we entered the room, the curtains opened and the music came on. My husband had to figure out the i-pad type device that ran everything in the room but once we did it was fine. There's a flat screen TV and too many other really cool features to list here. There was a dressing area with a full dresser and two wardrobe closets. The bathroom was to die for - it had a large spa-tub and shower room, a frosted glass commode area and was marble and travertine throughout - and very clean. We will echo what others have said and say the bed and pillows are the most comfortable we have ever slept on in our lives, (with the exception being our own, which are almost identical to the hotel's mattress, pillows and linens). What's cool is you can push a button which will reflect in the hall that you want privacy or if your room needs to be serviced. Each morning as we headed out the door, we'd hit the 'service' button which electronically signals the staff to clean the room. Every time we returned the room was clean and restocked with everything we needed. The rooms are also extremely quiet - not sure if it's because they did extra sound proofing or what, but we never heard our neighbors and we rarely heard even small sounds from the hallway. Unlike MGM where you can hear every room door bang shut or drunk returning to his room all throughout the night. We slept like rocks! The hotel staff were all amazing, friendly and helpful. We didn't meet a single rude person during our stay. The hotel itself is quite lovely and we loved that it didn't wreak of cigarette smoke. The lobby area had a really nice vanilla smell. Everything about the place was clean - the public areas, the restrooms, the elevators, the pool area, etc. Never a wait for the elevator either, which are often way overcrowded at the other strip hotels. We've stayed at MGM multiple times but it's really starting to show it's age and wear and tear but didn't realize how much so until our stay at the Aria. We spent one day at the pool which was amazing - no pounding top-40 rap music, no partying 20-somethings looking for a hook-up and monopolizing the area, nor 5,000 little ones running amok around the lazy river. It was fabulous - nice music, older crowd, uncrowded, no smoking, no drunks and no underdressed young people being, well, stupid. Very relaxing day with plenty of trees for shade, comfortable lounge chairs and very good service. I totally didn't want to leave - the pools themselves are amazing too. The last evening (we stayed three nights) we ordered up room service for dinner. The food was fabulous - we had the new york steak and the salmon. Forewarning, the accompaniments are ala cart. For the steak, salmon, baked potato with each, side bread and one dessert, with tip, was $114.00. We were okay with that though as we had a $75.00 food and beverage credit. We used our express comps to pay for the remainder of the dinner too. We used the business center to check-in for our return flight home, pay for our luggage and print our boarding passes. The staff there were so nice and very helpful. The center was gleaming it was so clean and the internet connection was faster than anything I had ever experienced. Awesome!! The only thing I would call out about the Aria though is their slot machines are pretty tight. We never really 'hit' on anything, not even small wins, but they did give us $100 in free play with our stay so that helped a bit. Even at that, we dropped quiet a bit on gambling. We had a car during our stay, (self-parking is very easy and the garage is not very far from the casino or hotel rooms). This helped manage expenses as we were able to get off the strip to buy beer, wine, water, snacks and go to off-strip restaurants. Otherwise I think you'd rack up a pretty sizeable food bill if you ate (and especially drink) at the hotel or strip restaurants all the time. We paid $15.00 for one drink at a bar in the hotel and I about had a coronary. We were extremely pleased (and impressed) with our entire stay and would stay there again anytime. I'm very glad that Aria management has been listening and acting upon guest feedback. We look forward to returning soon - I think we're too spoiled by this visit to stay anywhere else now.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cMy New Favourite Vegas Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "writetosfa", "ReviewID": "UR118713478", "Content": "Just got back from a 3 night stay at the ARIA Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. We've stayed at the MGM Grand, Mirage, Bellagio, NY NY, Paris & Vdara and previous to this stay, I would say that the MGM Grand was my favourite place out of all of these. We absolutely LOVED the ARIA - it was fantastic. We stayed in their standard resort room, the resort was full so there wasn't an opportunity to upgrade, but the standard room was great. It was spacious, nicely decorated and I loved the automatic system that controls the curtains, lights, tv and temperature. You could set your alarm to open up the drapes instead of hearing that annoying alarm sound or telephone ring! I also fell in love with the beds. Each night I couldn't wait to get back into it! They have the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The bathroom is great as well. The bathtub is so deep and very relaxing. The ARIA has a large casino which smells so wonderful. My friend loved it so much she bought the scent sticks for her home from the gift shop for about $25. Could not smell any cigarette smoke at all - but like all Vegas hotels, the air was pretty dry. Jean Phillipe has amazing pastries and other goodies, The Buffet has a great lunch spread and Lemongrass served up fantastic Thai. Couldn't believe how helpful all the staff were. Everyone you encountered spoke to you, make small talk and asked how your stay was going. The dining room reservation line agent talked our ear off!

But my stay at Aria was like a first date with a beautiful woman who has something stuck in her teeth - one flaw that distracts and detracts from the overall experience. First the positive - Aria is a BEAUTIFUL hotel. You can tell the designers spared no expense in the decor of the casino, restaurant and lobby areas. My buddy who is in the construction industry was marveling at all of the intricate detailing in the lighting and the facades of each area. Everything seems extremely clean and new, which is as it should be since it was just built a few years ago. Some care also went into the overall layout - the front desk is just inside the main entrance, and the main guest elevators are a short walk away. No trekking through the majority of a gigantic casino is required to get to your room. Also, Aria has a distinctive smell of vanilla that is most noticeable around the front desk. It's a very different aroma from the rest of Vegas, and I appreciated that most of the resort doesn't smell like smoke. The rooms themselves were very spacious. Even though we didn't have a view room, we had a lovely view of Vdara and its pool area, the Cosmopolitan, and the surrounding Vegas mountains. I found the view to be mesmerizing at night time, with all of the hotels lit up and people coming and going through the main entrance. The bathroom was not huge, but they did incorporate a large shower and a separate tub within the same space - very unique. One of the reasons I was looking forward to the Aria is the technology they incorporate into each room. All of the lighting, sound, curtains, temperature, etc can be controlled via the TV and remote, OR by the touch panel by the bed, OR by the individual control buttons along the wall. In addition, there is an input panel that allows you to plug in your laptop/iPad/iPhone/Android phone and playback your own videos or music through the TV, as well as charge your devices. Very cool! The big problem was that in our room, the technology barely worked. There was an excruciating delay, up to a minute, whenever we tried to turn a light on, or change a channel on the TV, or even open the curtains when we first entered the room. This delay occurred regardless if we were using the remote, the touch panel, or the hard buttons on the wall. Technology is great when it works, but when it doesn't, it makes even the most simplest activities (like watching TV) agonizing. If I had been staying longer than one night, I would have definitely asked the front desk to fix it or move us to another room. As it was, we barely spent any time in the room so it wasn't worth the effort. Also, the beds look comfortable, but in reality they were way too soft for my taste. Aria uses some sort of pillow-top mattress, which meant that I literally sank into the bed when I got in it. Ultimately I had a good night's rest, but that may be more about how tired I was instead of how comfortable the bed was. It certainly wasn't comfortable to be in while awake. Service-wise, I can't complain. From the valet to the front-desk, service was fairly prompt and courteous. I also had the opportunity to use the Spa at Aria. That was an amazing experience. The spa facilities are top-notch, with the highlights being the co-ed therapy pool overlooking the main Aria pool and the co-ed meditation room with hot stone beds. Since I was with my wife, it was great to be able to spend time together in the spa instead of being separated in the men's and women's sides. The hot stone massage was fantastic and highly recommended. There are quite a few restaurants I would have liked to try at Aria, but I ended up only having the time to eat at Jean Philippe Patisserie. The sandwiches and pastries were very tasty, if a tad overpriced (although probably fairly priced by Strip standards). I appreciated that I was able to get something to eat quickly (it's located right by the guest elevators) and people-watch while eating. Overall, my wife and I agreed we would both return, but I'll be looking out for malfunctioning technology next time around.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pompton Plains, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Aria but do not go if you are depending on the kindness of your Casino Host.\u201d", "Author": "CookieCahill", "ReviewID": "UR118709864", "Content": "We spent for days at the Aria Resort & Casino in August of 2011.

The first day it does take a little time to get used to the fragarance they pump through AC system in the Hotel, Casino and shopping areas. I traveled with my 74 year old mother and like many posts before, the lights and remote was a little more than my she could handle. But we got thru it. The beds were comfortable but I hated the pillows. What is it with hotels that do not provide firm non feather pillows? They were all of the $10 Bed Bath & Beyond stuffing pillow quality. The Bathroom was great except our tub was was in with the stall shower. Kind of a different set up. The shower head was dreadful - it was of the rainbath style and can not be adjusted. So if you like rainbaths, you are good to go but if are like me that has thick hair, you struggle to get the shampoo out. Pet Peeve of mine, but I do not like blow drying my hair in the bathroom when staying at a hotel and you have 2 people sharing a room. I wish there was a mirror and plug near one another on the outside of the bathroom. There are no cheap eating options at the Aria. The buffet and cafe was just OK and expensive, there are other much better in Las Vegas. Note, I only ate at the buffet and cafe for breakfast. Sirio Ristorante and Jean Philippe Patisserie were divine and were worth every penny. The Elvis show was the best Cirque de Soliel in Vegas as far as I was concerned. The concierge and front desk people were also very helpful. The spa was good but pricey and though I did not sit by the pool, I did walk thru the pool area, and it looked to be very enjoyable. Now onto the reason this hotel is getting only 4 stars instead of 5 by me. The casino host were rude and not helpful. Actually out any Casino host in the country, I have never encountered such rude hosts. And it was not just to us, but it seemed they \"rolled their eyes\" at every guest who came their way.

I got a special price of $79.00 a night so it was hard to pass up. I arrived early in the morning (9am) and they gave me a room right away. I had given my bags to the bellman coming in because I thought I would have to wait for a room. When I got to the room I was greeted with the curtains opening on my arrival and music turning on. I called the bell services when I got to the phone and they had my bags up in 5 minutes with a bag of ice for the ice bucket. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Of course by now most travelers know not to touch anything you don't want to buy in/on the mini bar. They are all weight sensored, but I did not have any trouble with it. I bought a ticket to see Viva Elvis from the casino offer and was given a great seat at a discount. The show was very good with lots of talented musicians and singers and lots of Elvis soundtrack singing but all live backup. The set was incredible in true Cirque fashion. I was also able to pick up my Terry Fator tickets at Aria, even thou he is at Mirage, at the concierge desk. This saved me from a trip to the box office for will call at Mirage. The room was always well maintained. The privacy lights at the door are great - no hanging of tacky tags outside the doors. When you were ready for service you could put on the service light or call housekeeping. All the staff was very nice. I ate at the cafe and the food was excellent as was the service. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the buffet. I went on \"gourmet dinner\" night but the extra price was not clearly listed out front. It was $39.00 instead of $29.00. I found out from my waiter that this included a half lobster if I desired and all the wine I wanted. Well I don't drink wine and the lobster was not that great. As for the other items on the buffet I was disappointed with the selection. Very average food - hardly gourmet.

(20256 and 20258) First day both rooms were fine, awesome view, even though it was not to Strip Ave. Rooms are high tech, and very clean, at least in our first day. Second day, room 20258 was cleaned up but no new towels were left in the room, and room 20256 was cleaned as well but no soap were left there (we took shower with left overs soap). Third day and the most painful day. Room 20258 members were locked out the room because of a locker issue.

They almost missed the night show, and the attendent didn't care about it.

We saw Rod Stewart at Caesers Palace which was mind blowing and Viva Elvis at the Aria which was great. There is an English pub that is next door to the Aria called Todd English and it serves some really good ales/beers/lagers so we visited there quite a bit.

I can\u2019t say enough great things about this hotel, the staff, the restaurant and the overall experience. I have stayed at many of the hotels on the strip and I admit there are some fabulous choices, but Aria is our home away from home and now the only hotel we choose. It is chic and classy and it is absolutely beautiful. Sure you won\u2019t see any canal boats floating by or circus acts, but that is totally ok with me. Keep the sightseeing tourists in other hotels as far as I am concerned. I have never stayed in a regular room, but we have stayed in the corner suites twice and the rest has been a one or two bedroom sky suite. I absolutely love the sky suites. The private entrance is also a great benefit. One my first visit I did experience long lines at the main entrance, but that was when the hotel first opened. I have only used that check in once since and they seemed to be more streamlined. Now we just use the private entrance at the sky suites and we are checking in very quickly and swept away to our rooms within minutes of getting out of the limo. In fact we never have to touch our bags from the time we arrive in baggage claim until the time we arrive in our room. GREAT SERVICE! The rooms are beautifully decorated and offer a fabulous view no matter what side of the hotel you are staying. I love the technology in the rooms and have not experienced many of the problems other reviewers have mentioned. I find it very easy to use. There has been one or two occasions where something in the room did not work properly but the staff was very quick to respond and send an engineer to our room. It happens, no big deal. The variety of restaurants in the hotel is overwhelming, in a good way. I love the choices. Lemongrass in one of our favorites. The best Thai on the strip. Julian Serrano\u2019s is a favorite as well and we visit it often. Try the shrimp and grits at American Fish. AWESOME! I can say I am not a fan of the breakfast buffet. We have never been thrilled and usually opt for another hotel when looking for a good breakfast or brunch buffet. Otherwise the other restaurants on property are absolutely fabulous. We are gamblers and Aria is our casino of choice. The casino is large and offers a lot of variety. (I saw a previous poster mention how small it was. Obviously he/she did not do a very good job of looking around! Note: It is rated in the top 10 LARGEST casinos in Las Vegas and is noted to be the size of THREE football fields). We absolutely love the casino staff. Keyia is our favorite dealers and we always look for her. She makes playing at her table an absolute adventure. There are so many more we love and too many too mention. The dealers are so nice and we have made great friendships with many of them. Some of whom we keep in touch with on a regular basis. I have never encountered a rude or unfriendly staff member at this hotel. I think that the people who complain about the staff here were probably rude to the staff members to begin with (which we see SO much of) or they are mad that they lost money. Don\u2019t blame the staff! I cant tell you how many times I have seen people get rude with the dealers and think they are god because they are making a 10.00 bet. Rude people really need to get a life. I would also like to say that Tyrone and \u201cG\u201d at the bar by the sports book are two of our favorites. They are always our very first stop when we arrive. We love those guys.

The smell that others commented on is quite noticeable and was pleasant enough at first, by day 4 I was glad to be leaving it behind. The room was nice enough, although with all of the high tech options we had a really hard time plugging in ipods/iphones into the system for music. The beds were very comfortable and the washroom, tub/shower were fine. We had a cabanna poolside one day and this was a highlight, we've rented cabannas at the signature and this one was definitely nicer. The casino itself isn't that large which was a bit surprising, the table dealers quite obviously wanted to work somewhere else. We ate at the buffet (nice options, tasty enough food), the cafe (great service, good food) and Jean Phillipe (delicious, long long lineups/wait). I think the main reason we won't stay here again was the general lack of good customer service.

We arrived for a 3-night stay at about 3pm and waiting approx 5 mins to be checked in - plenty of people at check-in desks and only one person waiting (maybe we just timed it right but check-out was just as efficient) We chose to self-park and there is a short walk to get you into the casino area, followed by quite a trek to the check-in desks (the hotel is massive so you can't expect all things to be within touching distance - there are signs everywhere so you don't get lost) The vanilla smell within the hotel is lovely - not at all overpowering and it covered the smell of cigarette smoke well. The location is fabulous - quite central, with a train that runs to the Bellagio. I can't disagree more with people who complained about the distance from the hotel to the strip - yes, it's set back slighty so you can't step out of the hotel onto the strip but it's not that far! It would take longer to walk the length of the Forum in Ceasars Palace. It's simple if you don't like walking, don't go to Vegas! Our room was fabulous, spacious and modern and the bed was like sleeping on a large cloud! I can only echo what others have said about the technology - Plenty of storage for clothes and luggage, lovely bathroom with 2 sinks and shower/bath behind a frosted glass door. The toilettries were nice and were replenished even when they weren't completely used up. We saw a few room service trolleys which were outside the rooms for a few hours but were never still the there the following day. On our second day we got back to the room at 4pm and it hadn't been cleaned (even though there were cleaners along the corridor and we'd put our service light on). My partner saw a supervisor just along the corridor who apologised and send somebody round within minutes while we went to have a drink. We had a standard room which was at the far end of a corridor (even this wasn't a long walk, despite what people have put on here) and overlooked the pools which was lovely. The hotel itself was spotlessly clean everywhere and we were constantly seeing maintenance people about and one day there was a large water spillage on the tiled floor but it was dealt with quickly and somebody stood by it to ensure nobody walked through it and slipped. My only gripe about this is that upon entering our room, it was pitch black as the black-out curtain was closed and it didn't open! I've read that they're supposed to open and your TV comes on but we were left groping around for the light switches for a few moments but it was fine once we got the hang of the controls.

I found the hotel and the rooms very clean and with a very nice smell. The decoration its modern and high tech, and so are the restaurants. The rooms(we stayed in the deluxe room city view), are not that far from the exit, so we have nothing to complain about that, and since we know that in vegas its all walking and walking. Our room was fab and spacious. So as everyone says, it had the control to customize the lighting, curtains, tv etc. The bed was supreme!! Very comforting, and I think it was the best thing of the room. The bathroom its fine too.Two sinks, two mirrors, a weight balance, eco-friendly products,the tub and the shower are next to the other, with a glass door. I have only two things to complain about: -The view. We pay the deluxe room city view, so we assume it was a full view of the strip, but what we'd get, was a view of the city center facing the strip. It was OK. -The noise.We were in the middle of Cosmo's Marquee, and Aria Liquid dayclub, so, in the day, we hear a little bit of the music coming from these 2 places. It wasn't a high noise, but we notice that. We also went to the pool and we liked a lot.

Starting with the location - let's get this out of the way - I've read a few comments that suggest that the location is poor or it's a terribly long walk from the casino floor to the strip etc. well, i can put that to bed right away, there IS a walk from the casino floor to the strip but it's the same at every other hotel. That's Vegas surely? Yes, there's a short walk to the strip from the hotel but either - [a] if you are happy in the hotel then it won't be an issue or [b] if you're heading out, then you'll be prepared for the walk or the taxi drive. Getting to and from the strip is simple and is actually a pleasant experience. There's plenty to look at and if you do head through the stunning Crystals Shopping Centre then there's always shops and bars to stop at. I wouldn't ever moan about the walk to the strip especially as when attending events at other hotels, I'd suggest the walk was considerably shorter at Aria than at other hotels. Onto the room, we had a city-view suite which was stunning, packed with features, The bathroom was great with 2 sinks, wet room, shower and bath and lots of toiletries that were refreshed every day. The room itself had lots of storage space, drawers, wardrobes etc. and plenty of space for storing cases and shopping too. The in-room technology was cool and fun to play with. We ate and drank at a few of the in-hotel bars and restaurants are were delighted with them all. Only one minor issue with a surly waitress but even that couldn't dampen our affection for this new establishment. Incidentally, i did read a couple of comments both within reviews and on the LV forum about the smell of vanilla in the hotel - well compared to other hotels in Vegas, I'd say it was easily the cleanest of them all and there was only one time that we smelt smoke and that was when we walked past a woman puffing on a huuuuuge cigar! Each to their own! We did find that other hotels had varying smells ranging from urine to pine toilet cleaner so a soft, inoffensive vanilla was much preferred to stale smoke or sweat! The only point that means i'd reward this hotel with a 9 out of 10 rather than 100% is when checking out, I wasn't asked if i'd enjoyed my stay and my card was charged before I had chance to tell them that i wanted to pay cash. Not the end of the world but a little annoying - not that I had huge amounts of cash following a dismal casino performance!! :) Overall, a great hotel, top location, super modern and stylish and so much better than any of the many other hotels we visited whilst in Las Vegas.

I probably would have liked the room more had I not gotten a suite on the 4th floor - which meant basically no view, which of course, is why I wanted a corner suite - for the fabulous view. The room was nice, bed and pillows were very comfortable. I had no noise issues at all. The room is a bit of a hike from the elevators, but as the suites are at the end of the hall, there isn't much you can do about this. I only mention it for any one who has mobility issues. The bathroom was very nice. The tech stuff in the room took a while to figure out, but we eventually did. I did have a few issues with housekeeping, the first being them helping themselves to the tip I left, without actually cleaning the room first. They did come later that day and clean the room, but I thought that taking the tip first was a bit tacky. Second issue with them was the next day, them calling and leaving a message saying they couldn't clean the room because we had left the privacy light on all day, which we hadn't. The room HAD in fact been cleaned. They came knocking on our door at 9:30 that night waking us up, wanting to clean the room. Food - I ate at the Buffet twice, and the Skybox twice, and had room service breakfast. I thought the food was good, if a bit overpriced, but then we aren't big \"foodies\". It filled the hole. Gambling. Absolutely no luck, but that's gambling. I didn't care for the selection of slot machines there. Every machine is brand spanking new, which means you won't find any of your old favorites there. Poker schedules are not good at all. Location - not really great for getting to the strip.

The front desk said the only room they had was not as nice as the room we booked - I said I did not think it was fair to get a \"downgrade\" and all she kept says was \"its all we have\" and repeated \"how can I help you\" over and over again ina condesendign rude manner. I asked if a manger could call me (I was now standing in the hall) and she said I would have to come back down to the lobby because they were all on the \"floor\" I asked when someone could call me back and she said she did not know and \"how can i help you\" after a few of these I hung up and waited 10 min and called back only to get the same rude person. They offered to spray the room and air it out (gross) so i hung up again and called the bell desk to get my bags - I'm a meeting planner with friends at other hotels. I wanted to Try Aria and frankly if my guests are treated this way I would never hold a business meeting here. I told this to the bell desk and they offered to try and help - they moved us to a lower floor and we had to wait 45 min while room keys were all messed up and security came to let us in and then another wait for room key delivery - what a mess.

Liquid Club is interesting - they get you in with a free ticket but then you have to pay a lot for drinks & $10 fee for men. Not worth it! The pool lounge at the Venetian (Tao Lounge) is way better if that's what you are looking for. Also, this is not a family hotel - mostly adults. If you want to take your family, the Vdara is better as it's an all suite hotel with kitchenettes & a non-smoking hotel since there is no casino.

For only $30 dollars you get to use all of the facilities at the spa for the entire day and you can come and go as you please. That is a terrific deal. The pools were nice. I spent a few hours at the regular (kid/family friendly) pools and checked out the (adults only) Liquid Pool Party.

Our bed was also pretty uncomfortable--it seemed to peak in the middle and then slope down on each side, so we always had a feeling that we were falling out of the bed. And a couple of minor things--the hot water fixture on one of the sinks was quite loose and constantly moved around and the light on the magnifying mirror didn't work.

We both really enjoyed the slightly toned down atmosphere at the Aria...the distinct lack of neon, flashing lights, gaudiness, faux gold \"opulence\" and on-going casino noise that typifies most of the Vegas hotels and casinos. Yes, I understand that's what many people go to Vegas for but its not what everyone wants. We ate twice at the Julian Serrano Spanish restaurant and really enjoyed both meals. The pools were beautiful and relaxing, other than the noise coming from the obnoxious Liquid Lounge. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the fitness center is well outfitted with weights and cardio equipment (though it gets quite crowded on weekends). The only nit we had to pick was that we couldn't find a safe in the room and no mention was made of a safe in the guest directory. We stumbled across the safe when we were checking out and opened the drawer to the nightstand...turns out it's hidden in there. We could have asked at the front desk but with nothing in sight and no mention of one in the directory, we just assumed there wasn't one. Also, as some of the negative reviewers have mentioned, they inject incense into the air in the common areas, this gets a bit annoying and may really bother people who are sensitive to perfumes and other strong smells.

Both check in and check out were done efficiently even though there were some line ups. When it was busy, some of the concierge staff went around with iPads and checked people out. Everyone that we dealt with was pleasant and helpful. The hotel is connected to the City Centre complex which has numerous stores and restaurants. There is a free tram that you can take to get to the Bellagio complex as well. When getting used to the layout of the hotel and surrounding area, we asked any of the hotel staff who are posted around the property for directions and were always given good advice. The room itself was excellent. We had a king room in the Main Tower with the mountain view. This turned out to be a bonus because in some of the other parts of the hotel, rooms overlook either the Liquid Bar at Aria or the Day/Night Club at the Cosmopolitan. You can hear the thumping of the bass from some of the other rooms until dawn apparently. We heard nothing. In fact, other than a few noisy people going by our door at night, the room was very quiet. The room was cleaned well each day. When you leave, you simply push the Service button by the door and the cleaning staff are notified. The cleaning staff came by once when we were in the room and they did not try to enter. A notice was left hanging on the doorknob. It asked us to notify them when we were ready. There is another button to light the Privacy light outside the room. No more Do Not Disturb sign hanging from the doorknob. We were also impressed with the wall to wall picture window with a great view of the mountains. The vanilla aroma that is pumped throughout the hotel is not overpowering at all. We found it pleasant and it covered much of the smoke smell in the casino. We had no problems dealing with the technical side of the room. As others have noted, you have an iPad like device next to the bed that can control the lights, curtains etc. You an also use the tv remote to access all of the room controls. There is a convenient Good Night button on both sides of the bed. When pushed, lights and tv go off and the curtains close. On the desk by the large flat screen, that has HD tv, there is a control panel where you can plug in your iPod or computer to listen to music etc. on the tv. We enjoyed the pool on a few occasions and, again, all of the attendants were very helpful. It\u2019s definitely not a quiet place though. You have tour helicopters going overhead constantly and there is the fairly loud music from the Liquid Club when it\u2019s open. We thought that the hotel might have made one of the pools No Smoking and will suggest that to them. It can be annoying to have smoke wafting over you as you sit to read or lounge in the pool. And, yes, some people actually do smoke in the pool! We tried two restaurants in the hotel, Michael Mina\u2019s American Fish and The Buffet. Our meal at American Fish was the best one we had in Vegas. Everything was extremely tasty and well presented. The Buffet was nothing spectacular and had a cafeteria like feel to it. The food was good, just not something we\u2019d return to with so many other options available. .

I enjoyed the technological advances in the room, particularly the one touch \"Goodnight\" button that closed the drapes and turned off all lights. The thing that separates this from the ultra luxury line is the bathroom. The shower and the large soaking tub are right next to each other with one door leading to both. You open the door and step into the shower or take another step to the tub. Different for sure. In addition, the double sinks were closer than other luxury hotels and there just wasn't as much room to spread out makeup, contact stuff, etc. But there was plenty of closet and drawer space, which was nice. I had a deluxe city view and that was great to see at night - the colorful fountain and all of the city lights. Hotel walls aren't all that thick and I had frat boys out in the hall at 3:30 am chatting it up, but I guess that happens in Vegas!! I found all personnel very friendly. I have seen complaints about checking in, but I arrived on a Wednesday and had no problem. Checkout lines were quite long, but to their credit, there was an employee checking people out in the lines with a mobile device, so that helped speed things along. For the millionth time I tried to check out of a hotel via the television, only to be told at the end of the process that it didn't work! That always happens to me.

And it was! Far from the typical overly gaudy Vegas hotels on the strip - Aria is modern, chic, lavish and still over the top! Room - We loved the room - possibly one of the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. Huge comfy bed, great bathroom with two sinks, sunken tub AND a great shower, and a super geeky integrated control panel that powered all the lighting, curtains, temperature, music, and TV. We ate it up! There's nothing like walking in your room and having your room curtains go straight to sheers open to give you a fabulous view of the city. Or being able to go to complete \"blackout\" when its time for bed in Vegas. Food - On our first day we did brunch at Le Village Buffet at the Paris Hotel. We'd heard great things. And while we enjoyed our food - the brunch at the Aria was much better. Less of a wait and more selections. The only thing missing was a crepe station :) We also loved all of the restaurant selections at the hotel - Julian Serrano was our favorite! A great tapas restaurant right in the main lobby. Casino - loved this casino! Great selection, never overcrowded, fun, great music, and clean and modern. Service - top notch service. Check-in was a little slow but other than that everything was great. Pool - beautiful pool area with three great pools, plenty of chairs, great cocktails, and so relaxing. I definitely recommend trying the Aria - whether you've been to a Vegas 100 times or it is your first time!

Next morning my husband went to reception and asked that our room be cleaned and that he wasn't prepared to pay the resort fee of around $20 plus tax for the day the room wasn't cleaned. If anything the only complaint would be that the buy-ins in the Casino were too expensive. My husband likes poker but $125 is just a bit too expensive and the minimum $10 chips for roulette were too expensive.

I have kept checking my credit card statement just in case but we have been home 5 days now and so far nothing has been charged. It was our first time in Vegas and we loved it but considering it is such a long way we probably won't return.

Be aware that the $20.00 resort fee (just another way to jack up the price) is in addition to the price quoted by Priceline. The resort fee is supposed to include a morning newspaper, but none was delivered to the room and I didn't see any available for the pickup anywhere in the lobby. Check-in was on the slow side, they didn't seem to have enough clerks. The checkout was also slow since they have an 11:00 AM checkout time and many people waited until the last hour to checkout. We stayed just after the Labor Day weekend and the hotel didn't seem to be crowded, so check-in and out could be a problem on busy weekends. The room was pleasant and well designed. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and I liked the lay out of the bathroom, although it was not especially fancy by luxury hotel standards. House keeping was good, but there was a long, easily visible black hair on the window sill and the chrome in the bathroom was very water spotted. There was no trace of smoke smell on our non-smoking tenth floor. The electronic room controls are fun (especially the drapes that open automatically when you enter the room), but are actually a little tedious after the novelty wears off. The touch pad is not very sensitive and you have to press firmly to get it to respond. No ipad sensitivity here. As a result, what should be the room's most modern feature (the touch pad) seems a little dated already. The automatic drapes are the one really worthwhile electronic feature. The window covers the entire outside wall of the room and really opens up the room, so good drapes are a real necessity. Getting a room with a good view will be worth the extra money. The hotel is going to have a problem keeping all these windows clean and ours could have used some attention. The main pool was great, but doesn't open until 9:00 AM and closes at dark. The pool is shallow (about 4 feet) and decreases in depth at one end so you can just walk in. This is great for children and just relaxing, but it's not a swimmer's (or a partyer's) pool, which is probably a good thing for most people. The hotel is in a great location and right next to the incredibly up-scale shopping center. Bring your high-limit credit card if you want to shop there. Overall, this was a very nice stay. It's not up to the quality of a true five star hotel (It's a AAA five diamond hotel), but one of the nicer hotels on the strip.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cUpscale Resort Casino on the Strip\u201d", "Author": "seaver41", "ReviewID": "UR117970664", "Content": "This was my second stay at Aria.

In fact, we both thought since we got into town early ( we arrived to the hotel by 11am) they wouldn't let us check into the room so early. We ate an early lunch (we were coming in from the East coast) and around 1230 we decided to walk by the desk and see when the earliest check in time would be. They were already checking in people! We waited in line for maybe TEN minutes and we were all checked in and off to our room. The one thing that we weren't prepared for was the $130 a night incidental hold they put on your credit card.

The beds are super comfortable and the bathroom is really nice (there is even a magnifying mirror- great for girls)! The hotel itself has every commodity possible- though at a price of course. It is a pricey hotel but it's expected given the type of hotel. There is a CVS and a Walgreens super close, so go there for anything you may need such as water. There are plenty of restaurants at all price ranges and different types of foods. We ate at Julian Serrano and though the food was really good- the service was terrible. The waitress had no personality and she made us wait a lot. It took her forever to clear our plates and did not ask once if everything was okay. This was my birthday dinner, so it was disappointing. We alerted management, and the manger didn't convince me in him trying to fix the situation. He didn't care either. As far as service- it's a hit or miss really. It just depends on who of their staff you interact with. My check-in process was good, though I did have to wait more than 15 minutes to check-in. They don't have a streamlined process to do this as it is not one line but just open and people get confused and skip others. I approached the front desk about an issue during my stay and the agent was not pleasant or customer service oriented. She was not compassionate and didn't care about what I had to say. On the flip side, I did lock myself out of the room and one of the housekeepers rescued me as I was on my way out to catch my flight and needed my room opened ASAP. This was at 3:30am and that person was really nice and understood my sense of urgency. With a hotel that large with so many employees, it must be hard to ensure that everyone is on point when it comes to customer service. Room hygiene is something the Aria should really focus on. The rooms are not cleaned the way they should be. It seems the housekeepers do a very superficial cleaning during your stay- more like make the beds and empty trash. The common grounds were very clean. The pool area is really nice and even though I went during Labor Day Weekend, there were enough chairs. The drinks at the pool are super pricey- FYI (expect to pay $16 minimum for a drink). We also went to Gold Lounge- great place to warm up with drinks. Beware though, they sell you open bar for $10- it's not open bar it's only well drinks like cranberry and cheap vodka. For Vegas though, I think that is a good deal nonetheless.

It's still in remarkably good condition and provides rooms that are a solid step above what you get in many hotels in the city. The room was really clean and well appointed and everything was comfortable. But this being Las Vegas, the room is meant to be used sparingly as they want you in the casino. However, it still provided a good work space for me. I was here on a business trip, which is why a non-gambler like myself ends up in Las Vegas all the time. For your business planners: the meeting rooms were very good and the technical service was quick and polite. We had an audio problem and they fixed it fast. Of course, like all these Las Vegas hotels, it felt like a 10 mile walk to get to the meeting rooms, so plan your trips carefully. Forgetting something is a real pain. And the business center was useful, but overpriced. The Aria swimming pools are marvelous, with a good number of choices. I decided again the \"adult only\" pool, so I can't comment on that. But the main pool area is clean, chairs are plentiful and if you plan well, you can even find shade. One last point: like so many other hotels on the strip, the Aria is attached to loads of high priced shopping and marathon like walks from place to place. Keep in mind that there are budget choices nearby, such as CVS for immediate needs (at normal prices) and even McDonald's not to far away.

I actually recall seeing the property being cleaned 24/7. Are the costs a little bit higher? Yes but if you want cheap and crappy, stay at Bally's or Imperial Palace. I will pay a little more to stay in a place that holds itself to a higher standard. The pool was a good time. I'm sure there are nicer pools in Vegas but we still managed to have a blast drinking and splashing all day long. I strongly suggest Barmasa for a sushi dinner. Our waiter, Chris was outstanding and was a shining example of the level of service Aria demands from its employees.

Wish it could be kept a secret!\u201d", "Author": "ILove2Travel95", "ReviewID": "UR117672570", "Content": "After reading a number of mixed reviews, I was becoming skeptical about staying at Aria and was considering canceling our reservation and selecting another hotel on the Strip. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t! Having just returned from a week long stay during the last week of August, I can happily say, Aria is a refreshing Las Vegas hotel experience, somewhat of a departure from the frenzied nature of some of the other big names on the Strip, while still providing that uniquely Las Vegas casino and hotel experience. I look forward to going back! Aria is immaculately clean. There was always someone cleaning something when we were walking around the hotel grounds, cleaning glass, railings and dusting. Aria is beautiful to look at with stunning architecture and design elements throughout. The lobby is infused with a wonderfully relaxing yet intriguing vanilla scent and the common areas are decorated in rich, dark tones. The casino area is very open and spacious, and everything is thoughtfully laid out around the hotel, so, although it is a big property, it was never difficult to navigate and never took a long time to get anywhere inside the hotel as it often does in many of the other larger hotels on the Strip that seem more labyrinth. Staff in the dining venues in particular were very friendly and willing to talk, offer suggestions based on our requests, and we never felt rushed. The Sky Box Bar and Grill was excellent for a bar style meal with typical American bar fare such as burgers and wings, nachos, and a few other types of sandwiches and desserts. There were plenty of TV\u2019s for watching sports! We had dinner at Lemongrass, the Thai restaurant, and it was fabulous! I\u2019d definitely go back on a future trip. The food was fresh and ultra flavorful, dinners were served hot, and the service was very friendly and attentive, yet unobtrusive. We opted for breakfast at the Jean Philippe Patisserie several mornings, which is very convenient as it\u2019s just a step from the guest elevators and the staff works quickly to move people through the line. There\u2019s a large selection of breakfast pastries, quiches, yogurt, granola, panini and crepes, among some other items. The chocolate muffin was my favorite as it had a small yet awesome layer of fresh chocolate creme infused into the muffin. Yum! We returned to the Patisserie later in the day on several occasions to try the gelato, which was, of course, great! The Buffet had good quality food on offer but service here was the only somewhat negative exception among the venues in the hotel, as we had a minor glitch the first morning when we were never acknowledged after being seated in order to request coffee and juice. A number of other tables around us were seated and greeted, and received beverages while we sat there for an extended period of time. I eventually got up and walked to get someone\u2019s attention, because the staff attending to the tables in our area wouldn\u2019t even look at us. Later, as we were finished eating and getting ready to leave, someone who I figured out was probably our server did awkwardly come by our table and looked at our table, but not really at us, and she didn\u2019t say anything and moved on. No coffee refill was ever offered after the person clearing tables eventually brought me my original cup, but I suspected that in advance, so I rationed my one cup. It was very odd, but really the only exception to our time there. I did use the spa, and while my massage was excellent and relaxing, I feel the spa common areas could have been more thoughtfully designed. Spending some time there was still a great retreat, however, the lighting in certain areas was too bright in my opinion. On the brochure, they show the wet area with the whirlpools and sauna and steam room dimly lit with warm colored tones of stone and lighting. In reality, the area is brightly lit with white lights, and although it was still relaxing because I had just had a great massage, it had somewhat more of a gym locker room feel than a tranquil spa feel. There were only a small handful of lounge chairs in the whirlpool area, and they all were being used or had towels on them, so there was no opportunity to relax with a book or fall asleep for a brief nap after the massage. The eucalyptus steam room, however, is very spacious. Also, while using this area, while relaxing in the whirlpool, you can hear loud dance music from the Liquid pool party that takes place outside. So, all in all, in my opinion it\u2019s not necessarily the most relaxing place to hang out and soothe your mind if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for in a spa day. In the co-ed area there are heated stone beds and a salt room. They were both small for a hotel of this size, and the stone beds were not warm enough. The stone beds were mildly relaxing until someone was emptying garbage and changing can liners in the hallway just outside the door and there were garbage bag noises that continued on and on for quite a period of time. I found the pool area to be particularly relaxing and enjoyable. It is very approachable, with little pretense. The pool grounds are very nicely laid out with wandering pathways and three separate pools and plenty of lounge chairs. We never had a problem finding a chair and were greeted promptly and offered bar and food service by a very friendly waitress. As for the rooms, they are stunning, as are the views, and the decor is warm and comfortable. The in-room technology is great, and the console next to the bed controls everything in the room including the curtains, lights, thermostat, television and wake-up settings. The console is a touch pad and it is not as immediately responsive as many people\u2019s touch screen phones or tablets or similar devices that are out there today, but once you get a feel for it\u2019s function, you adjust accordingly. The curtains were cool to play with (it\u2019s the little things in life, right?), and it was amazing when entering the room for the first time (or any time, really) as they parted to reveal our spectacular Strip view. Oh, and yes, the beds and linens are amazingly soft and comfortable and available for sale. I may just have to splurge at some point! I do agree with some other reviewers in that housekeeping service was a bit inconsistent and didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to it. A few days of our stay housekeeping was in our room but nothing substantial seemed to have been done except the bed made and our toiletries randomly re-arranged on the counter, no refills of soaps or shampoos or folding or refreshing towels. A few of the other days, many things were done and little touches were added, such as, I found my loose change that I had left on the dresser all organized on a mat, stacked neatly in separate stacks by coin type. One day used food wrappers were cleared from the table, another day they were not. One morning a newspaper appeared at our door even though we were supposed to go to the shop to get the daily newspaper. No newspaper any other day. Turndown service was only provided on 2 of 5 nights. Some of the furniture and furnishings were showing signs of abuse and the hotel is only less than 2 years old, but that is unfortunately due to guest abuse. Upon check in our shower had long some long black hair by the drain and we hadn't used the shower yet and I don't have black hair. It makes me wonder how well the shower or other surfaces are actually cleaned and I feel there should be more attention to detail in a hotel of this caliber. I feel that if I had asked housekeeping to attend to certain issues, they would have responded, but there was nothing so bad and the room was awesome, so we moved on. Overall, despite some of the very minor things I\u2019ve commented on for the purpose of this review, Aria was truly a special experience and has so much to offer both within the hotel itself and throughout the City Center complex. I can\u2019t recommend it more highly and am eager to return someday on a future trip to Las Vegas!", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cAll around beautiful!!\u201d", "Author": "XxHollyxX", "ReviewID": "UR117667679", "Content": "Stayed at aria from August 20-23 and had a great experience.

After staying at the Wynn, Pallazzo, and Monte Carlo on previous trips to Vegas, we rank Aria among the best. Our package included 4 nights and free buffet for a very reasonable price. The buffet ranks with the Wynn and is far superior to most we've tried in Vegas and would consider going back for sure. The casino in Aria is large and dark and provided above average wins, which is why we spent a significant amount of time there. Drink service in the casino was steady and the ambiance was great, so we were never in a rush to leave. If you like high end shops, there's plenty available surrounding the casino area, just remember to bring your wallet! The architecture in Aria is a reason to visit this place on its own, as it features some of the most brilliant curves and designs we've ever seen.

Just look for wall switchs that operate several functions if you want things turned off or on. Beds were very comfortable although a little on the soft side. Bathroom was definitely tops. Overall the room and room service was excellent. The casino area downstairs was small by Vegas Standards but had all the latest slots. Very convenient to other hotels, shopping and restaurants in the City Center. My only recommendation would be to have taller bar stools in the Bar Moderbi. Being a tall person, my chin was still resting on the bar.

I would have thought that the hotel would have staffed up to meet the demand, but no- even a phone call to front desk took 12 minutes of waiting on hold. As other reviewers have said, the beds are very comfortable, and the rooms are very nice- clean, well stocked, and not scented with the vanilla fragrance that they push through the vents of the casino. The bath and shower are separated from the vanity area by a glass door, as is the toilet. Privacy is obtained by a sliding pocket door which was a nice touch. Towels are the big fluffy white ones. The room didn't have a microwave or a spare square inch in the bar fridge if you wanted to bring some personal refreshments into the room. A kettle or coffee maker would have been appreciated, but was not offered either. It's true- prices in Vegas, especially on the strip, have risen quite dramatically. A croissant and a small latte ran a $12 bill. Much more worth it to check out \"The Buffet\" for breakfast or brunch. $18.95 for breakfast, or $24.95 for the brunch/lunch buffet was better value- kept my friends and I satisfied a good 8 hours. I had one hiccup at the Aria- the night before my fiance was meeting me, I was taking a nap after a long day. It was around 7pm, and I was shaken from my rest by a loud banging on my door. I nearly jumped out of my skin. I went to the door in my bathrobe, to find 2 people from housekeeping at my door. They told me I had to check out \"now\", when actually, I was booked in the room from Saturday to Saturday, and it was only Tuesday. They did apologize, but I was really shaken, being nervous in my room alone. I called front desk to complain (there was the 12 minute wait! Don't have an emergency!) and was told they would investigate. When I went down, I decided to speak to someone in person. The manager on duty offered me a late check-out. I then asked to have a credit on my account, and she said she would investigate and get back to me. Within 20 minutes she called back to confirm a $75 credit on my account for the spa (which I later converted to a room credit since there is nothing at the spa for under $75) These \"comps\" were appreciated later.

Pros - very nice rooms overall with a modern feel - very comfy bed - very cool 'smart' rooms (the one touch command center) - very nice pool area (3 to choose from) - pretty central to the strip (the walk to the strip takes about 3 minutes) - food quality was very good at the buffet and the cafe that we tried - check-in/out (for us at least) was no problem Cons - the 'scented' air pumped into the casino was irriating to both of us (smelled like the old women's perfume 'Poison' from the 80's). Thankfully, it wasn't in the rooms. I get the oxygen pumping into the casino, but there is no need to scent it in my opinion (what do people with scent allergies/sensitivites do?) - overall food/drinks were very expensive (this seemed true all around Vegas). Again the quality was really good, but priced too high (trying to make up for gambling $$ being down??). For example, a very simple breakfast in the cafe (eggs, french toast and coffee/juice ran $50. That would be less than $25 at any high end restaurant. Also poolside drinks were crazy...$16 for a margarita in a beer cup? I can see $8, but not that much. - as others have said, the disco over at the Cosmopolitan was pretty loud, you heard the bass pumping all night. I am very surprised that the hotel can't get the city to clamp down on their sound levels that late at night (even if it is Vegas) - Like everyone else, the ' resort fee' is complete BS ($22.50 with tax per night). I shouldn't have to pay for Wi-FI at any hotel these days. I can see if they want to charge a maintenance fee if you decide to use the gym, then al least you only pay if you use it. If you are going to try and make some more money, just add the cost to the hotel rate.

The well thought-out public areas of the Aria, from the casino to the reception area that \u2013 up to ten people deep at every available position when I first walked in, not unlike a supermarket check out \u2013 manage to combine space and calm without losing buzz. Even the restaurant where we enjoyed the above-average brunch, was hushed rather than frenzied. Natural light and the soaring atriums of the two lobbies add to the openness of the place. Leaving by the spacious north lobby proved to be much closer to the guest rooms, and waits for cabs were also shorter. Even the basic rooms are good size and well-appointed. Furnishing are standard understated modern hotel, but comfortable. Bathrooms are spacious and I liked the bench in the shower, the separate toilet and the sliding door that his it all. Closet and dresser space is more than ample for two people. They pride themselves on their technology, but oddly it doesn't all work. The automatic curtain opening in the rooms is a nice touch, as is the good night button for switching everything off all at once.

The biggest technological failure however is that the bars and restaurants have to phone for approval before making a charge to a room or a card, causing unnecessary waits, unpleasant particularly in a hotel of this calibre. When dozens of people are waiting for the buffet, the process is painfully slow. We were asked to pay cash to expedite seating and were able to, but most people in line only had cards or rooms. There were some minor housekeeping issues, too. Glasses left outside a room across the hall from me were still there the next morning. An extra bed appeared outside my door a day before I checked out, and there it sat. Otherwise any actual contact with staff was professional and friendly. A note on the very good brunch: the unlimited \u201cchampagne\u201d is in fact just mediocre sparkling wine. Acceptable in a mimosa, but really not worth the trouble if you're drinking it alone.

Check in was smooth and quick and our suite was modern, spacious and mostly clean...mostly. Clumps of long red hair were in the shower drain and behind the toilet...sigh. This is a quick and easy fix for housekeeping and should not have been there. Consequently, I cleaned it up myself. The air conditioning was also a bit wonky. It could not keep up with the 105 degree temperature outside. At bed time (around midnight), it was still 82 degrees while we had set the thermostat to 70 degrees in hopes that it would cool off (we set it at 10 am, so there was more than enough time for the system to catch up...). The restaurants, while a tad expensive, were quite good (we sampled ALL of them during our stay!). Not one for buffets, I was highly impressed with the offerings on the three visits we made to the Aria, well, buffet! Now, to a small issue that I have noticed growing in Vegas: The smaller things are getting much more expensive. Breakfast at the coffee kiosk, which included yogurt, a muffin, hot chocolate and a latte cost $36.00 US. Seriously. That is uncalled for. A liter of water was $4.00. Again, I know times are tough, but this is beyond acceptable. I can afford the cost, but that left less for the gaming...... The gaming WAS good, BTW. I left UP, and that is always a positive. 'Nuff said. Now, the thing that really irritated me: We spent a day at the Aria spa. We had the normal massages, facials, etc. They were fantastic. The young lady who took care of me was particularly skillful, and explained all about my \"chakras\"....not my cup of tea, but interesting. In any event, the issue was the $200 extra charged to our room for the pleasure of hanging out and using the facilities. Now, I can understand the need to do this to a certain extent...however, considering there were well ove 40 guys on the men's side alone while I was there for my 2 hours, the cost seems a bit prohibitive. Charging me and my wife $100 each to use a crowded facility is just excessive. Not telling us up front was unacceptable..... Check out was...interesting. Apparently, there is not single line at the front desk that feeds to the various stations. What this means is that, depending on how fast the variety of Aria staff check guests out, multiple people may finish the process before you. It's like being at the supermarket. It's a crap shoot which line you choose....(this IS Vegas, after all) What is the bottom line? Would I stay here again? Not necessarily. It's certainly 3 star, with aspirations to be more. HOWEVER, charging four to five star prices before they reach that level will not inspire me to return anytime soon....sorry, Aria.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201c\"Very classy resort\"\u201d", "Author": "maugham", "ReviewID": "UR117195769", "Content": "I booked my rooms through Hotwire, where they were offering an unnamed 5 star hotel for about $100 a night.

It's part of the new CityCenter complex. However, at this point, the true city center on the strip is probably still around Bellagio/Venetian/Caesar's area. You can take a tram to Bellagio, so no big deal. As many have noted, the hotel is huge (it's Vegas) so it's just a lot of walking to most places. This is not a complaint because it's good to walk off all the eating. If your shopping budget allows, the Crystal shopping place is very convenient. However, I wish there's a tram to their MGM resort. It looks like it's just right across the street, but it's about a half an hour walk. Service: Check-in was professional. This was the SkySuite check-in area. We had to wait about 5 minutes, so that's fine. However, later that evening, the small area was packed. I would have been pretty upset if I have to wait over half an hour for check-in if I paid for premier check-in. The limo services (both ways) were good. Housekeeping is fine. Food: There are quite a few restaurant on the premise. Sage was excellent: beef tartare and oysters amazing, service was very good with exception of bartender (bored look); American Fish was good: brazino and flounder were nice, service was very good, sommelier helpful; Julian Serrano was very nice: most tapas items very good; brunch buffet was bad: below average quality for most items, desert was nice. If you have to do one Vegas buffet, I recommend choosing another casino. Gym/Pool: The gym was very nice, lots of new and complete equipment. Pool area looks like what you expect a new Vegas pool area to look like. The spa was ok. We were expecting more lux setup from Aria but it's definitely not in the Qua or Canyon Ranch league. Room: The skysuite was very nice. The section has a separate entrance from the main casino, so you do not have to drag your luggage through the casino. The room was modern and has all the requisite Vegas touches. Toto toilets with built in bidets are great - hope the trend continues to all US hotels. Overall a very nice property. I can see that if you expect a \"theme\" hotel a la Bellagio or Venetian, you will be let down. It's like Wynn, except a lot more minimalist.

The casino floor is clean and fresh. Most of the staff I came into contact with were friendly and helpful. Yes, the beds are fabulous. I had a meal that was possibly the very best I've ever had at Union restaurant. The hotel is very cutting-edge. Despite all that, unfortunately Aria didn'tt quite measure up, and i'll explain why. I was travelling solo, meeting my sisters in Las Vegas for our \"sisters getaway\". We decided on the Aria for our 3 night stay. Upon arrival on a Sunday afternoon, I pulled into the valet. The valet attendant took my keys, gave me my stub, and ran to the upcoming cars behind me. He didn't offer to unload my luggage. I slung my duffel bags over my shoulder and rolled my suitcase along to the entrance, struggling to open the door. Not a very good first impression. Check in - wait time was about 25 minutes - probably the longest i've waited to check in a hotel in Vegas. There was a staff member with an iPad that I thought was there to help speed things along, but he was basically just greeting everyone and answering questions while they waited. Odd. The girl at the reception desk was very pleasant. The connecting room I requested to mine was available early (1:45 P) so that was good. I entered my room and was not \"greeted\" with curtains opening, lights coming up and TV turning on. No big deal; everything worked fine in my sisters connecting room and they enjoyed the wow of the greeting. It is true that the hotel is set back from the strip. This only seemed to be an issue when trying to walk from the Cosmopolitan. There is no sidewalk, so you are pretty much forced to cab it - or walk up to the strip, then across, and back over to the Aria. (no quick jaunt) Walking to Bellagio wasn't bad at all via the connecting walkway. Day two - housekeeping made our beds - period. Trash wasn't emptied, toiletries and towels were not replaced, carpet wasn't vacuumed, nothing was tidied up. My sisters had a plate of leftover pizza from in-room dining the night before that was left behind. But... on the third day housekeeping was spot on perfect. I just didn't get it. Bellagio offers twice daily housekeeping service, and I missed that here. I ordered room service twice, and each time it took over an hour. The second time I ordered soup. Yes, over 1 hour. For soup. The server and I actually had a chat about that, and he informed me management has been inconsistent with training employees. Also possible understaffing. (You think?!?) I felt sorry for him, as it was by no fault of his. It was quite obvious to me there were MANY inconsistency issues in different areas of the hotel. I got the impression staff was having trouble keeping up with the average daily demands of a hotel of this size. Maybe it's something they'll be able to work out in the near future, but until then be advised... On a last note, upon departure I needed the assistance of 3 employees to find the North valet. It's too easy to get disoriented in a casino this huge. The valet service was just as bad as when I arrived. Again, no help loading my car - in fact, the valet attendant watched and chatted with the bell desk gal as I loaded up. That being said, giving credit where credit is due, one of the highlights of our trip was dining at Union restaurant. We had the filet mignon, and at $45, it was worth every penny - and then some! It was absolutely delicious. I would definitely visit the Aria for the restaurants and casino, but personally I would stay elsewhere next time. This isn't a bad hotel - just not up to par with what it touts itself to be.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo", "Title": "\u201cClean your the rooms\u201d", "Author": "LilySpring", "ReviewID": "UR117007190", "Content": "I have been coming to Las Vegas for a very long time and the \"Five Star Aria\" is not truly a five star quality in my book it is not a clean hotel.

We reserved the 2 bedroom sky suite. After many trips to Vegas over the years, Aria is now my favorite hotel, After a horrible travel experience with numerous flight delays (THANKS AIR CANADA) we arrived in the baggage claim at McCarran airport to find our limo driver waiting for us. He could not have been more professional and accomodating. He collected all our bags and ushered us to the awaiting stretch limo outside the baggage claim doors and wisked us away to the VIP entrance at Aria. On arrival we were lead to the Sky Suite check in where we were immediately checked in and offered cold drinks. We had requested a non smoking floor and two double beds in one of the bedrooms - both requested taken care of. i had called the Sky Suite concierge earlier in the afternoon as we would not be able to attend the evening performance of LOVE we had previously booked due to our numerous flight delays (THANKS AGAIN AIR CANADA) The concierge had taken care of everything, and we received a full refund for the 4 tickets we had purchased. We arrived in our Sky Suite and it could not have been more perfect. It was more spacious than I had imagined and spotlessly clean. the views from the floor to ceiling windows were great. There were flatscreen tvs in all the rooms, including bathrooms. Also had a dining table, sink, separate fridge from the mini bar and all the utensils required for making coktails. It was like having our own apartment. Previous reviews have discussed the room technology so i will not go into the details other than to say I had no difficulties working any of the features ( and I am not the most tech savy person) The suite contained a 2 piece bathroom and a huge ensuite bathroom with each bedroom that included a free standing jet tub and separate shower/ steam room and a private water closet with a heated toilet with bidet features.Every bath product that you can think of was provided including hairspray, dental kits, bath salts and razors. We love the entire hotel. The openess of all the public spaces, the unique architectural elements and the water features were all great. All of the staff we encountered were very professional and pleasant and could not do enough to assist. Even in the casino, all the employees were extremely freindly and eager to answer any questions. All of the restaurants we ate at were fabulous ( except the buffet, but I am not a buffet person) Julian Serrano for the tapas was our favorite, so much so we ate there twice. The pool area is also unique with four different pools and several large hot tubs all secluded by many palm trees, sculpture and flower gardens. You would never know you were in Las Vegas.

The check-in process was slow, due to their computer system (Aria management - please listen to what your customers are saying about this!) Our room was on the 15th floor (overlooking the Cosmo pool area) and had everything that we needed for comfort; large bathroom, comfy beds, ample storage for clothes, efficient A/C, bathrobes (which were a nice touch) and clean. The ventilation in the bathroom is horrible though (for shower steam). The housekeeping staff work very hard. Please remember to tip them! They will go the extra mile for you. We ate at Lemongrass (Thai restaurant at the Aria) and had a lovely meal. We celebrated a milestone birthday and enjoyed the food and champagne! The manager and our waiter were great. If you get the tasting menu, be prepared for a lot of food. We received VIP guest passess (like many ladies do), to Haze, which included free drinks until midnight (and no waiting in line). What a bizarre place. It was seriously like something out of the Twilight Zone. Aggressive bouncers, nowhere to sit (tables are bought at $ 550 plus tip) and there are VERY limited places to stand (or even to set your drink down). It because a joke to see how long it would take for a bouncer to come over and either ask us to move, or our drinks (one minute was about average). HORRIBLE dance floor, music and smoke. We lasted about 30 minutes. The place was full of posers trying to play the part. What a joke. We ended up for drinks at the Deuce. Very expensive but 2 for 1 drink tickets are freely distributed. Our waitress was very nice. The pool area is FABULOUS! Three pools to choose from (one being Liquid). Ample shade, umbrellas and loungers. Pool service was excellent. Drinks are very expensive (large diet coke is $ 11 plus tip). Welcome to Vegas! The cafe next to the pool was also nice. Food was okay but the service was excellent.

I was really skeptical having read numerous bad reviews from this site after booking the package through Bookit.com. I had only read the reviews from vacation booking sites which generally have only positive reviews. Anyway, I was pleasantly surpised and put at ease when I arrived (Monday morning). The bellman promptly opened my cab door and offered service. I was able to check in immediately to a room without having to wait until 3pm. I was in line behind two parties so my wait time from in line to desk was 8 minutes. I could see how it would be caotic if I had arrived during a very busy time. Part of the wait with each party is people asking questions! It took only a minute or so for the desk clerk to check me in so the problem is \"conversation\". The desk clerk was very friendly and made eye contact. I was aware of the $20 + tax/day resort fee prior to my arrival so I had no reason to argue (though I would have preferred not to pay it!). My room was very nice and spacious. i had a room on the 8th floor facing the pool and away from the \"nightclub side\" facing the Cosmopolitan. There was quite a bit of dust but I think it may be due to the air conditioning unit as I have this same problem at home. You can dust and it'll come right back! There were some \"marks\" on furniture from most likely the vacuum being pushed against the lower parts of the furniture. I didn't feel the furnishings were of the best quality but the room was nicely appointed. At least I didn't experience some of the things other reviewers wrote about: trash/food on floor, unemptied waste baskets, etc. My room was clean except for dust. Be sure to check your mini bar upon arrival. I found mine to be short a Coke and made sure I wasn't charged for it. As a matter of fact, the front desk was able to lock it while I was on the phone with them. I also made sure not to bump/touch any of the items on top as they are sensored as well. Since I had read about the recent outbreak of Legionnaires Disease there, I brought my own cleaning spray and sprayed down surfaces, etc. Insuring my own health was more important to me than relying on housekeeping to do what they are supposed to do. I used bottled water to brush my teeth and peroxide to disinfect the toothbrush after rinsing it with hot water from the sink. At no time did I risk ingesting the hotel tap water. Towels were quite rough though nice and thick. The electronics in the room sort of worked but worked enough for me to stay 4 nights. I felt the bed was too soft and kept moving to different spots during the night once I sunk in. I prefer hard mattresses and this was way too soft for me. I found the staff to be very friendly, speaking as you walked by. The only person I would complain about is one desk clerk that I asked about computers in the business center. Although he didn't speak rudely, I felt he was being a bit snide in telling me the kiosk beyond the bell desk adjacent to the casino had free internet (he said the business center did not have computers to use though the center was included in the resort fee!). Clearly they did not as you had to use a credit card to operate it! He seemed knowledgeable enough to to give me info regarding the kiosk so he should have known they weren't free! I wasn't trying to \"get over\", just trying to send an EM since my touch screen phone froze up and I needed to let someone know to call the room since my phone wasn't working. My package included free breakfast buffet every morning. Overall it was good but served the same thing everyday. But it was free and had no problems with it being charged to the room as some people did. They didn't even show it on the bill (make sure you show the promo card to the cashier). I ate at Lemongrass. After having spent two weeks in Thailand, this is not authentic Thai food. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. Find a restaurant off the strip if you want Thai food that bad during your stay. I really liked the connection between hotels and the Monte Carlo. There is a convenience store right outside so you don't have to go across the street. Overall, it was a very nice stay and beautiful property. The vanilla scent was nice in the casino to mask the cigarette smoke/odor. I would consider staying again as long as there are no health issues. I also think they should consider a \"pay as you go\" instead of the resort fee.

There is still a used bandage on the shower floor ( I noticed this when I was in the tub) - how disgusting.

Back to the nasty room - one of the glasses in the bathroom had the previous guests toothpaste dried on top of it and there was hair in the foyer and on the bathroom floor. Finally, one of the pillow cases had (what appeared) to be tiny blood spots on it. In all fairness, the young lady who was called in to refresh the place was disgusted at what she saw. Also, the housekeeping manager was also very apologetic. I was totally in shock and will definitely write a letter to management regarding this unsanitary room. With Aria being in the news lately, you would think that their housekeeping department would be on top of things. I hope this is brought to managements attention - the room was 24219 and the person who re-cleaned the room was a part of the evening crew.

From the moment we arrived in Aria, a sweet vanilla and berry aroma captures your senses; the hotel actually puts out a scent throughout the lobby area and entrances into the hotel which smell amazing, and it is calming at the same time! The rooms are incredible with remote controlled curtains, lights, room temperature, music and more! You can even control these options from your television, as there is a channel specifically designed to open your curtains ect. You can even set your alarm clock in the morning to automatically have the tv turn on and the curtains open. Like I said, this hotel is just amazing. We had the best stocked mini fridge, with everything you can think of from champaigne, wine, V8 juice, frappucinnos, water, m&m's, chocolate bars, gummy bears, peanuts, I can go on and on! The only catch there is beware what you touch for 30 seconds! All items are sensored and will be charged to your room once held for a period of seconds. Either way, still very convienient should you ever need anything! The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly. But as I mentioned, Aria hotel completes your vacation, after a long day of walking around Vegas because there is so much to see and do, you become so tired, and the beds in Aria were probably the best beds I have ever slept in and I have done quite a bit of travelling. If anyone has ever stayed in the Sheraton hotel with their new sleeper comfy beds, which are great, these beds are 20x better! You just have to see for yourself! The food within the hotel is pretty good, the buffet for lunch for $19.95 was excellent! I enjoyed the variety of food offered. There is also a great bakery place right outside the elevators to all the main hotel rooms and they also serve excellent pasteries, cakes, and breakfast paninis! Of course if you are looking to save money, there are a number of places with cheaper options, even in some other hotels you would be surprised once you actually look around! The casino is great in Aria and probably my favorite out of most of them simply because of the layout. Vegas casinos are huge, but somehow in Aria the way it is layed out it makes it easier to find others and I really love the modern decor throughout the casino and hotel! When you are playing, the girls will come around and offer drinks which are free in the casino as you play. I noticed in all other casinos, such as Bellagio, Caesers, Monte Carlo, and MGM being the worst for that, the girls were never around offering drinks, where as at Aria, as soon as you take a seat there they were! As well, the most important thing about Aria hotel is it location! Location, location, location is key in las vegas!!! By staying in Aria hotel, you are only a free tram ride away to Bellagio, which is then close to Caesers and Vdara. You are a walk away to Monte Carlo, or if you head the other direction about 10 mins walk to New York New York and MGM. Based on the location, even if my experience was terrible which it wasn't, I would stay in Aria again due to its location.

Easy access to Vdara, hotel with condo style living, inside bridge access (thru Vdara across the street from Aria) to Bellagio. Beautiful architecture, pool grounds are nice and fantastic pool parties, variety of restaurants and excellent breakfast and lunch buffets. Liquid pool is where the pool parties happen in Aria. Wednesdays are less crowded and a little cheaper to rent the beds or lounges, etc. Thursdays are Industry days - resident DJ plays and sounds are fantastic & Thursday nights is Industry night at Haze nightclub in Aria - fantastic DJs. I have celebrated in July, August, New Years and it has all been fantastic - ladies are free before 12am and guys have a cover charge of $20. The queen rooms at Aria are great but the bedding is OK, in my opinion - nice colors and all but, I found the King room bedding softer and the rooms at Vdara had more comfortable bedding. Great cupboards to store your belongings - plenty of hangers. The room is \"techified\" but you can get used to it - no extractor fan in the toilet, nice bathroom. When you go to Las Vegas - if you like to dance/ club - there are different venues on different nights that are great. Mondays - Marquee at Cosmopolitian/The Bank at Bellagio Tuesdays - Pure at Caesars Wednesday - Surender at Encore (beautiful hotel) Thursdays - Haze at Aria Fridays - various nightclubs in hotels - check with local promoters -they are walking everywhere in Vegas. Walk around and through the hotels - they are great. For soft drinks, ask the cabbie to stop at a gas station very reasonably priced - drinks, snacks, etc. There is also an ABC store in Miracle Mile shopping center - walking distance from Aria and across from Bellagio - they sell alcohol and a whole lot more We went to see the Lion King - all adults - great show bu,t we think it was a bit long - so not for children personally, who are too young & they should have patience - approx. total of 2 hours and 15 minutes including intermission. Aria concierge was very helpful and go to them to print your boarding passes and check in for flights before you leave - you now are airlines can bump you these days. Enjoy Las Vegas - 3 nights is enough but, you can do 1 more night if wished. Have a drink on me when you visit.

Cons: - VERY long checkin time (to be fair, I noticed most of the other vegas hotels have this problem too). The checkin lines are relatively small but it takes ~10 mins to checkin every guest.

The hotel is technically on the strip but it is a non-trivial amount of walk from the strip to the lobby.

Since Aria is rated as a five-star resort (AAA), we wondered how it ranked compared to the other biggies on the strip (i.e. Wynn, Bellagio, Venetian). Overall, we were very pleased and think it's made tangible improvements over some of the reviews we read before our stay. Pros: - Aria is beautiful. Well designed casino and restaurants plus an immaculate pool and gym. - Service is a plus. Since we had resort credits through our booking, we had to get a manager to help at the front desk. We met Patrick who was incredibly helpful and responsive. We also ate at Sage, a truly delectable and service-driven experience. Unlike other reviews, check-in and check-out were also efficient. - The rooms are great. As others have written, the technology is well-above other hotels and the interface is very intuitive. Plus a very comfortable bed makes these rooms a great place to escape. - Wifi is included (with mandatory resort fee). The signal is strong and fast everywhere we went on resort. Cons: - While on the strip, Aria is set further back than most hotels. This creates a bit of extra walking, but the free monorail was great and you never encounter the crowds like the center strip resorts. - The prices reflect the hotel's status, so don't expect to stay/eat cheaply. While several of Aria's restaurants deserve their rave reviews, the buffet doesn't measure up to other hotels. - Resort fees. They're a staple for MGM resorts, but I never like to see them. Can't they just add this to hotel price? We would certainly return to Aria and think the hotel will mature into a true competitor with other greats on the strip.

During the call we were told the fridge isn't really a fridge and it is just insulated cool not refrigerated cold so we asked for a fridge and they brought it up real fast. I'm pretty sure that anyone that stays at Aria will have a nice time (if they can avoid the extra charges) but I do have a few nit picky observations I would like to share for those of you who care about the details: I thought the hotel portion of the resort had a lot of unresolved minor repair issues for such a new building. For example, the baseboards in the room were very marked up, the framed picture had an obvious blemish, the touchscreen (master control for room) had a big nick/ding on one corner, and the wall paper and wooden paneling in the hallway (8th floor) had many nicks. I just felt like they aren't planning on taking on the cost of minor maintenance issues in such a new building and it shows. Regarding the technology, it seems like a good idea but I didn't feel like they pulled it off well. The controls are fairly user friendly but those that are technically challenged might struggle. The TV stopped working as soon as we arrived. The staff member who brought the fridge couldn't get it to work but told us he would send a technician up. An hour later we had to call the desk and ask for assistance. Eventually it was fixed. On day two, we had the privacy switch on (shows a red privacy light outside the room for staff) but house keeping still called to ask if we wanted to have the room cleaned which was fine but we said no and a little while later someone entered without knocking so why did they bother to call? While walking the halls I witnessed house keeping knocking and announcing through the door but this person just walked in on us. She then put an old school privacy sign on the door handle despite the advanced privacy light which was working so they don't even trust their own technology (or the guest's ability to use it properly). The TV remote was really mundane and the system wasn't very responsive to the buttons (there was usually a delay) for a room that was supposed to be technologically advanced.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel but the temperature in the casino is fr..fre..freeeeeezing\u201d", "Author": "Traveler_McGee", "ReviewID": "UR116438800", "Content": "The only thing I can say bad about the Aria is the casino was so cold, I brough the coverlet from our bed down to the tables to drape over our laps and legs.

When we first complained to the pool waitress who brought us the drink, she said she was sorry but that nothing could be done as it was just a misprint on the menu.

I will say that the view and architecture of the Aria is beautiful but customer service was some of the worst I have seen recently. My husband and I went to sleep but early but about 12am we both realized that the room was slightly warm even though we had the temp set on 70. About 1:30 am we both woke up and both said how warm it still felt so we lowered it to about 68. By 3am we both knew it was not going to get better. From there on it was basically just small naps till our wake up time of 6am. Our bellman came for our bags about 10am and asked if our stay was enjoyable which we explained that it was not because of the temp in our room. He said to make sure we spoke to the front desk concerning that. When we did speak to them a few minutes later we got nothing more than \u201cIm sorry but you should have called so we could have sent a technician to your room.\u201d My husband then explained that it would not have helped us by 3am to call and have someone come to our room as we would have gotten even less sleep. That got us nowhere. While my husband tried calmly to reason with them I began to notice two other couples becoming very frustrated with two different ladies at the checkout area. I am very disappointed in this outwardly beautiful hotel with the extremely poor customer service! Before the Aria we stayed at the Venetian and were so pleased by excellent service from the entire staff. Although we had no issues with the Venetian I did over hear one couple and another individual that was not happy with certain things during their stay and the front desk immediately responded with \u201cI will take care of that right away.\u201d You could see right away that they had a customer for life!

There was no line for check in, and imagibe my delight when I learned we were upgraded to a SkySuite. It was jaw dropping amazing - a huge apartment with floor to ceiling windows, 2 bathrooms, foyer, living room/office, kitchen/bar and dining room, and huge master bath with a walk in closet. The toilet even had a full panel of options next to it including front and rear cleansing and drying with an optional oscillator. And yes, this was a toilet and not a bidet. The suite amentities included compliementary breakfast pastries/fruit/coffee, and wine/cheese and cookies and bottled water. It was a luxurious experience and the rest of the property did not dissapoint. We spent a day at the spa and i enjoyed my massage, plus taking advantage of the sauna, steam room and whirlpool. They offered delicious herbal teas and snacks. Plus, there was an outdoor whirlpool for the spa which overlooked Liquid, the high energy pool club so you could watch the fun without actually being in the action - it was very \"MTV Spring Break\". The main pool areas were beautiful and calm - several mid size pools allowed for zero crowding and lots of privacy, plus there were a few hidden hot tubs. The chairs, tables and umbrellas were plentiful and comfortable and beverage service was frequent. We had a great tapas meal at Julian Serrano - service was incredible and the sangria (both white and red) delicious.We also enjoyed pastries at the patisserie on site and gelato to die for. We had breakfast one day at the cafe at Vdara, a non-gaming property adjacent to Aria. The fitness center was large and very well equipped, with windows looking out onto the pool area, providing cold towels, bottled water and fresh fruit. The location was perfect - not too far from anything. It was easy to cut through the Crystals Mall to get to the strip and a short walk to Bellaggio, Paris, or other main hotels. While in Vegas, we saw Jersey Boys at the Venetian (really fun!) and ate at many celebrity chef restraurants, the highlight of which was the tasting menu at Craftsteak - with wine pairings - a phenomenal event not to be missed. I can't wait to go back for another relaxing vacation and I will definitely stay at the Aria again. I have no idea why we were upgraded - perhaps it was because it was mid-week stay during the summer, perhaps it was because I signed up for MLife to get a good deal on the rate - but even if we were in a standard room I would happily return in an instant.

We debated quite some time before settling on this property. We had both been to Vegas many times and decided to try something new. We couldn' t have been more pleased with our decision. The rooms, casino, restaurants, shops (I could go on and on) were top notch. Our room faced behind the strip and had a beautiful view. The room is basically controlled by one controller (about the size of an Ipad) that controls the tv, thermostat, window shade, alarm and lights. I guess the only downside to our room was the bed. It was so comfortable that when we got home we couldn't sleep on our old bed any longer and had to buy a new one. As far as the casino the dealers were all very friendly and willing to give advice if you asked for it. The casino didn't smell like smoke like a lot of other ones it actually had a vanilla smell that was very nice. I never had a problem gettting on a blackjack or craps table. There were always plenty of available slots to choose from as well. We ate at several of the local shops/restaurants and were never disappointed. The SkyBar was very good and \"vegas affordable\". It is a short walk to the Monte Carlo's food court if you are looking for something on the cheaper side. As far as entertainment goes we had a great night our last night in town thanks to the concierge at the Aria. I went down to talk to her when my wife was resting in the room and said I would like to take my wife to dinner and a show that night to celebrate our anniversary that had actually occured several months prior. I explained that I work in an industry that doesn't allow us to do much for our anniversary due to me being so busy. She got us a reservation at Jean Georges Steak House (at the Aria) and discounted tickets to Viva Elvis (also at the Aria). Our dinner was amazing. The staff was beyond helpful and even gave us a free desert for our anniversary which we had not even mentioned. Many dollars lighter in the pocket and pounds heavier in the belly we headed for our show. Once there we were again upgraded to a better seat. We loved the show and I am not even a huge Elvis fan.

No detail has been spared on every aspect of this beautiful hotel. I found myself randomly reaching out to touch a wall, a pillar, an upholstered surface, just to see what material was used to make it as spectacular as it is. The rooms are amazing, even the basic deluxe will wow you. Upon entering your room, you will be greeted by the blackout drapes gliding open to reveal (in our case) a view of the pool, the Tv will come on, the lights will turn on and the AC will start. All of these features are controlled from a single control panel box by the bed, very handy, no more searching in the bedsheets for the TV remote or having to get up in the middle of the night to crank the AC when you underestimate the Vegas heat. You can even push a button by the bed entitled \"Goodnight\" which will slowly dim the lights to off in the room after you have crawled under the covers. This is a handy feature for childish people like my spouse and I who find it funny to shut all the room lights off when someone is busy brushing their teeth in the bathroom when they are least expecting it. The concierge is very helpful, and thankfully there were usually at least 3 of them behind the desk most of the time when we were there, although there was usually still a line-up. Even while waiting in line, there is a person who just stands there waiting to ask everyone in line if they can help them with something or answer a question to hopefully prevent you from having to stay in line. This happened when we were waiting in the concierge line to print our boarding passes and were directed to an open kiosk nobody knew about. There was a long line-up to check out Sunday am, but every spot at the desk was staffed so this was just a result of so many people being at this fantastic hotel. It is worth a line-up, nobody was even mad that they had to wait in line because there was ample service available. My only criticism would be that some of the \"guards\" at the guest elevators were not so friendly, but this tended to be the exception to the rule.

The room \"greeted\" us by automatically opening the curtains and playing music from the 42inch plasma tv...very special! The room was perfectly presented and spotlessly clean. Bed and linens very comfortable. Bathroom had a spa feel to it with marble twin sinks and seperate shower and soaking bath. Everything down to the smallest detail was of the highest quality. The room can be easily controlled from a tablet at the bedside and via the tv allowing guests to open/close curtains, alter temperature of room and request privacy or housekeeping when required. Room service was reasonably priced, presented well and delivered promptly. There are many restaurants within the resort and range from the expensive to the reasonably priced therefore catering for many. Swimming pool areas are clean and well presented with lots of loungers available. Aria Casino is clean and smoke free with lots on offer catering for all types of gambler ranging frtom $1 slots to high roller rooms. Aria is located within the City Centre complex and the Strip can be easily, and relatively quickly reached via the free tram which will take you to either Crystals shopping centre, Monte Carlo or The Bellagio.

The room was very fancy and more importantly very clean. granite counter tops everywhere, marble all over the bathroom. The bed was very fluffy & comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud. The high tech tablet in the room was easy to use.

I just turned the a/c fan on high and you won't here any noise from outside :-) We went to the buffet for breakfast, and it was great. Huge selection of food, something for everyone... We are slot machine people, and I did not expect to win anything at Aria (because it is a high end resort/casino) but i won 500$ there, very good casino. We went to Harrah's casino and they didn't give us anything... Aria is in a good location, in the middle of the strip. The only negative thing I can think of was on our second night stay the housekeeper forgot to give us soap/shampoo, so i contacted customer service and within 2 minutes it arrived and fixed the issue.

We headed up to our room and we when we entered our room we were blown away. We were on the 23rd floor and the view was amazing. The room was very clean and modern. As I was putting our things away I noticed our bathroom didn't have a hairdryer. I called down to the front desk and the lady was very helpful, she had me look in a couple of different places to ensure I just wasn't missing it. When there was no hairdryer to be found she sincerely apologized and said one would be right up. 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door and I was greeted by name with a hairdryer on a tray. This is just the first in a long list of Excellent Service. Let's talk the bed...Hands down the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on while on vacation in any hotel. You didn't want to get out of it in the morning! The hotel itself is pure beauty. You notice all the lines of the designs, the different textures, the smell, everything is top notch from the linens to the customer service. The casino was fabulous and clean. All of the dealers were amazing along with the pit bosses. It was late in the day one evening and we were looking for a $10 blackjack table and all were full. We asked the pit boss if there were any others in case we missed a table and there was not so he allowed us to sit at an empty $15 table and play for $10. I was very impressed! Even after the table started filling up I was allowed to continue to play $10. Food..Everywhere we ate was amazing. We hit up the buffet one afternoon and everything I put on my plate was delicious. I was sad when I became full because the food was so good. We also ate at Sirio for dinner one evening. It is the Taste of Tuscany. I picked a Ravioli dish and I have to say it was the best Italian pasta I have ever had. It was divine, along with the service and atmosphere. The Aria is connected via tram (which is free) to the Monte Carlo (which you can just walk to), Bellagio, Crystals and Vdara. We took the tram many times back and forth to the Bellagio. Excellent. When ever we left to explore other casinos on the strip we couldn't wait to get back to \"our home\" for the week because no other casino/hotel compared. My overall review of the Aria is it is absolutely amazing and we cannot wait to return. This was our 2nd trip to Vegas, the first being 5 years ago and we stayed at the Venetian. Before our trip this time was over we were already making plans to come back to the Aria and hoping to make it an every 6 month trip. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

There weren't any upgrades available at check-in. My friend has a breathing machine, and there are no electrical outlets except two at the desk. We had to get two extension cords to plug in her machine and reach the bed - very poor engineering/planning. Would have preferred electrical outlets on the nightstand to all the fancy lighting controls. Next, the first night we left a few small cash tickets and our unused drink coupons on the dresser. They were gone the next morning. Maybe housekeeping thought they were a tip? I never tip till the last day, and I've never had anything taken like that. Next, the last night I went to check out so we could avoid the lines the next morning. There was $80 worth of mini-bar charges on my bill that I had to argue to get removed (housekeeping?). A couple walked up next to me. They had just been checked in and when they got to their room, someone was sleeping in the bed.

I had booked this with Low Cost Usa for a good price which INCLUDED the resort fee so I was a happy bunny! I checked in about 10am on a Sunday morning and was able to get to my room right away. However the room had not been cleaned properly so back down to Reception I go and this time they \"upgraded\" me to a City View room. I am glad that I did not pay for this upgrade as all you could see was the side of the Monte Carlo and a bit of MGM Grand opposite. Room was lovely, fab bathroom with large shower and tub combo, plenty of storage space, lovely flat screen tv with plenty of channels available and without a doubt the best bed I have ever slept in. If I could have flown home with it I would!!!! Maid service was spot-on every day, leaving me plenty of extra soap, shampoo etc etc. I did leave a daily tip though as I think those ladies work damn hard. All the staff I encountered were friendly, and I had great service from the cocktail waitress on the casino floor. Plenty of 1c and 2c slots to choose from and I had a great time trying them all out. Lots of luck on American Idol and Sex and the City games though. Dorothy obviously has no time for the Welsh as she hated me each and every time. Pool was lovely with plenty of chairs available both in the sun and shade. Very tasty (and pricey) cocktails were consumed but what the heck....its Vegas. Music is played around the pool but it was at a decent volume and did not disturb me. Saw Viva Elvis whilst I was there and so enjoyed it. It was my first Cirque show so had no idea what to expect, but the acrobats and the dance sequences were fab!! The only negative I had with Aria was the location. I did know where Aria was but did not realise it was set so far back from The Strip. They did not make it easy for you to just leave the hotel and pop accross to another. Trying to get accross to PH for example was a nightmare. The tram to Bellagio was useful, but a bit of a walk. Having come from the Flamingo when you just fall out of the hotel onto the strip, this was a bit of a shock. Overall, a lovely hotel with great rooms and service.

No matter where we wanted to go, we always felt like we were very close already. The rooms were extremely comfortable and very well appointed...all the way down to the higher thread count sheets and the automatic drapes. The architectural openness of the lobby and main floor don't give you that \"cramped\" feeling that so many of the other casinos do. The air never weighed heavy with smoke; as a matter of fact-it held an essence of vanilla. We dined at Cafe Vetto for breakfast and enjoyed the Italian delights at Sirio for dinner one evening--both were very nice. Without a doubt, the pool area at Aria was a change of pace from the typical big pool scenes in Vegas, as it is comprised by 3 pools that are cleverly hidden from each other with well placed plants and shrubs. This creates a bit more of a secluded feeling, even though the atmosphere was very active. The service staff seemed to sense when we were out of our room, as it was always refreshed upon our arrivals throughout the day.

THE BUFFET restaurant: Lamb had gamey taste, almost like spoiled meat. Alaskan King Crab Leg wasn't fresh. Prime Rib of Beef was not tender. I paid $35-40 per person for the buffet. This is considered cheap in the hospitality industry. High End buffets typically cost $60-$65 per person. Corner Suite: Brochure mentions room was 920 sq. ft. Suite looked nothing like the photo on their brochure. Room seemed small. Did not use their fancy remote that controls the entire room. Easy to use, but the touch screen made it difficult.

A few minor issues aren't worth removing a star for.\u201d", "Author": "Jeff D", "ReviewID": "UR115797435", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here in July with a few friends who had just gotten engaged. The grounds are very nice pulling up in the taxi with some pretty cool art and water features on Aria and City Center grounds. When I first walked in I loved the design and chocolaty decor of lobby, checkin desk, etc. as well as the tall ceilings and very open feel. I was immediately put off however by the extremely heavy vanilla scent they were pumping into the place. Don't get me wrong, I don't really have a problem with adding scent to a hotel like this in order to give it a memorable identity (all the big hotels and resorts do it) but I really have a problem with vanilla. For one, vanilla is a fine line because a lot of people like it, but a lot of people (like me) hate it. Not only that, but it is really overdone and could be severely scaled back and still be quite noticeable. The good news is once you get into the casino area the ventilation really mutes the smell and by the time you are in the room areas up the elevators is is almost non-existent. The staff at checking was extremely nice, so all these reviews about terrible staff are surprising to me. I guess it depends who you deal with. Every single housekeeping, bell, and other staff member literally asked my if I was enjoying my stay for 4 days straight. I found them to be quite welcoming. The rooms are awesome. Upon entering the first time the curtains, lights, etc. all activate automatically via the central control panel. It controls everything in the room including AV, temp lighting, etc. and is very easy to use. The bed had a ridiculous pillow top built in and was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in in my life. The pillows were also great and large. One thing I thought was unique was that our friends' room down the hall was the same layout, but the art, wallpaper, and color schemes were different. That's pretty nice attention to detail to give everyone a unique experience. Housekeeping was very good. They roam the halls almost 24/7 and respect the privacy indicator on the door panel. When we set it to \"Service\" mode, our room was cleaned and refilled while we were out at dinner. No problems at all. We had a view of the main entrance and the driveway out to the strip (Aria is just a small walk off of the actual strip). The view during the day was fine, but at night it was great when everything was lit up. Our room seemed to be a very long distance from the elevators. This is kind of annoying when you're trying to get up and down all day, but actually helpful when trying to go to sleep at 5AM when you get home drunk from the clubs. I didn't go to Aria's nightclub (HAZE) but I would like to next time. The hotel is in a great spot in relation to everything. It is removed from the strip by a small distance (easily walkable in about 10 minutes) but obviously close enough for most people not to care. It is connected to the ultra high-end Crystals mall where I can't afford to buy anything, with stores like Prada, Gucci, Miu Miu, Balenciaga, and other stuff like that, and a complete indoor walk all the way over to Cosmopolitan, then you are at the strip. The casino is very nice, and does not appear to be the focal point of the hotel, which is good. That's not to say it is small or anything, but the layout is actually navigable (unlike most hotels) and the high ceilings and \"airy\"ness of the whole place makes it very a comfortable atmosphere. It makes you feel like you can stay there for a long time without itching to get out, which I'm sure was the goal. We didn't eat at a ton of the restaurants in this hotel. The Cafe Vettro has great food but if it is busy be ready to wait a while for the food. The little breakfast, lunch, and quick food nooks are great and easy to find. The three main pools are very nice. They were crowded on Saturday, but actually not too crowded to enjoy yourself as you would expect. They also have an adult pool lounge called Liquid, which is actually a \"day club\" if you will. We had intended on going there, but never got around to it. There are people passing around cards to anyone that looks like they might fit in there, but it does have cover all the time for guys, and ladies get in free with one of the discount cards. I wish I would have tried it but we ran out of time. We also walked through the Spa area, which looked and smelled very nice and relaxing (and quiet, amazingly) but did not have time to try any services. Overall, I thought it was a great hotel. I would most definitely stay there again, if only there weren't so many other damn hotels that I wanted to try. The few negatives (elevator distance, vanilla smell) are not enough for me to remove stars from my review. If you are ultra-sensitive to artificial scents however, watch out. I would recommend this to anyone who is used to staying at normal-class Vegas hotels like TI, MGM, etc. or even middle-upper scale hotels because it will be a great and enjoyable upgrade. I have stayed at Bellagio and Venetian and ARIA compares favorably or better than either of the normal rooms I stayed in in those hotels, but that could be because it's still very new.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWOW!!!\u201d", "Author": "YR18", "ReviewID": "UR115775580", "Content": "ive never written a review about a hotel before (or anything at all for that matter :) but i had to give credit when it is due. so here goes: Location: in the heart of the new city centre, between the new and stunning cosmopolitan and Vdara. youll walk for maybe 2 minutes out of the hotel and you will be at the very heart of the strip. location is AAA!

Rooms: SUPER CLEAN!!! the hotel is brand new, so the rooms are very modern. huge 42 inch flat screen on the wall with a remote that controls everything in the room: lights, blinds, alarm clock and ofcourse, the TV. very user friendly too. The bathroom has double sinks, a large oval tub, a stand up shower and an enclosed toilet. Lots of closet space, floor to ceiling windows and very comfy beds. There is a fridge in the room but it is fully stocked and all the good are on sensors. The hotel charges you for anything you take out of the fridge, weather you used it or not. If you need an empty fridge in the room, they will gladly send one to you room for $25/night. If you require a fridge to store any kind of medicine in it, the hotel will provide you with the fridge at no charge. Casino: this place is awsome. Yes, they happen to take your money, but the atmosphere is great. Its beautiful, and there is not the slightest scent of smoke (and i hate cigarette smell). They probably use fabreze on steroids to keep it smelling that good, but it works! Room Service: Very fast. we ordered room service several time and the wait was never longer then 20 mins for food, less then 10 minutes for towels. The fridge we ordered to our room upon check in, got there about 2 minutes after we made it to the room. Front desk access: never had to wait to speak to someone. Everyone was readily available. Check out: over the phone. very easy. you can actually pull up your final bill on the TV in your room. Hotel amenities: Pools: 2 types. There is Liquid, which is a closed off party pool for adults over 21. Great music playing, great parties, very fun atmosphere. you pay $100/lounge chair but you get $100 credit for food and drinks while youre there. you actually dont have to pay anything if you dont need a lounge chair, but youre gonna want to relax and have a drink and some food anyway, so why not treat yourself? We had an absolutely amazing time there! you must go! The other pools are the general pools, typical 5 star vegas hotel pools. shallow water, mix of different people, young, old, kids, etc. these pools are beautiful as well and are great if you just wanna relax and soak up the sun. cold water fountains are available around the pools as well. Gym - Huge, stocked with everything that you need and more. Buffet - Delicious food, and lots of it. you actually dont feel like your in a buffet. it feels more like youre at a great restaurant and the food just happens to be served buffet style. Other resto's were very good as well, try the cafe for good food served quickly as well. General comments: - hotel is beautiful but huge! youll find that you have to walk about 10 mins from your room to the pool. not a big deal though, as you will be passing by different stores, restaurants, etc. - hotel security will require you to show them your room key anytime you go to your room. its kind of annoying cause you have to fidget and find it, but it shows you that the hotel does not compromise on their guests security. only hotel guests can get up to the room. They can bring anyone they want with them though. - wait for cabs is very short. the hotel will have one ready for you anytime of day or night. - hotel is meticulously maintained. constantly being cleaned, flower arrangements are change frequently, etc. This is a definite 5 star hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend ARIA to anyone looking for a top of the line vegas hotel. Keep in mind, our group of 8 guys are not high rollers by any means. We were there for a bachelor party, hence, we werent the easiest group to deal with, but the hotel was extremely accommodating.

We did not have enough time to use the Spa & Salon - it was very pricey but all massages and facials sounded very tempting! The buffet had a great price for an all day breakfast but had very long lines and wouldn't have been worth the price with us only eating 1/3 of the value. The Jean Phillippe Patisserie near the main casino was excellent! I recommend. Beautiful pastries, great yoghurt parfait and if only we could have fitted in the dessert crepe! Chocolate truffles also very nice as well. We didn't really dine at the Aria and seemed to enjoy exploring the strip and other eateries instead but the menu's at some of the tapas bars looked devine!

The washrooms are well designed to accommodate multiple people at once \u2013 one using the washroom, one showering etc\u2026 while still maintaining privacy. Beds were unbelievably comfortable. The pool side service and pool itself were also amazing and the servers were so friendly and really looked after us. Hotel food was great with plenty of variety and by hotel standards and even Vegas standards, didn\u2019t seem outrageous. You are in Vegas afterall, so things tend to be on the pricey side, but we didn\u2019t find it outrageous at all. We also liked that you could charge meals and drinks at other MGM hotels to your room. We dined at the Bellagio and just signed it to our room. Breakfast buffet, which was included int he cost of our room, was also amazing and so much variety. Checkin was fine and quick, though the person who took care of us lacked some attention to deal and kept having to ask over & over for spelling of our names, despite having our passports right in front of her. The Ugly \u2013 Turns out the room we were assigned hadn\u2019t been turned over from the previous guests and there were food bits all over the sheets. We couldn\u2019t be bothered to move rooms, so they just came up to clean the rooms and we all moved on with our vacation. On our second day, we noticed a discarded condom wrapper on the side of one of our beds. My friend and I know both that wasn\u2019t our party! Gross to say the least. Lastly, the clincher, we just received a letter that the hotel had an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease. Apparently limited risk, but still. The Bad \u2013 Customer service. This is where Aria really falls short and shows just what a young and inexperienced hotel they truly are. To even get a hold of someone in customer service was a challenge and once we did, they were very unsympathetic and didn\u2019t seem bothered by any of our concerns. For our condom wrapper troubles, they offered to credit the room tab $50. When we went to check out and view our charges, we noticed the credit had not been applied from the previous day. Again, we went through the process of chasing someone and long story short, resulted in a further $50 credit.

When we got to the room there were some noticeable misses. Trust me, I'm not picky either. Housekeeping missed alot. Hair on the bathroom floor, not vacuumed, very obvious, burnt match and Kleenex on the floor (smoking room, I smoke) huge greasy hand prints on the floor to ceiling window ( cleaned it myself so we could enjoy the view), and most of all the furniture looked as it hadn\u2019t been dusted in a while. The furniture is all black so it's extremely noticeable. I bragged about this hotel stay to my girl heavily, so I was a bit embarrassed.. It just looked like housekeeping rushed to get it clean.

Had so much fun playing with it I accidently killed the lights while my lady was showering.. It was funny.. So I have to say our stay was delightful!! 5 gold stars for the terrific bed! Couple of more heads ups. Food is WAY overpriced. I only ate at the property once so I cannot speak to the restaurant/food quality. I will say this though, after a long night we came back to the room. I ordered a cheese burger fries and a chocolate milk... $30.00 and very mediocre at best. I swear on this, 1 1/2 hrs to get delivery! You would think that after 20yrs these mega resorts would have fixed this little glitch.

Taxi to casino was quick, and first impression of exterior of casino and front desk was classy, architectural and welcoming. The vanilla scent (which I feared when reading other reviews) was actually really good and inviting and negated almost all of the smoke. The front desk was not too busy but I did notice it was essentially a free for all (not one line but many - and pick your poison) but there was a staffer waving people to open spots, so I was seen within 5 minutes. Girl helping me was nice enough - got us adjoining rooms and a roll away for free (usually 35/night) - but would not give us the city view as that would be 15/extra per night and I refuse to pay upcharges for what I know can be free. She said the rooms she had for us were not clean and it might be a couple hours (it is now 1:30). Since our group was hungry we were hopeful we could have a leisurely lunch and then get up to our room. I gave the girl my cell and she would text me when rooms were ready. We checked our bags and explored our options. The Aria is connected directly to the Crystals shopping center which is almost more of a clothing museum than a mall - only the highest end shops and beautiful architecture within - and we ate at the DELICIOUS Todd English's P.U.B. A bit pricy but dang good. I made the mistake of ordering the Bloody Mary which did not sit well with me. Nevertheless, it is now 3:45 and I have no text for our room. We swing back to the casino and my girls get their game on while I investigate our room sitch. Since we have adjoining rooms we would take even one if it was available, and we find out one of the two is ready although the desk agent looked unsure. We were happy to even have the one for the time being (desperate to get to the pool) and head to the 21st floor...not bad, right?! Wrong. I open the door and get HAMMERED by freshly smoked marijuana. Seriously, we were in the room for 5 minutes and I swear I was getting high from the fumes. Frankly I'm surprised housekeeping approved the room. I immediately called the front desk and told them this would not work. (It's now 4:30) The desk agent was nice and moved us to the 18th floor, city view for no upcharge (see I told you), and my keycard would magically switch over to that room. We gladly made our way to 18 but my room key did not convert as I was led to believe. I'm kinda getting irritated (the front desk is a bit of a hike) and walk back to the front desk. Luckily another agent is able to give me proper keys to both rooms while my girls are back waiting outside the door. We finally get in our room (now after 5pm) and are pleased with the view, space and cleanliness. This is what we were hoping for, yay! I did note that the doors adjoining our room DO block the A/C vents when open, but I just kept the adjoining doors off the vents at night or when we left the room. The room technology (remote/shades/TV/etc.) worked fine as noted in other reviews but weren't really all the mind boggling to me. Nice touch but nothing that innovative (it is 2011). We quickly dashed to the pools for about an hour and a half and were very impressed at the cleanliness, service and atmosphere. Very peaceful, plenty of places to sit and swim, cute and friendly waitresses, etc. We never went to the shi-shi pool Liquid because it cost to get in and we were very happy with the main pools. Big moneysaving piece of advice #1: Get one of the 32 ounce drinks (be ready for sticker shock: 10 for a soda or 20+ for an alco-drink) so you can GET THE CUP. Then, send a friend to CVS down the street and buy your normally priced liquids (alcohol, mixers, etc.) to keep in the room. Then, when you go down to the pool, you can premake your drinks in the room and save literally hundreds of dollars. You can't bring a cooler to the pool but you can bring your fat drink! Anyway, we got a taste of the pool then headed to get ready for our 8:30 reservation at Serrano which is in the lobby. Got there no problem and had a lovely time, then off to gamble! The casino itself is crescent shaped and has plenty of gaming action. It's spacious and the clientele were considerate and having a good time. The great thing about Aria is that it is so far off the strip you won't have the sad looking gamblers you might spot often spot in other casinos on the strip - the people playing at Aria are also staying at the Aria and are generally cleaned up for a nice vacation...which I personally think Vegas should be about - high end class not chintzy cheese. Aria provides the former, thank god! We gambled a bit, won and lost per the usual, and retired by midnight - tired from travel. We went to bed admiring the night city view (which was fantastic). I had the roll away bed which was fine if a bit short (I'm 6-ft and my feet hung off a bit) and the ladies were generally happy with the beds. We woke early to get our gym on!! The gym at Aria is dang nice, plenty of treadmills with individual t.v's, weights, plenty of towels and bottled water. Worth the trip even if you don't workout as the lounge just outside the gym has a cool fireplace and lounge. We explored the spa area which looked nice but we found it too pricy to get a massage. Afterward we headed to the casino floor to the Jean Paul Patisserie for coffee and pastries - they were really good and we returned every morning - then back out to the pool! Another lovely day followed by some shopping at the Miracle Mile (Earl of Sandwich - great $10/lunch) and eventually out that night to Paris to eat at Mon Ami Gabi and watch the Bellagio fountains. All perfect. We even went to the Chateau above the Sugar Factory to party with Dennis Rodman at his 50th birthday (random!). Needless to say the rest of the trip went really well - more pool and gambling at Aria which was wonderful. We had an interesting contrast when we went to Treasure Island to see Mystere - we felt the casino there was dirty, dated and had too much foot traffic while Aria was clean, current and only had people that were meant to be there - not just passing through. We had no other issues other than a housekeeping guy getting upset with us for putting a canned drink from CVS in the mini bar fridge (it messed up the weighted system) and for some reason, every day, we found orange tic tacs littered throughout our hallway. On Thursday when we were leaving (5pm flight) we got a late 3pm checkout which we strongarmed out of them due to the checkin issues, so that was nice. When I checked out there were no surprises on the bill - it was exactly what it should have been and not a penny more. We were certainly sad to leave and I can say I would love to go back! I love to try new casinos and have new adventures but my fear with leaving Aria is that another casino might be a step down. I've never stayed at the Bellagio so that might be an option, but I'd really love to go back to Aria and get a suite. One final caveat: our trip was during the off days of Monday-Thursday and I imagine that from Thursday-Sunday things could get a bit hairy at the Aria when it comes to service and turnaround time...but that is true of EVERY casino in Vegas so if you are going just expect some wrench somewhere and be very thankful if there is not one. Also, if you are a shopper like me check out the Aria men's and women's clothing stores - they are freakin awesome! Kudos to their buyers.

The pool area is nice and very large, even though there were people, you could get a bed with very little effort. The food: We went to the Gourmet Buffet Dinner on sunday, with unlimited wine and a lobster for 2. Food was Ok, with some outstanding selections, specially desserts, but If I hadn\u00b4t had the resort credit, I would definitely spend my money somewhere else, since its expensive and not the best buffet in vegas by far. Try Wynn or Bellagio, same price and more selection, or go outside the strip to Red Rock Hotel and casino or M Resort, for a very inexpensive dinner with the same quality that you will find in all casinos. we also went to 2 other restaurants and the Jean Phillippe corner, all where good but pricey for what you got. I would definitely recommend to eat somewhere else, if you don\u00b4t get comps or special discounts at the hotel. Gambling was Ok, but costly, there aren\u00b4t tables below $15 to $20 usd, where in other hotels, you can bet $10usd per hand. Overall I consider Aria one of the top 6 hotels in Vegas: Wynn, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, Mandarin Oriental, Caesars (the nicer suites) and Aria. But food options are limited, specially if you are on a budget, and there are better options around the strip. Service was Ok , but nothing to die for, I would not stay here, since I didn\u00b4t feel its my thing, but the Hotel is certainly nice. It is just not my thing, but I can say anything bad about it. By the way, Viva Elvis is nice if you like his music. If not go to Mystere or ka and you will enjoy it more.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bow, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cHuge hotel - very high tech room!\u201d", "Author": "dandkm88", "ReviewID": "UR115615915", "Content": "Stayed at the Aria on a business trip.

After normally staying at the far end of the strip, we decided to try a hotel closer to all of the \u201caction\u201d of Vegas. Overall, we were happy with our decision and satisfied with our stay. We would return if we could find a similar deal that we booked during our stay. Here are the pluses: Bed and pillows in the room- The bed and the pillows were awesome! So comfortable, it was easy to fall asleep each night. Pool area- The pool was lovely! Definitely worth going to the pools! (But wished they stayed open later than 8pm\u2026) I liked how there were different pools to choose from, it never really got overcrowded. If you get there before 9 or 10am you can choose seating near the sunbrellas and be seated comfortably in the shade. After 11am, you\u2019ll want that shade!!! It\u2019s also a nice touch that guests can get their own chilled water at several stands around the pool\u2026no waiting for the waitresses or walking far. Also with the pool, we really liked Breezes Caf\u00e9. Yes, the prices are a bit inflated, but this is Vegas. It is convenient to get a snack or quick breakfast and eat it poolside. Their breakfast items (breakfast burrito, egg sandwich, fruit platter, etc.) were yummy and we liked their BLT, too. Would rather eat this than the buffet or go somewhere else in the hotel. Customer service- We did initially have issues with our room and were relocated several times. As another traveler noted, it is nice to not have to trek all the way down to the front desk for new room keys. However, be prepared to wait awhile for security to bring up new keys\u2026we had to wait at least 20 minutes outside of our new room and it was stuffy and hot in the halls. A HUGE thank you to Heidi at customer service (?), who made all of these issues worth forgetting!!! I have never dealt with any customer service rep EVER who was as nice, polite, and accommodating as Heidi. There were no excuses, just apologies and kindness. Honestly, I hope her supervisors read this because she deserves a raise! Another big thank you to the concierge desk. Once again, they were beyond polite and helpful! Cleanliness- One of the few hotels that had a really clean bathroom. Didn\u2019t have to worry about seeing the previous guests\u2019 hair in the sinks/floor/shower. That\u2019s my biggest pet peeve. (On the other hand, housekeeping takes forever to clean the rooms. We left in the morning and came back at 3 only to find that our room hadn\u2019t been cleaned yet and we didn\u2019t have new towels.) Mostly adults- Liked that there were very few kids in the hotel, saw mainly adults and only some kids at the pool. The tram- The tram was a plus. We could take it to Bellagio and go across the street from there to other hotels. Some things to consider: Rooms- Yes, the rooms are smaller than what we\u2019re used to. For the same price we could probably get a larger suite-size hotel farther down the strip. But I guess you pay for location, right? Also, the remote control started to get on our nerves. I\u2019m not anti-technology, but would have rather preferred simplicity over this remote. It was probably just in our room, but the blackout curtains did not black out the room completely as there was a sliver of light that got in each morning. Staff- Despite our luck with some staff, the rest of the staff was indifferent. The front desk was unfriendly, very blah. Didn\u2019t even ask how we were, if we were first-timers, or if we had any questions. The staff who patrol the elevators were rather strict in a harsh way; I understand that you would like to keep your hotel secure, but there\u2019s no reason to bark at me about my room key. Restaurants- There were only a few restaurants within the hotel that we\u2019d actually dine at. For food we preferred to walk across the street to Paris and Planet Hollwood or to Monte Carlo. They had more casual, less expensive options. And one more thing\u2014Yes, we were part of the group of guests that were exposed to legionella. Really gross!

The pool is great, three pools with plenty of sun all day long and even a day club for those party animals.

The hot tub spa's upstairs were very relaxing as were the steam and sauna rooms, well recommend and afternoon in the fitness suite even if you dont use the gym.

I was on hold with the same busy front office about 15 minutes before contemplating making the journey downstairs in person when a capable and friendly agent moved our room away from the noise. BONUS: No trip to desk or security required to re-key our existing keys to the new room. This made it simple for us to get down the hall and away from the noise! The rest of stay was uneventful and problem free which makes it pretty darn good in my opinion. My only gripe aside from the pool party original room was that the marble shower was quite slippery.

Housekeeping was all over themselves apologizing and said they would take care of it immediately. I left the room and when I came back a few hours later it had been cleaned properly. However, every day after that the housekeeping seriously lacked. Trash cans were not emptied, soap dishes were scummy, no vacuuming done etc. To add to my delight the report about an outbreak of Legionnaires disease at Aria hit the news while I was staying there.

We arrived at the hotel rather late in the evening and although there was a line at the desk for check in, it did move rather quickly. The reservations clerk assigned us to a room very close to the elevator, even though we asked if we could be situated at the end of the hall to avoid any outside noise. She assured us that the hallways were very long and we probably didn't want to be assigned to a room so far from the elevator. We were too tired to argue with her and decided that we would give the room a try and if too noisy, would ask to be moved the next day. Well, the Aria must have the most soundproof rooms in all of Vegas, aided by the white noise provided by the air conditioning unit. We ended up being very happy with the location and never heard a sound unless the door was ajar. We made our way to our room and were so pleasantly surprised. I read about the 'thingymabobber' by the bed and the safe being tucked in the nightstand drawer -- so felt a bit prepared, but didn't know how truly wonderful everything would be until we plopped down on those beds!! MGM-Mirage does such a great job with all their beds and this was no exception. These may have been the most comfy beds and pillows in any one of their properties. The bed had an ultra cushy pillow top and plenty of nice soft fluffy pillows. From the thingymabobber (as someone described it...so I kept referring to it as that) by the bed, you could open / close the curtains, turn the tv on and off, check the flight schedules, adjust the temp in the room, set the privacy or service sign to light up outside your door, turn lights on and off, etc. How truly wonderful....felt very spoiled. There was also no hint of smoke in the room -- which was great as we requested a non-smoking floor. The bathroom is also fantastic with plenty of very nice towels (extras in the drawers and bathroom shelves) and nice toiletries. The lighted magnification mirror is always a nice touch, as were the 4 robes hanging in the closet upon arrival. Everything was in working condition in our room and as I mentioned, very soundproof. The temperature control worked perfectly and sometimes that isn't always the case. The only issue I had with the room is that the bedspread was kind of dirty and actually had someone else's hair left on it when we checked in. This was minor, as we only needed the blanket at night and choose to turn the bedspread all the way to the end of the bed. OK -- that was the ONLY issue with the room during our 3 night stay. Again...very minor but unexpected for such a fabulous hotel. Everything else was spotless and the bathroom was kept extremely clean throughout our stay. We found there was never really a wait for the elevators and made our way down to the casino with ease. We also used the monorail back from the Bellagio and used the escalotor that is within the hotel itself to make our way over to Monte Carlo. Very convenient location. Also, they did a fantastic job filtering the smoke out of the air in the casino. The players club desk agents were very friendly and quite helpful -- all with a great sense of humor. We experienced a problem when attempting to use the freeplay or point play while we were there but ended up finding machines to accept it. They were doing some work on the system and for awhile, all machines were down. I don't think our play was accurately recorded at this time but not too much of an issue. We didn't go to the pools as our last morning there, it was raining and that was the time we set aside for relaxing by the pool. Maybe next time. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel but some did look inviting. But, too many other places to go to, so many next time. Also, never used the gym so cannot speak to that either. One thing that was quite impressive was the fountain and the wall of water by the taxi area. I think we sat on the bench out there for well over an hour enjoying this area. The lights shine off the dancing water in the fountain while behind you, there is a wall of water falling in waves. You have to experience it to understand what I am trying to explain. See it at night for the full affect. The staff at the concierge desk were so helpful and friendly. There is also an internet kiosk just down from the bell desk to check in for your flight -- although the printer didn't work for us to print our boarding pass. After staying at several hotels in Vegas, this quickly became our favorite and cannot wait to go back. I would give this 4.5 stars out of 5 -- not 5 only because of the very minor problems we experienced with the slot machines and the not so clean bedspread. The staff, save just a couple, were outstanding. Even the cocktail waitresses were fantastic and more than willing to suggest that special drink to hit the spot. NICE!!

And Again\u201d", "Author": "Jeremy9631", "ReviewID": "UR115377415", "Content": "When we looked at the reviews, we started with the worst, and we nearly didn't go to Aria, there seemed to be so many problems. But all the hotels had problems, many a lot worse, and a colleague had recommended Aria, so we gave it a shot. Boy, are we glad we did! We only stayed a brief time, but we encountered absolutely none of the problems mentioned. Granted it was a Thursday and Friday in July, but, when we pulled up, there were a dozen or more bellmen to take our bags. Let us say right off the bat that the most impressive thing was the staff. They couldn't have been nicer, more helpful, and more accommodating for our entire stay. The check-in was really fast, with ample counters, and when we waited for a minute, an employee came to us, escorted us to a new window, and we were checked in immediately. Our bags arrived at our room in less than 5 minutes after we asked for them. The room was clean, with plenty of everything - towels, robes, shampoos, pillows, and electronic everything. If we walked into the room during the day, the curtains opened automatically as we entered, and at night closed automatically when we entered. It took a while for us to figure out how to use the remote, which controls everything in the room, but we figured it out. I went down to the gym, and found everything I wanted. I use the treadmill, and there were a dozen ones not being used, each with its own TV and jack for an iPod. Headsets were available and free (I wish they were in my club at home), free cold water, free towels, a weight machine circuit, and just around the corner when I was done, 3 pools to jump in to cool off. A note: the pools are only three and half feet deep, but more than ample for swimming. The entire time we were there, there were plenty of empty beach chairs, and we were able to find umbrellas if we got there at a reasonable time. The umbrellas are free. A word of warning: there are workers who circulate and, if a chair is unused for 30 minutes, they will take your things off and bring them to the main desk, so, if you're thinking of staking out a chair and then going somewhere else, not going to work. Some caveats: the place is huge, and I mean huge. It can take 15 minutes to get from your room to one of the dozen or so restaurants or the pools or just about anything. Allow even more time to get to the self-park garage (again, no charge). They don't tell you this, but you need a photo I.D. to buy anything -- meals, a newspaper, anything. We learned quick. The food ain't cheap, especially around the pool ($8.00 for a small coke). The buffet was okay but a huge number of things to eat. Breakfast will run you $40.00, which, strangely is the same with a tip it'll cost you at a restaurant there, but without 150 choices and as much to eat as you want. Of course, a lunch will run around $50, and a dinner easily $100, unless one eats in the Crystal mall Wolfgang Puck pizza place. We should say that, while it is true that the Aria is located on The Strip, it is on the south end of the strip, and it can take a half hour to walk (you don't want to drive) to take in the \"theme\" hotels, like The Paris, The Venetian, and so on. Finally, check out was a breeze. We have absolutely no complaints, and our only regret is that we didn't have more time to stay there. I know this might sound like we're being paid to write this, but we're not, and this is probably the first time in our lives (we're not young) that we've written about a hotel or anything else that wasn't to tell people how bad it was and to avoid it.

The casino seems smaller (not a bad thing) but nice and smalls great. However, cocktail services was practically non-existent. The pools are much better at Bellagio and slightly more family friendly. The Liquid Lounge (outdoor pool bar) at Aria plays loud music with a big base beat that becomes distracting background noise, and it's almost impossible to escape it at any of the three pools. The Buffet at Aria is smaller, but nicer and very well organized - not less food, just less redundancy and less chaotic. The workout facility at Aria is fabulous and big!!

My husband fumbled a few times trying to figure out the lights but once we got used to it, pretty cool. Check in and out was great, no waiting. We checked out via TV which I recommend to anyone! Pool was very nice with very few families. They let you have plenty of towels and allowed us to bring in our beverages although we had to pour them into plastic cups. My biggest complaint is the casino. Every open table we saw was a $25 minimum. Occassionally a $15 blackjack table would exist but was always packed with no spots open. They are very proud of their casino. So we didn't really play there very much because at $25 a hit, the money doesn't last long. Instead we headed over to Monte Carlo (connected to Aria) and played there for hours at $10 tables. Restaurants are OK but pricey. Crystals is a joke to the typical American.

This was a solo trip and having only been to Vegas once before and stayed at the excellent Bellagio, my expectations were pretty high when deciding upon the Aria. I wasn't disappointed!!!!! After a smooth check in with a very helpful member of staff, I upgraded to a city view room for an extra $15 dollars a night on the 24th floor. My one gripe would be the $20 a day resort fee which is payable upon check in... this basically covered things that I actually didn't use... wifi, spa etc... has to be be paid though, so nothing you can do. The first thing that struck me as I walked through the casino to the elevators, was the amazing feel of luxury and fantastic smells that waft through the resort... no old smoke drifting through the casino and instead filled with very fresh aromas. Casino itself was excellent and the poker room was one of the best I played during my time there... and I played quite a few of them. For those who do play, they have an excellent daily $200 buy in that had a sizeable pot on both occassions I played... granted numbers were probably inflated at that point due to the number of visitors there for the WSOP. As I entered my room I was delighted to find a spacious and immaculate room with fantastic views of the strip and all the amenities one could need. The bed was amazing and I literally didn't have to leave it to access anything like the lighting, tv, curtains etc... as they are all controlled via an ipad like device next to your bed. Bathroom was spacious with an excellent shower and tub. It was a great feeling every morning to wake and have the drapes open at the touch of a button to reveal the strip in all it's amazing glory. Onto the buffet and all I can say is WOW...... I ate here most mornings as it really wasn't worth the while going elsewhere when it was so good. Ok it's not the cheapest place to eat at $20+ but the variety and quality is superb. I had the Bellagio buffet one morning and it didn't come close to Aria.

Finally on a hot 110 degree day in the desert it would be nice to have a mojito and a strawberry daquiri...but not at $32 for little 16 oz cups...plus tip...wow i could get a better deal in NYC. On another note the beds are very soft and the room was kept very clean by the staff. you may search a while to find ice on your hotel room floor..but hey it is a huge hotel. we walked thorough city center and crystals which is their high end shopping destination and felt it is worth the window shopping. I guess we would have liked a more intimate hotel because the aria is luxury but it leaves you a bit disconnected with the rest of the world.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "pb62", "ReviewID": "UR115267342", "Content": "We stayed in the Sky Suites.

We are 34 and 32 years old. I go to vegas for conventions/sales often so I have a few comparison points to judge Aria on. We had room 7217 the basic king room from what I could derive from the website. We arrived around 11:00 AM not expecting a room to be ready. We waited in line at the invited guest checkin for approx 20 mins. The girl checking us in was not overtly rude but the check in could have been done at an automated kiosk for as warm as she was. It took till we were leaving for her to make eye contact with me during the checkin process. Head down at the computer the whole time. We get to the room and get everything turned on. The room was very nicely decorate and had a good feel to it. I will say our view wasn't anything to write home about but I don't really care much about it. We were on the backside of the hotel so there wasn't any noise what so ever. I played with the touchscreen controls for a while and found them easy to use. The one thing I didn't like was the length it took to go between screens for TV channels. I abandoned the touch screen and went to the remote control also in the room. I just found it easier to use. There was one minor issue with the room. The shower head had a leak at the joint that sprayed water 90 degrees into the bathtub. There is no reason to raise a fuss about this but it just showed me that Aria doesn't take care of the small things. We did eat at the skybox cafe and it was good sports bar type food with the typical resort prices. The pools were amazing. That was the best part of staying at Aria. I didn't visit liquid because I was having more fun in the main pools than I expected. Check out was a breeze, I did the text message checkout process that was fun. The one tip I have for anyone staying here is: If you are grabbing a Taxi go to the North side taxi stand it was almost always empty. When you get off the elevators turn right and follow the sign past the Jean-Phillpe shop. It is much closer than the main entrance as well. To Sum up: The rooms are very nice. There is nothing special about the hotel. Unless they plan on training/retraining the staff, I would put in self-service check in kiosk. That would save MGM some money and eliminate the lines. Mlife comps are not as good as the use to be. Sidenote: I am a share holder of MGM Mirage and read the quarterly statements regularly. City Center has yet to turn a profit so as good business management they are driving out cost as much as possible and increasing revenues where they can. I feel this is why everyone at Aria is grumpy. There isn't any extra money floating around for the staff. My stay was fine and that is just the problem it was just fine.

Tram service to Bellagio was very convenient. It's very much the 'hotel of the future.' The buffet is A+ - we went during 'gourmet' night (or some such event - it's what's offered on Friday and Saturday night) which included a glass of wine, huge crab legs and a whole lobster for us to split, as well as any other food imaginable. The only other restaurant we sampled at the hotel was the Coffee Bean, where we had breakfast twice. Much more expensive than Starbucks and no place to sit (we had to go to the Sports Book) but pain au chocolat to die for. So - the criticisms. They possibly went too far with the 'modern-ness' - everything is controlled via a central remote. Navigating through this thing is not so easy or quick. It took a couple of days to realize that much of this can be controlled via the TV remote control. Hard to describe here, but I would say that older patrons or those who aren't techie naturals may have some trouble. We're pretty tech-savvy and had trouble upon arrival ... but we did figure it out. The other bother was their $22/day 'resort fee' which apparently includes internet, USA Today, some of the gym, and probably a couple of other things. It's funny to me how the cheaper hotels offer all of these types of things for free, but the expensive hotels charge for all this type of stuff. With the exception of the gym, these amenities are the same wherever you go. The cheaper hotels will leave you USA Today at your door - at Aria, you had to go to the back of a gift shop - finding out how to get the paper was almost like a scavenger hunt.

Upon first arrival, I was a little distressed to see that there was no door man at this 5 star hotel to hold the door for you. I had 2 large suitcases, a backpack and my husband also had his hands full with his own luggage. One would think that someone would be available to assist in holding the door, but there was a man just inside the door who stood there staring out the glass instead. I\u2019m not quite sure what his purpose was. Once inside, there was a PAINFULLY long wait to check into the hotel. There must have been about 10-15 positions open with 5-6 people in each line. Some people seemed to be standing at the counter for literally an inordinate amount of time. I don\u2019t understand this either because presumably you have a hotel booked and all you really need to do it give them your license and your credit card and you should be on your way. When it was finally my turn to check in, the employee at the counter was pleasant enough and sent me on my way to the guest elevators which required you to truck it through the casino (where many places are carpeted) trying to wield your suitcases around everywhere. When we finally got to our room, it was very modern looking and had some interesting gadgets inside. The curtains even opened the first time you walked in the door. The major gadget boasting from the room was a touch screen panel which could control everything from the curtains, to your AC to the \u201cprivacy\u201d light at the front door and more. You didn\u2019t need to use this tool in order to access items in the room, it was just another option, and while as cool as it was, it was pretty unnecessary and I never really understood how to use it properly. I believe there is something on the front of it which dictates how dark it is in the room or something and it shines pretty bright at night, so I would put it face down on the side of the bed and twice when I picked it up to see what time it was, it activated everything. Turning on all of the lights, the TV, the lamps\u2026 at like 4am. Needless to say, my husband wasn\u2019t too thrilled to be woken up that way! Our AC didn\u2019t appear to be working and we were very hot the first night in the room. The temp only getting down to about 73 when we had it set at 63, so I called the front desk to have someone look at it and it appeared it was fixed while we were out one night because the temperature did feel colder, but not as cold as the number displayed which by the time we left was 67. There are many drawbacks to the room which I feel are worth noting: -Lack of outlets. There is a panel in the desk area which holds two outlets and many other plugs for things like hooking your laptop up to the flat screen TV. Unless I am doing a presentation in my hotel room for some reason, I really don\u2019t see any value in this, particularly in Las Vegas. Besides that there is an outlet by the front door and then that\u2019s it (with the exception of one in the bathroom). It would have been nice to have one adjacent to the bed to plug my phone in at night, instead I had to plug it in on the desk and then wake up in the middle of the night to retrieve it so I could use it to wake up. -The \u201cblackout\u201d curtains really aren\u2019t \u201cblackout\u201d curtains in my opinion. Yes, they stop the light from entering, but only what it actually covers. The curtains hung about 1-2 inches from the ground which meant that light streamed in under the entire bottom of the curtain, and the way the curtain folded at the top allowed light to come in the entire length of the top of the curtains. The curtain is substantially long as the window runs the entire length of the room. This meant I was disoriented first from the 3 hour time difference I had and then again because I thought it was like 6am at all hours of the night. -The bed is um\u2026 not that good. Maybe if I had been sleeping alone I would have found it ok, but every toss and turn from my husband sent me feeling like I was on a waterbed of sorts the whole night. In addition to this, as others have commented, the pillows are terrible (unless of course you like \u201csquishy\u201d pillows). For my neck and shoulders they just left me in pain every day I stayed there. -Turndown service? Not sure if they actually have this, others have commented they have had it, but no one ever turned down our room the entire time we were there. -Trashcans- There are only 2 in the room\u2026. Both in the bathroom. Just a little odd. There is a \"resort fee\" which is a daily fee charged to your room, but our group had that waived, so I am not sure how much it costs but it does cover the internet in your room and \"the use of the pool and fitness center\". One item we didnt realize was that you could actually also get a daily paper with your room key if you showed it at their little sundries type gift shop. The pool is also nice there. There are three enourmous hot tubs which fit 45 people each...one which appeared to be broken and there are cabana rentals available. One of the members in our group rented one for the day and it was very nice and well appointed with a flat screen TV, sodas, waters, light snacks, comfy lounge beds and a waiter type guy who would check on you for drinks. The pool on the weekend is a madhouse though. I felt like it was an MTV SPring Break special going on, so if you want to go in the pool, just be ready to push past people while in there.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201c\"Aria kicked it up a notch!!\"\u201d", "Author": "jackie1223", "ReviewID": "UR115030917", "Content": "This place is amazing!

We waited in line for maybe 5 minutes before they took us on..This might have been because it was late at night as we were catching the red eye coming in. The front desk staff were so friendly and accommodating to our requests..we asked if there were any upgrades available and he stated that Aria had overbooked but if we called the next day they would try and see if there was another room to upgrade to. We decided not to because our room was FANTASTIC! We loved the electronic tablet that welcomed us and the greeting was very neat. The tablet was great to control the temperature of the room, music, tv, blinds (our favorite part was the goodnight button next to your head that turns everything off). The bathroom was very nice with the glass shower and tub beside it. Our room was very spacious-be careful of the minibar though..if you take anything off the minibar or out for more than 30 seconds, they will charge you-fyi! Our room had a great view of the pool and other areas of vegas!! The pool is gorgeous with 4 pools, one that is the adults only dance party pool called Liquid which has cabanas and chairs for rent. There are 2 small hot tubs/whirl pools but it was so hot, i couldn't imagine seeing anyone sitting there. The pool area does get busy but there are so many chairs around that you are bound to find a spot. To get to the pool you have to bring your room key and its on the Promenade Floor. There are a few restaurants in Aria-we only tried Jean Philippe Pattiserrie which was very yummy! We basically had breakfast there every morning (probably not the smartest thing since it cost us about $25 for 2 sandwiches) but boy were they yummy!

Their casino area just didn't do it for me..Don't get me wrong, its a nice place, but there are many other vegas hotels that just give you that 'viva las vegas' feel and aria just didn't make the cut in terms of the casino..this is why i'm actually only giving aria a 4.5..Go play the price is right game-its a lot of fun when you can get the showcase showdown or play the games such as hole in one. Also! there are cocktail waitresses that come quite a bit so be sure to get your free drinks before you head on out! =) Overall, Aria was an amazing place to stay..the housekeeping staff always greeted us wherever we were and everyone seemed so friendly to help us out or even chat with us. The bellhop guy outside of aria was super friendly!!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone as it is a great location and there is a tram that connects to monte carlo, crystals and bellagio..I can't wait to stay here again!!", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cNo WOW factor...\u201d", "Author": "FortMacPrincess", "ReviewID": "UR115023120", "Content": "We went to Las Vegas for my birthday and a well needed girl\u2019s weekend. We stayed at the Aria resort and although the rooms were very nice the hotel itself lacked that WOW factor. Check-in took well over an hour which in my opinion is much too long. They only had 3 people working the front desk and a lineup of over 100, I am no mathematician but I could figure out we would be in the line for a long time and we were.

When we did find somewhere to eat it was a very large, bright \u2018caf\u00e9 feeling\u2019 restaurant. The food as bland and the service was lacking, so not the hip, vibrant feeling that we wanted in Sin City. The pool was lovely but again we couldn\u2019t get food or drinks as only one waitress was working the whole pool, we ended up leaving and went to another hotel so we could eat and drink. We spent all of our time away from the Aria as the amenities were lacking. Check-out was very easy because you could do it over the phone and they were very fast at adjusting our mini bar charges (my sister and I touched everything and ended up with a large bill) The Aria has a lot of potential but they really need to hire more staff, offer better restaurants and iron out some of the problems before I will return as this is one of the most expensive hotels in Las Vegas.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBurglars and Club Music\u201d", "Author": "Zorack89", "ReviewID": "UR115005831", "Content": "On my fourth night there someone tried to break into my room at 2am. after yelling at him as he was slamming against the door repeatedly he finally went away. i called the front desk and they could care less.

For all the money spent on this hotel it is very sad that it is let down by probably the most important part of any hotel, ie the housekeeping.

When you enter the room all the money has been spent on the gadgets, and they are impressive, open the door the lights come on and the motorised curtains open to reveal full length windows. But lookng behind the gadgets and we came upon a broken lampshade about to fall off, someone's phone number left on the writting pad, food sauce dried onto the bar menu cover, bent and squashed boxes holding the bar snacks. And worst of all someone had been smoking in the toilet! So we complained and got put into a non-smokng room on the 10th floor which is a non-smoking floor, why weren't we offered this in the first place? Although better we did still have the previous occupants hair all over the duvet and sheets and they did have a slightly off white appearance as if not washed properly.

The Aria is one of the 15 or so 5 star hotels in vegas and after doing some research decided to stay there. We booked a vacation package on the Aria website which included Southwest airfaire and the room. I thought the price was reasonable at about $1100 for everything. Since we booked this trip 5 months ago, we also purchased the cancellation insurance for $100 just in case. When we arrived at the hotelat about 6 p.m. vegas time, I thought the entrance and lobby was gorgeous. However, the first thing I noticed was how long the check in line was. Sure enough, I waited about an hour before I reached the front of the line. It seemed like they didn't have enough people working the front desk and everyone was taking their sweet time. It got very frustratiing. When I finally reached the check in desk I was informed that the only King bed room left was on the third floor with a horrible view of the 2nd floor roof covered in air conditioner units and lights. I could have a room on the 19th but it was 2 queens. I was pretty upset since I booked the room 5 months ago. The employee then notified me that the room was at 102% capacity, which I thought was weird. She said I could come down in the morning and try to move to a better room after people checked out. At this point, I was tired of waiting and just wanted to get to the room and shower. We also were running late to our dinner reservation. So, I reluctantly took the key card and asked for a bell hop to take up our luggage. I was then told that it would take at least 2 hours for my luggage to be brought up. At this point I got really upset. Fortunately, my wife found a bell hop, batted her eyes at him and he agreed to take us up. I don't know how she pulled this off, but I wasn't about to question it. When we entered the room, the lights turned on automatically and the curtains opened up to a horrible view of the air conditioning units, just like I thought. It really made me upset and ruined my first impression of the room. To be fair, the room itself is very nice. The bed was extrememly comfortable, the bathroom is big and the shower is great. Everything seemed very clean and new. I really liked how everything from the lights, to the temperature can be adjusted using the television or the flat panel by the bed. The next morning I went to the gym and found it to be great. Lots of equipment and everything was modern and new. We then all met for breakfast at cafe vetro and the bad service continued. It took forever to have a server come over and take our order and even longer for the food to arrive. It got to the point where we had to speak to the manager of the restaraunt. When our meals did come, one of my friends order didnt' come out. He ordered the same thing as me but the server messed up and only put it in the system once. Again to be fair, they took his meal off the bill and gave us a few menu items for free. The food, when it did arrive, was fantastic. When breakfast was finished, I went back to the lobby to see about switching to a better room. When I arrived, the lines were even longer then the day before and I had no idea who to talk with. There was no line available for people that were already guests so I decided to wait in the check in line again. After about 20 minutes of waiting, and the lines not moving, my frustration was boiling. I decided to go over to the conceirge and see what they can do. Fortunately, I spoke with a friendly gentleman and he went and spoke to a manager on my behalf. He came back, took my cell phone number and said they will call me if a room becomes available. I told him that I was told that yesterday but have yet to recieve such a call. He said that's the best he could do. I then left for my room in \"steerage\" not feeling anybetter. Lo and behold, as soon as I got out of the shower I got a call from the front desk saying I got a room on the 54th floor and they would send someone up to take my bags in 30 minutes. Success!! I quickly repacked everything and was ready for the move. The bellhop came, we moved to our new room which had a great view of the strip and was about 100 squarge feet bigger with an extra closet. Needless to say, I was happy with the end result. The rest of the stay was very nice. I really enjoyed the casino and found the hotel itself to be very nice. On our last day there, we got a cabana at the Liquid lounge, which is the hotels adult only pool. You can get a cabana if you spend at least $500 on food and drink. Otherwise, you can get a chair for $50. It was very nice and the service was fantastic. All the beautiful people were there and I felt like I was in an episode of Entourage. It was a great way to spend the day and stay cool in the Vegas heat. My wife and her friends decide to get a massage at the spa but said the wait was very long. Other then that, she said the massage was great. $160 for 50 minutes. Check out, unlike check in, was a breeze. The line was short and quick. We were able to leave our bags with the bell hops after check out because our plane didn't leave until the afternoon. So, we walked the strip and did some shopping to kill some time, then came back, grabbed our bags and a taxi and went off to the Airport. In the end, I had a fantastic time. I know that Vegas is struggling in this economy and I got te feeling that the Aria just didn't have enough people on staff.

My only complaint about the pool is they need better food options pool-side but the drinks were awesome. The gym is incredible - huge with lots of machines and really cool ones I've never seen before. In terms of restaurants, we ate at Julian Serrano (average) and the Buffet (average). We had a few drinks at Deuces Lounge which is your typical hotel bar. I actually found the Vesper bar at The Cosmopolitan to be much cooler and the restaurants there better but it's easy enough to go from the Aria to The Cosmopolitan.

There were lots of people in line but there were also several lines open. We had reserved a city view room for 3 nights and got exactly what we requested. The room was very clean and very comfortable. The mattress and pillows were beyond comfortable. The in room technology worked great. I loved the electronic blinds - when I woke up on East Coast time the first morning, I opened the blinds with a touch of the button and got to see the sunrise over the mountains before going back to sleep. Housekeeping did a great job of keeping the room clean while we were there. The casino is very clean and well ventilated. I'm sure over time it will start to smell like the other older casinos but for the time being it is still very fresh. All of the staff on the floor were super friendly. The pools were clean but definitely crowded. Staff is nice but perhaps a bit understaffed on the poolside service. That being said, the pool bar is close enough to the pools to get your own drink if you can't wait! The gym was super clean and a great place to work out. The price to go to the gym is included in the resort fee. They have several different types of machines and weights. Also the fresh towels, bottled water and fresh fruit are a very nice touch for after a good workout. The only negatives I can attribute to the hotel were: - Room service took forever but it was late on Friday night and when the food arrived it was delicious; and - We had extremely poor wait service in the Cafe Vettro (i.e., it took 30 minutes to get a bloody mary and it had to be requested several times); however, other tables and servers seemed to be doing fine so I think it was just one bad person in a bunch of other great servers.

Myself and my partner had planned a 5 night stay in Vegas as part of a long holiday travelling around California and Nevada. This was to be the last stage of our holiday, so we wanted somewhere nice to end on a high note. We looked extensively at the large variety of hotels available in Vegas and eventually settled on the Aria. Most of the hotels along the strip seemed to be excellent and have good reviews, but as we're both a fan of very modern hotels (versus the more 'traditional' style you might find at the likes of the Wynn or Bellagio) we decided the Aria was perfect for us. Having only been built relatively recently, it stood to reason that it would also have suffered less use and wear than the other hotels and would have fairly modern amenities. On arrival at the resort, the first thing that struck us was the size of the resort. The hotel and casino, coupled with the adjoining 'Crystals' shopping centre, truly takes up a serious amount of space. The entire front is glass-surfaced and has a beautiful water feature running along the wall which spans the length of the frontal pickup area. We had read reports that check-in times were quite slow, but I was happy to find that as almost as soon as we had set foot in the check-in area, we were immediately directed to a shorter queue and had no more than a 2 minute wait. There seemed to be a large amount of staff at the check-in desks, so perhaps this is something the hotel has recently remedied. Check-in was quick and the staff friendly. As is the norm with most of these resorts, you have to drag your luggage through the casino area to get to the elevators but luckily the casino floor didn't seem too busy at our arrival time. The ultra-quick elevator had us on the 26th floor before too long, and we noted that everything we saw en route was kept immaculately clean with no signs of wear at all. As soon as we entered our room, the curtains opened automatically and the TV came on with a personalised greeting. Nice touches. The room itself was excellent; large, spacious, with good quality furniture, a 42\" Plasma TV, large minibar and numerous other features which were welcome. The bathroom was also large, with a fantastic shower and dual sinks for him & her. It was in the room that all the modern touches we were fond of became apparent. All the automated features of the room (the curtains, lighting, privacy/service lights at the door, music, billing, etc) were accessible via both the TV and also by a small touchscreen panel next to the bed, much like a small iPad in size and shape. It's a small thing but it's nice to be able to manage everything from the comfort of your bed for those lazy mornings when you don't want to get up. I wouldn't have enough time or room here to describe the resort itself in detail, so I'd recommend you spend a while on the Aria website which has detailed information on everything available. Which is, suffice to say, pretty much anything you like. There is a very large and well-run pool area, numerous restaurants/cafes, and numerous small bar areas dotted round the Casino. Although we did venture out a few times into the unrelenting heat, I'd imagine you could spend an entire week in the resort and not have to go outside for anything if need be! Unlike a number of other resorts which have a smokey smell in the Casino area due to the relaxed Vegas smoking laws, the Aria pumps a slight vanilla scent through the air conditioning system and this ensured that the Casino area smelt clean and fresh at all times. We found all staff we encountered to be extremely friendly and courteous, always making a point of saying \"hello\" even if only passing in the corridor. Room service was prompt and efficient, and I'd recommend you try it once - we were very impressed not just with the prices for room service food, but also how it was presented and how it tasted! We also noted that there is always a member of security at the elevator areas who checks that anyone travelling up to the room areas has their door card - always a good way to ensure there's no randomers roaming round the corridors where people are staying. Now, no hotel is perfect so I'll quickly mention what little negatives we could see. These were observations more than anything. First off, if you're a fan of 'character' you may not immediately take to the Aria. It lacks any kind of running theme like you may find at the Italian-themed Venetian, french-theme Paris Hotel, etc - it's simply a very modern building. This wasn't a problem for us as we specifically wanted that type of hotel anyway and found the modern design/decor very refreshing, but for those of you who want your hotel stay in Vegas to be more of a 'theatrical' experience, it may be worth looking at a few of the other longer established places. Secondly, the eateries in the hotel are not the most expensive around, but they certainly aren't the cheapest either. If you're on a tight budget, you may find the slightly-above-average prices a little much, especially if you're only after a small breakfast or lunch. There are numerous other places nearby on the strip which offer lower prices so it may be worth venturing out. In saying that - we had breakfast in the hotel buffet once, and thought it was excellent value. You can pretty much fill your plate as much as you like and the variety (and quality) of food on offer was superb. Other than that, we had no negatives whatsoever and would highly recommend the Aria. We're hoping to head back to Vegas in a couple of years and Aria will definitely be our hotel of choice again.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cIt was better than I had hoped for.\u201d", "Author": "LarryJohnson64", "ReviewID": "UR114813346", "Content": "The room was very comfortable.

We arrived in our own car to valet, pulled up, got out of the car and waited.. and waited. Finally a valet attendant came up to us to take care of the car. We asked for the bell man to get our luggage. The valet had to yell out three times to get someone to come and get our bags. So much for first impressions! Valet and bell service, both negative. We went to the check in desk, were only one person back, and the wait was too long. Must have taken 15 minutes and my wife and I had split off for two clerks and it didn't help. We got our room no problem, regular room, city view on the 15th floor. Once up to our room, we called down to the bell desk for our luggage. It took nearly 30 minutes for our luggage to arrive. Unacceptable!! We had places we wanted to go and had to wait and wait and wait. The room was clean and fancy. Wouldn't expect anything else from such a new hotel. The high tech features were fun to learn and use (We loved the privacy light and lighting controls). But the room controls showed the name of the previous room guest our whole stay. There were fingerprints on the ceiling, really annoying to look up at when in bed. The \"blackout\" curtains did not make the room dark.. as soon as the sun came up the room was bright since the curtains don't stay flush against the wall and window. So much for playing at night and sleeping during the day! While we are spoiled by MGM Grand's suites, the room in Aria felt congested. They used the nice size refrigerator and stocked it full of mini bar items to buy and even used a good portion of the desk area for more snacks and drinks to buy. The restroom was small with two sinks in such a tiny space and be careful.. the shower floor is slippery!!! We love to play poker on our stays in Vegas. Always hit the MGM Grand poker room and was excited to try the poker at Aria. Wow, what a difference! We were there on a slow Wednesday and yet the people at the podium to sign up for poker with were rude, made little to no eye contact and quickly brushed you aside to perform their other duties. Oh how it made us miss the smiling faces at the MGM Grand poker room. Dealers at the Aria were silent, just going about their duties, didn't have smiling friendly dealer at all. Looking forward to a nice dinner in the evening we made reservations at Bar Masa for Japanese. We arrived and were seated right away (positive!), but were given a dirty look when all we wanted was water with our meal. Guess they expect everyone to buy fancy wines?? My wife ordered two sushi items, California Roll ($28) and a Spicy Tuna Roll ($22) that normally cost $6 to $8 anywhere else. I am not a seafood fan, so ordered the Kobe Beef and Garlic Fried Rice for $34. We patiently waited for our food that took WAY too long to arrive with the restaurant nearly empty. Our water glasses ran dry while waiting, but were filled up shortly before the food arrived. The Kobe Beef rice contained about a handful of rice and beef (maybe a total of two cups?) for the $34 price and tasted mostly like soy sauce and was way over priced for such a small portion. My wife enjoyed her tuna roll, but found a crab shell/tendon in her California Roll and informed the waiter. They took it and return with another and told her to give that a try. She ate a couple pieces and found it was so salty she couldn't eat it. We again told the waiter and asked for the manager. The manager came over and my wife told her she just didn't want it.. said sorry, took it away. And our waters ran dry again! The next thing we knew the waiter came by with our bill, set it on the table and said here you go. No apology, no offering if we wanted something else, no saying if it was removed from the bill. Fortunately, it was removed from the bill so we quickly paid and left. Nearly $70 for a sushi roll and some rice. Horrible restaurant, avoid it at all costs!! The next day we woke up early because of the sun shining through the blackout shades and just wanted to get as far away from Aria as possible. We stopped off at one of the bars to get our free drinks with our coupon from the front desk. It was the slowest bartender we have ever seen, slowly finding his lemons for other customers drinks, ran out of something, slowly walked to far end of bar and spent a minute or two there. Ridiculous! When it was our turn he just walked up and look at us.. no hello, no can I help you, nothing! (he didn't see the coupons yet) We know the routine, so just told him what we wanted. I laughed to my wife that we should have just had a stare off until he spoke to us at first. Bad service.. only thing he said was \"thanks\" when we left. To get to valet we were directly all the way around the casino, instead of out easily out the front door. Sure, great to get people spending more money in the casino, but not good location or service for the customer. The bell desk was a tiny portable podium off to the center of the driveway that we gave our ticket to. The valet waiting area was cramped and tiny, but air conditioned at least. Bell man was friendly and polite! FINALLY!!! One out of... we lost track. To sum it up, great hotel because it is so new.. looks great, very clean, fancy.. staff and service subpar. Expected so much better. Aria should take notes from it's bigger brother, the MGM Grand, on how to take care of customers. We won't be back to Aria.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "Lynette51", "ReviewID": "UR114808153", "Content": "Being frequent visitors of Las Vegas we tried the Aria for a Father's Day stay. Beautiful resort. Check-in was a little slow as has been mentioned in other reviews. They do mention several times if you so much as move any item from the tray or tray itself from the counter in your room, you will be charged for misc. food items. There is plenty of counter space though so just steer clear if you're worried. We had a standard king room that overlooked all 3 pools. As soon as you enter the drapes open and music comes on. The hard part was finding the in-room safe. Hint: it's in the nightstand. Ours was locked so we had to call housekeeping and they were there promptly to open & clear the combination. The bed is so comfortable. You literally sink in it. And the pillows again heavenly. There is a control bedside that controls everything ie: drapes, sheers, housekeeping, temperature, tv, music & lights. The bathroom does have the tub within the shower. But again plenty of room in the bathroom and plenty of towels. Housekeeping service excellent. When exiting your room yu push a buton for housekeeping. Room amenities are good and abundent. Pools are nicely kept. We did not see any children anywhere and lots of shade if you're not a sun lover. The staff also constantly walk around and remove any towels left to save a chair, which is nice, allowing plenty of seating for everyone. Check-out was no problem. You can check out via your TV. We did notice an error in our bill so we went downstairs to check-out and were prompty greeted by an agent with an ipad that made the adjustment and checked us out without having to stand in any line. All in all a very beautiful resort & worthy of the a 5 star rating. Hint: If driving in from out of town and using their valet, drop your vehicle off at the North valet. No waiting ever to pick up your car.

It was a surprise and he had no idea where we were going. We were only going to be there for 2 nights but we were ready to make the most of the short time we had there! We arrive at Aria and walk in to the hotel to the pleasant, sweet smell of vanilla. My husband immediately says, \"WOW-what have you done?\" The hotel is amazing. LOCATION~Location is good. Not far to get to the strip. A quick trip through Crystals mall or down the main entrance and down a long sidewalk and your on the strip. Really don't understand the complaints about the location. It's not THAT far back. CHECK IN~Check-in is fast. We only waited about 10 minutes in line. Angela is our desk clerk and she was outstanding. I tell her about my husband's birthday and she gets on the phone to her manager to ask for an upgrade. I had booked a standard king room. After a few strikes to the keyboard she asks me if I would like a junior suite, but explains that the TV is not facing the bed but rather a couch area instead. She also tells me the room is not going to be available for another 4 hours- I pause as we like to watch TV in bed and we really wanted to change our clothes and put on shorts as it was hotter than hell already! She notices my hesitation and offers me a City view room on the 18th floor, several free drink cards since it's his birthday and \"some other goodies for us.\" I accept as we really wanted to freshen up, drop off our things and change. Now that I get home and look online and see the suite...I think we should have waited. WOW! Lesson learned!! ROOM~We walk into the room and the music starts playing, the curtains open and we see a pretty incredible view of city center and Monte Carlo. I was totally happy with the floor to ceiling windows, the ultra plush bedding and the view. The bed is probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. OUTSTANDING!!! Husband is floored by the room. Probably one of the nicest hotel rooms we have ever stayed in...and we have stayed in many. He is immediately intrigued by the control panel that controls everything in the room. System is easy as pie to control and anyone who complains it's too complex must still be typing on a manual typewriter. I cannot understand how it's confusing to people. The room was clean, but I did notice a bit of dust on some tables and the phone in the bathroom. Now, normally I wouldn't even comment on this...but being a 5 diamond award winner, that just is NOT the norm or acceptable. BATHROOM-kind of a weird set up with the tub and shower in the same shower area. Never took a bath but I can see that being strange if we stayed longer. Ammenities in the room were restocked daily and the towels were standard towels but an ample supply. The shampoo, conditioner etc were nice but lower end bottles. 2 sinks and a nice hair dryer that worked perfect! Plenty of drawers and storage. Toilet has a seperate glass privacy door. CUSTOMER SERVICE~Later in that first day after a full day of exploring around the strip we come back to the hotel to get ready for dinner and a show and as soon as we get in the room, we hear a knock at the door. A guy is standing there with a tray of chocolate covered strawberries and chocolate dipped macaroons and a thank you/birthday card for DH. Nice touch Aria and Angela! Thank you! DH hates coconut and everything including the strawberries had coconut on them\u2026so I am the big winner in this! Delicious! Scrumptious! Yum. Nice touch! POOL~The pool area of this hotel is perfect! Day 2- I get down to the pool about 9:00am and the pool is just opening. Nice older gentleman running the pool area is handing out magazines and checking room cards etc. I go in, get towels (they let you have as many as you want) head all the way to the back on the left (I hear this is the pool with the less kids) and find a chair. The pool area is stunning. Very well landscaped and pretty. Clean. The pools are gorgeous. There are 3 pools plus the liquid party pool. The first pool on the left has several kids in it. I pass. 2nd pool was all shade but looked nice for later in the day. I pass. The 3rd pool was just perfect! I feel like Goldilocks telling this story!! Drink service is fast and efficient but expensive! $15.13 for a grey goose and pineapple...but hey! It is Vegas. The liquid pool was not too busy the day we were there. The music sounds great but is not obtrusive to the other pools. Never went in as the crowd in line seemed to be of the MUCH younger early 20 variety and resembled that of a college frat party or Jersey shore crowd! lol Definitely not OUR scene. RESTAURANT~Had the pleasure of trying American Fish inside of Aria. We went for drinks and an appetizer and loved it so much we stayed for dinner. The service from Christian at the bar was so good. He was very friendly, but not over the top and really good to check on us often and had a great personality. DH had a beer here and I order the pinot gris and it was very good for a happy hour selection. We also get the white truffle mac and cheese and the fish and chips. (happy hour version small but delicous samplings) Everything was delicious. Devine actually. We are still kinda hungry and have time before heading over to the show so we stay for dinner. Halibut for myself and scallops for him. Succulent and delicious\u2026we also shared the horseradish mashed potatoes. I know that doesn't sound like it really goes with fish, but it really was delicious! REALLY, really great meal. I wish we could eat there once a week! It was so good and one of our favorites of our short stay. Also had the pleasure of eating at jean philippe patisserie. Tried the chocolate croissant and it was the best dessert type yum to touch my lips in years!! ;) A MUST DO. SKYBOX BAR~Great little sports bar to grab a drink, watch the game and play video poker! Service was excellent. VIEW BAR~Not really sure what the \"view\" was, but the service was great! lol I guess it's mostly a place to people watch! EMPLOYEES~The employees at this hotel are outstanding! I cannot even begin to tell you how fast 2 1/2 days went or how much we enjoyed our stay here. From the taxi hailers to the management people-the customer service was stellar. I loved everything about the hotel. If I had one complaint it was that there is no fan in the bathroom. How weird is that? I saw the \"vent.\" But we could never find a switch that actually turned on a fan...not even on the techno wizard thing-a ma-bob. But, if thats one of my only complaints...I think they are doing just fine!! CHECK OUT~check out was kind of a nightmare compared to check in. I got to see what some people complain about. The lines today were crazy! It was Friday, so much busier than the Wednesday morning we had checked in. There is no organization. It's somewhat like trying to pick the \"best\" line at the grocery store and then you have that annoying crazy lady complaining about her coupons not coming off her bill correctly. DH stood in one line and myself in another and finally one of us made it up to the clerk. He wins. No problems after that. Amazing place and I would certainly stay again!!

Although this sounds really good, it wasn\u2019t one of my favorite places to stay on the Strip. I live in Los Angeles so travel to Las Vegas quite regularly and have stayed at a handful of hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. Pros: \u2022 My room was amazing, I had booked the standard room and was upgraded. My room was almost the size of my apartment \u2013 it had a huge living room area with a full couch and flatscreen TV, very comfortable king size bed, bathtub (which I did not use), two sinks and a TV in the bathroom. I had a view of the Monte Carlo (a hotel I love) so that was quite cool. \u2022 Design of the casino and lobby was quite cool. There was also natural light coming through which was nice. \u2022 It was easy to get around the hotel and I never had to wait very long for the lifts. Cons: \u2022 Checking in and checking out took a long time \u2022 No vending machines anywhere in the hotel. So if you didn\u2019t want to buy the expensive mini bar water you had to go to the convenience store on the lobby level, I found this quite frustrating. \u2022 The place where you leave your bags is outside, this was really annoying that you had to take your bags outside after check out. \u2022 The pool was okay, we had a large group and it was initially hard to find seats together. Going to the pool is one of my favorite things to do in Las Vegas and the pool experience at Aria was just okay for me. If you just want to go to the pool and lie there, this is the place for you! If you want a DJ and games and that kind of atmosphere, then it\u2019s not. \u2022 Was a little pricey compared to other hotels I have stayed it, I guess this is because it's new. Also be sure to check your bill, they didn't take my resort credit off my bill which they were meant to. Overall I would have liked to have given it a three and a half rating, it was the pool scene and the other cons mentioned above that lead to this rating. For me a huge part of my Vegas experience is the pool and at the Aria pool there wasn\u2019t much atmosphere by the pool.

While the hotel and room itself was really nice, clean and well equipped the cons I am about to list made it a place I won't stay at again. Firstly check in took an inordinate amount of time. Not only was the line long but each person was standing at the counter for ages and ages. My check in was a straight forward one in the sense that all my information was already there, it was pre paid etc but it still took forever. I have no idea what the person at check in was seeing and typing on his screen but it took for-ever. This really put me off. Secondly, bag storage is outside the hotel. Not a biggy but after standing at check in forever the last thing you want to do is drag everything outside again. Thirdly, while the Aria is described as being a center strip hotel, considering how far back it is from the strip you may as well be staying as far down as the MGM. The driveway is very very long (can I suggest a moving walkway?)! and it was a pain in the butt! and the number 1 thing that put me off. Fourthly, we got charged $8 for a weight sensored bag of chips we must have moved. Some clearer signs on the mini bar.snack policy wouldn't go astray.

Loved the funky tech features: as you enter the room the aircon & interactive TV comes to life and the curtain sweeps back to give you a jaw-dropping view of The Strip from floor to ceiling windows. Our suite was high up and my favorite thing was lying in marshmellow soft bed looking out at the Vegas night life. The suite interiors are hushed, cool tones that offset the crisp white linen on the magnificently soft, orgy-size Sealy bed. The first thing we do when unpacking is put our valuables into the room safe and this was no ordinary safe... built unobtrusively into a bedside table its solid enough to secure the Crown Jewels and your winnings! The Aria pool is THE place to be seen, sipping on a frozen Mojito. The jugs are better value and you need one, in these desert temperatures. We parked ourselves at the bottom end of the main pool and its was a never-ending parade of bikinis and boardshorts. It rocked! We arrived at the pool in the afternoon, too late to hire a cabanas, but would recommend the exclusivity and the private mist spray to keep your cool in these temperatures. For a big city I was amazed how easy Aria was to get into and out of and the free self parking is simply a bonus. Last thoughts on Aria, do dine in the Sage restaurant. Its subdued lighting oozes uber chicness, a respite from the sensory overload of Vegas. I recommend the creme brulee fondant of foie gras followed by the New York Strip steak.

Vettro restaurant which is also (amazingly!) blasting music no one really wants to hear anymore....this place was a huge let down (massive). Speaking of Vettro...the first place I've seen dinner served under a metal cover since visiting a nursing home/hospital. The food was about as good. I can only reason that my table was so...far....away...from the kitchen door that the cover was needed to keep the food warm on the journey? Our server was very nice, if a bit odd. One plus was the meal at Jean Georges steakhouse...the server was also very nice, and the food, what little there was of it, was very tasty (thankfully the bill was being expensed...I could buy a week's worth of dinners for the price of a steak, one side, and a glass of wine there!) As for the actual room...while the fancy bathroom area was quite impressive, there were some quirks (I'm not the only person on here who found the toilet to be a bit high), and I don't like having my toothbrush, etc. all rearranged for me by housekeeping (ewww!) I would prefer an empty, cold fridge for bottled water, to an extortionist vending machine in my 'luxury' room (who 'buys' this stuff?), and if I had to do much work in my (dark) room (there was a desk lamp, but if you leave it on for an hour, you could brand cattle with it), I would have really been irked...I'm sure it's great for lounging, not what I was here for. The bedcover was all snagged, as if someone rubbed a giant piece of velcro all over it...it made the room seem kind of 'used up'. However, the bed itself, and especially the pillow, were very comfortable. I could not get the hang of the push-button lights/curtains/etc., and I had a total Mr. Bean moment when I tried to set the fancy touch-screen alarm clock and could not stop opening/closing the curtains and turning the music and bedside lights on and off repeatedly....the whirrrr the power curtains make is kind of eerie, especially at 5:30 in the morning! Really effective at waking me up though! (altho I set my phone alarm too after all that, just in case) I bet lounging for days at the Aria (I never did see the pool) is awesome, if money is no object. (I did have a quick manicure, and thought what I saw of the spa/salon to be really nice....the blank marble wall in the manicure area was like a spa for the eyes!) However, if you're in Vegas for business, overall, this is not the best, most functional location.

A very good air conditioning system meant very good sleeps on all three nights. It did take us a short while to learn how to work all of the electronic controls in the room but after that it was very easy. The pools (there are 3 including one oriented more towards kids) are great. There are lots of trees providing shade if you don't want the full sun and they also give the impression that you are not in the middle of the strip in Las Vegas. There is good service from the pool bar. I cannot say enough good things about the concierge service. They are very professional and like all of the staff are friendly. They make complex things look easy. The casino is present in the hotel but does not dominate. Unlike the older hotels, the ARIA appears to be designed more as a good place to take the family, have business meetings or attend a convention. The staff appear to have been selected for their people skills and besides being friendly, have been given the mandate to correct any problems during your stay there. The exercise facility is well run. When you first arrive they provide you with an exercise towel, headphones, bottled water and papers/magazines if you wish to read. The machines there are professional quality and the facility is clean. I don't run into many places that make a point of how \"green\" their facility is and how they recycle.

I am so in love with this property. This is our second visit and this time we used the corporate M-Life comp. Three nights in a Suite with some food credit and some free play. That is the nicest room I have ever stayed in. I have stayed in a Premium Palace tower room and, Augustus Tower room at Caesars but there is no comparison to this property. Even the regular rooms are outstanding at ARIA. \u201cBut on to the suite!\u201d Wall of windows in living room and a 55 inch wall hung TV. Dining table, couch, desk, and a bar complete with a refrigerator. (Minnibar fridge also) Wall of windows turns a corner in the bedroom, and back wall window in bath. All windows are floor to ceiling and the curtains automatically open upon entering the room to a fantastical view of the strip and city center complex. Wow!!! WOW!!!!!!!!! Simply too nice, only room I ever spent any time in Vegas. All controls can be operated from the remote control. I never had to turn out a light of adjust the blackout curtains, just melted away on the comfy couch until I completely dissolved into the comfy bed. Powder room just off the entrance is handy for master bath privacy and contained a glass sink top that was approaching art status. Travertine bathroom with jetted tub, TV, large shower, dual vanities and toilet room. Futuristic toilet with a \u201cWashlet\u201d. This thing warm water washes your backside, front side, all sides and warm air dries the jobsite, all which come from the comfort of a cushioned heated toilet seat. A Japanese innovation that is just too dang cool. Real innovation here; I am not fond of gimmicky things but after my Vegas stay I have got to get one of these. They can really change the landscape so to speak; a full moon never looked so good! Price research reveals they run from five hundred to twenty five hundred bucks. The gambling was fun and up and down. The table limits were ten bucks and fifteen and up on the Friday and weekend. I love this casino. Layout and decorations just fit me and I am comfortable and happy here. We ate the weekend seafood buffet brunch at the ARIA. I came for the legs. That was done well. The price included a two pound lobster cut for two and it was good but having just had lobster at the \u201cPalms\u201d it did not compare, just a distraction really. The king crab legs were very good, medium to large if you looked for them but they were split so it was quite easy to maneuver. They are served cold but I had them steamed in about two minutes and that made them excellent and reduced the salt content. Quick and easy! The other buffet items were not good. Unlawfully overcooked lamb that even though I knew better I tried. I cried! Jerky was mere minutes away. Beef round that was just rare but tough and unpleasant, and no lamb chops. Pizza was good and I am not a pizza fan. Comes with wine but we drink water. Desserts are creative and excellent. Flan that was perfection, cooked to just the right consistency. Oreo something that was nothing like a cookie but was a divine chocolate something. Excellent gelato, I guess we have to call it that because we are in Vegas but it was fine homemade ice cream and sorbets. Also ate breakfast there once and although the egg station cooked was efficient and precise the other selections were mundane buffet food. No fresh squeezed OJ ( not the criminal, the fruit) but again the dessert was nice. Lago at Caesars by a mile. I am so sorry that I cannot express delight in the ARIA buffet but after two trips we swore off anything but a restaurant experience. That is my sole complaint with this property. I also will say that as I have gotten older I am not running to the B to wait in line for year to get buffet that is better but just another fancy buffet and you waited in line for a year!!! The other dining choices on this property are very good to exceptional. Lemon Grass Wonderful lunch here. Dim sum cart was fun, fresh, and tasty! Had the Pho which was very good and wife had a corn soup that was excellent with Satay Chicken. About fifty bucks for a nice lunch with three selections of wonderful dim sum. A beautiful restaurant with excellent service. Jean Philippe Patisserie This is a stellar operation. World class pastries, fresh salads, pannini, tasty sandwiches on an array of breads you would expect from a bakery. Wonderful coffee, and a world class cinnamon roll make this place my \u201cgo to\u201d when I want a CharlieSheenWINNING\u201d experience. Julian Serrano I was just itching to eat here. I have lived in Madrid and was impressed that Julian Serrano was from there and he was bringing his native food to Vegas. I just loved the food in Madrid and I was expecting the memory stimulating fine dining experience of yesteryear. Although the preparation was excellent, and the service sterling alas it was not the synapse building meal I had wished for. The restaurant was beautiful and alluring reminding me of Madrid\u2019s tapas bars. The paella was beautifully presented just too similar to Jambalaya, not close enough to the classic Castilian paella. Too much tomato flavor and not enough saffron flavors. The rice was red from tomatoes instead of yellow orange with saffron. The chorizo was original and excellent and the seafood was fresh and tasty but overall it failed my test as perfect paella. The potatoes bravas were very good and the sauce was fresh. A well done dish but again in Madrid at \u201cLas Bravas\u201d potatoes bravas is a classic tapas dish that cemented synapses for future reference and Julian did not send a signal over those neuron pathways. Calamari was excellent presented with an aolei sauce. IMHO only! Very good just not the exceptional experience that I was expecting. About fifty bucks a person for everything. Paella was for two and takes thirty minutes to prepare. Now that part is authentic. American Fish by Michael Mina This was the exceptional dining experience I was seeking. I have to seek adverbs to distinguish this meal. First the restaurant is lovely, tucked away behind the escalator on the promenade in ARIA. The bar was beautiful with a birch tree forest behind the bar mirrored so it looks like it continues forever. Happy hour was four to seven and we thought we would try the menu as it contains many of Michael Mina\u2019s dishes in smaller portions for five bucks each. One of a kind cocktail\u2019s for seven bucks each. We had the shrimp and grits, fish and chips and a cheese steak sandwich. IT WAS STELLAR. Food was fresh and well presented. Shrimp and grits were the best I have ever had and I am from the gulf coast where many chefs prepare this classic dish with great success. Perfectly prepared grits, thick and creamy, containing chunks of smoky bacon and lightly laced with a smattering of cheese melted and mixed into the grits topped with a heavenly jalape\u00f1o sauce that was all flavor, subtle spice and two inch flags of crisp thin bacon standing between the shrimp which were grilled and on top of the grits. Perfect! Fish and chips were hot crisp bits of battered fish among golden fried potatoes accented with malt vinegar. Excellent!! Sandwich was a tremendous hit but was relegated to third place because of the first two unusually exceptional choices. We repeated the shrimp and grits and the fish and chips because of adoration for the flavor and my deadly sin of gluttony. Had a few cocktails, \u201cRemember the Maine\u201d, \"Jasmine\" and a \"Blood and Sand\" that were unusually interesting and prepared with utmost care and presentation. Excellent and just seven bucks each. We were so impressed we ventured towards the dessert menu. A sampler of four of his best and it was the final jackpot of the night. JACKPOT, JACKPOT, JACKPOT!!!! A mascarpone cheesecake, smooth and creamy perfectly prepared; rice pudding with lemon sorbet, tangy and sweet; a carrot cake topped with unbelievable carrot sorbet. It was a fine and creative combination; cake and carrot sorbet, beautifully colored and delicious. The final of the four was an excellent chocolate mousse selection topped with mocha gelato. This will be indelibly imprinted in our minds as a fantastic overall experience in dining, and all for under a hundred bucks. Thanks for the very happy hour Michael Mina!!!

Well scented with a deep dark brown wood. Check in was very smooth and fast. Very little questions asked with very attentive front desk/concierge. Walk to the elevator was confusing at the beginning, but that's a given since all Vegas' hotels are like this. Once you get your way around it, it becomes a breeze. There was an added security to the elevator area, which was nice/annoying, depending on your mood. Rooms were marvelous. It's very nice to have soft music playing and the curtain open automatically when you first walk into the room. Very pleasantly surprised. My only concern is the touch screen master remote control. I found it easy to use, but I'm quite sure many will not. Like all top quality hotels in Vegas, the standard high quality amenities were provided. Aria is very spacious and its restaurants/food options are plentiful. Like every other Vegas' hotel, there is always a line up for the buffet, even when half the restaurant is empty. Food presentation was quite minimal, just like the hotel's overall design. But the quality was most definitely there. I counted 5 carving stations. But the highlight of the meal was most definitely their dessert. They have one of the BEST buffet dessert in Vegas.

I liked the whole touch screen technology that controls everything in the room. My main problem with the Aria is the location. It's set way way back from the strip. All the other hotels seem to be easy to walk right off the strip into the hotel. Aria seemed like a 10 minute walk to get from the hotel to the strip. If you like to walk from hotel to hotel in my opinion the Aria is not for you. Food options were good. For casual dinning I liked Lemongrass. Skybox was pretty good also. Jean Philippe Patisserie was amazing. Probably best thing about the hotel. For the more upscale restaurants Barmasa was pretty good, Julian Serrano was also good but kind of limited menu.

The bellman told us to use the invited guests check in, even though we were not invited, which was quick and no questions asked. We loved our corner suite; it was well worth the upgrade with a huge master bathroom plus second half bath, nicely sized bedroom and separate living room with couch, side chairs and desk. In addition to the mini-bar, there was a small refrigerator as well. The technical aspect of the TV, Lights, Thermostat and Curtains was cool, not at all difficult to figure out. The bed was comfortable although not as over the top fantastic that I was anticipating. Housekeeping always cleaned up the room within our requested timeframe. TIP: Always call housekeeping when you are ready to leave the room and tell them you need it cleaned as soon as possible or by a specific time. We enjoyed the pools; they were very nice although fairly crowded. Had lunch at the Liquid Pool, which is the party pool. TIP: If you don't want to pay the cover charge entrance fee to get in, they will allow you in if you have lunch, but you must spend $50 per person per hour. Liquid is loud and wild, lots of eye candy, but as a middle aged couple who prefer mellow music, the techno blast was a bit too much for us. While at Aria, we attended the Elvis Show, which was very good. We had breakfast at Cafe Vettro, which was average at best. Our best dinners were at Beso and Todd English PUB at Crystals next door, as well as the Palm at Caesars where we ate after the Celine Concert. (Main reason for our trip to Las Vegas was to see Celine; she was fabulous as always; 4th time for us). We enjoyed \"window shopping' at Crystals, but it is very high end. There are some interesting \"art pieces\" at Crystals and we enjoyed the waterfall wall at Aria. We did very little gambling at Aria as the blackjack minimums start at $15. Our only complaint about Aria and it is a MAJOR ONE; the noise level from one of the nightclubs in the complex. We were inundated with the thumping music till 4:00 in the morning on both Friday and Saturday nights.

In addition, the electronic controls in the room were difficult to figure out. The parking garage was difficult to navigate, and I resorted to parking at the Monte Carlo rather than the Aria after a couple wrong-way turns. The buffet was mediocre at best. The casino itself was very dark & cave-like -- not inviting, so I did not play at the Aria. While I appreciate the presence of security at the elevators, it made me wonder why it was necessary in the first place; as a female traveling alone, it was a bit of a concern. I found the employees -- from the concierge & check desk staff to the coffeehouse & buffet servers -- to be unfriendly and inconvenienced by my presence.

We had our own sinks and the bathroom had it's own separate door for privacy. Shower and bath are separate. Everything was electronic and high tech. When you wanted housekeeping to come, you punched it in to this master control panel, which lit up outside your door number \"service please\". They come right away too. My friend got hit with the stomach flu and housekeeping was amazing about returning to clean our bathroom multiple times. The hotel has many quality restaurants and a big variety. I did not feel the need to venture out of the hotel for food. The room service was top quality too. I had never had a better pizza in my life than the one on the room service menu.

They advertise that the rooms come with a mini fridge, but what they forget to mention is that, like most overpriced hotels, it is fully stocked with $4 sodas and $12 bags of peanuts so you cannot use it for your drinks and/or water. On top of that they have another fully stocked/overpriced bar that sits right on top of the desk that you lay your purse down on. This is so that you knock over all of the $20 bags of almonds when you go to grab ur purse and \"accidently\" bump these items and have to pay for them when you do not consume them. They also have a resort fee that is not included in the price and it includes things that you typically don't use when in Vegas anyway. The bars that are inside the hotel lobby are just as overpriced as everything else here. The minimum for a drink is $20.00, so you are better off going to a destination outside of the hotel. The casino is the one place you want to stay away from.

Our room overlooked the pool area, which was great for me, as I could see where the beach chairs were available. The room is controlled by the TV, which was kind of a pain, because our remote control was slow and sometimes you would press the button and nothing would happen....so you would press HARD on the button, but still nothing. However, there are controls on the walls as well. The shower is in front of the bathtub, which is interesting but not very convenient if you want to take a bath and someone gets in the shower. I was sad that there was no drying line available in the bathroom to hang up wet swimsuits. And the electrical plug in the bathroom is in the middle of the two sinks, so if you blowdry your hair, you will sweep everything off of the sink with the hairdryer cord. The toilet has a glass partition/door that you can still see through, so no privacy there....Overall, the room was clean, the bed was super comfortable (if a bit soft), and the staff is very friendly. The pool was fantastic, it was not too crowded but very hot (it was June) and the pool drinks take 20 minutes to get to you and they cost $20 a drink. The frozen mojito was awesome though, very cold and minty. I saw some people that brought alcohol and mixers out to the pool, which is a great idea (but where to get the ice cubes?). The casino was clean and nice, mostly $1 or penny slots and lots of table gaming. We only at at Cafe Vettro, which was good food but terrible ambiance.

It's located at a spot called City Center, right at The Strip (Las Vegas Blvd). This complex features another two hotels - Vdara and Mandarin - and a high-class shopping, Crystals (Prada, Gucci, etc.). It's very close to Bellagio and his fountains, Paris and the Eiffel Tower (great restaurant!) and many other attractions right on the street. Aria is a high-tech hotel. Rooms are spacious, well decorated and filled with up-to-date electronics - lcd tv, media center connector, power curtains, programmable lighting, all under control of a touch-screen tablet. It's a geek paradise. Aria also has a casino. Almost all Vegas hotels have, so what's the point? The point is, in general, you have to cross the casino area in order to reach the guests elevators, and Aria isn't different (ok, there's a shortcut, but just a few people use it). Crossing a casino area is the best way to get \"smoked\" by cigars and cigarettes from gamblers. For those of us who don't smoke, this is disgusting. And here lies the main difference. Everywhere you wander around inside Aria - including casino - you smell vanilla! You can smell your clothes, after crossing the casino area, and you won't find any cigarette smell in it. Fantastic. Aria has a wonderful buffet, where guests usually have breakfast. Food has superb quality (for a buffet) and price is generous. One minor glitch is the sunday breakfast. You can't have your ordinary buffet breakfast - you have to have brunch, and price is higher. The option is to have breakfast in a p\u00e2tisserie, in the first floor, by the casino. It's also good, but it's not the same. And we can see no point in having breakfast by slot machines... Staff is very nice, both front desk and concierge. Daily rates are fair - in fact, with all those newnesses and amenities, it's a good deal. We had one problem, though. We had cancelled our reservation at Vdara and switched to Aria, for they had a promo including breakfast, limited to US$ 40. We had understood that those US$40 were a limit on a daily basis, not for all the stay, as they said. This wasn't clear at their website and they knew that, because, when we complained, they \"granted\" us another US$40, for the \"inconvenience\". So, here's the tip: if they have a promo, double check it. Anyway, of course we would come back.

I was there for business and my husband came along to see the sights. Good points about the hotel were location (we walked everywhere), service (hotel personnel are everywhere and are very helpful), and the decor (very, very nice but not as over the top and garish as others.) I appreciated the fact that gambling did not appear to be the hotel's sole reason for its existence - - yes, you have to walk through the casino to get to your hotel room, but just about everything else in the hotel was free of gambling mania. While I have some complaints, on balance if I have to go to Vegas again, this is where I'd choose to stay. Check in on a Sunday afternoon was surprisingly slow. There were plenty of hotel clerks available but each transaction seemed to require 10 or more minutes. Our reservation was on file and was processed quickly. Our room was clean but not immaculate - - there was dust on the knick knacks (easy to spot when you opened the curtains) and the very dark color of the carpet was a dead giveaway to where more vacuuming was needed. Neither of us liked the mattress (too soft) but that's personal preference. There's a 'sophisticated interactive panel' that controls the lights, music, TV and curtains but I found it annoying. By the time you figure out how to use these things, it is time to leave. Some people may enjoy these kinds of gadgets but I would much prefer the 'old fashioned' on off switch. Check out was easy if you use the Express check out. However, we've been back three days and I haven't received the email copy of my bill, as I was promised. The pool area is beautiful. We ate at the poolside Breeze cafe which was less fabulous than advertised but it was nice to be able to sit outdoors and enjoy the weather. There's a spa which we did not use and the Cirque du Soleil show was 'dark' the two nights we were there. We also ate at Cafe Vetro for breakfast (overpriced, in my view) and at Sage for dinner (expensive but the food is very very good). We also had a very late dinner at the tapas place and loved it. We walked through several of the other big hotels during our stay and while I can't speak to their rooms, what I liked about Aria was the fact that it made me feel like I was in a very nice, high end hotel. The other hotels were, for my taste, so ostentatious in their decor that I felt like I had been dropped into some parallel universe where everything is outrageously oversized and overdone.

We ate at a few restaurants in the hotel (Sage for dinner, American Fish for happy hour, Cafe Vettro for after show snack). All three restaurants were great- Go to Sage if you're looking for a fine dining experience. The service was superior and the food was exquisite. American Fish has a happy hour from 5pm-7pm. They had a selection fo appetizers and drinks for $5. The food was delicious yet small- great for a pre show drink/snacks. Cafe Vettro is good for casual dining although service was a little spotty. The room itself was clean and modern. I love the bedside remote control (where you are able to control everything!). It was so nice to open up the blinds in the morning without having to get out of bed. The view was pretty good too- request a floor above the 30th floor. Cons- They didn't have a king bed available for the first night of our stay but offered to switch us the 2nd night. They told us they would call our room around 12 so we can do the switch. However, we had to call them 2-3 times before we were finally able to switch. In the 2nd room, the remote for the tv was missing and we called for room service to bring one up- but it never came.

I would definitely stay at ARIA again!", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful room - less than great service - not sure if I'll return.\u201d", "Author": "JennAly", "ReviewID": "UR111600324", "Content": "Given the very mixed reviews of Aria, I wanted to be sure to write a review of my recent trip; we were at Aria May 30 \u2013 June 2, 2011. To give some background, my husband and I are in our early 30s and go to Vegas about every four months. I am not particularly loyal to any hotel in Vegas, but the Mirage is probably our favorite. As soon as Aria opened and we saw their corner suites, we knew we wanted to stay there at some point. We arrived at Aria around 11:00 a.m. and waited in line for about 15 minutes hoping to check in. While in line I noticed that nobody was able to check in but the front desk clerk seemed to go through the same charade of looking for rooms for every customer and then telling them they had nothing available. I understand fully that check in time isn\u2019t until later in the afternoon, but what I don\u2019t understand is why they waste the time acting like they are looking for a room and then telling you they have nothing available. This happened to at least 10 people while we were in line. No surprise, when we got to the desk they took our credit card info and did all of the registration for us and told us that we would receive a text message when our room was ready. This clerk was not overly friendly, but certainly wasn\u2019t rude. We booked a corner suite, and I requested a non smoking room on a high floor \u2013 hoping for something over the 50th floor \u2013 the told me that they could request a room on a high floor (which I was informed meant anything over the 12th floor). Being that it wasn\u2019t the weekend, it didn\u2019t seem that this would be an issue. We went to eat and received a text at around 1:30 telling us our room was ready. We went back to the front desk to pick up our keys; the clerk on this encounter was EXCEPTIONALLY rude \u2013 quite honestly she was the rudest front desk clerk I have ever encountered on any trip anywhere. She tells us that we have a room on the 7th floor \u2013 this is really disappointing because the reason we wanted a corner suite was for the views. I asked if it was possible for us to get anything else and she said she had a smoking room on the 11th floor. She said she had no idea when another room would be available because many people would not be checking out until after 6:00 p.m. Begrudgingly, we took the room on the 7th floor. We got into the room and it was nice enough. While waiting for our luggage to be delivered we both started noticing how worn the room was looking for such a new hotel. Spots on the carpet, scuffs on the walls \u2013 things you won\u2019t imagine you\u2019d see at this hotel at this point. The longer we were in the room we noticed that one of the toilets was running non-stop and the mini-bar was warm. These issues were nothing in comparison to the window rattling noise from the pool/day-club at the Cosmo. I felt so old for this to bother me \u2013 but it really was extremely obnoxious and it was the loudest in the bedroom. After showering and getting ready, I decided this wasn\u2019t going to work for me \u2013 had the trip been comped I might have been willing to overlook it, but given that we had paid for this trip especially paid for an upgraded room we needed to be moved. I called the front desk and this time got an extremely friendly clerk, she told me that she would move our room but that they didn\u2019t have any other corner suites available so we\u2019d be getting a larger suite. She told me that she\u2019d call me back after she got everything squared away; nearly an hour later I hadn\u2019t heard anything back (shame on me for not making a note of her name). I called the front desk back and got another friendly person, she looked it up and there were notes on the room \u2013 she was able to get us assigned to the new room while I was on the phone, she indicated that the keys should work to get us into the new room. She didn\u2019t know what kind of suite the room was but indicated it was a city view room on the 25th floor and it was on the opposite side of the Cosmo so the noise shouldn\u2019t be an issue. We went to our new room and were pleasantly surprised, this room was in much better shape and the views were outstanding. After looking at the website I think that the suite was a Crystals Suite although the floor plan wasn\u2019t very much like the one they show. The room was beautiful, regardless of how I feel about the service, the casino and the hotel as a whole; I will not deny that this room was outstanding. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on \u2013 I was not looking forward to going home and sleeping on my bed after this! The technology in this hotel really is cool, I love that the curtains open and shut electronically. As others have pointed out the touch 4 system that controls things is a bit slower than one might like, but it was still a nice feature. I\u2019d like to add that you can still control your lights, curtains and temperature from switches on the wall, you don\u2019t have to use the touch 4 control panel to do so. The bathroom was unbelievable, floor to ceiling windows all along the front and side of the room. There was a tub facing the windows so you could take a bath and look at the city all lit up at night. There was even a really nice sitting area with two chairs in the bathroom to enjoy the view from. I did find it odd that there was virtually no counter space in this bathroom, there was also only one drawer \u2013 oh well \u2013 not that big of a deal. Housekeeping did a great job throughout the stay and even provided turn down service on our last night without us even asking. At the end of the stay we tried to use the TV to express check out, but it encountered and error and told us to call the front desk. Our dining credits from the promotion we booked came off without a problem \u2013 it was good to not have to argue about that, as it seems some people have had to. To be perfectly honest, I\u2019m not entirely sure whether or not I\u2019d stay here again. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we had a great time on our trip \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with Aria. I feel like there were too many little issues, that all kind of ran together and left a bad taste in my mouth about their service. I\u2019m very certain that there is no way that every single suite that they had was either occupied or dirty when I checked in on a Monday \u2013 even if it was after the holiday weekend. Furthermore, I\u2019m sure that not every single guest room was occupied \u2013 so why weren\u2019t other people allowed to check in. Little things like that really go along way in making people recommend a hotel. To that end, I have NEVER been turned away at Mirage \u2013 I have checked in there as early at 8:00 a.m. and they were happy to get me into a room at that time. My advice to anyone would be to have reasonable expectations \u2013 I would say that this hotel is not really operating at a 5 star/diamond level \u2013 the service is lacking, as is some attention to detail (there was a recessed light out in the living room that was never attended to). If you get a good deal and can get a suite, I think you really will enjoy your room. If you are staying over a weekend and don\u2019t want to hear the noise from the Cosmo, I\u2019d recommend asking for a room on the opposite side of the hotel.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "orlando", "Title": "\u201cNice to look at\u201d", "Author": "kingmanOrlando", "ReviewID": "UR111583355", "Content": "Adding our comments agreeing with other reviewers who said the place is gorgeous, but for the money, the service and amenities don't add up.

Given that the ARIA is billed as a 5-star property, it's only two years old, and we reserved a premier corner suite, we had very high expectations for our stay. Sadly, the horrible customer service we received upon check-in marred our perception of the resort. After a 25 minute wait at the front desk, I was finally \"assisted\" (if you can call it that) by one of the surliest customer service representatives I have encountered in years - and I travel frequently. She quite literally did not speak to me when I first approached the counter; I spoke to her first to inform her that I was checking in. She then said \"name and credit card\", and never uttered another word (no greeting, no courtesies, no addressing me by name - nothing). I was stunned by her rudeness, but the story gets worse - she next disappeared behind a rear counter for several minutes, where I could see her conferring with a colleague, but was offered no explanation of the delay. When she eventually returned, she informed me that the non-smoking suite booked was not available, and I had two options: I could either accept a higher-category suite on a smoking floor, or wait 3-4 hours for a non-smoking room to be available. Obviously, neither option was acceptable to me, and we went around and around on this before I was finally situated in a non-smoking suite. This entire process took a full hour, and I was livid. Later that evening, my husband and I started chatting with another couple and discovered that their check-in experience had been nearly as bad - they too were informed that their designated room category was not available, but were then told that they either had to wait hours for a room, or alternatively pay $75.00/night to upgrade to a higher room category. On the plus side, the suites are stunning - if you can overlook the ordeal at check-in and finally gain access to your room. The decor is sleek and modern without being sterile, and every inch of the place was spotless. There are some particularly nice features, such as the plasma TVs in the living room, bedroom, and bathroom (located opposite the whirlpool tub), and the automated lighting, sound, and service menu that is accessible from the TV remotes. I would also highly recommend the hotel restaurants (we ate at three). If you're looking for a bargain, go elsewhere, but we definitely got what we paid for - quality food and exemplary service.

When going to Vegas I expect to get ripped off at the tables, at the bars and a dinner, but not by my hotel. When I booked our room I signed up for the \"free breakfast\" deal. When we checked in (a process which took 45 minutes given everyone in front of us needed an explanation for all the random charges they drop on you) we were told to make sure we take advantage of our free breakfast. On Sunday morning we head down to get our free breakfast buffet, when we try to enter we are asked to sign a room charge of almost $70, we ask why as our breakfast is free and are told that it will just be deducted later. Somewhat perplexed, we ask why it isn't automatic and the woman explains that she doesn't know how much of a credit we have so can't just let us in without us agreeing to pay. Just to be safe, we decide to head to the front desk to confirm our breakfast will be free. Shocker, it isn't. We only have the weekday free breakfast (interesting given we are not staying on a weekday morning) but we can apply that to the weekend breakfast, so the breakfast is only $30. At not point would this have been clear without going down to check. It is only $30, minor blip in the weekend expenses, but really poor form by the hotel. I argue with the desk person who agrees to have the additional $30 waived. Feeling better, we go off to have easily some of the worst food ever. Later in the day we head down to check out. A process which takes an hour given everyone in front of us is arguing about the strange charges on their final bill. When we review our final bill, the $30 for breakfast is there at which point I have to argue the point again. The hotel eventually took the charge off, but I remain livid that they would try to get that extra sliver of money. Had the overall experience been better I would have spent well beyond that at the hotel, instead we went other places, and we would go back, we will never stay there again.

The hotel was very clean and in a perfect location, almost right in the middle of the strip. The views from our hotel room were amazing and the room was definetly great, with plenty of space, a beautiful bathroom and unbelievable bed - it was seriously difficult to sleep on my own bed after sleeping on theirs for 3 nights. The pools were also very nice, there was plently of room and again the service was great. The casino was what you would expect, very large with plently of ways to blow your money - although it just didn't have the same atmosphere as alot of the others. My only issue with the hotel was that it was almost too trendy for the average couple. Most of the bars, resturants in the hotel were more of your high class places with a high price tag. Also the shopping area right nearby the hotel was neat, but I didn't even have enough money to walk in those stores (ie. Gucci, Versace, Louis Vuitton). The hotel also has a tram that takes you down only a couple of hotels, not really a long ride but it beats walking through the storm of homeless or people trying to put you on vip lists or sell you show tickets. My wife and I walked through the Monte Carlo Hotel just nearby - it seemed like a hotel more suited for the average person, with resturants youve actually heard of, a pub bar, and a pool that had more than just a circle of water, with a lazy river, a wave pool, and a little bit more flare. So, in summary - the aria was a great hotel with great service, but we found ourselves going to other hotels quite often (Monte Carlo, MGM, Bellagio) to do things at instead of ours. If your an average couple making an average salary - the Aria hotel may not be the best selection for you.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston TX", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Aria\u201d", "Author": "JMOrlando", "ReviewID": "UR110365110", "Content": "Just arrived home after 4 day stay - we absolutely loved the Aria.

Get ready to wait for everything.\u201d", "Author": "drfaust206", "ReviewID": "UR110262415", "Content": "We stayed for two nights in May 2011. What you read in others' reviews about the service here is basically what we experienced. We arrived and waited in line to check in for over 30 minutes, even though there were only 4 people in line ahead of us. We were told our room was not ready (we showed up around 2pm), and that they would call us when our room was ready for check in. That happened around 4:25pm. That's bizarre, since the published check-in time is 3pm. After we got to the room, the bell service had our bags to us in about 5 minutes, which was a big surprise. Pretty good, IMO The next morning we, we were in a hurry to eat quickly so we went to the buffet. At the cashier, we tried to charge the buffet to our room, but she said that we couldn't because we hadn't left a credit card at the front desk. But we had. She said she would call the front desk to find out... wait wait wait wait... We had left our credit card, but hadn't authorized room charges on it, apparently. Bizarre. I've never heard of a hotel taking your credit card, but not authorizing room charges. Cashier said she would try to get it authorized... wait wait wait wait. Then she hung up and said she'd call them again. We were out of time, so we just paid there with the credit card. She tells us to talk to the front desk. So then we're shepherded to a waiting area. No line or anything... they just make us wait for a table. It was 7:30am and the buffet dining room was practically empty. Wait wait wait. Wait some more. Then... randomly, we're taken to a table. No one left, they didn't clear any tables. They just make you wait. After breakfast, I go back to the front desk to try to get room charges authorized, but of course, I have to wait in line for 25 minutes. She tells me that you have to explicitly authorize room charges on your card when you check in. There are lots more incidents like this... mostly involving poor service followed by waits to make up for the poor service. It seems to me, if they did it right the first time, there would be way less waiting for everyone, since people wouldn't have to stand in line 3 times to get one thing done. The in-room tech was interesting, but malfunctioned on us a few times. We couldn't get to the blinds to open and close, etc. At check-out, we tried to check out via the TV, but it didn't work. I didn't want to wait in line at the front desk, so I called downstairs and of course was put on hold for 10 minutes. That's probably shorter than the wait would have been in the lobby, actually. Actually, the best service we had was picking up our bags from the bellman when we were getting our cab to the airport. It took 3 minutes, he was incredibly friendly and helpful. A few nice things -- the property was beautiful. The casino was great, and the dealers were great. I enjoyed the spa, the pool and the fitness room. And the quality of the breakfast buffet was far beyond what I anticipated. I usually don't hold out much for buffets, but the food on this one was quite good.

I read all those negative reviews, and almost switched, but i'm so glad I didn't. Let me start with check in. We walked in waited no more than 3 minutes, and went right to the window she was so nice, it took her 5 minutes to check us in.As far as the Vanilla smell everybody was complaining about, I didn't even notice it until my girlfriend said something.It's so faint, you hardly notice it. We stayed in a deluxe city view room and it was perfect. We were on the 23rd floor, our views were spectacular. If I knew how to upload a picture on here, I would so you could see it. I can't compare it with the corner suites, because i didn't see them,but this was a great room,We were in room 23050 it was four rooms from the elavator but we wouldn't have cared if it was 100 rooms from the elavator. We're not lazy. We enjoyed every minute. Our room was spotless, the bed was super comfortable. The contol panel was very easy to use. Room service was great.Anything we asked for came up in just a few minutes. As a matter of fact, when we needed more towels, the guy came up with them on a silver platter.As far as gambling, we did good.The Aria is very quiet It's like nobody is there,because it is so big. It's totally different than any of the other hotels.We got to use our comp points to eat.Speaking of food, try the philly cheese steak at the sky sports bar, best you'll ever have.We never paid for drinks because they are free when you gamble. I can't tell you too much about food because we didn't eat alot. Check out was easier than check in. They printed our boarding passes for us. We will definately will stay here again. Im' trying not to leave anything out. Everybody was friendly. The dessert place(Jean Phillip) was good but not great. You can take a tram to hotels like Monte carlo or bellagio and then get out and walk to cesars that part of the strip or if you want to go to luxor or mandelay bay you take the monte carlo tram and walk, nothing is far from the hotel.You can walk, it's easy, but crossing the street, you got to find a bridge or a crossswalk. I'll tell you, anybody that complained that wrote bad reviews, must have a tough time in life with everything. It was perfect and must go back soon. One thing they should add is a coffee shop like a dunkin donuts or starbucks for Ice coffees. You can get them, but they're not the same. But that's no big deal.

We had booked a Deluxe King Room thru Orbitz since it was almost the same price as the other lesser rated hotels and this one was rated as a 5 star. The hotel itself is impressive. HUGE! And just beautiful inside and out. This was our first time to Vegas, so we had no expectations or anything to compare to. However, service in this hotel is non existent. We travel a lot domestically and internationally and are not that hard to please, IMO. This is my first negative review about a hotel. First, when we checked in, the lady was very curt and not pleasant at all. We had booked a package where 2 free buffets per day were included. We had to argue with her and show her proof of the offer which luckily I had brought along. She still had to get a manager who also made a big deal about honoring the promotion and said \"Orbitz has hung us out to dry\" as they didn't have any details about such promotion. Second, the room was on the 12th floor and since the hotel is so big, we had to drag our luggage all the way across the casino and then find the appropriate elevators to get to our floor. No sign of any bell hop or anyone to help guide us. Third, the room was nicely decorated, however we came to realize that housekeeping at this hotel is horrible! There was dust and grime on the furniture. There were make up stains on the linens and towels. There was no garbage can in the bathroom. The door handle on the bathroom door kept falling off every time I closed the door. This is not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel that is relatively new. During our entire stay, housekeeping was consistently negligent on basic things, like refilling toiletries and replacing towels and wiping down furniture. Although the electronic drapes were a cool feature, the control pad to control the lights, TV, etc., was so frustrating to figure out that we just did everything manually. And mind you, both me and my husband are in the computer industry and consider ourselves electronics savvy. Lastly, and what really showed us how bad the service at this hotel is: On the last day of our stay, the water shut off during the middle of my shower! Just completely stopped! I felt like I was at a cheap motel, not a new five star hotel! I waited a few minutes, but still nothing, so I got out of the shower, and to my dismay realized that housekeeping also forgot to replace the bath robes in the room. UGH! I tried to call the front desk as I was freezing and soaking wet. After 10 minutes of being on hold, I got what was actually a call center. I told them the situation and they said that there was a glitch in the whole tower and that they would also rush up a bath robe and personally call back when the situation was rectified. Of course, no bath robe was sent and no one called back. My husband also went down to the front desk to complain and finally after bypassing the long check in line and hailing down a manager, he was given a \"there is nothing we can do it is out of our hands\". No apology, nothing! Also, when we checked out, we still had to argue about the buffet comps as the charges were still on our bill. What a waste of time! I'm sorry, but we have stayed at plenty of lesser rated hotels and have received MUCH, MUCH better service than this. I was extremely disappointed with my stay at this hotel. We visited almost all the hotels on the strip during our stay and were constantly greeted and smiled at. Not at this hotel! We will not be staying here again and I definitely plan on writing a review on every website I can think of.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "indianapolis", "Title": "\u201c\"Aria\" must not mean \"service\" in Italian\u201d", "Author": "gohappy103", "ReviewID": "UR109995927", "Content": "With all of the hotel options in Las Vegas, you would think it would be a constant contest among hoteliers to provide the BEST service possible in hopes of filling every room, every night. Not so.....at least not at the City Center's Aria. My 4 day stay there last week was reminiscent of trips to DisneyWorld, where everything requires a wait in line and you are just another face in the crowd anticipating that you WILL eventually get your ride, your meal, your ticket, etc. The difference is that you expect it at Disney - it's part of the experience -- but not at a swank, new hotel where you are paying minimally $200-300/per night. Let's start with check-in. Upon arrival, there were 3 open windows (of the ~15 or so available) and we were guided to the shortest line where the old adage \"the shortest line always takes the longest\" proved itself to be true. There were 2 parties in front of us, the first of which was there at least 20 minutes AFTER we queued up while the clerk seemed to struggle with the computer and whatever requests they were making. I finally inquired as to whether they were just renting a room for several nights, or closing on a loan to purchase the property -- it was taking that long! Finally, we were directed to a newly opened window, where the gentleman apologized for the delay and handled our check-in with ease. The higher floor room I had requested was not ready, so he keyed in a RUSH order and said that it was one of the first RUSH requests of the morning and that it \"shouldn't be too long. He directed us to bag check in, explained the process for key retrieval when the room was ready, and invited us to enjoy the casino and/or pool. Two+ hours later, we had not yet been summoned, so we returned to the desk and accepted rooms on a low floor. I don't know about you, but RUSH to me certainly means inside of several hours. Bag delivery to the room was prompt, and the bellman was very cordial + knowledgeable. The room was just a room....nothing special, nothing particularly well or ingeniously appointed....nice enough, but a plain room. Here's the crazy part: the lights & electronics are mostly controlled via the TV screen....which is real cool & techy I guess, but it is a bit tedious to have to turn on the TV and scroll through the menus every time you want to switch on/off a light or open the curtains!! There is a curtain control panel on the wall I discovered, and some assorted light switches here and there, but it was a bit inconvenient and confusing....designed apparently for travelers WAY smarter than me. The bathroom had one hook for robe, towel, hand towel, etc., as there were no other towel bars. Clean towels & washcloths were left on the edge of the sink daily. The tub was located INSIDE the shower stall....not that you were showering in the tub..... the shower stall contains a place to stand and shower AND the tub separately but within the shower stall walls....yep....odd. The next day, I returned to the room late in the day (4:00-5:00) and the room had not yet been made up. I don't leave my own house for the day a mess, so I expect that when I'm paying $200-300/night for a room I'd like it to be tidied and serviced by my return at the end of the day. All of this is to say that the ARIA just seemed to be grossly understaffed. Everyone was cordial and seemed to be doing the best they could, there just weren't enough workers to service the size of the property and the number of guests. The pools (3 + \"Liquid\" the adult pool) are lovely and for the most part, peaceful (well, not Liquid,,,it's a party). Plenty of big white towels, lots of chairs, good food at the outdoor restaurant. Service though again, was SO slow and inconsistent. You would think they'd be in a bigger hurry to sell more of those pricey drinks....seemed understaffed. The best though, was the night we ate at the Michael Mina restaurant, American Fish. We started at the bar, where the bartender was very good and told us a lot about the menu, the specials, etc. Then, we were seated in the bar area at a table. The waitress assigned to us (an seemingly to the entire rest of the place...but certainly to the entire bar seating area) was amazing in her own right. Sounds like a broken record, but I don't make this stuff up.....the place was way understaffed. This lovely young girl named CARMEN, was literally, nearly running from table to table...to the computer....to the bar. She gave us our menus and explained the specials, then she was off. At one point as she whizzed past we asked her to send the bus person around with water.....she appeared shortly with the pitcher and filled our glasses. Later, we ordered a bottle of wine which she said the wine steward would be delivering. A few minutes later...POOF...there SHE was uncorking and pouring the wine. Off she went....back with the food....and on it went. And I'm pretty certain she was doing the same for the other guests around us. I believe SHE could have single-handedly taken over that entire resort!!! LOL!!! She was something to see! Perhaps she should be promoted to \"Director of Service Training\" there!! The coffee + pastry shop was decent, but get there early, or yep......you wait in a long line. Same at the candy store and the sandwich/ice cream shop on the way to the pool...long lines, slow service. Again, nice folks just too few of them it seemed. Nice casino, great location, loved the pools. I'm going to mark that I would NOT recommend to a friend, but I would with reservation, to anyone with more patience or time to kill than me I guess....and for the right price. Oh...very nice fitness center! And if you're looking for the safe, it's hidden in the nightstand drawer!

Our Booking read early check-in and we were there @ 10am but got the room only @ 1pm. We did not complain about this as we were already in the vegas mood. We saw the room and loved it immediately. The Curtains opened up as soon as our Room Door was opened and it was so cute (hheeeee). The Room was good average size and so was the bathroom. There was a Remote Control Panel (hand held) next to my table and you can operate music, tc, curtains, lights, wake up alarm, and just everything from that small remote panel. Light was so easy for those 5 Days. I think they could just add just a bit extra light to the room and it would be perfect. TV had good channels for fun, news, sports, etc. But for Movies, you had to pay-up which I think was pretty cheap thing to do. Bathroom was nice and so was the Bath tub. I think they Toileteries could be up-scaled to much better quality. We did not try the Restaurants and we were eating out most of the time but did go to Vetro (Coffee Shop) which was right next to the Casino and had Coffee & Nachos which was 10 out of 10. Casino stakes would be low during the day (minimum was 10) and went up in the night (minimum 15) which I think was not really steep. But I think the Casino was average size and was definetly not too big. But that cool as you can play in any casino in Vegas. Check out was prompt.

It is not really a suite, just a bigger room, but a really nice room with an outstanding view of the Strip. It was also probably the most technologically advanced room I've been to - everything (lights, TV, curtains) is controlled from a portable sensor panel. As for hotel itself, it is a typical mega-casino hotel with lots of restaurants, nightclub and of course casion action on the main floor. We tried the buffet (good variety , service was ok) and a pastry place (very good!). Didn't try any of the full-service restaurants. The hotel has a very nice pool area, but it was too cold during our stay, so we just walked around the pools once. If you planning to gamble, you might sign up for their loyalty progam - might get some freebies.

I'm not a big gambler, so I find the lobby of these hotels disconcerting - they always make it very hard to find how to get to your room, or do anything really besides gamble. This is also a HUGE hotel so there was just a lot of walking every time I wanted to go anywhere. If I forgot something up in my room, it was a big ordeal. I am pretty sure my colleague and I would have lost each other if we didn't have our mobiles. I paid extra for the gym/spa, which was very nice - and I think worth it, but not open very early - most business travelers (esp those of us coming from the east coast) like to work out in the morning but I guess this isn't the point of the hotel. The room was fabulous - super comfortable and a giant remote control that does everything for you. But you definitely have to pay for anything extra. The toiletries were nothing special. Pools were luxurious and typical Vegas party scene. I ate at the buffet one night, very casual, more like a cafeteria than a buffet, but the food was good. I haven't eaten at other Vegas buffets, so I don't have a comparison. The other restaurants looked very nice, and there is an Elvis Cirque de Soleil show in the hotel, which I would have loved to attend, but didn't make it this time. Hotel is on the strip, attached to lots of good shopping, so if that's what you're looking for, you're all set. And we parked our rental car, which was free and easy, there is also a valet for tips. So no major complaints - I just think Vegas isn't my scene. I did get a government rate, but they don't honor that on weekends, so we had to move into another hotel Fri. night (work went through Fri. afternoon.)

Check-in took about 10 mins, and our room on the 10th floor facing the Vdara was spacious and clean. My Mom noticed a few crumbs next to the bed, but it's better than finding a dirty bathroom, so it didn't bother us. The ipad control thing was easy enough to figure out, but we didn't really use it. They still have light switches on the walls and a remote control for the TV, which was a lot easier than going back to the control pad for everything. The beds are as amazing as everyone says, but I thought the pillows were too squishy. I was still congested from having awful allergies in NYC, but couldn't really prop myself up enough to breath using 2 pillows. We used the gym each morning, and it was wonderful. They give you water bottles and towels, and have most of the machines you'd find at any gym. It's also huge so there are always machines open even if it's crowded. Same with the pool. Last year we stayed at the Mirage, and though the pool there is prettier, everyone sits on top of each other and that isn't the case at the Aria. With 3 huge pools areas, there were always plenty of chairs. Yes, the drinks at the pool are expensive, but no different than any other 4-5 star hotel. If you're looking for $1 beers, go to the cheap casinos on the street or bring your own. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants besides Sweet Chill, which has really great gelato. Instead, we went to the restaurants in the Miracle Mile mall across the street for breakfast. All of the bars serve breakfast for under $10. The PBR Rock Bar was the delicious and gives you SO much food. We also went to the Wicked Spoon Buffet in the Cosmopolitan for brunch and it was worth every penny. The Pub in the Monte Carlo is worth mentioning because they had he best nachos ever and over 70 different beers. The only place that wasn't worth going was Freemont Street. It takes forever to get there on the bus, and is actually a little scary. On our last day, our flight wasn't until 10:40pm so we stored our luggage and that couldn't have been easier. It took 2 mins and when we went to pick it up, it took another 2 mins and they got us a cab immediately. Overall I didn't really have any issues with the Aria. It's clean, and spacious, and right in the middle of everything. It is a little set back from the Strip, but we found it quicker to walk through Crystals or take the tram to the Bellagio.

My girlfriends and I come to Las Vegas every year for a trip. We have stayed at the Mirage, Venetian, and MGM hotel and Signature Towers. We wanted to try out Aria because we kept hearing about it, and it was one of the newest hotels on the strip. We stayed there May 13-16, 2011. The hotel itself was very unimpressive. I have been to all the 5 star hotels in Vegas and this one does not even compare. The casino/decor overall is just \"blah\". I guess they were trying to go for a \"modern' theme...to me, it just seemed cold. It was understaffed wherever we went. We had to wait in long lines to check-in/out, at the buffet, and at the pool bar. It was nearly impossible to find a waitress to take our drink orders at the pool. We had to end up going to stand in line at the pool bar for 30 minutes! This is not exactly what we had in mind when we go to relax at the pool. Everyone in line was annoyed and unhappy. There were 2 bartenders for a huge line of people. We wanted to buy another round of drinks, but did not want to waste another 30 minutes of pool time waiting in line. The buffet line was just as bad. The ladies up front ringing customers were very slow. The restaurant had plenty of open seating. There was no reason for that line to be sooo long for a breakfast buffet. We almost missed our flight due to the line at the buffet and check-out. And once we got into the buffet, there were hardly any waitresses! We had finished our food before we got our drinks. This is ridiculous. Everything in the room is controlled by a touch scree (like an ipad). Sounds cool in theory, but it was confusing and didn't work much of the time. For older people who are not good with technology, this would be a major deterrent! We set the alarm to wake us up after a nap and it never went off. Also, it would be nice to add more outlets in the room. Most people like to charge their phones on the night table. There was no outlet anywhere near the beds. The power was completely out for hours on saturday night. The pillows were too fluffy/big for a stomach sleeper like myself. The beds were comfy, but I didn't sleep well b/c the pillows were too big. Also, the so called \"black out\" curtains, do not block out the sun. We got woken up every morning at 6:30am by the sunrise. I have never had this before at any hotel. I love the idea of the big floor to ceiling windows, but you guys need to figure out a better curtain system that blocks the light out. It was very bright in our room very early! I constantly heard noises around us. It sounded like a bowling alley was literally above us. I don't know if they were moving furniture or what, but it woke us up several times. We could also hear people having conversations walking down the hall. Between the noise, pillows, and light in the room, we slept awful the entire trip. I am usually not a negative person and have never complained about a hotel in my entire life (and I travel often). We will not ever be back at Aria again.

I set the alarm to wake me up and when it did the blinds opened, the TV turned on to the channel I chose and the lights I opted to have turn on, turned on... that was cool. NOW THE NEGATIVE (AND THERE IS ALOT). Upon check in the front desk clerk was curt, cold, and not informative. To get a double bed room I would have had to pay 30$ extra - and we were two women staying in a room. We went up to the room and right outside our room there were two drinks on a tray that had not been picked up. I started to think that the room might be occupied. When we went into the room, the carpet was dirty, the room was dusty, and the blanket had a bunch of hair on it. I called down to front desk and they switched our rooms -- however, they had noone come up to assist and honestly for the inconvenience I thought they should do something as an apology..(maybe give us double beds).. they did not. We got to the new room and everything was cleaner (thankfully). The first night everythng worked well, although we had difficulty getting the temperature just right and for the black out curtains there is a gap so if you are up late gambling and sleep past the sunrise, it could be annoying (it was). Saturday night I went out and when I got back to the casino I gambled for a couple hours.. EXHAUSTED, I went back to the room wanting to watch a little TV. NOTHING WORKED. I couldn't watch TV, shut the blinds, even some of the lights were an issue. Then I went to the bathroom and the water wouldn't run, after using the restroom GROSS. tried to call the front desk, my phones weren't working. So I tried to call them via my cellphone and I got a message they were closed........NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM A 5 STAR HOTEL!! The next morning, I coudln't wait to get out of there. I called the front desk and explained ALL that had gone on over the last two days (they had also messed up a breakfast credit).. and they told me they could offer me a one night stay in the future.. I requested they remove the 44$ resort fee (this alone ticks me off - I didn't use anything that this fee is for.... I didn't use wireless, or the fitness center - I just gambled in their casino and I still was going to be charged this)........anyway, they did take off that fee and informed me that my breakfast credt was on my account -- on friday they said it wasn't! SO DISORGANIZED... so we went to a 50$ breakfast with our 40$ credit.......NOT EVEN close to a good buffet by Vegas standards.... truly not. I was just so disappointed in this experience. I also have friends that live in the area and it is VERY inconvenient for them to access. YESTERDAY, I GOT the free one night stay paperwork in the mail and there are ALL SORTS of exclusions.. and it is for a standard room, when I stayed in an upgraded/view room... RIDICULOUS!! not worth the price!!!! I also filled out a survey a few days ago, thinking that maybe they will respond in a way any customer would expect. No response to this date.

Our taxi had to stop in the far left lane to let us out. We had 5 bags and despite my shouting for some help with the bags, the bellmen either ignored us or didn\u2019t hear us. My wife and I had to drag our bags while maneuvering through several lanes of traffic. Fortunately other guests saw our dilemma and offered to help me get the bags into the lobby. That same couple shared with us that they had had a similar experience when arriving and that they were planning to move to another hotel just because the service was so bad at the Aria. I walked the length of the front desk looking for the shortest line. A man in a suit (I assume a manager) approached me and told me to \u201cjust pick one; they are all moving at the same speed\u201d. I picked a line and after waiting for 45 minutes to check in, I was told no room was available but that I would be called on my cell phone when one was available. We dropped our bags off with the bellmen and after a couple of hours I had not received a phone call so I checked back and was given a room key. The only positive experience I can relate is when I asked to use the honor bar to store my medicine and the front desk clerk quickly arranged for a refrigerator to be delivered to my room at no charge. We ate at the cafe Vettro on Saturday evening, May 14th. The food looked and tasted as though it had come out of a frozen box then been cooked in a microwave. The au jus tasted like it had been made from a beef bouillon cube. The food was really terrible. Our server had a cold with laryngitis and was coughing. I didn\u2019t want to be rude and ask for another server so we took our chances. The manager of the restaurant should not have allowed that server to work around food. 2 days after being served by that server, I came down with a cold and was unable to complete our planned hike in the Grand Canyon. While shopping at the elements gift shop Sunday, May 15 at noon, my wife selected a sweat shirt and started to walk towards the cash register in the front of the store. The cashier looked at us approaching from about 12 feet away and then abruptly walked away from the cash register and headed to the back of the store and through a door without saying a word. We walked to the register at the back of the store and waited behind 2 other customers. We ate at the buffet 3 times and the food was pretty good with a nice variety of selections. I had omelets on 2 occasions and they were both great (nice and fluffy). I thought the buffet was a pretty good value. The only complaint would be that we visited 3 times and on all three occasions, I could not get the attention of a server to get a drink refill for either coffee or iced tea. I\u2019m guessing there is a policy of \u201cno refills\u201d. I called room service at 10:50PM on Monday, May 16th and a young lady answered the phone. From her tone, it was clear that my call was an irritant to her. She seemed genuinely perturbed that I had taken her away from another conversation (that I could still hear in the background). When I tried to place an order for food, she interrupted me and told me it would be at least an hour and would that be okay. I was a bit incredulous when I repeated back to her \u201can hour?\u201d, she responded \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d as though she was proud of irritaing me. I declined and went looking for food elsewhere in the hotel, but at 11:00PM the Caf\u00e9 Vettro was the only option and I had already had a bad experience there. We called room service back and somebody else answered and it did indeed take 55 minutes to get a cheeseburger and fried rice delivered to my room. (Dominoes could have brought me food in 30 minutes). I could relate a few other incidents, but if you have read this far you got the point. I do not recommend this hotel. Throughout our entire 4 days at Aria, I didn\u2019t have a single interaction with an employee that made me feel like they actually cared or were even interested in what I wanted. In fact, several interactions made me angry because I felt belittled. Even the best interaction had the same emotional impact as a purchase at a convenience store with barred windows.

We booked a City View Deluxe this time rather than the corner suite we had last year. It was perfect for us - we don't spend a lot of time in the room so we don't really need the larger suites. Check-in is still a bit of a pain there. We waited in line and decided to hold out for a room on a higher floor than was currently available. I wish there was a way to reserve that in advance, but it is luck of the draw as to what is open at the moment you get to the front of the line. We did eventually get a room on a decently high floor. Our room wasn't too far from the elevator and still fairly quiet. I heard noise in the hallway a few times, but not to the point that it bothered me. I never heard anyone above us - which is always nice. The room this time was clean - a major major sore point from my prior stay there. Housekeeping seemed to have improve greatly over our last stay, though we never did get turndown service. Our minor complaints 1) Drink service at the pool can take an agonizingly long time. They need more servers out there when it is busy. 2) Waiting in lines for restaurants that are practically empty. You should not have to wait in line at Cafe Vettro or the Buffet when there are miles of empty tables. Super annoying especially when the food is only so-so. 3) The resort fee is a joke. They need to end it and stop pretending it is a convenience for the guests. Whatev. What we like - 1) the SMELL. Some people complain about it - they are dumb. It smells heavenly. 2) The decor - it suits our 30something taste to a tee. I love it. I feel relaxed and calm and at home there. I love that is both contemporary and warm at the same time. 3) VERY FEW KIDS - OMG, I love kids, but I DETEST people who bring their kids to Vegas. What is WRONG with you? Don't you know everyone who passes you is questioning your parenting? Vegas is just not a family friendly environment so I don't get what possessed you to bring them there. Not to mention that everyone goes to Vegas to escape reality and your children (adorable or not) intrude on that. Leave them at home or stay at Circus Circus. UGH - it is what drove us away from Mandalay. 4) Cabs line up underground... such a small thing, but makes a difference in the vibe. 5) LOCATION - people who complain about it being far back are lazy. I don't WANT my casino to be located right at the front of the strip where all of the riff-raff are wandering. I love Vegas, but I am apparently a bit of a snob - some of the people there just make my skin crawl. I like the Aria vibe and the class of people that frequent the property. 6) Restaurants are okay. The buffet is terrible and I wish they had a decent contemporary Mexican place to balance out all of the Asian offerings. The tapas restaurant (Julian Serrano) is decent - some of the offerings are fabulous; some are terrible. The Todd English Pub is good, but beers are ridiculously expensive. Lemongrass was a good lunch. DISLIKE the Cafe Vittro. Bottom line - I love Aria.

We aren't high rollers by any means and we must say all the staff were very friendly and helpful when needed. Some even went out of their way to be extra nice when it wasn't a part of their job. Check-In could be a pain since everyone coming in to the main lobby clumps together like one big mob and it becomes a guessing game as to who is next and \"I was here first\" issue. It may take away from the overall decore they are trying to convey but roping off lines may help smooth out the check-In process. Aria is centrally located and really not far from the other major casinos on the strip. Let's face it, just walking from one casino to it's neighbor is going to be a hike. Distance here is very decieving. As for transportation, we used the tram from Crystals to Bellagio and Monte Carlo a lot. This got us off of the sidewalk crowds for a bit. Taxi service was readily available and was never a problem. Dining in Aria is not cheap but neither are most of the casinos in this area.

He also mentioned that there were currently 2 adjoining rooms on the 4th floor but if we wanted a higher up room, we should wait. No problem - we'll wait.

First off, we chose to arrive by shuttle. Obviously those who choose a shuttle are viewed as second class by the hotel, as we were dropped off in the parking garage, not the front enterance. There was no one there to assist with our bags and we were left to find our own way to the front desk. It was only once we made it to the front desk, which was a good hike away when packing four bags, that a bellman offered some assistance. The room was really nice. We got a deluxe king room. It had a beautiful marble bathroom with a huge soaker tub. Lighting, curtains, etc are all controlled automattically with wall push buttons or a remote control. Once the controls were figured out, they were oky to use, but I think a simple switch is just fine. One thing we found odd is that the bedding is VERY heavy. The comforter felt extremely weighted and uncomfortable to sleep under. I weighed it out of curiosity, at 18 lbs. We solved this by having housekeeping bring up a blanket and left the comforter on the floor for our stay. Other than the bedding, the room was quite comfortable and extremely quiet. Elevators were quick with verry short wait times. On our first night there, we asked directions to the strip. The staff member showed us a route between the two towers that felt like you were walking down an alley, was poorly lit, and needed multiple crossings of the same street as the sidewalk didn,t run the full distance on either side. At night it didn't feel like a safe place to be. The following day we found the other main way to the strip that we probably should have been guided to in the first place. The hotels pool was really nice, the shops and restaurants were suitable. We went to the dinner smog which ws unite good, but we were seated for sometime without anyone coming by to take our drink order. We finally had to track someone down to do this.

It is a really impressive, modern and new looking hotel. Compared to the other hotels on the strip (apart from the Wynn which we didnt make it to) I am really pleased we stayed here as it is so much more modern and sophisticated. We were impressed by the staff in the Aria, everyone was very helpful and friendly and we had no issues to mention. The drinks service on the slots was the fastest of all the hotels we went to and strongest drinks. The room was as smart as the rest of the hotel, quite large and as others have mentioned the bed is to die for. We had dinner in Julian Serrano's which was really tasty. The buffet was good value for lunch, great seafood and deserts. We were given free passes to Haze nightclub and this was the only area of Aria i was not impressed by- very small club with no atmosphere- i would say do not bother going. The only other area below expectations was the cleanliness of the room. This is why I gave 4 stars not 5. After reading other reviews I was worried it would not have been cleaned at all. Luckily it was. However I had a look at everything perhaps more than I would normally. The under pillows had mascara marks on them (were they not changed?) and there was black hair in the shower base. I understand they have a lot of rooms to clean, but this is meant to be a 5 star resort and it is a shame they let themselves down as apart from this it was a perfect trip.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it.

The room was a bit \"disjointed\", not an open concept which we tend to prefer. The beds were comfortable at first, but very soft and ended up giving us sore backs after a couple of nights. We ended up eating at the Cafe Vedro in the hotel for breakfast each morning. You will learn very quickly that the drinks are expensive. It was 7.50 for an orange juice and $4 for coffee. The service at this place was horrible - I don't know if it is because the servers were too busy as they had too many tables in their section or not as the servers were kind, but very very slow. They pump a strong scent through the hotel which can be overpowering in certain sections of the hotel. The gym was nice - but the staff is not very friendly at all. The location of the hotel is okay - but if you are more interested in doing some shopping, it is quite a distance from Caesars, the Venetian and Fashion Show Mall. The casino itself is very dark and the vibe wasn't that great. The Cosmopolitan (next door) was a better environment for gambling. The pool area is nice - but nothing that different from the other hotels on the strip. The Viva Elvis show was okay - probably great if you are a huge Elvis fan - but not quite the same spectacular show you would get from most Cirque de Soleil shows. We have gone to Vegas several times and we've tried a different hotel each time - our favourite is still the Wynn with the Venetian taking second place. The price of Aria certainly is not worth what you get. It's a hotel that is just lacking in so many ways. I do question if this would be everywhere right now as I found the same level of service I used to love about Vegas was absent just about everywhere.

The hotel was busy, but we didn't wait long at the check-in. They didn't mention the weight sensitive snack tray in the room so when my wife picked up a box of almonds to see what they were she didn't realize until after that we would be getting charged for them ($12). Not a problem though, we called the front desk and they took the charges off our bill. The hotel itself is very contemporary with all the amenities you'd expect from a prime hotel on the Strip. The rooms are large and comfortable with plenty of drawer and closet space, as well as a spacious bathroom. The electronic controls for lighting, curtains, etc will appeal to the techie travelers, and there's a control panel to hook-up your laptop to the flat panel TV. We were on a smoke-free floor so we didn't have to deal with cigarette smoke other than on the main floor areas. We're not gamblers so we didn't really spend any time in the casino other than walking through to get to where we were going. In comparison to others I didn't find that it was overly noisy and navigating through it was pretty painless. There are quite a few restaurants to choose from if you eat in the hotel; getting pastries at the Jean Phillipe Patisserie is well worth it, fresh and delicious, although out of our entire stay this was the one place we thought where the service didn't meet our expectations. One night we were getting a late snack and although we were already inside looking at what to get before they closed the doors they refused to serve us saying that the customers at the cashier were the last ones. The other time my wife had ordered a crepe and the person taking the order wrote it down wrong so when the girl was making it my wife pointed out that isn't what she ordered; the girl eventually made the right one, but had all sorts of attitude about it. We ate at the buffet for breakfast one morning and there were many things to choose from; the food there was no better or worse than other Vegas hotels we've stayed at and we didn't find that there was anything wrong with it. It is still a buffet, so don't expect it to taste like its all been cooked a la carte (except the omelette station). We also ate at the Julian Serrano restaurant which serves a tapas menu. Between us and the other couple we traveled with we ordered eight dishes and they were all very tasty. The service was very good. There were three large outdoor pools with plenty of loungers; we never had a problem finding one, and there were no issues with getting enough towels. We didn't order from the bar at the pool so I can't comment on the service; it seemed like there was always someone coming around to see if people wanted to order something, but we never found it obtrusive or annoying. Overall I'd say we had a good stay and would consider staying at the Aria again. In the past we've also stayed at Treasure Island and the Red Rock Resort & Casino. We found the Aria to be similar to the Red Rock in terms of the contemporary styling, comfort and service.

The remote controlled features are extremely easy to use, and I can't understand how anyone could have trouble with them. Just be careful with the safe. If you stuff it too full it may not open, and it takes about half an hour to get someone up to help you with it. The pools were amazing, as well, although we didn't check out Liquid. Yes, the drinks are very expensive by the pool, but you can buy your own drinks from a corner store and take them with you. I didn't find the vanilla scent offensive in the least, and I'm not a fan of perfumy smells. We didn't try any of the restaurants as they are a bit out of our budget. The hotel is huge, and set back from the strip. You'll do a fair amount of walking, but that's to be expected in Vegas, right? We ate most of our meals at New York, New York down the street as it was cheaper and the food was pretty good. There's also a McDonald's across the street if you need a cheaper breakfast option.

I searched hotel review web sites for over two weeks, and read in the neighborhood of 500 reviews of various hotels up and down the strip. Just like you I read that the Aria had issues with their cleaning staff, a \"dark\" casino, overpowering smell, and poorly tranined staff. Taking all of those reviews in to account, I decided that I wanted to try out this hotel for myself. Having just been awarded the Five Diamond Status, I found it hard to believe that it was as bad as some had said. Our stay was four days and three nights, from Monday through Thursday. Please keep in mind that we are not high rollers, in fact we spent less than $500 gambling in the casino the entire length of our stay. We are also not rich by any means, this was to be our only vacation for the year. So, here is my review of the Aria Hotel in Las Vegas, NV. Upon arriving at the hotel, the first two things you notice are that the hotel itself is huge both vertically and horizontally. The other is an amazing waterfall that runs the length of the front of the building. When you walk in the front doors, just walk straight and the check in desk is directly to your right. We waited less than five minutes before a spot opened up at the front desk. I had originally booked a King Deluxe Room with City View through Expedia, and paid around $130 per night. I did try the sandwich trick, slipping a $50 dollar bill between my ID and my credit card. I told the desk agent that my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to know if they had any Corner Suites available for a complementary upgrade. She handed me back my fifty, and told me to hang out for a second while she spoken with her manager. I figured that I was sunk, and resigned myself to the fact that I would not be getting any upgrade. Oh how wrong I was. She came back in a few minutes and informed me that I would be upgraded to the Tower Suites on the 36th floor with a view of the strip. I thanked her profusely, and then my wife and I made our way to the elevators (the Aria has a security guard posted at all elevators - no key, no access). When we got upstairs, we walked in to an amazing space. The front entry had all marble tiles, and a table with tray for your keys/pocket contents. Just ahead was the living room with a very comfortable couch and large 52\" television. behind that was the desk and small lamp. Directly across from there was the amazing king size bed and legendary mattress. Floor to ceiling windows ran the entire length of the room, including the bathroom. Then I walked in to the enormous bathroom. To the left was an amazing jacuzzi bathtub unlike any I have ever seen. Behind it was a shower that was stone/glass with a bench in it that could have easily sat four adults. Behind the shower, and in its own room with a frosted glass door was the toilet complete with bidet (which I was far to scared of - although my wife did enjoy it). At the end of the bathroom was the closet and safe. On the opposite side of the room were two sinks and a 20\" flat screen that you could watch from the bath tub. Many people have complained about the high tech gadgets in the rooms. I will break it down as easily as I can. The unit is roughly 8\" x 10\" and looks like a picture from. On the screen are icons representing everything from the TV/Lights/Curtains, etc. The unit is easier to use than most universal remotes on the market today. I was like a kid in a candy shop as I ran through the various functions and watched the entire room respond to my finger tips. PLEASE do not let this detour you from staying at this hotel. The unit was extremely simple to use - and added to the overall modern feel of the room. There room itself was spotless. There was nothing in the tub/shower/toilet/sinks that should not have been. The floors and bed were freshly cleaned, and every surface was dusted as well. All in all, I had only two issues with the room during our stay. First, the sinks seem to drain very slowly. Second, and even more miniscule than that - on our last night the room safe wouldn't open for me. After a call to the front desk I had a tech and a security guard in my room within thirty minutes to open the safe for me. Turns out I had hit the wrong button when I last locked it and had cleared the combination I had programmed in to it. Around 7pm on the first night of our stay we decided to grab some dinner and walk up the strip. We returned to our room around 11pm and found a plate of chocolate covered strawberris/maccaroons along with a Happy Anniversary card sitting on the table be the front door. This was a very thoughtful action, considering I had only mentioned it briefly during check in. We had room service twice during our stay, and both times well after midnight. The food arrived to our room hot and fresh, and always within less than thirty minutes. Make sure you ask for turn down service on the final night of your stay. We were suprised to find that along with the turn down, we had been given chocolates. Not just one chocolate mind you, but instead a box of 6 chocolates on each pillow! At the end of our stay I did the express checkout with my Blackberry. My bill was emailed to me with zero issues and all charges accounted for. As we walked out the front door, I did notice a large amount of people waiting to check in. That was to be expected due to a major fight as well as the Kentucky Derby having been scheduled for the weekend. Overall, this hotel far exceeded my expectations. In fact, I can say that this facility is without question the best I have ever experienced.

A longer stay may have changed my opinion. I booked the Aria as the latest 5 Star on the strip (usually stay at Wynn and Encore) and was looking forward to being wowed by my stay. Whilst enjoyable I have to say I felt a little underwhelmed. Without doubt it is a beautiful hotel, but it seemed to lack a little something that elevated it above being just another good hotel on the strip. The casino large and getting a spot at the card tables, or on a machine was never a hassle. The shopping at near by City Centre is worth checking out, but leave your credit card behind lest you be tempted by the latest high fashion. The rooms are nicely appointed and relatively spacious, and boast a high-tech system that allows you to control every aspect of the room using the TV remote. Whilst a neat little trick, the remote and system is a little cumbersome. The bathroom is adequate (though don't expect a large bathroom). Room service had good quality food which was surprisingly affordable for a hotel stay, and friendly staff. Being such a massive new hotel the rooms can be a fair way off from the elevators. My room 22033 felt like it was about 600 meters from the elevator, and the corridor kept on going. Overall the Aria is a good quality hotel that just lacks a bit of Wow. Others may love its appeal so it's worth checking out. For me though, my next stay will be back at Encore.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFabulous location, Amazing rooms and fabulous beds!\u201d", "Author": "Katetk8", "ReviewID": "UR106605082", "Content": "Stayed at Aria in April 2011 and it was everything you expect from a true 5 star hotel.

After 1pm you have to pay a cover charge on top of the $50 min fee for a lounge chair ($500 for the daybed and no idea how much more for a cabana). The other three pools were great and we never had trouble finding a chair. All the hotel staff was very courteous. Casino was nice but smokey in the evening- like all the other casinos.

This is my 4th time in Vegas staying at Caesars, Mirage, Wynn, and now the new Aria. The new Aria is a fantastic hotel. It is centrally located and very big. The hotel is a little tedious to get out of, however, once you get the hang of it, the strip is easily accessed. The design of the hotel is spectacular. The colour scheme works and the details in craftmanship are mindblowing. The Casino is average size, however, never seemed crowded. Limits are manageable and there are a variety of tables and slots. Sportsbook was better than expected, but not as good as Caesars. Facilities are outstanding. The gym has a variety of machines with towel, water, and fruit all part of the experience. A great way to start the morning. Never did the spa, but heard good things about it. The pools are great. There is something for everyone. There are quiet pools and an adult only pool/club called liquid. If you can afford it, I would definitely recommend booking a Cabana. It was probably the highlight of the trip. Rooms are amazing. We had a standard room and I can't imagine how anyone would want anything more from a hotel room. Comfortable bed, quality materials, great design, all the amenities and toilletries you would expect from a 5-Star. What separates the Aria's rooms from other hotels is the use of technology. From requesting housekeeping to drawing your curtains, everything is done through a remote. I would definitely suggest spending 10 minutes walking around the room and seeing what everything does. I really don't understand how anyone can complain about the service. I can't imagine better. The housekeeping is the best I have ever experienced. We were two men in the room and left the room a bit of a mess every day and every evening came back with the room in perfect shape, including our clothes and toiletries. Any requests from the front desk was dealt with promptly and with a smile. From the front desk to the baggage handlers, it felt that everyone was there to make sure you were happy. The restaurants in the hotel are expensive, but spectacular. We ate at Jean Georges and it was excellent. The tapas restaurant and the sportsbook restaurant were also very good. Overall, the hotel is one of the premier hotels in Vegas. It's only flaw is how expensive everything is, however, for what you get, the costs are warranted.

We got there around 10 AM on a Friday and we were able to get our room immediately! Room was beautiful with a City View, housekeeping came everyday and did an excellent job and the beds were very comfy. We ate at 3 restaurants including room service and all the food was VERY GOOD. We didn't have any problem in finding chairs by the pools and we went to the pool every day at different times. All the staff memebers were great and went out of their way to say hello! I have to admit that food and drink prices were over the top and I think the Aria could give their customers a break here! We were also disppointed in the MLife card credits. We dropped a couple thousand dollars and only got $32 comps! Mandalay Bay gave us much, much better comps when we were there in the fall.

Having previously stayed at the Wynn, we were not expecting this hotel to be up to the same kind of standard, but were very pleasantly surprised. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would stay here again, subject to it remaining competitively priced. Plus Points: - Location: The Aria is located right on the centre of the Strip, being very close to Bellagio / Paris. There is a free monorail that links the Monte Carlo, Aria, Vdara and Bellagio. Being in this central position means that there are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants, all within a few minutes\u2019 walk. - Bedrooms: The bedrooms are incredibly modern and comfortable, having lots of \u2018techie\u2019 toys to play with, such as the iPad like control panel, that controls everything from the room temperature to the position of the curtains. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Despite our room being one of the more basic, we still had plenty of space and were high up enough to be able to watch the sun go down over the distant hills, of an evening. The bathroom was equally as impressive, being extremely modern and having plenty of space. Despite the hotel being fairly busy, we were never disturbed by anyone from outside the building, in the corridor or from the adjoining rooms, so the soundproofing must be fairly good. - Amenities: There were at least 8 restaurants and several bars throughout the hotel, although I couldn\u2019t comment on the quality of the food, as we chose to eat outside. They ranged from the \u2018Sports Bar\u2019 where you could get takeaway burgers, to several top end restaurants with European chefs. The hotel gym was fantastic, probably one of the best I have ever used, with almost every piece of kit that you could ever need. The swimming pool complex included 3 pools and was great for relaxing after a day out shopping! Other amenities included a fairly decent shop and health spa that offered a number of treatments. - Check In / Staff: Despite it being the Saturday before Easter, we managed to check in within around 10 \u2013 15 minutes. In fact we got from the plane to our room in less than 1 hour! The check in member of staff was very polite and gave us all of the relevant information that we needed. To avoid any queues on check out \u2013 we used the \u2018express checkout\u2019 option from the TV in the room, which was fairly straightforward. Negative Points: (Fairly minor) - The safe was designed for a laptop and therefore you would struggle to lock up more bulky items such as an SLR camera. - As with most hotels, the items in the fridge are touch sensitive, so you can\u2019t move anything without being charged for it. This means you can\u2019t store anything else in there that you may have purchased outside. - On arrival you are made aware of the resort tax \u2013 which for the Aria is $20 per night plus tax. It was slightly disappointing to find out there was extra to pay, although this did include free use of the gym, free WI-FI, two free drinks and a complimentary paper every day \u2013 all of which we used, so it wasn\u2019t quite so bad.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cTypical strip hotel...great location but nothing else\u201d", "Author": "AZ-Traveler85253", "ReviewID": "UR106425889", "Content": "Against my better judgment, the guys in my golf group convinced me to stay on the strip for our annual golf trip. After some research, I picked Aria, since it was a new property. I predicted what our stay would be like, and I was right on the nose; pretty, good location, but overpriced and not fun. ROOM: Check in was fine, although they have no structure for a line, so you just stand behind somebody and hope they are quick. Unfortunately, I picked the problem check in and other guests in other lines who arrived after me were in their rooms while I waited. The view was great and the automated system for monitoring your room was cool, after the learning curve. Even with the blackout shades drawn, the room was still way too bright. Beds were really soft and fluffy pillows made for easy sleeping. I thought the shower/bathtub setup was a little weird, and with glass doors, offered zero privacy. Shower pressure was fair. We came back to the room at 4pm on Friday and Saturday to a room that was not cleaned, so that was a little irritating. FOOD: D minus for quality and price. Holy cow...$18 for a breakfast buffet and it had half the selections of any Station casino and almost 3 times the price. Not to bang on the strip hotels, but wow, what a rip-off. $7 for a glass of OJ, $5 for coffee...I could go on. Every restaurant and bar at this place was severely overpriced, and the quality did not match the lofty costs. Serrano's was a joke...(tapas)...$14 for flat iron steak, and what arrived was 4 small pieces...and I mean small small pieces. Same with all the other dishes they said are for two people. We spent $200 and another party spent $400, and we both walked away hungry. Bar drinks can run you $20-$25 per specialty drink. This place is way out of touch with their food and beverage costs. GAMBLING: I go to win, not just to play. Therefore, I play single or double deck blackjack only. Aria had one table of single and one of double with a minimum of $50. Yeah...I may bet that eventually, but I like the chance to decide. I had to go downtown to gamble. The dealers were wither surly or indifferent, with a couple exceptions. Mostly continuous shoe blackjack, which is the highest advantage to the house. If you are a serious BJ player, this is not the place for you. Nice poker room though. My wife commented that the fitness center was the best she had ever seen. So, Aria proved to be exactly what I thought it would be; overpriced and a terrible experience. It is new, and beautiful, and has a good location, but that doesn't do anything for me. When I go to Vegas, I want to enjoy myself, both gambling and off the floor.

It wasn't horrible, just wasn't good. Their signage is horrible...so it's not easy to get to where you want to go. Long, long lines at check-in. We were wondering why it was taking so long with each person. Once it was our turn, we figured it took so long with everyone else because they messed up their reservations just like ours. We had pre-payed for a specific room and had our written confirmation in hand to show what room we should have been given. We were only told that the room or any similar room (king bed, non-smoking, with a city view) was not available. They offered to put us in a king, n/s with a mountain view. When we said we didn't want a mountain view, we wanted what we paid for and requested to speak to a manager, they indicated they could take $30 off our room if we accepted the mountain view room because it was $30 cheaper than the one we paid for (though they didn't indicate that at first when they were trying to put us there). She also indicated that even though we pre-payed for a specific room, that they weren't obligated to have one for us and insisted that the confirmed room was only \"options\" that they would provide if available. I can accept that a king bed is optional. But city view is not optional and a non-smoking room is not optional, especially for medical reasons. She refused to bring us a manager, went to speak with the manager herself, and came back and told us the manager said the same thing to her that she said to us. Anyway, after a half hour at the check-in with a long line of people still waiting behind us, we agreed to take the lesser priced room. For our trouble, we were given 2 coupons for a free glass of wine or beer (with no limitations on type). Finally made it through the casino to the elevators to the room. The room was clean and looked nice. However, there were no wash clothes in the bathroom...so I had to wait for those to be delivered before getting ready for a show. Remember the drink coupons? Later that night when we went to have our glass of wine and go into the casino, the only wine they would give us was their house wine, which tasted slightly of vinegar. So, we didn't drink the nasty wine and also decided not to play in their casino because we didn't want to take the chance of giving them any more of our hard-earned money. We were supposed to be able to check out via the television (as one option). It had the wrong person's name on the room so we couldn't check out via that method. So, long process of checking out later, the reason we couldn't check out that method and had to go through a person is because it flagged us for having a credit (the $30 credit that was applied to our room at check-in because they didn't have the room we were supposed to have, minus some other fee equaling a credit due to us for $18). What a pain in the neck it all was...and then trying to find our way back to the self-park was also not easy due to poor signage. So, I will never go there again.

The space was wonderful the views from my bedroom was breathtaking and bathroom area layout perfect for relaxing. The room had an additional 1/2 bath area in the foyer for guest to use. When we check-in the lines was not very long and it moved pretty well. I am unsure why people complain about lines at check-in because ALL hotels have lines and it truly depends on the time of your arrival. If you come to Vegas to complain, you can find a great deal to complain about but waiting 5 to 10 minutes in a line is not a big deal for me. On Thursday we decided to check out Liquid Pool - the best idea my friend came up with for the entire trip. We got there about 12.15 and learnt that there was free champagne until 1 pm and free entry for hotel guest with the VIP pass. The staff was very accommodating, the drinks was the usual hotel prices and the day was perfect. Everyone was in a good mood, the music was pumping and we stayed there until about 5 pm because we had dinner reservations at 8.30pm at Carnevino. We went back to Liquid Pool on Friday again because we were so relaxed and happy the day before. The sum for the Daybed (which includes food and beverage) increased for Fri and Sat but we ordered above that amount in any event and it was great! The service was even better on Friday because we had Bobby attending to us! My room service was great! Each person would ask if they could lay out my meal or pour the coffee/open the bottle or whatever. The food was very tasty particularly the turkey burger! Yummmy. The casino staff was friendly and of course you would meet the rare miserable dealer but all in all, I thought they were great. They were patient with my friend Candice who was learning the game and the craps dealers was giving me advice on my bets and thankfully I listen and won big that day on hard 8! :) I think the layout of Haze and the lighting is great but on Thursday night the DJ it seem to me that the DJ played the same music over and over...boring. So we left. Did not visit again during our stay because there are so many options in Vegas but would try it again on another night. Check out was a little complicated because I booked a second room via a 3rd party for a friend in our party using my credit card etc and the $50 credit was not made initially and although the lady on check-in said she would follow-up she obviously did not. But Stephanie and the other young lady on Monday night/ Tues morning took care of everything and they did all the calls to the 3rd party and quickly handled it. When I got home I follow-up with a call to ensure that the credit and comps were made and although the guy on the phone was a bit impatient at the beginning once I called him out on it he calm himself down and realized I was right and actually found another credit I should have got and did it for me...now how can I complain about that! I would stay at Aria again. Hopefully I would be able to get the 2 bedroom suite the next time so we can all stay together but those suites are very popular and hard to get so secure it in advance!", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cBest value on the strip.\u201d", "Author": "jessietan", "ReviewID": "UR105887575", "Content": "Hotel is new and clean still, compared with older venues which smokers have already ruined by their smokes.

Check in was a short wait for us but I watched others as they waited in line for an open counter. There is not one single line but several lines behind each open counter. The lady felt bad for the hotel credit thing and gave us a better room which had a pool view. We knew about the $23 per day resort fees but were shocked when we were told there was a $30 per night charge for a 2nd bed! Once again SWA Vacations did not disclose this. My brother in law and myself were not about to share a bed so we paid the fee. We will contact our credit card company to work on these issues!!! Our room was beautiful, clean, big & comfortable!! Beds were perfect as were the pillows. Love the remote that was like an ipad. Took a little playing with it to figure it out. It operates the lights, curtains, television, movies, music, etc. We used it for an alarm that opened the curtains and turned on the lights and tv when ready.There is also a regular hand held TV remote if you dont like the electronic one! Not much noise from neighbors or outside. Everything was clean for us. Fully stocked frig and snack box. Everything is touch sensored. Only one electrical outlet near TV desk. The safe is in the 3rd drawer near bed. Two large closets with dry bar in between. (4) comfy robes, iron board wth iron and lots of hangers. Full length mirror. Lots of large drawers for clothes. Bathroom has sliding pocket door and the shower is European style with huge shower and soaking tub all enclosed in glass. the toilet area has frosted glass with large door. Double sinks, hair dryer and lots of towels. More towels in drawer near closet. Other reviews said no service but we got service. Each room has electronic switches near door that have an external message at room door wall. You can press PRIVACY that will turn on the red light that says the same. Or you press SERVICE for the green light that says the same. If you press nothing you will NOT get service except if your checking out. The maids usuall start cleaning rooms early so ipeople expect their rooms to be cleaned late in afternoon, forget about it! The maids can't wait until 4pm for you to leave room. Pool areas were huge with room for all ages. There was an ADULT only area that charged $20 for men and $10 for women. This was to only get inside to use pool or stand and people watch. If you want a chair to sit they said it was $100.00 WTF? There was a D.J. though and lots of people going inside. Yes, you must have a bathing suit to get in. Lots of chairs at the other three pools. Valet was free and they were fast. Taxi line was fast too. Dollar car rental place was VERY hard to locate when I returned my car that I got from airport. Self parking is very easy and has underground entrance!!! The Restaurants were many and the prices were EXPENSIVE. I ate at the American Fish restaurant where the staff was very friendly. Had the best drinks and lobster corn dogs! The bars were fun and had dollar video poker machines. To get comp drink, deposit $20 and try your luck! I got two four of a kinds in 10 minutes, walked away $500 ahead and with a buzz!! Casino was very tall and open with lots of games to play. The tables were starting with $10 minimum bet. I did good at roulette and blackjack. You got to go with a limit for each day you play or you can lose quick like I watched others do. Casino smelled of vanilla like a waffle cone, even from outside and in the mall called Crystals. Very easy to get around to the strip through there. Also opposite end mall area connects to the Monte Carlo. Casino was very nice and lots of fun. The customers or clientel at the Aria were much more to my liking as they were't as shady or GHETTO like the Monte Carlo, MGM or Excaliber. Hands down the best looking women at night. There is a night club there that starts happening after 11pm. I watched the people coming out until 4am the next morning. Yeah that crown was from 21 - 51 it looked like. The Aria is new with lots of fun things to do. Yeahh it is very expensive but if you got the money, enjoy it! I will go back if I can get a great deal.

They have built this fabulous hotel to a very high standard but then forgot to tell the staff that they are not working at a Motel 6. First of all there is no line to join at check-in, they have about a dozen or so people there but you have to try and guess which line you think is going to be best. And yes, just like the supermarket, you always end up in the one where someone in front of you has a problem. Then if you have to leave your bags with the porter because your room isn't ready they won't deliver them to your room when it's ready, like the good service of old, you have to call them when you finally get your room and then wait for them to bring them up. And then they have the hide to tell you \"it's for your convenience\". Trust me it's a saying you'll learn to hate. For your convenience they charge a $20 daily resort fee for which you get the paper (which isn't delivered to your room, you have to go and get it yourself), in room wi-fi and the use of the gym. And finally if you are catching a flight out of Vegas, when you check-out don't rely on the porters, take your own bags down with you. I called and was told 7 to 10 minutes, I called back after 20 minutes to be told that the computer had broken and that all the porters were out. I asked how long it would be and was told, and I quote \"I don't know, just wait\". After thirty minutes I carried all the bags by myself as my wife had already left to check us out. To my disbelief when I got outside the front doors of the hotel three Porters there just standing there talking.

We found two but they weren't together and there was no one around to help (thankfully a nice gentleman at the pool did help us). But with 4 pools (and thousands of rooms) you would think they would have pool attendants to help manage the chair/towel situation. Then I decided to get some drinks at the pool bar. I waited in line for no less 30 minutes! Way to long.....the people next to us ordered drinks from the waitress right after I left and still hadn't gotten their drinks when I got back. My husband and I use the mini bar a lot and we had to call almost every day for it be refilled (they kept telling us they would come daily but never showed). Housekeeping is a little slow also. We're from the east coast so we were up pretty early most days. We would leave for breakfast, come back to change for pool, etc and come back @ 2/3 (nap time :) and the room still wasn't clean. I never saw anyone cleaning before 10am but yet there were numerous rooms with the \"service\" light turned on by or before 8am. We went to the \"Liquid\" pool (day club kind of pool). It was fun, not trashy. All types of people; fat, skinny, men, women, young, old. It was a pretty cool vibe and not \"stuck up\". We \"rented\" two pool lounges and I think our bill with drinks, tips etc. was $500 for the day. It was worth it. The DJ was pretty good, in fact we went to lots of clubs while we were there and the one at Liquid was probably the best. I forget the name of the pastry shop/cafe in the Casino but it was good for a quick sandwich. The pastries looked amazing but I didn't try any. The buffet was good. I am not a fan of buffets but we are lunch there twice and it had a good assortment of food. The hotel is in a great location. We walked to Cosmopolitan, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio. Crystals (very high end mall) is connected to Aria and another shopping mall (abercrombie etc. is right across the street) We only paid $159 a night for the room (which we ended up getting comped anyways because of gambling) and would most likely stay there again for that price. I would actually be willing to pay more for better service. I really did like the location and the overall \"feel\" of the hotel. It just seemed like we were waiting a lot. Check in/Check out, restaurants, pool, mini bar etc. Overall, I would recommend this hotel but if you are regular 5 star hotel kind of person you might be underwhelmed.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFabulous location and facilities for our family of 5 inc kids\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR105156074", "Content": "We had one of the Aria sky suites for our recent 5 night stay in LV.

Aria is no exception to that rule. But hey, it's Vegas right? We arrived via shuttle service to an underground \"loading\" area and were immediately met by a bell person who whisked our luggage off to storage while we checked in. They directed us towards the lobby area which takes you on a journey up to the street level and either through the Casino, or past the nice fountain feature at the main entrance (skip the casino and check out the fountains.) We arrived earlier in the day, so I was surprised to see the longer lines at the check in area, but with 4000 rooms, I guess I should have expected a crowd. Check in seemed to take longer than necessary, but was gracious none the less once we made our way up to the check in counter. One quibble would be that the lines seem to blur between one and two queues, so you never know which line you are exactly in. Our room wasn't ready, but they would call me when it was. Once the room was ready, I waited in another line to pick up my keys, and then took the ubiquitous trip through the Casino to get to the elevators. Elevators are divided into different floor zones so you NEVER have to wait more than about 15 seconds. Nice. We had a standard room with a strip view. But when I say standard, I mean really, really nice. Say what you want about the computerized touch screen control for lighting, curtains, tv, and temperature, but I liked it. On the bad side, it was frustratingly slow to respond to inputs. Not the computer type, just hit the Master on switch at the entrance of the room and use the good ol' light switches on each one. The bathroom was nicely appointed with double sinks, a make-up mirror, hair dryer, and even a scale. The shower and bathtub room was nice for those early morning steam showers needed after a late night. Other travelers have mentioned the beds in the rooms. They truly are AMAZING! Absolutely the best mattress I have ever slept on. The Casino in the hotel is nicely appointed and extremely easy to navigate (unlike the mazes of other casinos.) As with most of the higher end properties, you aren't going to find minimum bets under $10 for the table games. But if you are looking for a quick comped drink, head to the lounges and play $1/hand video poker or black jack. Restaurants are numerous and priced towards the higher end. You can expect about a $45 minimum for two breakfast/lunch, $60 for dinner (and only one out of two in my party was drinking alcohol.) The buffet had the usual fare plus a tandori oven for Indian food, snow and king crab legs. The title of the development really says it right. City Center. You really are right in the middle of the action. It is hard to put into scale how large these hotels and resorts are until you have to walk through them. The nice part is that several properties on that side of the strip offer a free tram service, with Aria being included in that bunch. Take advantage of that. Aria may not be as timeless as the Bellagio, Wynn, or Venetian, but that isn't what they are going for.

Arrival - We arrived on a Saturday late afternoon/early evening and had no wait at the front desk. The front desk clerk was friendly and efficient. Room - The room was fantastic, we were in a king room facing the mountains. Besides the long walk from the elevator (huge hotel), the room was everything we could ask for. The closet space and changing area was huge and well appreciated. The bathroom double sinks and extra space was a great advantage. The bed was one of the most comfortable that I have ever stayed in. Finally, the electronic gadget to run everything in the room was easy to learn; however, was a little slow to run the tv guide. Restaurants - We had snacks/smoothie at the Patisserie in the casino which was expensive, but very good. We ate at Beso Steakhouse in Crystals. This was not a very good experience. The service was slow, we had to refill our own wine glasses from the bottle away from our table for our entire meal.

There are not very many gaming tables and all have high limits, even if no one is playing and the cheaper tables are full. The highlight was the tram that runs to the Bellagio, we rode it nightly to gamble at the Bellagio, as we preferred their casino environment much better.

It is beautifully done and, although huge is size, has a comfortable and almost intimate feeling about it. The rooms are sound-proofed and the beds are plush and comfortable - I suffer from a bad back and can be very sensitive to new beds, but I always awoke feeling rested and without back pain each morning. The staff could not have been more gracious and friendly, from the check-in staff to the housekeepers to the bell men. Also, one doesn't feel lost in the vast casino as it seems to flow from one comfortably sized area to another effortlessly, with each area designed differently enough to make it feel like you've walked into a new room. The restaurants are top-notch, even the ones without a designer chef attached to their name. We inquired about possibly getting an upgrade from a standard room to a suite and were \"comped\" a corner suite n the 16th floor with views in three directions. The suite included a free-standing whirlpool bathtub situated in the triangular \"point\" where two of the windows met together, so it felt as if we were bathing in the clouds. At night, there was a lot of splendid lighting and motion from the surrounding strip, City Center and monorail visible through our windows, but not a sound came in through the glass or from neighboring rooms. All draperies are electronically operated and can be controlled through either the wall panels or the remote control that operates the TV sets (one in each room, including the bathroom). The lighting (which is mostly soft and ambient) can also be controlled through the remote. When laying in bed at night watching the light show outside, you just need to push one bed-side button and all lights slowly dim out while the drapes close themselves. The pool areas (there are three pools) are as beautiful and well landscaped as any I have seen anywhere in the world. Compared to what we saw in other resorts, including the Bellagio and the Wynn, we felt that we could not have done any better than what we got at the Aria. It's just a different style; more clean and fresh and modern, and less of that hokey plastic fake-luxury decor of most of the other hotels.

I arrived off an east coast night flight at 10 pm on a Wednesday to find VIP check-in not being staffed, which was annoying. Waiting in the poorly organized area (multiple lines for each desk spot rather than a single line for all) took about 15 minutes standing on the worst of the lines. (I would note that at check-out on Sunday, they had organized the space better, which the single line feeding into all the windows) Fortunately, check-in was pretty much the only low point of my stay at Aria. The basic room is very nice - not as large as \"all-suite\" places like Venetian or Encore but definitely larger than average. I shared a room with a buddy and there was plenty of place for our stuff; we essentially only used the room for washing up and sleeping and it was more than up to those tasks. The bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable, the room was clean, the bathroom was very nicely done (except for the annoyance of the not-entirely-opaque frosted glass separating the toilet area from the rest of the bathroom), and the much-maligned Control 4 electronic console was totally functional and at worst silly. There were no tech issues throughout the stay - I would only discourage the most technophobic people from avoiding the Aria because of Control 4, so long as you don't rush your commands the system is extremely basic and user-friendly. I'm a big fan of the Aria's casino. The Aria space is as high end and pleasant for gambling as the best of the strip, places like Wynn and Bellagio, yet multiple tables of quality blackjack rules (dealer stands soft 17, etc) can be found at the $50 level during the day, even Saturday afternoon, and $100 level at night. The competition keeps minimums much higher, which makes Aria a great place for the $50 player to go and get top quality games and service in a very nice atmosphere. Its also a decent casino for players all the way down to $10-15 - though you have to play on a continuous shuffler, at least you don't see shoe games paying 6 to 5 on blackjack. Video poker pay tables are as bad as anywhere on the strip, unfortunately. Besides having good rules, the Aria casino also has a unique design. It is much more modern and less European in style than the other fancy joints on the Strip; I found it to be beautiful, though some of my friends thought it was dull in comparison to Bellagio or the like. Food at Aria was also great. Jean Phillippe Patisserie is really wonderful for quick food, the paninis, crepes and pastries are all extremely tasty and it is very conveniently located right next to the elevators. Caffe Vettro is a standard high-end 24 hour coffee shop, and there a buffet (didn't try it) and a wide variety of fine dining options. We ate at Michael Mina's American Fish, which was really excellent, and had some great meat in addition to the fish. A lot of people here kvetch about the resort fee, and I understand why in principle, since it would be more honest to put it into the room rate. On the other hand, I pay $12-15 for internet access all the time at hotels, so having it included in the resort fee was nice. My roommate used the fitness center every day, and it was a first-rate facility, nicer than your average Equinox - for us, the resort fee turned out to be a money saver, since daily use of the internet and fitness center at other Strip hotels would cost more than $22. While check-in was crazy, the check-out process on Sunday (when half the hotel is turning over) was much calmer. Boarding pass printing at the Concierge proved to be a simple, no-waiting task, and was included courtesy of the resort fee. Express check-out went through without a hitch. Aria should be judged on what it is - a giant Strip hotel. This is not the Wynn Tower Suites, and you are not paying Tower Suites prices, so don't expect that level of personalized service. But for what it is, Aria is exceptional. Its luxurious, edgy, modern look is really refreshing in a town full of high-end faux-European hotels and mid-tier generic American joints, pricing is very reasonable for the high quality stuff you are getting, and the food and location is tremendous. I would highly recommend Aria and plan on returning here often.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kamakura-shi, Kanagawa, Japan", "Title": "\u201cPlush and overpriced\u201d", "Author": "dalexlegis", "ReviewID": "UR104226669", "Content": "The room was clean and location is perfect (right in the middle of the strip) but the hotel is overpriced.

The room was gorgeous and elegant. We received a room with a beautiful panoramic view of the strip/city. It was breath taking! You can control your lights, TV, and curtains with one touch with the bedside alarm clock. The beds are to die for. Very comforting, and the mattress \"hugs\" you. I loved it! The bathroom had a soaking tub and separate shower. Housekeeping kept our room clean and fresh towels were delivered on a daily basis. There's a checkpoint to get to your room, so keep your room key handy, as the security will not allow you to walk where the elevators are to get to your room. We also received many free-be's from the hotel (free drinks, food, and extra's to \"play\" with). And the Hotel is centrally located, so it's in the middle of the action. Now, the cons. Our stay at the Aria was for 8 days March25-April 2nd 2011. If you rent a car, please utilize the valet services upon check-in. There is, and I repeat, there is a VERY LONG WALK from the parking garage to the entrance of the hotel. Not only that, when you first enter from the parking garage, you will have to maneuver your way through the casino (and it is a big one) to the lobby where the front desk is located. The front desk clerk was very......................................ethnic. Because we were African-Americans, she utilized a lot of Ebonics, which was very unnecessary. Nonetheless, she did her job and got us checked in. I will say that I was very aware of the fact that there is a resort fee of approximately $25.00 per night, but she also informed us that the hotel would like to charge an additional $133.00 per night for incentives. We told her we were only paying the necessary resort fee. Since we arrived in spring break season and we were located in the middle of the strip, we encountered countless drunken college kids that all seem to belong in a strip club of some sort, or one of Hue Hefner's entourage. And since the hotel is so big, they were walking barefoot with shoes in hand, laughing and partying like a rock star. I come to Vegas a lot and although the Aria is nice, the rooms are a bit smaller when compared to other 5 star Hotels. The Encore, (The Wynn's sister property) is much nicer, and caters to a much more mature crowd.

It's not near any Express bus stop, and the Monorail is so far you can forget it. To compound this, the taxi lines are SUPER long all day. I'm very sorry I spent $1,200 for 5 days here.

Got a great deal for a four day weekend visit over the 4th too. just under $500!! The one downside I would say is if you do get a great deal there which you probably can, the restaurants in the hotel are pricey! And also my friends stayed in the upgraded city view suite. and we didn't. Their window was kinda gross and the view kinda sucked.

Total disappointment; I'll explain... 1. They certainly do try \"nickel and dime\" you every step they get. I booked on Price-line and standard is a 2 bed on the site. I asked for a room with a view of the strip and that I was okay giving up the 2 beds for a 1 bed, I was told it was a $30 per night charge for this upgrade; which I was okay with. Now I am reading reviews on here, they actually charge people $30 for a room with two beds... so because I gave up my 2 beds in a room room, they actually made money because I bet they charged someone else the 30$ extra a night for the room with 2 beds I gave up, AND then I paid $30 a night for the view upgrade. If they were honest with customer service, I really should have paid nothing for the upgrade with a room with 1 bed. 2. I went up to my room, opened the door expecting the best with the curtains opening, lights turning on, tv greeting me... NOT THE CASE! I walked into a room that was TRASHED! The room had obviously been \"partied\" in and not cleaned; I actually started looking around for personal belongings feeling bad I may have been intruding in someone else's room. I sat in the mess of a room on the phone for 10 minutes waiting for the front desk staff to pick up. When they finally did, I got a \"sorry, this is your new room number.\" I then let them know I felt that this was totally unacceptable to just give me a new room being that this was to be a FIVE STAR hotel, my first impression of the room was ruined. They replied that they would give me a room upgrade however there were no suites available during my stay, They then offered a $75 food credit. So I go to the newly assigned room.... 3. I entered the new room expecting this experience with being greeted by the room... again disappointment! I walked into a pitch dark room, couldn't see a thing... here again they did not live up to the 5 star standard. I then called down again now very frustrated. When I asked if they could take the $30 off per night for the strip view, I was told \"No, we can't do that\" REALLY??? This is where I dropped the calm attitude I had and let them have it. Their idea of fixing my first impression was re-setting the walk-in feature and having me walk outside my room and re-entering... what a joke!! When all said and done, I got a 75$ food credit, my resort fee taken off the bill, and a complimentary upgrade to a corner suite for the \"next time\" I say there, If I ever do again. Now take it I only got this because I opened my mouth and called them 3 times. If I had not, I highly doubt they would have done anything to make my stay better. I will say that the bed is comfortable and the floor staff are very nice (house keeping and someone who walks the halls, for safety I guess). The remote features for the temp, curtains, lights, and TV was a nice feature; although the TV guide on the remote reacts about 3-4 seconds after touching the screen, which can get annoying. A 5 star hotel is given 5 stars because they are to be the best of the best, flawless... and when mistakes happen (because they do, we are all human) a real 5 star hotel handles it in the best manner and would truly rectify the situation to have the guest staying and leaving the hotel with a good impression; I basically had to tell them to do something to try make my stay better. No coffee maker in the room either, they want you to go pay for gourmet coffee downstairs; and no refrigerator.

First of all, we got stranded in Dallas on our arrival date due to Southwest Air fusilage-related cancellations, so I called and explained it to them, and they shortened the reservation by a day and did not charge us for the first night (Saturday at $269) when I asked them if they would do this. Very accomodating and loyalty-building. It went somewhat downhill from there, however, when they gave me the rate folio to sign, and it was $269/night, even though I had booked all the other nights at $139, and I had the printed confirmation to prove it. This required their manager to fix, which they did. We had also booked the special \"Upgrade to City View and Breakfast Credit\" and I confirmed the credit when we checked in, that it was $40 per day, and the clerk agreed. The last day of our stay I looked at our folio online to-date, and there were all the breakfast charges, except the first day. I called, and the desk told me it was \"per STAY, not per DAY.\" It honestly does not say that it is either one or the other on the confirmation that I received and the printout I had from their website describing it. It was totally reasonable to assume that it was just like a European plan, i.e. breakfast included daily. This took a trip to the front desk and a front desk manager who looked at the printout of the web site I had, agreed that it was ambiguous, and took off 3 days of breakfast charges. We would have never eaten in the buffet each day if the rules were clear. I just reviewed my final bill, emailed to me, and we were also charged $10 for Almonds from the Refreshment Center.

The wait time to check-in was a little slow, as the computer system went down for almost 10 minutes but overall not too bad. The check-in clerk was very nice, apologized and tried to upgrade us to a suite or strip view room, but none was available because of the Michael Jordan golf tournement that week. Our room was on the 29th floor - not a strip view but was still very good. The room itself was very very nice...clean, large and looked very trendy. The bathroom tub and shower combo room was great...we used both almost every day. The room remote control was easy to use and worked flawlessly for me...although my wife had some difficulties figuring it out. The bed was probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in and the linens were always clean. We found no dust or dirt in our room, and housekeeping was very attentive for us. Aria casino doesn't have a lot of gaming tables and overall it's not one of the bigger casino's on the strip, which was fine for us since we are not huge gamblers anyway. The pool area was phenomenal - 3 separate pools and the Liquid nightclub pool. We even saw a few celebrities at the pool we were at! The bar at the pool was extremely slow, so I recommend using the waitresses for ordering any food or drinks. The pool area was very clean and water temps were nice and warm. Aria breakfast buffet was not very good at all...cafetria style and the food was bland. Highly recommend walking next door to the Cosmo's Wicked Spoon buffet instead...same price and way way better quality, taste and ambiance! Overall we have to rate the Aria as excellent!

We decided to stay at the ARIA, as we had seen pictures of the resort, and liked its location at the center of the strip. We usually stay at the Venetian, so our expectations are high when it comes to Las Vegas hotels. We were extremely disappointed. Check in was unstaffed when we arrived, and the only person available for check in was at the \"Invited Guest\" line. He kept looking over to the regular check in desk hoping for someone to bail him out. This was one of the highlights of our stay. After 20 minutes of waiting (we were the only ones in line), we finally got our key and headed up to the room. The tile floors in the room were dirty. There was lint everywhere, and we ended up wearing socks when we walked on the carpet or into the bathroom. We were able to write our names in the dust that was on the end tables and desk. We assumed that housekeeping overlooked it and would dust them off when they came in the next day, and also pick up, and or vacuum, since my wife noticed a stray hair pin, bottle cap and hair tie on the floor, obviously left by the previous guest. Since that didn't work, we put in a call to the housekeeping manager, and were told that they would take care of our issue. We went out for some sightseeing and came back and nothing had been done. We ended up checking out early and moved to another hotel. The ARIA has a lot of amenities, but some of the electronics don't quite work right. Our in room control panel had the name of the prior guest on the main screen, which seemed strange. Also, the temperature gauge constantly read 59 degrees for outside temps, even though it was 80 + degrees during the day. The air conditioning was set at 70 degrees in the room, but it never felt like the temp ever got under 78. And for some strange reason, the maid always turned the heat up to 80 degrees whenever she came in the room. The casino was nice, but the decor didn't seem to quite fit all together. The staff rarely smiled, and the only authentic \"good morning\" we recieved while there, was from the maintenance guy who was in the middle of painting one of the hallways. The location is nice, as it is in the middle of the strip, with close access to Monte Carlo. It is a little bit of a hike to get to Cosmopolitan, or even back to the strip, but no more than 15 minutes. We usually walked through Crystals, especially when it got hotter after 3 pm. Long story short, If you like dusty rooms, poor service, and a generally blah attitude, this is the place for you. Next trip, you can find us at The Venetian!!!", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat room!

Upon arriving, we learned that they had sold out of all of the rooms that we had reserved. We were upgraded (for free) to a Crystals Suite City View. The Room - The suite was amazing!!! The bathroom was exceptional. The bed - I wanted to take it home with us! The views were unbelievable. We honestly couldn't have asked for any better. Working the lighting, curtains, temp, TV was easy! Two tiny complaints - one day our TV controls in living area stopped working but you could watch TV and then one of our keys stopped working. When we got it fixed, the other one stopped working. The Service - from check-in to check-out all of the employees were so nice. From housekeeping to the bell staff, we had friendly customer service. Big kudos to the bell staff who were super friendly when we stored on our luggage on last day. Restaurants - were expensive but it was a short walk to the Monte Carlo food court so we did that a couple of times. We ate at the Union Restaurant in the lobby one night and it was $150 for 2 filets (one large/one small), order of asparagus, order of pureed potatoes, glass of wine, and a cocktail. However, the food was top notch so worth it. Viva Elvis - Great show! Not as good as \"Love\" but good none the less. We got free tickets when we booked a room. We were upgraded to closer seats upon arriving at the theatre, so that made the show ever better! The Gold Lounge was nice as well. Pool - while the weather the weeks proceeding had been cold, we had 80-90 degree temps each day. We spent 2 days at the pool, and it was great. Music wasn't too loud; pool was heated so perfect temp; hot tubs were nice; adequate chairs. My only small complaint would be that they needed someone to pick up after everyone. It got sort of messy at the end of the day. Also the strawberry daiquiris and pina coladas were good. We got BIG ones, but they are $$$$$$$. ($22 each) Casino - I don't gamble very much at all (pretty much never), but my partner does so while he played, I sat down at a penny machine. I didn't know exactly what I was doing but the bells kept going off. I put in $14 and cashed out when I hit $60 after only 5 minutes. I'm not a serious gambler so not sure how other machines are, but for those on here saying they didn't win, I decided to provide this example. Haze (Nightclub) - we went to the Club. We had friends in the VIP section so we got to skip the line but it is LONG. Very popular club. Not sure we would go back unless we were in VIP section again because the dance floor was so full that people couldn't move. We would stay at Aria again. We love Venetian as well. I think it would be a toss up between the two for our next trip. We will probably go to whichever is offering the better deal.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDirty - Avoid\u201d", "Author": "Breaker64", "ReviewID": "UR102541011", "Content": "I found a dirty sock in my bed the first night.

Before booking my stay i read all the reviews from this site and was very suprised as to the number of negative reviews. In most instances , people create unrealistic expectations for a hotel to meet before they walk in the door. In my case, I came in expecting nothing and I received a memorable vacation. From the moment we walked in the lobby ,we were greeted by a very pleasant hotel employee who welcomed us to the hotel and walked us to the check in area. The lines were extremely long ,due to a HP convention that was checking end at the same time. The employee assured us that even though the lines were long, they were moving quite quickly. Having our doubts we got in line and prepared ourselves for a long wait, but to our surprise we were all checked in by 20 minutes. Hotel employees were passing out bottles of water and information regarding services and amenities that the hotel had to offer, which helped occupy our time waiting in line. Upon entering our rooms , we were pleasantly suprised by the trendy modern decor , which added a new dimension to your basic hotel room. Large flat screen t.v., soft beds, plush linens , and modern furnishings were also present . Everything in the room ( lighting,tv,air conditioning,curtains) are all controlled by a easy to use remote. The bathroom was large with double vanities,enclosed tiolet , granite floors and seperate shower and jacussi tubs. The casino is small compared to others on the strip, but presents you with the same gaming options as far as slots or table games. The dealers were quite personable and polite, as well as all casind employees that we came in contact with. We ate at two of the restaurants located in the hotel, as the food was exquisite and the service top notch.Prices are a bit high, but you definitely get what you pay for as it was well worth it. The Aria is a five star resort in every sense of the word. Every area of the hotel from the conceirge, bellman, security , front desk, bartenders were extremely polite and helpful and helped us enjoy a very relaxing and stress free vacation .

(no smoking floor) so i am sure that should of been frowned upon as well. anyway the third call down we were told we could possibly change rooms around noon thurs as none were available. unsatisfied with that my husband had to get dressed and head down. after speaking in person he was told oh there is a room available on the 20th floor we could move now. well we did. although i do not believe it is fair we had to pack up and move rooms in the middle of the night when it is others causing the disturbance. and it is pretty bad he had to go down and argue to get a room that was obviously available a few minutes earlier when i had talked to them on the phone. shame on them!! i know vegas is a party town but i think at 6am its time to shut it down when its disturbing other paying guests. if we had not booked though west jet holidays we would of left then and there. we have stayed the mirage and the monte carlo in the past and had wonderful customer service there with no noise issues. we could of stayed at one of the lower priced resorts to get the party next door experience if thats what we had wanted. we got to our new room at around 7am slept until about 9 am showered and came back that night to an uncleaned room.

The hotel itself is so beautiful. Very modern and yet still very warm and relaxing. The lighting is typical Vegas (dark!) and there was always music pumping through all common areas. It wasn't obnoxious at all. Our room was wonderful. We had a standard room with a city view upgrade. It was a short walk to the elevator and was very quiet. We never heard noise from other rooms. We loved the touch pad control, the bathroom (excellent shower) and especially the bed. I got the greatest sleep! It was so comfortable. For us, the only way the room was lacking was in lack of electrical outlets. There was one in the bathroom, one by the front door and one at the desk. I like to have my phone charge through the night on the nightstand but there was nowhere to plug it in. My in-laws did note that they wished the room had a coffee maker. I don't ever use in-room coffee makers, but if you do, don't expect to get one here. I did feel like the restaurant options weren't great. There was no \"food court\" where you could get more inexpensive quick food, only high end coffee shops and restaurants and, of course, a buffet. It was never an issue though...whenever we wanted cheaper food, we just walked out to the strip. We did have breakfast at the pastry shop. It was over $20 for a croissant, a cinnamon roll, an iced coffee and a small soda. It was all delicious but not worth the price. The lines to this place get very long. I would recommend going to the other end of the casino (by the taxi stand exit) and getting your morning coffee at \"The Roasted Bean.\" It is about the same price, but never a line. We also had a few meals in the attached \"Crystals\" mall. We ate at Todd English's P.U.B. I'd never go back. The find of the trip was at Wolfgang Puck's Pizzeria and Cucina. They have happy hour all day every day. After seeing a show, we went there, sat at the bar and had $18 pitchers of Sangria (YUM!) and bar bites ($7 each for mini pizzas).

The casino was a lot of fun....I would recommend they add a few more blackjack tables but it really wasn't a problem. A final point that was very impressive to me.....this trip was a gambling trip but since i had never been rated at a MGM property, I had no history at Aria but wanted to stay there anyway. Upon making the reservations, the hotel promised that they would rank my play during the stay and then retrocatively comp based on the play. I have to say i was skeptical about that coming up on someone's radar prior to checkout but unbelievably, a very nice hostess FOUND me at a gaming table and introduced herself, met us at checkout, handled the comps as were justified and even walked with us to the limo taking us to the airport!

Thought I'd go a bit \"Vegas\" and booked a Sky Suite at the ARIA hotel/casino at the new City Centre block on the strip. I've seen a few mixed reviews of the Sky Suites, but our experience was awesome!! Sky Suite bookings include a stretch limo pickup + drop off at the airport. You're taken to a separate (VIP) foyer for check in at the rear of the hotel, the staff swarmed all over us getting our bags etc. Check in was also in a separate foyer (just for Sky Suite guests). A quick check in, then they take us up to the suite where they take a little time and show you all the features. The main \"different\" feature is the touch-screen remote that you can use for lighting, TV, curtains, aircon and many other things throughout the suite. I've seen reviews where some found it confusing and hard to use, but all the features can also be accessed by on-wall switches and TV remotes - so no real problem. The suite is huge and the views of the strip (from our one) was great. Big, spa bath, his + hers vanities, lots of dresser, cupboard space. Nice king bed with great linnen. The only things we didn't like about the suite was there appeared to be no tea/coffee making facilities and the touch screen remote (next to the bed) is REALLY bright at night - we covered it up with a black T-shirt, but it's the only visible clock in the room. Sky suite guests have a small lounge serving coffee / tea / breakfast (continental) in the AM, then snacks + drinks, then in the evening wine + cheese. All free (well - you are paying a bit for the suite). Quick access to the Aria casino and then easy to get to other venues on the strip. All the staff we dealt with (including a dedicated Sky Suite Concierge) were excellent and any requests + bookings we made were dealt with quickly + efficiently.

The Room\u2014The Good 1. Our room and bathroom were immaculate. There was no mold, dust or hair anywhere. Kudos to the housekeeping staff. 2. Room was pleasantly decorated. Contemporary art graced the room and bathroom. Wallpaper, drapes, carpet and most of the woodwork was brown/dark brown/black and provided a soothing contrast to the glitz of Las Vegas. (If you find brown depressing, this may not be the place for you.) Lights and curtains were automated. Very cool! It took a few minutes to figure everything out but if you can work your cell phone/microwave/computer, you can do this. Read the handy-dandy remote control guide provided in the room. Floor to ceiling window spanned the width of the room. Plentiful closet, drawer and counter space. Three phones\u2014one cordless. Drawer safe. Full-sized mirror on wall. Good temperature control. Very comfortable bed, four fluffy pillows and beautiful white linens. Well-stocked mini-bar. Large, flat-screen TV on wall. Great audio visual panel at the desk\u2014again, read the guide provided in the room. 3. Bathroom was gorgeous. Lovely light tan/brown stone. Exceptional lighting, double sink and large mirror. Soaking bathtub was part of the shower area. Very cool concept. However, even with the grab bar, this area might be problematic for an older person getting in and out of the bathtub if the shower was recently used. (It would be in Aria\u2019s best interest to provide a safety bath mat for the shower floor.) I appreciated the drawer and shelves in the bathroom and the lighted magnifying mirror. The Room\u2014Improvement Needed 1. Lighting was inadequate. A 40-watt bulb lamp and a 25-watt wall sconce on each side of the bed is not enough lighting for reading in bed. There was a small, just adequate 60-watt reading light for the desk. There was only a 40-watt lamp near the chair. 2. Electrical Outlets. Let me count them for you. One double in the bathroom. Two singles at the desk. One double near the front entry. Six plugs in all. None of them are anywhere near the bed or near the chairs. The Resort\u2014The Good 1. Aria\u2019s architecture is contemporary, elegant and simply beautiful. Every day, I discovered something new to appreciate. If you find contemporary style \u201ccold\u201d, this may not be the resort for you but otherwise\u2026wow! 2. I found Aria\u2019s employees to be extremely hard-working and dedicated. This resort was huge and crowded at times and I thought the employees did an excellent job under the circumstances. I was also impressed that the employees took such good care of the inebriated or otherwise indisposed guests\u2014all without being condescending or judgmental. There is a lot of compassion here among the rank and file workers. 3. The Aria has some of the cleanest bathrooms I have ever seen. There is an attendant in every bathroom and they are always cleaning. I did not mind tipping. 4. We enjoyed the restaurants in the Aria. They were expensive but the days of the cheap buffet are gone. In the resort, we ate at Lemongrass, American Fish and the more casual (read \u201crelatively inexpensive\u201d) Caf\u00e9 Vettro. We had room service a couple of times. Dinner arrived within 30 minutes and breakfast came promptly at the time we ordered it. 5. Very nice, sophisticated casino! I am not a big gambler and even I felt comfortable here. I noticed that a few reviewers said the casino and the nearby hallways were smoky. I am very sensitive to smoke and I did not think that this was the case at all. The Aria must have a tremendous air conditioning/filtering system. I could smell some smoke but it was not at all issue for me. I am fairly high-maintenance on this issue in any environment so my take on this should speak volumes. The Resort\u2014The Bad I put the following comment at the end of my review because this is a complete deal-breaker for me but it may not be for other travelers. I personally will choose not to go back to the Aria for this one reason. I like rock music and I love to dance. I also can appreciate the energy that background music gives a space. However, occasionally, I need a quiet space to work, read, conduct a quiet conversation or simply daydream. However, Aria management makes no effort to provide any kind of *free*, music-free, public space. Rock music was constantly and unrelentingly piped into all public spaces. My best guess is that a hyper eighteen-year-old and his Ipod were put in complete control of the hotel sound system. I understand that a smaller hotel might not have the resources to provide a free quiet space for its guests, but a large five-star resort should be able to provide this amenity. One should not have to pay $1.00 per minute (yes, Aria\u2019s going rate for a small business room) to get a music-free space for reading and working. I spoke to someone about this issue at the front desk and she said that other people had complained about it also but that Aria management had no intention of changing their policy. They like it this way. This business decision on their part leads me to believe that I am not part of Aria\u2019s target audience and that I need, unfortunately, to listen to my own admonition.

They experienced dirty rooms (when I say dirty I mean DIRTY gross DIRTY) upon check-in and had to switch twice, nightmare for them. The rooms are just okay compared to others on the strip, nothing really out of this world. The in-room technology I guess is neat but more of a bother than a convenience. The casino (slots only) the worst selection of slots on the strip. I could not find anything that I really enjoyed and I ended up playing at other MGM properties and Planet Hollywood across the street. It's a convenient location but plan on doing a lot of walking. The tram is nice but I think walking would be quicker to the Monte Carlo and Bellagio due to the fact that you have to walk soooo far to get the tram etc. not worth it. The Breakfast Buffet is good, nothing special. A lot of expensive restaurants. Architecture is beautiful, there is a strong smell of vanilla pumped into the hotel/casino area which didn't bother me but could see that it might be bothersome if you don't like the smell of vanilla. Would I go back? If it were comp'd again, MAYBE...it's just not as convenient as one would think (I run 3 miles a day and bike 2) I don't mind walking at all but it's walking in circles to get someplace directly across the street that drives me crazy.

In order to get out of the hotel/casino, you must walk through the Crystal shopping center or all the way around it. It's not a quick walk either. As for the hotel room, we had little to complain about. The first room we received had a really nice view and was on the 14th floor. But, there was a door adjoining our room to a room next door and we could hear every single word our neighbors were saying when they arrived home at 3 am. They were loud college guys and it was impossible to sleep at all. We checked in around 12 am and had to request a room change by 6 am. The front desk was great- they assigned us another room without any question. The only downside was that our new room was on the 4th floor without any kind of view (we saw a roof from our window). It was however very quiet. The rooms were smart with controls for the curtains, lights, tv etc. I found them to be easy to understand and convenient. It was nice to just use the Master on/off when leaving the room to shut off everything and close the drapes. The bathroom had a shower and soaking tub enclosed together which was fun. Also, they had a nice sitting area in the standard deluxe room that included two chairs and a table. This was in addition to a desk with full controls for your computers, phones etc. Overall, once we changed rooms to a quieter one, things were great. The beds were also very comfortable. The second room had a soft down comforter that was heaven. The first room had a rough duvet cover that we couldn't sleep with so I was a little chilly. The casino had a really nice perfume smell pumped in and the architecture/ design was modern and fun. As with any Vegas casino the food was expensive (expecially at Skyboxx where a sandwich will run you $27)! They do charge a daily service fee for high speed internet and the fitness center/ pools. We used the fitness center each day and found it to be great. The machines were all new and all the cardio equipment had iPhone/iPod connections and a TVs. The pool area was also really great and b/c it wasn't too warm we found seats easily and enjoyed some time outside. I will not stay at the Aria again because of how difficult it was to get anywhere. I think we will go back to Bellagio or Planet Hollywood. I think this casino is beautiful but not as nice as Bellagio or Wynn or some of the other higher end ones. Also, about the shopping... none of the stores at the Crystal shopping center were worth visiting for us. They were so high end that it wasn't worth spending time at. We walked through the mall several times a day to get to the Strip and honestly the stores were always empty. I prefer to shop at The Forum Shops at Caesar's or Planet Hollywood.

The check-in line was massive upon our arrival, but on the phone I had been told to check-in at the unmarked desk on the left that had a much shorter line - might be something to ask about. Upon checking in, we were told that we had been upgraded - I wasn't sure what this meant, perhaps they had been trying to cover up my upgrade in front of the gf? Once we got to our room I realized I was wrong - they had set us up in one of the penthouses, simply an amazing room with views to match. From the moment we arrived onwards, the service was outstanding. The bell-hop was quick to greet us and seemed friendly and happy, as did the staff at large. Chocolate and coconut strawberries were brought to our room the first day, along with a card stating \"we hope you enjoy your special occasion\" - was difficult to play that one off in front of the gf as I hadn't proposed yet. On the second day, I worked with the concierge to setup a trail of rose petals leading to the bed which was also covered in rose petals. They did an excellent job at this, and also provided champagne and more chocolate strawberries. She said Yes, and I'm happy to say I left our trip with a fiancee. Room service did a phenomenal job of cleaning the rooms. The pool was very nice as well. We didn't try many of the restaurants in the hotel - went to the buffet once that cost $60+ with tip for two people.

Like most of the Vegas hotels the resort fee is a bit of a con if you don't have any use for wi fi, fitness room, spa and the newspaper which you have to collect yourself, so make sure you take your fitness gear & swimming costume if you have them and get something for your money! Use the Sweet Chill cafe on the Promenade rather than the pateserrie in the casino if a quick coffee/cake/paninni - the queues are a lot less.

So this time we decided to try out the Aria Sky Suites and it was well worth it. It all started with a complementary Limo ride to the Private Sky Suites entrance, way better than arriving by the main entrance which is typically busy. We were greeted by a very helpful bellman upon arrival, and escorted to the check in desk. Once there we checked in to our Aria 2 Bedroom Suite on the 51st Floor. And by the way every floor has a different smell for arousal of some sort, Our floor smelled like Oranges and it was very pleasant, how cool is that! The room was amazing, 1630 sq feet with floor to ceiling windows very ultra modern furnishings and electronics, the bathrooms even had different mood lighting for an occasion! and as well a cozy steam room built into the Shower, a heated toilet seat! and cleaning apperatus to wash your behind when you are done your business! It was just over the top amazing. Also, there is a exclusive complementary lounge for Sky suites guests only, and what a treat that was. 24h coffee, pastries, juices, anything you want! and starting at 5PM there is chocolate strawberries for an added touch. Eating wise, the food was excellent around the hotel the buffet was well worth the money with anykind of food imagineable anytime of day, Jean Philippe Patisserie is there as well with the BEST GELATO EVER! TRY IT! and other tasteful treats as well. They have a huge casino with a great selection of Slot Machines and table games, dont get lost! and dont worry waiting on a drink the waitresses there are attentive and fast paced getting drinks. I also tried out the workout center, which has a great variety of Workout machines and its probally the biggest workout center I have ever worked out at at a hotel on the strip.There is complementary drinks, and snacks while working out there as well, very nice overall. Entertainment is great as well Me and my Family went to Viva Elvis show situated in the Aria and it was a fantasic performance, and is probally one of the best shows me and my family have ever been to! A great recommendation to get these tickets is at Tickets for tonight which have half off tickets for shows and good deals on meals as well, we got our tickets for a good deal for a VIP seat! Instead of $150 for box office prices each we got them for only $90 its well worth the savings. You can find these places across the Street from the Aria at the Hawaiian Marketplace, Showcase mall, or Fashion Show Mall across the Street from the Wynn. Thats only a few they are scattered all the way down the strip. Aria is very close to most attractions on the strip and is in a great location. Overall Out of every Hotel I have stayed at this is the Best one and I will be coming back very soon, the Staff were wonderful and helpful and provided great service.

Light bulbs in 2 of my lights didn't work and it was hard enough as it was not to feel like I was in the dark. I enjoyed the electronic controls as soon as I figured everything out. The bed is super comfy. Biggest downside for me: The casino has an overpowering floral scent. It's like walking into a department store perfume department. I got a headache every time I was in there for more than 20 minutes. Might explain why the casino was relatively empty. Had a really great meal at Julian Serrano. Liked that I didn't have to walk a mile from the front desk to the elevators. I had a special deal with a $50 a day resort credit which I confirmed on check in. When I checked out they hadn't credited me. I had to ask and it caused a pretty long delay that involved a manager and some complicated accounting maneuvers... Check your bills!

He went to the ticket desk and explained that my husband and I were waiting to get in and to let us know when it was showtime. About 45 minutes after getting there Harry came back to check on us and took us to the front door and into the showroom. We really enjoyed the show and would recommend it to anyone.

Since we were going to be there so long, we decided to splurge on a corner suite. For the price of a mediocre room in NYC we got a two room suite that was over 900 square feet. It had two bathrooms. A half bath off the living room that my daughter used most of the time and a full bath off the bedroom. The full bath featured a whirlpool tub, tv set (my daughter got a kick out of watching tv while taking a bath), a nice big shower, a heated toilet seat and two sinks. You can program the curtains, tv, temp etc from either your television set or a small screen by the bed. When you set the alarm, not does the alarm sound but the curtains open too. Very cool. We don't really gamble so I can say much about the casino except I can tell you that the air scrubbers did a good job - never smelled cigarette smoke. While the prices of the room are very reasonable, the food prices are pretty expensive. The buffet was tasty. The price ranged from about $16 for breakfast, $25 for brunch plus tip. The bakery was unbelievable (Jean Phillipe) but pricey. Cup of tea was $3.50. Fruit cup $7.50. Roast beef sandwich $9 or $10. The staff was as friendly as can be.

I had convention at Mandalay Bay, but I was offered a good club rate at Aria. We checked in at 6 pm. It took maybe 15 minutes total. My wife waited at nearest slot and turned $2 into 30 on a penny machine... a good omen? I tried a $50 sandwich but the clerk laid it on the top counter. Only upgraded to City-View but on 22 floor and threw in a mini-fridge. I said the 50 was for a suite but gave him $20 anyway. It was President's Day eve after all. The most striking features are the dazzling front of Aria at night and the aromatherapy vanilla smell throughout the hotel. It is very much preferred to cig smoke for me. And through the week, when we came in that scent seemed to say that we were home. We genuinely enjoyed it. The room was very nice... close to Panorama room at Wynn that we enjoyed in September. The bed was among the best mattresses of any hotels we have stayed in. Bathroom was fresh and thoroughly cleaned and stocked with top-end toiletries. The electronic control panel was okay. Many Seasoned Citizens would be stumped to use it. Between panel, wall controls and switches on lamps themselves, it was an effort to get lamps on for the first time. The view was great and we kept drapes open 24/7. Housekeeping was good for 4 days but stumbled on last night. We left the room at 8:30 am and stopped in for just minutes during the day. We turned on the electronic \"Service\" light at the door each time that we left. Finally, at 4 pm when we returned from the pool with wet suits the maid was in our room. She said she was just starting and nicely offered to come back later. Rather than stand outside shivering for 20 minutes, we accepted the offer. And she asked when she should return. I said an hour. So, we had an\"appointment\" - Great!! When we returned at 8 pm, you guessed it...no sign of a maid. We had a 3 am wake-up call set for an early flight and had plans of an early bedtime. A call to housekeeping got us a rude lady offering full service or just towels!! i thought for a quality hotel we should get the full treatment, so she would send someone right away. Well 45 minutes later they showed up and we settled for just towels. I told the front desk at check-out and they did comp our buffets. Very satisfactory. All of the food is quite expensive, but we had plans to go out for many meals. The buffet is a good value. Breakfast buffet ran about the same price as a pastry and tea at the counter service around the casino. Mellow music in public areas...lots of Cheryl Crowe. The pool area was beautiful and OPEN, which is more than most LV pools in February. We Northerners need a little sun, even if it is only 60 degrees. The casino treated us well. Staff was great and friendly. We are low stake VP players and the machines seemed to be very gentle and the money lasted a long time. Trips to other casinos during the week reminded us how fast the 50's evaporate at some machines. The Aria casino waitresses were a hoot! Sometimes hard to find the first time, but once they got that first tip, they re-appeared regularly. We had very cheap res at TI for the last 3 days in case we felt like switching, but I think the slots would have eaten up that $60 per day savings. We stayed put. Our stay wasn't perfect, but everyone except the HK supervisor was very nice, the slots and free drinks were a hit, the bed was a keeper, the Jean Phillipe pastries were killer and the whole place smelled like Grandma's Kitchen.

The first night we were woken up at 2 am by very noisy neighbors. I called the front desk and they told me to give it about an hour for them to settle down. An hour? Well I called back 30 minutes later and they said they would tell security. I called again 10 minutes after that and still no security. The neighbors happened to leave the room right after that last call so we went back to sleep. They returned at 4 am only to wake us up again. I called the front desk a fourth time and this time they sent security up and the people left the room. The next day I went to the front desk and told them what happened and showed the documented times I called and the gentleman seemed a little concerned that security never did anything until 4 am. We had our room changed and had no problems for the next 4 nights. The room itself is very nice. The upgraded technology thing is kinda neat and fairly convenient. The bed was very comfortable. I am not very keen on the idea that all the snacks and sodas are weight sensored meaning that if you just move something or knock it over, you get charged for it. Seems like a cheesy way to make more money. How do they know the maid didn't do it? We had no extra charges on our bill because we were careful. Just make sure you understand they are weight sensored. We joked about this as we walked throughout the day. You wanna take a shower? $10. You used the toilet? $3. You slept in the bed? $15. Just seems fairly ridiculous. Not sure if this is the standard for all other hotels in Las Vegas. We did one lunch buffet while there and it was excellent. Very pricey at $20 per person for lunch. Breakfast is $15 which we did not do. Dinner is $28 per person. One of the newer things I saw was a 24 hour buffet pass for various places. At Excalibur you can have 24 hour access for $25 but only at their buffet. Still pretty good. At Total Rewards casinos you can access any or all of them for 24 hours for $45-$50 per person. I wish the Aria would do something similar and give hotel residents a discount like offer 24 hour Aria buffet for $50 per person for hotel guests, $60 for nonhotel guests. Just a suggestion. Some of the other hotels like Venetian have multiple small cheap snack type shops in their lobby. All of the Aria places including the cafe are pricey. It seems as though Las Vegas used to be the place to go for great cheap food buffets and with the economy downturn and people not gambling, the hotels have chosen to now make money off of food so don't go thinking you will get great food deals. I can't say I would not recommend this hotel since every experience is different. I can't say the hotel wasn't nice. The neighbor noise is not their fault - that could happen anywhere.

Located on the strip but a bit removed as well, as the entrance is up off the boulevard. This is a plus if you want some relief from the crazy pace of the strip. It's a negative if your feet are already aching from all the walking around you just did.

I would have liked to pull up to the front door of the place and been wowed by the elegance! It's a long walk from the bus lobby through the casino to the main lobby to register. The bathrooms had no towel bars and just one hook on the wall. SUGGESTIONS: Use the free monorail if heading towards the Bellagio - your feet will thank you for it!

I read some strange complaints on Tripadvisor throughout the years, but I don't remember seeing anything like this even for a Motel 6, let alone for a place claiming to be 5-star and AAA 5-diamond. In a nutshell, we packed all our stuff in the morning of our checkout day and headed out for breakfast. The plan was to come back to our room afterwards, pick our stuff and proceed with checkout. When we come back, we were shocked to find our keys not working, our room already occupied with new guests (poor people, did they even clean the room?) and our belongings nowhere to located immediately. But hey, it is not even checkout time and we certainly did not complete the checkout procedure. It took them about an hour to sort things out. On the positive side, our luggage turned up after a long chain of inquiries. Ironically, it was at lost&found! But good luck if you were planning to catch a plane at that point! Amazingly the front desk staff and manager was more defensive than apologetic throughout. (Where is my mistake here, again?) Once the luggage is located, all they wanted was to have the security report signed off so that we can declare nothing is missing. That clears them of any liability, at which point your status officially becomes unwelcome. Onto the review of the property, the hotel is new and very elegant with contemporary design. Rooms certainly have a wow factor with beautiful furnishings, large flat-screen TVs and rather high-tech room integration. Bathrooms are immaculate with separate soaking tub, shower and WC areas. Make no mistake, just by its looks, this is a 5-star property. It is located right at the heart of The Strip so that you can walk in each direction easily. I tried the Sunday brunch at the buffet. While it is priced on par with Bellagio or Wynn, by its presentation and food, it must be one of the most forgettable buffets I have been in Vegas -- and I have been to quite many of them over the years. They have unlimited snow crab legs, but food selection and quality is very poor otherwise. My last remark is, while what happened to me was probably uncommon (or is it?), given that it is a major screw-up on their part and their part only, I am certainly not happy with the way it was handled. My advice to travelers is that if you can get a room here through Hotwire or Priceline at 50-60% of published rates, you can still go for it as you typically start overlooking things for the value you are getting; but if you would pay the list price thinking you are getting into a world-class 5-star property with impeccable service, well, you might be a little disappointed there.", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cfabulous\u201d", "Author": "saundra14", "ReviewID": "UR97724001", "Content": "This was our fifth trip to Vegas, and I must say i was quite impressed. the rooms were fabulous and very high tech. there was a remote as well as the clock in the room that controlled everything sorta like an ipad , including the curtains,tv, lights and the temperature. the refrigerator in the room was completely stocked (not free of course) but a great selection.

But if the weather is nice in the middle of the afternoon, go down and enjoy a cold drink by the pool. There is a free tram that connects you to the Bellagio, and although it's super short, it'll save you a little walking at least. The hotel is steps away from the city center which offers some very upscale shopping. Great if you're looking to spend some money, but also good if you just want to window shop and admire! If you've never been to Vegas before, bring comfy shoes, because to see everything you will do a LOT of walking! Which works out well because with the buffets you will definitely gain a few pounds!

The line at the concierge was long. It took until 4:30pm for our room to be serviced. We ate at the breakfast buffet, which was great and pretty reasonable at $15. Everything from eggs benedict, made to order omelettes, sausages, congee and kimchi and pastires. We went before and learned that if you go around 10:30, you'll probably still be there when they change over for lunch :) Had a late lunch at Julian serrano and prices there was reasonable too. No ceviche on the lunch menu, but the gazpacho was best thing we ordered. The stuffed peppers were also very good. Tuna and raspberry bites weren't that great--overpowered by the raspberry. We also went to the happy hour at American Fish. $5 is a great deal, but the selections were so so. 2 Oysters and 2 pieces of yellowtail sashimi were not bad but pretty hard to mess up. Lobster corndogs and fish and chips pretty uninspired. The aioli and tartar sauces were the best parts. We didn't go to the clubs or eat anywhere else in CityCenter.

The restaurant choices are good, the casino is a bit dark and not really inviting. The whole city center has an office building feel with prices of corporate art spread around. The rooms feel smaller than their size, probably because there is furniture in front of the full length windows. Oh and yes the windows are filthy. The room automation is clunky, unintuitive and slow compared to standard systems.

I called downstairs to find out what had happened to our personal items in the fridge, only to met by an extremely rude front desk clerk, who was abrasive and anything but helpful. Had to call back and was waiting for 20 minutes to get through. The manager offered a half hearted apology and offered a $100 food credit for the inconvenience of having everything in our fridge discarded. We should have accepted the food credit, because we decided to cancel our prior dinner reservations and eat at Julian Serrano which was located inside the hotel. The food was extremely overpriced for the bland and disappointing food that we were served. The next day upon check out, we noticed that we had in fact not been credited $100 in food, even though the manager had in fact promised it would automatically be taken care of.

The service is always great with many helpful people. The casino is kept impeccably clean and lots to keep your eyes busy. The rooms are very nice and the beds are amazing!

The rooms lights, curtains, music, and television can all be controlled on one touch screen remote. If you're not too tech-savvy you may find this troublesome. The bathrooms are nicely maintained with an awesome shower and large tub. One problem we have had with the Aria is that the bathroom doors stick or a handle in the bathroom is loose. You can easily contact the front desk and they send someone over ASAP. The pools are great with plenty of great staff to find you a nice spot to lay out or stay in the shade. I definitely recommend everyone sign up for the Player's Club in the casino area. The last two times I have been were complimentary stays. In other words, free rooms. Their are tons of restaurants and buffets. I have not visited the buffets, but I went to the Spanish restaurant, Julian Serrano and it was deliciously amazing.

Since it's my birthday, we go all out and try to have the most luxurious experience possible - we booked a suite and requested a high floor. My husband used the limo service to pick us up from the airport and worked with the concierge to arrange for flowers, chocolate-covered strawberries and my favorite Willamette Valley wine.

The food was good, the service was good and my room had an incredible view of the mountains and city (not the strip, though, which was ok). The rooms have an iPad-like controller that controls everything -- the TV, music, lighting, curtains... It was very cool. The bathroom was gorgeous with granite countertops, marble tile in the shower and a full sized tub. The exercise room was giant and had everything you would need. I didn't use the pool because it was cold. The spa pricing was a bit high so we opted out of the spa experience but the brochure looked very inviting. I think my favorite thing about the hotel was the overall ambiance it created --- a spa-like retreat in the heart of the Vegas strip --- and the rooms. The least favorite aspects were the expense for food (hard to get breakfast for under $15, including coffee) and the high spa pricing. However, that would not prevent me from staying there again and recommending it to my friends.

I\u2019m a slots player and there was an ok amount. My one beef with the slots at Aria, is that almost all of the penny slots only had 40 credit or 80 credit options (or higher) \u2013 so your 1 cent slot machine actually costs you 40-80 cents + per play \u2013 that felt a bit like a scam, they had literally removed the other buttons from being options! This is the case at other hotels as well for sure, but not to this extent! The drink girls circulated well, never waited long for a drink. Tho their hands were open for a tip before they even put down your drink, and barely any thank you\u2019s when being tipped (in contrast to the Cosmo drink girls who seemed genuinely thankful everytime I tipped) Room: Arrived to a reasonably clean room \u2013 which I was nervous about given the TA reviews..one negative upon arrival, the Fiji water for sale was half drank! Gross! We never called down to front desk, so chances are we\u2019re also going to get charged for that water!! I am a tech savvy person, programming phones and other devices for friends/family all the time \u2013 but I found the technology in this room needlessly complicated. It\u2019s fine if you want to setup your home this way, and you have the time to learn the system, but for a hotel room, I at least, want everything to be very simple and straightforward \u2013 which this room didn\u2019t always provide. We eventually stopped using the main panel on the nightstand for anything, and just used the actual switches themselves, worked just fine \uf04a The best part about the room for our needs, as we were a group of three girls traveling together, is that we all fit in the bathroom at the same time to get ready! This was super handy, and is not always possible in a hotel bathroom, so really allowed us all to get ready efficiently. Staff: Front desk girl was fantastic, really helpful, explained everything with the technology, room key, sensored mini bar, etc (which I already knew from reading these forums, but still helpful). Other than that didn\u2019t encounter any other staff members, but front desk girl was so friendly I had to call it out. Price: Would not pay full price for this hotel, given so many other quality options nearby, but if you can snag a deal, it\u2019s worth checking out, once Other: The vanilla smell did bother me somewhat (especially when hungover), I am a bit smell sensitive.. Overall, this was a nice enough place to stay, but upon next trip to Vegas, will either return to Bellagio, or try Cosmo.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cA very big, new bold-looking hotel\u201d", "Author": "dont-Winnipeg", "ReviewID": "UR96745569", "Content": "It was our first trip to Las Vegas.

The Elvis show looked interesting but we weren't there long enough to see it (only two nights). The prices for the shows are EXPENSIVE. Look for deals at the ticket booths on the street. Obviously, everyone else did because there were daily lineups for tickets. Electronic gamiung machines were everywhere. If you play, expect to lose it all eventually. I didn't see a winner anywhere. If you haven't been to the strip, you have to go, even if it's just to see it. The world is represented in its architecture (all scaled down representation) and in its visitors. The Aria is centrally located to visit a lot of different hotels. However, don't expect to walk the entire strip in 30 minutes like we thought we could.

If you want close proximity, stay downtown in the \"old school\" part of vegas. My spouse and I travel usually 2-3 times per year, and I am a very picky person. If I am staying at a 5 star I expect a 5 star experience, after reading the reviews I was prepared to have some complaints and/or issues. Overall I was very impressed! Previous visits to Vegas was at the Luxor, Bellagio, and now Aria, and hands down Aria was the best by far! Check in/Check out was fast and efficient. Room was beautiful, spacious, clean, and comfortable. Got 23 floor and view was amazing. Our three nights there, not a sound was heard outside of the room, it was pure bliss! Technical gadget was neat, but took forever to change channels. Could imput a service notice on the wall outside door to say request service, and by early afternoon our room was not done, no big deal, just replaced with privacy sign so we could have a afternoon nap, and housekeeping choose that time to ignore the privact sign and try getting into the room, thank goodness for deadbolts, but that was the biggest negative we ran into, after nap, and an evening of entertainment our room was always done for bedtime. From the players club, to the attendants running the floor, room service, servers...service was amazing, super friendly, talkative, informative. Definetly 5 star customer service. We ate at the Buffet, as well as room service, other than that we ate on our excursions. There was a Mcdonalds/Subway/Pizza in the mall connecting Aria and Monte Carlo hotel so we would grab a quick bite there so we wouldn't interupt our fun time. Bonus they had a harley store on the way! IF you don't like crowds (in Vegas...yeah right) go during the week. We stayed a wed-sat, and come friday it was a packed house, but the service was still top notch! As for resort service fee, most hotels have one, so we knew what to expect. We got a good deal and it was worth every penny....if I had to pay full price i would have expected more bells and whistles. Casino, we didn't do too bad, got some big pay outs on the penny machines and had ALOT of fun doing it. Probably the best pay out of all three previous trips.

No attempt was made to resolve the issue, nor did the manager come out to speak with us.

I've been an MGM member for 10 years, so I thought I'd take advantage of a free offer. NEVER AGAIN! Prior to checking out of my room after 4 days in Vegas, I placed my camera bag into a white plastic shopping bag with souvenirs and gifts. I tied the bag shut. The bellman picked up our luggage from the room. I watched him put the white plastic bag on the cart with my luggage, and saw my camera for the last time. The valet took control of the luggage and personal items from the bellman and placed the luggage and personal items into my truck. Upon arrival at home, I unloaded the luggage. I saw that the white shopping bag had been untied. I couldn't find the camera. I searched my truck, but there was no camera to be found. Hmmmmmmm... how did the bag become untied, and where is the camera?? I made several calls to my casino host, a pit boss who's card I had from a prior incident in the hotel, I made a telephone report with the security department, I called the housekeeping department and lost & found. No one seemed to care. I was told cameras are lost all the time. Mine was not lost, it was stolen. My casino host would not make the effort to compensate for the loss, even after I told him I would take my gambling business away from MGM after 10 years of dedicated play. In my opinion, either the bellman or the valet stole my camera. On a side note... I'm an EMT. During this stay, I witnessed a medical emergency on the casino floor while walking to brunch on 7/4/10. A person was laying on the floor, unconscious, in a position of distress. The security staff was not rendering care, they were keeping people back & talking on radios. I identified myself as a NREMT and asked a security person if I could help this person. I was told Yes, so I began administering care. After my assessment, I began treatment. While this person was legally under my direct medical care, a female security person from the ARIA casino told me \"sir, please step away from this person now\". I looked up and asked her if she was an EMT. She said \"No\". I asked her if she was a Paramedic. She said \"No\". I explained that my national protocols state that unless she was a higher level of care than me, by law, I can not abandon care of this person until someone of a higher level of care assumes the patient care I've already started. The female security person told me \"sir, I'm asking you for the last time to please step away from this person, or I'll arrest you for trespassing\". All this was happening while I continued to administer care. Just as I stood up to confront this woman face to face to again explain federal law, thankfully, Clark County Medics arrived on scene. I gave a professional turn over to the medics who praised my efforts. Afterward, a casino pit boss named Jack Konhorst approached me. Shook my hand & said I did the right thing. We talked & Jack agreed, The security person was wrong asking me to stop giving care. I told Jack the resort needs to have people trained to handle medical emergencies. At minimum, first responders who are trained in CPR and basic first aid. Call 911 if you need medical help. I wouldn't depend on the MGM staff to help me or my family if we had a medical emergency during our stay at any of their resorts. After reading the above... Would you? Buh Bye MGM.

I was looking forward to my stay at this hotel because of the technology and the stylish decor. The first room we checked into had oily fingerprints on the 2 nightstands, mirrors, cabinets, and door. There was what appeared to be splattered toothpaste on the bathroom walls. We opened the bed and there were many small hairs. There was crusty white substance on the bed scarf (you decide what it is). We were moved to a second room one floor up with a view of the strip. The second room had 2 obvious drops of dried urine in plain sight on the toilet seat, hairs on the bed and pillows, oily fingerprints all over the furniture, and small hairs in the restroom. At this point, it was becoming sort of a joke. We were moved to a third room. The third room had urine around the toilet seat hinge, hairs, eyeliner shavings, and lint in all the corners of the bathroom floor and under the sink vanity (obviously not swept and mopped), hair in the shower, oily prints on the walls and furniture, and the bed had small hairs in it. At this point the housekeeping supervisor had to come in to verify these things, which all were verified by him with his own eyes. He said a manager would call us. We waited 15 minutes and no call, so we called down because we were tired and wanted to just get the heck out of there. The front desk wasn't too helpful and said that they would have to charge the first night even though we had not stayed for more than 5-10 minutes per (dirty) room. Wow, what lack of common sense to do that to a guest. We needed to speak to the manager if we wanted to leave without a charge. We spoke with the manager and she said she personally went up and found the rooms to be up to standard. I showed her all the pictures I snapped as evidence and she then realized that housekeeping had touched up the rooms by the time she went to check them. No sincere apology, but instead she was confident that they had a great product and was sorry we did not get a chance to see that. Major lack of cleanliness, attention to detail, sincere customer care, and efficiency and effectiveness of communication. If you don't mind a few hairs on your sheets and pillows, unmopped bathroom floors, fingerprints on the furniture, crusty white stuff on the bed scarf, toothpaste splattered on the bathroom walls, and urine on your toilet then this hotel is for you.

We got a great deal for a little 4 night last minute getaway and since I heard about the Aria was game. First I want to start with the good. The hotel itself is beautiful. It is very sleek and modern. They were also preparing for the Chinese New Year so there were Rabbits and red all around us. The check in process itself was very quick. The only caveat was that they were out of single beds on non-smoking areas and had to opt for 2 queen sized beds if we wanted a non-smoking room. (It forced my wife and I to sleep closer together, so not necessarily a bad thing) I read some other reviews that the casino pumped some sort of vanilla fragrance in the casino to mask the cigarette smell. As a former smoker, cigarette smoke does not bother me (it does my wife however) but I didn't find the scent they used overpowering or bothersome. Personally, I like the smell they used. Going to the rooms, what I liked was that there was a security guard at the elevators that would not let you access them unless you had a key card. I like the idea of limiting access to guest elevators to actual guests. (I assume it is to keep out thieves and prostitutes) The rooms are well appointed and modern. The issue I can see with some people that are not tech savvy is that everything is electronically controlled by a touch pad, from the TV to the curtains to the lights. I didn't find it an issue and thought it was pretty cool. We had a huge window and saw the Palms and other casinos from our hotel and our beds were very comfortable. There is a nice large flat screen TV in HD, not that we spent much time in the rooms, but it was pretty cool never the less. When we got there, we noticed they only had one bathrobe. I called and within 5 minutes house keeping were up with more bathrobes. An issue I also noticed was that the tub drain was not stopping the water properly. I called and noticed it was fixed later on. I was on the 22 floor and it was extremely quiet. I didn't hear any noise at all from other guests or the casino. Now maybe the lower floors had issues, I can't speak for them. But from the 22 floor at night, I could hear a pin drop. The Bad - The only major issue I had with this hotel is that the food is ridiculously priced. At their low end Cafe Vettro, it was $13 for eggs and an additional $6 for bacon...... really? Their fine dining establishments were expensive as I would expect that they would be, but the casual dining experience was EXTREMELY expensive. My wife and I ate elsewhere, but it was silly how much they were charging. Another issue, was when I closed my sheer curtains, it made a loud grinding noise. I called housekeeping to address the issue but they never did. Another issue I could see with some people is that it is set back a little from the strip. Some people may be picky and want to be ON the strip. You do have access to a tram and to walk onto the strip is about a 3 minute walk. To me, this wasn't an issue at all, but for people that might be picky about their location, it could be. Just bear that in mind. This hotel is definitely geared toward higher end clientele, being next door to a high end mall (Louis Vuitton, Fendi, etc). I would honestly stay here again, but again, my only issue is how they hit you over the head with high prices for food.

I have watched City Center being built from the ground up and was always wondering how the entire complex would turn out. Well - it is simply AMAZING! Aria is by far one of the highest class, cleanest, and best service Hotel and Casino's I've ever been in. And, to top it off, it is a LEED Gold building, which scores big points with me (I work in the building industry, so I'm a building/architecture geek). Aria just does everything right from the moment you walk in (what is that scent? Vanilla? Awesome!!) to the masculine and tasteful decor throughout the lobby/casino. We got a room on the 8th floor, which wasn't my hope, but I still couldn't complain at all. The room was everything and more than what I had hoped for. I was expecting it to be nice, but I was totally blown away! I do have to say that my only complaint is that the separate little room for the toilet was enclosed in a frosted glass. While this is nice for a little privacy, it doesn't really provide the privacy of a solid door. If I was with someone other than my wife, I really wouldn't have liked this. My wife said that this would not work if she was there with girlfriends all trying to get ready in the bathroom. The other complaint was about the bathroom as well. While in the shower, good luck trying to have a conversation with someone else. The marble walls and floor provide a lot of surfaces for sound to bounce off of. When I talked in the shower, the echo was unbearable. As for sleep comfort? My wife has major insomnia and I was dreading having her toss and turn all night. This was completely not the case here. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. It was soft, yet firm. I didn't really feel my wife moving around (which was either because the quality of mattress or because she was sleeping so soundly!). You get the point on the room. This hotel rocks. I even decided to use the fitness center in the mornings. I belong to a very nice health club back home and have to say that this fitness center rivaled mine at home. It had plenty of cardio equipment as well as machine weights and free weights. We also checked out the pools. It seemed very nice. It was in the middle of January, so there wasn't anybody swimming, but we had good enough weather to lay out on a chair for a little bit to soak in the rays. Looking at the pool made me wish it was summer. I probably wouldn't have gone anywhere else but the pools!

Starting with Aria from the moment we stepped into this hotel i knew we wouldnt want to leave. The architecture, restaurants,shows,shopping, pools, day spa,rooms were everything you could want and more. You have to see Elvis Cirque Du Soleil it was amazing. When we are able to come back again to Vegas Aria is where we will be staying. Our room was immaculate and the beds and pillows were dreamy i just melted into them after our long days and nights out. The Hotel is presented beautifully. We even had what we call \"the incident\" where security was called and we were even impressed with this. The 5yo was having daddy daughter day and left her rashvest in the toilets by the pool as she was tired and in the shower her dad said he would run down just quickly and grab the rashvest, she was more than happy with this agreement. Daddy was gone for 5 mins and in this time 5yo had decided she wasnt getting left behind & being the cheeky monkey she is decided to wander the hallway where a cleaner found her crying and called security . Daddy came back to find a security guard with his daughter standing there hands on her hips smile on her face. Daddy got the 3rd degree about leaving children unoccupied in a casino. We all thought it was hilarious when we heard about his day. But as i said we were impressed with the security in this situation. The only negatives we experienced we found the restaurants over priced. Which didnt really bother us because we just went to other hotels. But when we did eat in the hotel the food was good. Also 1 nite we were having a snack near the casino tables and a young guy was absolutely smashed (drunk) I know he was having a good time but he was constantly yelling whilst he was in the hotel, for a classy establishment i thought it was tacky. As we know the security in Aria was great we thought this guy would of been approached by security to tone down or no longer be served alcohol but this didnt happen. We also found check in very slow. None of this however turned us off as we loved everything else about Aria. Our highlights are a helicopter over the Grand Canyon, Elvis show at Aria and we saw a basketball game. LA Lakers and Sacremento KIngs.

Check in was a very pleasant experience; our room was ready when we arrived at noon on Saturday, and we only waited in line about 10 minutes. We asked for a strip view, and Jennifer gave us a room with a spectacular view. One reviewer couldn't find the safe; we were told where to find it at check-in. Check out was also very convenient. We are non-smokers, and the casino seemed smoke free. Our clothes never smelled of smoke which was great. The cocktail service at the casino was also one of the best in Vegas. We tried the buffet, and it was also the best we have had in Vegas in terms of service, taste and cleanliness. All the staff at the Aria were very friendly. Here's a tip. You can walk inside from the Aria to the Monte Carlo. Along the way there is a nice food court including a McDonalds. We wen't there for breakfast and had Egg McMuffins - saved a lot of money!

All the lighting, TV, alarm, sound and window controls are integrated on a remote, which was something new. We found the hotel's location on the strip to be very central....an easy walk to most of the main casinos on the strip and about 20-30 minutes to get to the most extreme north-south ends of the strip (Mandalay bay or Wynn). Also, it is connected to the City Center, a high-class mall, if you like to shop. The pool area looked fantastic for the summer. We did not spend a ton of time in the casino, but the time we did have in there we were not impressed. It's a pretty small casino and as a result all the tables were crowded all the time. If you enjoy playing the inexpensive video slot machines or low minimum bet tables, this is definitely NOT the place to go! Also, we ate at the Aria's buffet one morning for brunch and it was nothing special. better off spending your $$ at Bellagio, Wynn, or Paris buffets in terms of quality and variety.

It may have been constructed in an environmentally friendly way, but there's nothing about their operations that seems particularly environmentally friendly...I mean, the pastry shop provides gigantic boxes and oversize gift-style baggies to cart out one little baked item, and I did not see anything indicating that they're encouraging recycling or reusable materials or anything... what's that all about?", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAria is a real stinker - literally.\u201d", "Author": "pavoga", "ReviewID": "UR94772925", "Content": "Airport shuttles must discharge passengers in a sub-basement, which is as far away from the registration desk as it is possible to be in this hotel.

The bathtub was luxuriously big with the shower next to it all encased in glass. I am VERY picky about cleanliness & i must say hands down this place is CLEAN! They freshen up the room daily bringing in new towels, making the bed & wiping everything down. I read reviews complaining about it being TOO big, i didnt get that feeling and NEVER waited on an elevator as they have 6 elevators for each floor grouping(every 8 floors)! I CANNOT wait to stay here again next year when return for the convention. The prices were SO good I will end up booking our employee rooms here as well next year when they travel to the show with us! Also very nice that it is located next to City Center!

I don't mind paying a little extra for convenience, but you feel like you are getting gouged every now and then. 5) The Aria's location lends itself to a wide variety of dining options.

I stayed at this hotel for a company conference and was very impressed on all aspects of this stay. The hotel is located on the South Strip and therefore right in the vicinity of all you might want to see in Vegas. It is a very modern and appealing hotel, with nice outside waterfalls. It might not offer some of the spectacular sights like some of the other Las Vegas Hotels (namely the Bellagio, Paris Paris, New York or Venitian), but it still has a very rounded concept. This high rise beautifully illuminated hotel has over 4,000 rooms, but what service is concerned you would not notice. The check in was extremely efficient and cordial. The rooms are large, very clean and offer state of the art amenities and technology. Touch screen devices manage every aspect of your room. The bathrooms are very large with extensive shower and bath facilites. I am in absolute awe about the greatness of these rooms. Besides the great rooms you find everything desireable in this hotel: nice pool, exquisite fitness facility, spa, great restaurants, appealing shops, Elvis Musical (though I did not visit it myself, colleagues told me it was great), and a nice casion environment, where the \"cheap\" Las Vegas does not shine through. What the conference I attended is concerned I can only give the facilities and the staff an A plus. It was incredible how they managed and served 2.5K plus people and fed them without any problems. The night club \"Haze\" has also proven to be an incredible clubbing location which leaves nothing else to desire by providing a great night!

We ended up going with her family as well right after Christmas, in between Christmas and New Year's, so we had a good couple of days. Our overall impression was that the hotel has a ton of potential - but for some reason, the staff still isn't quite executing the vision of the hotel. It's a shame, really - it's dragging down what is otherwise a very lovely hotel. Upon checking in, we quickly realized we'd been put in a smoking room, so had to call downstairs to get another room. I figured I'd have to go downstairs (yet again) to swap keys, but nope - just had to jot down the room number over the phone and walk in to the new room. The keycard worked in the new place immediately. So, that was nice - not so nice was winding up in a smoking room to start with. The 'free' wireless internet was included in a daily resort fee - fine, I suppose, since I always use the internet - although it would be nice if the wireless internet actually, y'know, worked. It rarely connected in our room and when it did it was mind-numbingly slow. You could connect to the 'wired; internet for free - but only if you happened to bring your own RJ-45 ethernet cable to connect, otherwise you were more than welcome to use the hotel's provided \"Internet Amenity Kit\", provided for the low-low price of $20. Ahem. The electronics in the rooms are pretty nice, all told - there's a bedside touchscreen that basically controls the room. Ours worked....when it wanted to, which is a way of saying, not very often. Pressing the \"Close Curtains\" button would often only work for a few feet, and then you'd have to mash it again....and again....anyways, you get the idea. Again, great idea - poor execution. Casino floor was nice - craps tables paid out for us and the family (and that's always a plus!) - we had dinner one of the nights at Lemongrass, the Thai restaurant in the place, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The cafe down on the casino floor (Cafe Vettro) sold some nice casual fare - have to admit, we about devoured their nachos from that place. I would comment on the buffet, but every time the wife and I tried to head there the line was at least 45 minutes long, and I wasn't going to wait. Checkout (should) have been a breeze, but of course - true to the theme of the stay, the automated check-out did not work and we had to actually go downstairs and stand in line to check-out, where a woman was doing her best to check people out in the line with a pen and paper. Decidedly non-technological, and rather annoying. Overall, if I could give the place a 3.5 I would - my wife and I both really enjoyed the actual comfort and size of the rooms and the restaurants, but it was the little annoyances that prevented us from truly enjoying the stay. We'll likely return at some point, and I'm hopeful that the teething issues will have been solved by THAT point.

The Aria is an spectacular new hotel in Las Vegas located in one of the best parts of the strip. It is connected with a free tram to the Monte Carlo and to the Bellagio, saving 15-20 minutes walk if you want to see the fountains. Just be ready to walk a lot in order to get to your room, as the elevators are located in the center of the building and if you are unlucky, your room will be located at the other end of the building. The rooms have everything automated so you can open the blinds, tv, control the room temperature, alarm clock from your TV/remote...it was very impressive and nice gadget to play with. The bathroom had an awesome design, two sinks, shower + Tub, all the ammenities, bathrobes....it was a really first good impression.....but then all started to go downhill: The water pressure (we were in the 20th floor) was not the best that you can ask for, very low pressure and not what I expected. Also, the room wasn't cleaned the first day until late in the afternoon....In addition, the glasses (where we were drinking sodas the day before) weren't replace after the \"cleaning\" and some trash wasn't pick up (Maybe because he/she was busy going through our stuff). Also, we started to observed and hear things not expected for this type of expensive hotel: We took one of the elevators and found condoms on it (Check the pictures)....and one night it was almost impossible to sleep because of the sex marathon/spanking session next to our room & the bum bum from the music coming from one of the discos [Remember, I was in the 20th floor so I wasn't expecting the music to be heard at such hight floor)...I would have expected the rooms to have a better sound proof system in place (The beds were amazing, too bad the noise was to loud to be able to enjoy them). Anyway, turning back to the title of my review: We came here for a business meeting and decided to stay an extra day to be able to gamble during our last night...Of course, when we arrived to the hotel, we looked everywhere for a safe to keep our money but we weren't able to find it anywhere (We later find out it is located inside the night stand and not in the closet/under the TV as in other hotels). So my colleague kept his money inside his backpack....only to find out the last day that the money was completely gone. We reported it with the hotel security, tried to narrow the time were it could have dissapear, sign a statement and that was it....The worst response from management really.... I was expecting either my colleague's money back or no charge for our rooms.... I definitely won't be coming here again.

Nice showers in the room (hot water came quickly). Water pressure was sufficient. Within 10 minutes walking distance to Bellagio, Monte Carlo and NYNY as well as a CVS pharmacy. Internet access was super easy. No passwords to goof around with makes it user-friendly! The Not-so-Good: most soft, squishy, uncomfortable mattress we have slept on in a long time and in many travels. After 3 nights we actually flipped this pillow-top nightmare over so we slept on the bottom of the mattress. Firmer to sleep on but sort of like sleeping on a box spring! I thought their internet was supposed to be fast but it was average. Because of the size of the hotel, I think they lose on the details (ie replenishing everything in your via housekeeping, keeping up with burnt out light bulbs, they left dirty drinking glasses in the room)... if housekeeping even comes at all!

When we arrived I felt the bathroom wasn't very clean because I counted 12 hairs in the bathroom (sinks, floor, etc...)

I asked for manager. Somehow, within 2/ 3 minutes there were three 50th floor rooms available.

I can clearly see why the post re. getting an above floor 25 is the right pick unless you don't mind shiny steel roofsout side your window. On 52 the view was spectacular, boasting city and mountains in back drop. Great big hi-def. tv. Generally clean but found a decent sized toe nail clipping on floor ( not mine) as I was alone. Nice shower but water pressure was low. All lounges a bit slow most of the time. Joined friends outside hotel for dinner so only had late nite turkey club sandwich at Cafe Vettro. Very dry and thin served with lots of ketchup. Not mayo. Hope this is not reflective of other restaurants at hotel. If you like perfumed air hang out in and around the lobby. Oh, I would set the thermostat at 70 only to come back to thermostat at 78 and too warm form my blood. I voiced my negative concerns to a manager and after much \"investigation\", points and counterpoints all of which made total sense to him, he offered me a refund for the turkey club sandwich which I refused.

The pros to staying here: very clean, pleasant employees, nice pool space (3 pools and 3 hot tubs), and a fun modern decor. The cons: we personally did not enjoy being in the city center as it took far too long to just get across the street, the beds were very very soft (i usually like a soft bed, but these were too soft to sleep well in), and the resort fee was an unwelcome surprise at the end of our stay...it is $22.50 per night, and claims it's for all the things you would expect any hotel to provide, such as a pool, fitness center, and wifi in the rooms. The high tech rooms were fun, but didn't have an iPod doc..the only tech feature I look for in a room. Over all, having gotten a good deal on priceline, I was somewhat pleased, but after the extra $22.50 fee per night, it wasn't such a great deal and I won't recommend anyone stay there unless you are looking for 1 hotel to stay in your entire time in Vegas.

We also brought along another couple (our best friends). I booked our trip through Travelocity, but in retrospect, I would have booked directly with the hotel and airline instead. It is too costly, and a pain to make any changes through Travelocity. Upon arrival to our hotel, we were very happy to see a modern lobby. The check-in line went quickly, and our requests of non-smoking, high floor and our two rooms close together were accommodated. The lobby was not too far from the room elevators, and it was nice to see a security guard checking keys to verify you were a guest before you could get to the room elevators. Many people mention the fragrance in the hotel. It is noticeable when you walk in the doors, but much less noticeable in the casino, and we could not smell it at all in our rooms. The Aria has 54 floors, and our rooms were on the 52nd. We had King City View rooms. The view did not disappoint. As discussed in many other reviews, the room is controlled by a main touch screen, and in my opinion, was easy enough to use. My suggestion would be to take 5 minutes to get familiar with it, so that when you have had an evening of fun and return to your room, you're not fumbling around trying to figure it out. Both our room and our friends room were very clean, and modern. The only complaints I would have about the rooms would be that the vanity counter space is limited (towel bars would be helpful), and the room itself was not huge, but plenty big for the 5 nights we were there. The his and her closets were spacious and had plenty of hangers. We spent time in the sports bar and in the casino. We had a blast at the craps table and all walked away winners. The slots were fun although we didn't win on them. Almost anytime of the day or night a cocktail person would approach you asking if you needed a drink. The hotel is in a great location and is connected by a tram to the Bellagio and the City Center Shopping Mall. It is also about a $10 taxi ride to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. The hotel has just been awarded the 5 Diamond Award, and in my opinion, is one of the better hotels on the strip.

Well the corner suite was just fine I am glad we didn't spend extra for the panoramic. Awesome views, comfortable bed and the best housekeeping.

They offer no other options so if you can't sleep well on a thick fat pillow you are out of luck. Second, the blackout curtains should be a priority in Las Vegas where you may want to sleep at odd hours. The room has a button that opens and closes the sheer and thick curtains but i found out quickly in the morning that they did little to block out the light. The top of the curtains let in a ton of light as did a three inch gap on the floor and also the side by the bed. So what is the point of having blackout curtains that DON'T block out the light??? I paid the entry fee to the spa to have a jacuzzi/steam one late afternoon last saturday and when i got in the jacuzzi it was barely warm. The soaking tub in my room had filled up quickly and was quite hot, so I was surprised I had paid 30.00 to come to the spa and was having a colder jacuzzi than the bath I could have had in my room. I mentioned to the spa staff and a woman finally came over with a thermometer and then left and never said a word to me. While I sat there about five different women got in and then said 'why is it not hot?\" and they would get out. We ate at Sage and spent quite a bit on the tasting menu, drinks, gambling later and I'm not sure I will stay here again or reccommend it to friends because I would like a dark room, comfortable bed and pillow , and a spa that works when you are only at a hotel for a few days.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLV trip\u201d", "Author": "A1bs", "ReviewID": "UR92767916", "Content": "Very good hotel with high standard of service.

The smoke in the Casino was well-vented; you could smell the occasional cigarette/cigar as you walked by a smoker -- but no cloud of smoke to irritate your eyes or soak into your clothing. The staff at Reception, Room Service, Housekeeping, and throughout the Casino was excellent; right down to the doormen hailing the cabs. One evening, as my husband and I strolled through the Casino, two well-dressed businessmen walked by, one of them saying to his companion, \"I really like this place.\" I certainly agree.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatchewan/Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeatiful Hotel...smoking allowed... yet VERY CLEAN air.\u201d", "Author": "Cjae", "ReviewID": "UR91959267", "Content": "The hotel is amazing from the moment you arrive. The shuttle picked us up at the airport and was right where they were supposed to be... no hassle. Check in took about 10 minutes... very professional and friendly. I liked that the elevators had a security person there all the time and having to show our room card every time made me feel secure. The room was very nice, curtains opened as you walked into the room all lights came on. Room was just a regular room, yet very elegant. The remote by the bed did all the things you wanted to do in the room with technology... opened the curtains... turned on the lights/tv/set an alarm was different. For the challanged with remotes it took us a few days to get it right. As for the service..... found a left over pair of underware in the bottom drawer... when I told the housekeeping person the next morning she was very good about it... Servicing your room, if your not an early riser they will clean your room later in the day. We did learn that when your going out for the day talk to one of them in the hallway and they will clean it when they are finished the one they are working on. You need to ask them to change your sheets if your there for more than a few days, we were there for 7 nights. They did a tidy up every day, but found they did not vacuum each day. The VERY POOR was that they had a small fridge in the room full of the hotels water/booze/treats that are very high priced. No room for anything we wanted or needed to keep cool. if you move anything in the fridge its your and added to your room price. NO coffee pot/kettle in the room this forces you to go downstairs and pay $6.00 for a coffee. I talked to others from other hotels and this seems to be the way it is in the upper end hotels. So reccommend you take a 1-2 cup maker with you if you love your coffee. The overall we found the staff to be very helpfull/polite. When they found out it was our 20th Wedding Anniversary they had a special treat of chocolate covered strawberries brought to our room... very nice.

For the most part, I enjoyed my stay. The lighting in the casino area was of a dark theme. We booked two rooms and requested connecting rooms since I was travelling with my baby. Initially we booked 1 king and 2 queens, but when we arrived, they could not find connecting rooms with that setup and she wanted to find a higher floor room, so we said 2 2 queen rooms would be fine, but they had a problem finding those rooms so we said 2 2 kings would be fine and any floor would be fine as it's more important we got connecting rooms. When we were given the initial bill, she made a mistake on the total probably because of our initial request and the difference in rates for kings and doubles ($30 more per room), even though I informed her that was what was quoted to us and advertised on their mail outs because my uncle had a players card. After a bit of time of sorting the situation out, we got it cleared up. We got connecting rooms on the 4th floor. The rooms were nicely appointed. I liked how we could operate the blackout and sheer curtains and they were so quiet! The bathroom setup is nice with a 1 glass door entrance to bathtub and shower and a separating door for the toilet and the entire bathroom closed off by another door. What thing that was unusual today was the bathroom door automatically locked when my uncle who was inside the bathroom swore he did not lock it. So be careful if you have little ones! Another thing is the light switch in bathroom...it was at times sensitive when you want to turn it on and at other times would not register when you want to turn it off. The bed was soft and comfy! I'm not sure I like all the functions of the television...I guess I didn't mess around with it enough as it was a bit of a challenge for it to use some functions especially checkout when you type in your email address wrong and you accidentally punch the wrong key, you have to start all over. After several tries, I just called the front desk to check out. Okay to my other annoyance situation-Anyhow on my 1st night there, my 15-month baby woke up from his sleep and started crying. I had just put him back to sleep (for the parents out there you know how hard it can be to put a baby back to sleep at times) when I hear a few knocks at my door. This was at 11:30 pm! I did not open the door right away as I was trying to make sure my baby was sound asleep again. Anyhow as I was approaching the door, a housekeeper used her key to open my door! I was so annoyed as I thought my baby would soon be awake again and of course the lack of privacy! She, however, did apologize and said her supervisor sent her up to check to see if the room was vacant. How could they not know that room has been checked in? I called operator from the other room and explained what happened and the person who answered said it was probably a glitch in the system and directed my call to the front desk who made me wait for over 5 minutes before they picked up the call. Then after I explained what happened, they just directed my call to housekeeping to explain story again. I didn't want to get anyone in trouble but I just did not appreciate what happened. After going through that, I finally decided that it was not worth filing a complaint as it would probably get to no one. I know mistakes do happen but still, you would think they should double check before walking in on someone late night! I quickly learned that I will just use the privacy button from now on. I didn't check this out in detail but there's a service button option as well. If one doesn't push that button, does it mean one's room will not be cleaned? I'm not sure. After the housekeeping annoyance, I started noticing how room service carts were left outside guests' rooms for quite some time (next day) and yes, you could smell it. I ate at the Buffet at Aria on Sunday night (around 5 pm no wait when we were visiting) when they were still serving the Gourmet Buffet (half lobster per person and unlimited wine). The seafood was fresh and I especially liked the prime rib and naan bread (as that is not served at many other Vegas buffets). The selection at this buffet is limited compared to other buffets though. I think if you have unlimited wine and want fresh seafood, it's worth it for $39.95 charge. However for kids it may be a ripoff as children under 3 are free and the rest are charged the $39.95 fare. I used the $50 food and beverage credit towards the buffet and it took them a while to figure out do the transaction. Forgot to mention, for each room I was given 2 welcome complimentary beer/wine coupons to use at one of the hotel bars. I did not get a chance to used it though. I also tried the crepe place (Jean...) and it was pretty good for a late night dessert. Overall, it was a good stay after I overlooked the nighttime housekeeping situation. Next time, I'd probably try other hotels such as Cosmopolitan (after they work out their grand opening issues) but I may consider staying at Aria in the future.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cI needed a good bed after 2 other hotels\u201d", "Author": "Charstorm", "ReviewID": "UR91779932", "Content": "I don't really know about the other reviews as I didn't use services other than the players club.

We were especially disappointed in the room service....the menu was abysmal, with a very limited and rather odd selection of food, and there was an error in our order nearly every time (including missing items and day-old bread on some sandwiches), although for the most part what we did receive was good quality and good tasting. Personnel at the hotel were generally courteous and friendly but, most of the time, there was little they could do to rectify problems in a timely way. In some cases, they were the cause of the problem...for example, we had a problem at check-in when my credit card was erroneously declined due to the clerk's not swiping it in the machine properly. I thought I had a fraud hold or something else wrong with my card, and so I spent the next thirty minutes on the phone trying to get ahold of VISA to figure out what was going on, only to find that the card was fine and it was the clerk's mistake all along. Very irritating when you just drove six hours and are very tired and hungry and just want to get settled into your room and relax. Errors were also made with respect to our show tickets that were booked through the Sky Suites concierge, which created needless inconvenience and annoyance. The concierges made diligent efforts to correct the problem, and ultimately did so to our satisfaction, however, the hassle took quite a bit of the excitement out of the evening. The last thing you want to do when you're excited about seeing a nice show is sit in the concierge's office for the better part of an hour trying to resolve stupid problems that never should have occurred in the first place and that were purely the result of human error on the booking agent's part. The rooms had great views but were less than stellar in terms of the following: 1. Layout: suite was too broken up into small areas, and felt smallish even in the 2 bedroom, 2100 sq. ft. Sky Suites 2. Cleanliness: relatively poor housekeeping was evident, and the room was showing a lot of wear and tear for a one year old hotel 3. Soundproofing: there isn't any! You could hear the guests upstairs clearly, especially when they moved chairs or ran their bathtub, both of which were very loud and disturbed us on many occasions 4. Bathrooms: were somewhat unclean upon arrival, there were very slow drains in the sinks, almost no pressure in the faucets. The way the sinks are laid out, the water tends to spray all over the counter and mirror, and there are also no sink stoppers, so you can't really do hand laundry in the room (maybe in the tub?)....however, we did like the steam showers (although mine had a strong mildew odor), and my husband liked the Japanese style bidet with the heated toilet seat 5. Amenities: there's no microwave and no coffee maker!! But there was a nice, good size hotel refrigerator at least. I especially didn't like the lack of a coffee maker in the room...they say it is fire regulations in Vegas that prohibit this and the installation of microwaves, but then the least they could do is provide good coffee somewhat close by the room. As it is now, you have to go all the way down to the Sky Suites check-in area lounge to get complimentary coffee, which is really just what I like to call \"brown water\", i.e., it's not very good or very strong coffee. Oddly enough, the closest vendor is terrible, a French pastry shop in the lobby. 6. Functionality: instead of doing what we wanted to do, we had to spend several hours on successive days trying to resolve various problems in the room, such as stopped up drains, light bulbs out in the shower, dead batteries in the remote controls, etc. The problems themselves were relatively easy and quick to fix, but the maintenance staff is so overburdened that it takes an hour or more to get any service. Another thing we disliked about the hotel was the labyrinth-like layout of the lobby, casino and shopping areas, as well as the City Center itself. The hotel employees are poorly trained in terms of providing guidance to guests seeking directions, and nearly all of them we asked for help had no idea how to direct us to our destination. The signage is also poor and of little help in navigating the premises. The City Center is hard to navigate and it is almost impossible to walk directly between buildings or out to the street in any expeditious manner. The City Center is also poorly located near the end of the strip, close to the airport, so it is a fairly long distance to any other hotels or attractions. Allow yourself a lot of extra time if you have to get somewhere outside the hotel. Another serious problem is the food at the restaurants. Overall, is very expensive and very trendy. Most of the food we tried was not at all good and certainly not worth the exorbitant price. The buffet in the Aria is especially bad in this respect....the food was average and the price was nearly $40 per person. Unless you have a lumberjack appetite it's hard to justify spending that much on the buffet, and there aren't a whole lot of other options nearby. One final note: as is the case at most hotels in Vegas, the Aria is still allowing smoking, and the smoke in the lobby and casino is very thick and annoying to non-smokers. The neighboring Vdara is completely smoke free, however, and has a lovely spa. In retrospect, it might have been better to stay there. The new Cosmopolitan was next door and also looks to be a nicer hotel, with great balconies, unlike the Aria which has no balconies and no opening windows for fresh air.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice modern hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rosscopcotrain", "ReviewID": "UR91567664", "Content": "Aria is a nice, clean and modern casino hotel on the LV Blvd. I was there for a company conferernce for 5 days and was allocated a standard room on the 19th floor which provided a good view out to part of the Strip. The room was a reasonable size for Vegas, the bed was large and very comfortable. I enjoyed getting to grips with the room 'controls' which allow you to control lighting, curtains, AC and a few other bits at the push of a few buttons on the TV remote control. There is also a bedside control unit which wasn't working in the room I was in but I didn't feel the need to report this and ask for it to be fixed as I could do what I needed via the TV. Not sure if there were additional controls and options available via this unit but maybe I will find out next time around. I found the service to be very good throughout the hotel. Room service and the availability and helpfulness of the staff throughout the hotel was great. The only time I didn't find this to be the case was when I was trying to call down to reception and could not get through for a while but this was no big deal.

In fact, the rate on two of the nights was $700. When I asked why, I was informed \"our rates are based on occupancy and there's the rodeo, conferences, awards banquets, etc\". Uh, yeah. Thanks but no thanks. As I was talking with the rep from theHotel, an email from ARIA popped up and their rate was only $129 - no brainer! We were guests at the grand opening last year and toured the property so I was a tiny bit familiar with what it looked like, but it was the cost that closed the deal. From the moment our cab from the airport pulled into the front of the hotel, we were in love. The beautiful water features, the gorgeouse lobby, the tasteful Christmas decorations, the lovely scent everywhere in the hotel (My husband hates over scented ANYTHING and from everything I'd read here previously, I thought for sure he'd hate this so I never mentioned it to him. Surprisingly, he liked it!). We had a corner king suite on the 36th floor and it was spectacular. People complain the walk from the elevator was far, but I don't understand that complaint at all. We're 48 and 50 years old, not young but not old. It was never an issue for us! People also complain ARIA is \"far from the strip\". It's IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STRIP!!

The one single thing we didn't like is the trek through the casino from the lobby to get to the guest elevators. I believe the architects should have designed that a little better.

I simply fell in love with the hypermodern architecture and technology, so in spite of the mixed reviews I decided to give this place a chance. To make a lame pun, that bet paid off. Every single space in the hotel looks modern, sleek, sophisticated and understated. The true spectacle comes from the futuristic architecture which is utterly amazing; Cesar Pelli designed Aria and he did a fantastic job. I'll always remember walking into the lobby which has this wonderful vanilla-sandalwood smell, and looking up through the skylight and seeing the glass towers against the Vegas sky. So strikingly beautiful. This is not the \"tacky\" Vegas of stereotypes. It is something different. That said, the somewhat restrained aesthetic may feel \"cold\" or \"unwelcoming\" to some. I tried the Twenty Dollar Trick. It didn't work, but I got a 53rd floor room with a strip view. Phenomenal. The room was done in whites, silvers, browns and blues; again all sleek and modern. The room control system was very high tech, although I rarely used it given I spent most of my time gambling. The casino was great. It felt like a classy nightclub; everything is decorated in browns, golds and silvers, with splashes of blues and purples to offset things. Its dark-ish, but I liked that... it felt suave and mysterious. I had some good luck and some bad luck at the Blackjack tables, but overall things were great. Cocktails (complimentary, thankfully) came every half hour or so, and delivered by attractive women wearing less skimpy outfits than the Bellagio waitresses. The dealers were very friendly. The pit supervisor even let me bet below the table minimum at a $50 table when the $25 table had filled up! By the end of my stay, I received complimentary late checkout as well as a significant food comp. They also let me take one of the coat hangers (yes, I asked). Service in the restaurants was overall very good. The hotel concierge was helpful. Given its a 4004 room hotel, I didn't get (nor did I expect) personalized service. So overall I think I got very good service for the kind of hotel I was at. What I truly found striking was the value. This is a very good hotel and I only paid 160 per night. I'm from Australia; in my home country this kind of hotel room would easily cost at least 250 to 300. Given the location, the aesthetics and the quality of the rooms, I think I got an excellent deal. My only real complaint is the beds. They were far too soft for my taste. I know many people love Aria's bedding, but for me its waaay to yielding. Additionally, Aria does feel slightly disconnected from the rest of the Strip; it isn't quiet by any means but it is clearly less energetic than most Las Vegas Strip resorts. I liked this, but some people may not enjoy it. Overall, Aria is a drastic aesthetic departure from the usual Las Vegas experience, and it looks fantastic. Fans of modernism will adore this place. Fans of architecture and cityscapes will be drooling. The restaurants are great, the bars have very nice cocktails, the casino feels suave and dramatic, and the overall atmosphere is very nice; elegant yet understated and completely devoid of the pretentious \"euro neo-roccoco italiano\" Bellagio/Wynncore paradigm which often dominates most people's ideas of 'high end Vegas.'", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic room with geat view!\u201d", "Author": "Simli", "ReviewID": "UR90497837", "Content": "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here whilst in Vegas!

The wait wasn't too long but the hotel clerk was disinterested and barely made eye contact during the transaction. We asked about the limo pickup and she said we should have called first!? We booked for 5 nights and on the 3rd day we discovered that Sky Suite guests have a private lounge available with wine/cheese after 4pm and light continental breakfast in the mornings. We were never told this. But we enjoyed the service after we discovered it. Room service was terrific and twice daily maid service as well. The hotel restaurants, hmmm, well we ate at most of them and would not recommend any except for the Tapas place and the buffet was ok. The service in all but the tapas place was horrible horrible and the food yucky and overpriced. The worst meal was in the sports bar, they have a signature pork slider and it was soggy and cold and the server was surly. The pool is nice and the poolside service was ok. The pool closes at 5pm!! Don't know why but during our stay is was very cool in the morning so you couldn't really enjoy the pool until later afternoon and then they close at 5. There is a fitness center but you have to pay to use it. My husband used it once and the place was mostly empty except A-Rod was working out on the treadmill. I wonder if he had to pay too or if they paid him?

Bellman recommended I call engineering instead of the front desk because it would take longer instead offering some assistance. I called the front desk and they said security would have to come up and let me in the room. She stated she would compensate me $50.00 food and beverage. Several minutes later a woman from security showed up and watched make use cards that did not work. She used her card to let me and told me I had to call the front desk and tell them the cards needed to be recoded. I left the empty room open while I went to check on my other guests settling in and security followed me to their room. They were having problems with opening the curtains and I asked security to help. Her only reponse was \"this is new technology and I can't come in the room to help, but I should not have left that other room open.\" I told her why would I close a door to a room that does not have my belongings in it knowing I can't get back into it unless she lets me in!! At that point I fed up with this drama and walked the long walk to the front desk to ask for a manager, but I was shuffled to another far away desk to be assisted by an employeed who was not a manager. After explaining it to him he said he would give me new cards for the room. I insisted that I did not want to walk up there to try the 3rd set of cards that did not work and if I did I wanted to be the night free. So, I tried the 3rd set of cards and of course it did not work, but the only person to witness this was a maid named Shelia who was cleaning a room a couple of doors down. She let me in the room and I explained to her what happended and she empathized and apologized for the other staff not doing more to help. She called down to the front desk for me to help speed things up, eventually I had to request a new room because I had spent over an hour trying to get into a room I paid for. Front desk said the card I had had been recoded for the new room. So Shelia and I go to the new room and of course those cards did not work. She let me into that room and I asked for a manager to be sent up to the rooms to see the problem I was having. I was put on hold for several minutes while a new set of cards came up that worked. Eventually, the manager came to the phone and I asked for the room to be compensated for the room and they gave me 1 of the 2 nights free. She really did not apologized for the bad service, but encouraged me to go out and have a good time. Eventually I received some chocolate strawberries and Shelia left me a personal birthday note and toiletries because she saw all of the drama I had to endure.

We jumped on this offer and were glad of it afterwards as the view was really cool. We had a window on the 20th floor looking out to the leaning apartment blocks, Crystal shopping center, the Monte Carlo plus MGM & New York New York in the distance. The automated lights and curtains were impressive particularly as we set it as our alarm clock for the following day.

The bath incased behind the shower was a decent size while the shower had good pressure. I also liked the toilet behind the frosted door in the bathroom. The hotel itself is pretty big (like most things in Vegas) with 17 restaurants. We ate one night at Sage which was really, really good. Bill came to about $180 for a starter, 2 mains & a desert but the most expensive part were the drinks which probably cost at least half of the bill. Service was great and the food superbly tasty. My boyf made use of the Absinthe offered as a desert option which came with quite a show-well worth it! We didn\u2019t get to use the pool due to the weather so I can\u2019t comment on that, also didn't visit the spa as that cost an extra $30 per day.

The desk person was fairly friendly, although offered no information other than the only room available in the hotel was on the 11th floor as the property was fully booked, I accepted the room and went upstairs. Upon entering the smoke filled room with ashtrays I realized we were issued a smoking room. I called the check in desk.

I asked to speak with the general manager , I was on hold a long time, then answered as follows, \" our general manager went home as it is getting late and there is no one else to talk with\". My response was that it is a very large hotel they certainly should move us to a non smoking room that was reserved a month prior. I was again told that nothing could be done about the room change. In addition, the rooms are small, good design, except the bathroom is a one person at a time ( two sinks in a 4' long vanity?), and the shower and tub are both in one stall.

The price was very expensive, but if you can afford to splash out I would reccomend. The pastry shop was yummy also, splurged out on a couple of pastries while I was there. Scoot City Tours is a must!!!! A great way to see the other side of Las Vegas (residential houses and the desert). So much fun honestly. Premium Outlets is the place to shop - I got all my going out clothes from there. CVS is where I shopped for alcoholic beverages to drink while in my room. LAX, Pure, Haze and XS were great clubs!

It was our first time to stay, and definitely our last. We arrived only to discover that the hotel's computer systems were down so they were doing manual check-ins, which meant the line to do so was long. Customer reps in the lobby were advising guests to leave their luggage with the bell desk, explore the strip and come back later. So we did just that..we explored Hoover Dam. Came back about 4 hours later, only to find that the line had gotten longer. So we stayed in line and finally were able to check in and when we did, the customer rep did not offer an apology for the wait or offer anything to us for the inconvenience. Not even a free breakfast voucher at the local cafe. All she did was reiterate that the mini bar in the room was weight-sensored so we would be charged if anything was touched. Done. We then went up to our room and called the bell-desk for our bags. I was on hold for 25 minutes, when a bell-desk associate finally picked up. It took 1 hour to get our backs up to our room. We were tired from the exhausting day, so we climbed in bed to nap for the late evening and we then realized that our pillows had make up on them. It was apparent that none of our sheets had been changed. We felt disgusting. We called house keeping and asked if they could come to change our sheets and they said they would send the floor supervisor right away. We waited 45 minutes and had to call house-keeping again to remind them, and they finally came. They did not apologize for the dirty sheets. They came, replaced them and left. And just as a side note, they do not offer complimentary wi-fi and their water pressure is poor. We will never stay at this hotel again.

I saw it twice from afar during the construction period and the construction, materials used is impressive now that ive finally seen the inside... This place is much nicer then the belagio without all the posers and snobs. The pool area had the vibe and atmosphere of the valley Ho hotel in scottsdale ( best pool scene ever ) yet reminded me off passing the time poolside in miami. My daughter loved the pool and although it was getting to be winter in vegas the shallow nature of the pool kept the water nice and warm. Only one of the pools was open but pool service was attentive despite the limited crowd. Lots of cabanas and ill try that next summer. My wife enjoyed the spa while i enjoyed draft beer and internet poolside and our daughter the water, suprisinglly although the hotel does not seem to cater to children ( no kids meals anywhere, and no discounts for children at buffet, a significant downer ) a number of kids were around and our daughter made friends easilly. Our room was impresive from the moment we walked in, hit the button and the drapes open or close automatically lights come on and dim according to taste. The 2 bedroom suite has 4 tv' s and u walk into the living area, beside which, seperated by a wall is an eating area for 6 and a small island style bar, sink area. with an extra fridge for your own stuff. ( thanks we loved that feature ) behind which was a 2 peice bath. on either end we had a bedroom with an adjoining huge bathroom and walkin closet. Nice!!! The bed was great and just let you sleep, and if u had to much free beer at the tables u got up and jumped in the steam shower to melt away the fuzz, class act! hit the auto drape and watch the vegas skyline while snoozing for a few more minutes. grab the 2 papers that come with the room and sit in your living room and watch the traffic coming up the wide lane highway coming up from the street reminicent of one of those moscow heavy arms or chinese parade squares. The flow of vehicles is something to behold and the coolest is watching the \"pez\" dispenser taxi cab loading area as the cabs come up a ramp from an unseen parkade... very cool. I have no tips for saving money, as this hotel is similarlly priced to most MGM's, special mention is the lemon grass where we had the best thai meal in years... Room service is an extra 4 bucks, but if u have a share plate in the other restaraunts they nail u an extra 3 bucks... of course vegas portions, so its easier to share and we found oursleves spending less on room service then going downstairs... Pancakes were heavenlly. Of course being vegas they dont have a coffee maker in the room something which is a must in my opinion and seriouslly lacking... What do these people really think that i will gamble a couple of hundred while i have to run downstairs to an buy an overpriced cup of java.... or that a coffee maker in my room will keep me out of the casino??? We found out later we could have requested a coffee maker??? I thought all the staff were very friendlly including the maids who were very serious about keeping you happy, security would actually joke with you and most staff made you feel special. We did have a number of communication problems with the VIP services and i have read on other comments people have compalined about service and i attribute this to growing and opening pains as some of these people are inexperienced... however if given the opportuntiy the staff made it right. The experience of viewing this massive complex from inside and enjoying the \"newness\" is well worth the money. If u can afford it go with the sky suites and they will limo you to and from the airport from the fleet of 30 + limos owned by the hotel. Sky suites also has a coffee and snack lounge which was free and easy to get coffee from in the morning. The wine and cheese held every night was sparselly attended but a nice touch.

The rooms were very plush with everything controlled form the remote control including the curtains and lights.

There was no central light at all. The bed was particularly comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. Rooms were well proportioned and we were lucky enough to egt all our rooms together and were upgraded free of charge to a city view room on the 28th floor so the view was quite spectacular. There was a mini bar in the room..be careful they will charge you if you lift the item even if you don't use it. Apparently, you can get a fridge from housekeeping but they ask you not to use the mini bar for your own use. Items within were very expensive so be warned.There was no coffee machine so I was very glad to have taken my travel kettle..as with the rest of the USA it is hard to find a decent cup of tea and the coffee bar in the casino was quite expensive and had nowhere to sit. This was something we noticed a lot here..unless youwere in a restaurant or bar or casino and spending money then you didn't get to just sit and watch this crazy world go by. The bathroom was lovely and very big with a huge tub and nice shower. The floor in the shower was very slippery and quite dangerous so take care.Everywhere beautifully furnished with nice carpets and curtains and plenty of storage space for clothes. An iron and board was supplied along with hairdrier and some toiletries. The casino was quite 'serious' and there did not appear to be a lot of merriment here, in contrast to some we visited for instance the Imperial Hotel. Although this was much older and a little run down the atmosphere was much happier, people seemed friendlier and minimum bets were very much cheaper. Also they did a good line in $1 Michelob bottled beer and Margeritas so we were very happy. Drinks were considerably more expensive at the Aria: my margerita was $14..it was good though. The pool area was beautiful with loads of sun beds and the whole area was a suntrap. We ordered drinks from the waitress round the pool and had a fairly hefty supplement added to our bill unbeknown to us until we went to check out. There is a lovely spa and gym but you have to pay a $30per person per day cover charge to use this. We chose not to because unless you intend to spend the day there it seemed not worth while. The pool area closed quite early too, so no after shop swim if you come back late afternoon/early evening. We went out to breakfast a couple of times but soon realised that the buffet in the hotel at $15 was actually really good value and included as much juice, tea and coffee as you like along with as much as you could eat. We found that the juice certainly increased the price of our breakfast in the restaurant across the road. Beware: breakfast becomes brunch at the weekend and price increases a lot. However, they included snow crab and other delicacies so probably still good value if you like that sort of thing. We noticed that the evening buffet seemed good value as well but unfortunately did not have chance to sample it. On one night they included Maine lobster and unlimited wine in the price. In summary, this was an enormous but lovely, very classy hotel. However if you are looking for a theme or a more boisterous feel then this may not suit you. We were more than satisfied andthey looked after us very well. I did not really see any others that matched it for elegance but did feel it had quite a serious atmosphere. When talking to the staff though i.e. room maid and waitress they all seemed very happy there which is a good sign as far as I can tell. Make sure you take really comfortable shoes..you will walk miles and most places do not really have a dress code so most people dress down even in the poshest hotels.However, anything goes it seems. The roads do not really cater for pedestrians. There are not too many crossing points on them and you often have to go 'up and over' using steps, lifts and escalators to walk over a bridge. We noticed that often the escalators were out of order and felt that anyone with disabilities might have problems getting about in places. Smoking is still allowed in most casinos but we did not notice the smell too much so assume they have good air conditioning systems. Getting about is easy by foot or some hotels have monorails that go between them. They unfortunately do not go for any distance so you have to keep getting off and moving to the next hotel so sometimes easier to just walk. The bus service is quite good value at about$7 for the day or $5 for 2 hours. They get absolutely packed though.There are plentiful cabs but you are not allowed to hail them in the strip apparently.We got a cab to take 6 of us to the Plaza hotel at the far end of the strip from the Aria(about 7 miles) and it cost $47 so you need to decide what will offer you the best value. We loved that you can just wander in and out of the hotels and see what they have tooffer.The new York roller coaster is great fun ($14 for one trip but you can buy a day pass) and there are loads of old fashioned amusements here so the kids would have a great time on these.There are some good restaurants in the Miracle Mile shopping centre across the road and you are also near Mcdonalds, Wendys, Dennys and Subway if you want something cheap and cheerful. Take a plentiful supply of dollar notes for tips and make sure you do a Grand Canyon trip..it really is quite spectacular...though not very safety conscious..there are no railings so mind your footing.We booked our trip through a company called Viator who are on the net. They were very helpful and offered some really good prices. Also they have a UK telephone number and it was really good to be able to speak to them without racking up the phone bill. Unfortunately our trip was cancelled but they managed to get us on a more expensive one and matched the price as well. You will have jet lag for the first couple nights but it's well worth the long flight and the tiredness. You will have a great holiday..I know we all did.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAria- Ranks Among the Best!\u201d", "Author": "traveljunkieab", "ReviewID": "UR87437790", "Content": "After reading numerous reviews of the Aria prior to arrival, I was somewhat a little hesitant to stay (we had originally booked the Mirage) but due to a great booking rate, my husband and I decided that it was worth a try! And boy, was it sure worth it! We loved it here! We arrived on a Monday night and had no problems at the check in whatsoever. To be honest, there wasn't even a line up. While checking in, we asked if there was a possibility of an upgrade since we booked a deluxe room. They offered us a corner suite for an extra charge which we happily took as it was at quite a discounted rate. The elevators are quite fast, and do be prepared if you have a corner suite-- it is quite a trek from the elevators, but trust me, it is definitely worth it. We were on the 20th floor, and the view was stunning. The room itself was gorgeous, and quite large. The floor to ceiling windows in the den, the bathroom and the bedroom were breathtaking. We could see NYNY, Paris, The Cosmopolitan, PH, PH Westgate, Ballys, Rio... all from our room. We really felt like we were living the life! There were a few minor inconveniences in the room such as a few burnt out lightbulbs, and we were missing one robe in the room which was odd too. The only thing else I'll comment on in the room is the technology- even being somewhat of a savvy electronic geek did not help me with the room controls at all. It was as if the settings had been programmed wrong, and while trying to do one task, it actually performed tasks not being asked of. It was a bit frustrating, but if you encounter the same issue just press the switches themselves individually and it'll work brilliantly! We had no problems with housekeeping whatsoever. There is a button adjacent to the hotel door that prompts housekeeping for service, which is nicer than those laminated do not disturb signs that are at most other hotels. I did forget to push the service button twice during my stay, but when returning to the room both times I had a voicemail from housekeeping informing me that the room had not been serviced, but at any time they would be more than happy to come up and clean it. The lobby is gorgeous and definitely has that vanilla scent that others have referenced prior, but it is not overwhelming and is a nice break from the other smoky casinos. Casino was large, and was busy with a good vibe during our entire stay. We also enjoyed that this hotel was a refresher from some of the other \"typical Las Vegas strip hotels\". It definitely has a more modern, upscale and classier feeling to it. We didn't eat too much at the hotel, but we did have an appetizer at Deuce Lounge which was great, and the coffee bar on the far south side of the casino had great breakfast offerings. We also had dinner at Todd English's P.U.B which is adjacent to the hotel and Crystals, and it was fantastic! Just an f.y.i. for you guys who are into this, on Tuesday's they have 5 cent draft night. The location of the hotel is amazing! I recommend wandering around throughout Crystals to find your shortcuts! Both my husband and I loved that we could choose whether to walk north or south on the strip as we particularly enjoy wandering the Strip. After being somewhat of an experienced traveller and having stayed in quite my fair share of nice hotels, this definitely ranks among the top. When I return to Las Vegas, I will definitely be returning to the Aria.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leuven, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms, fantastic view, top service\u201d", "Author": "Roel19", "ReviewID": "UR87319605", "Content": "We visited the Aria for 6 night in the beginning of November.

They just called us to say that our key cards were updated for the other room and could move when we wanted. The vanilla smell some people are complaining about is not that bad at all. You smell it the first time you enter the hotel, but after one day there you can hardly notice it. The room itself was fantastic. Very large windows, and no problems what so ever with the automated curtains/tv/light... bathroom was very clean and perfectly fitted out. My wife loved the heated toilet seat. The breakfast buffet is very complete.... We have tried the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, but the Aria breakfast buffet is equally good if not better. And to top it off it is very cheap (&\u00a7 dollars a person I believe). Location of the hotel is good (very good compared to the Wynn of course) and the walk towards the strip via the Crystals shopping is very pleasant.

I had called a couple of weeks before our arrival to request rooms close together and then requested again when we checked in. We checked our bags and went on our way. Did not get notified until almost 4:00 PM that our rooms were ready. When I went up to the desk to get our keys our rooms were on two seperate floors. I again requested rooms on the same floor and after much pleeding they finally gave us two rooms on the same (low) floor....only to realize once we were on the floor the rooms were literally miles away from each other. Very dissappointed!!! Didnt feel like fighting with the people anymore. The Corner Suite was beautiful!!! But be ready to walk A LOT!!! I think all suites are at the very end of the hallways. LONG WALK!!! The double rooms were very nice as well. I had gotten a pretty good deal thru Southwest Vacations. I saw what the rooms go for regularly and I think they are over priced. Also it appeared that the restaurants were all quite expensive. We ate at 2 of them and did the Sunday Brunch as well. The Buffet was excellent. All in all....I am glad I stayed at Aria, its a georgous hotel, but because of its location (set back from the strip) and the amount of walking you have to do just to get out of there, plus the fact of how expensive everything is there and that they really did not give an effort to give me my rooms on the same floor, I would not stay there again.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marysville, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAria was better than expected!\u201d", "Author": "DBonna", "ReviewID": "UR87115239", "Content": "We took a shuttle from the airport to Aria.

So I will break it down as easy as possible: Check In: It was busy we arrived by airport shuttle around noon on Thursday October 26, 2010. My husband and I waited maybe 10 minutes before we were helped. Linda was our represenetive. This was our 1st time in Vegas so she was very helpful, explaning where to go & what to do etc. The Aria is huge so Linda provided us with a map, and overview of hotel setup. Easy... Rooms: Very clean, spacious, and modern. room was serviced everyday (we used service button just to make sure), bathroom was cool, double sinks, tub & shower, the water is so hot u get good steam too. Had a great city view. Downside: No in room coffee maker and the line @ the coffee shop is longer than I care to tell ya. O and no newspaper unless you pay for it to be delivered. The little epad that controls the room is easy too, after you get use to it and stop playing with it, NO PROBLEM. It has about a 3 second delay after you select your option of choice. EASY Area of Aria: Ok, Aria is directly in the center of CityCenter between Crystals and the Mandarin Oriental. But you have to walk alot to get out of CityCenter. Be prepared leave your stiletto's for the days you rent a car or take a cab. Food @ Aria: We ate at Cafe Vettro several times it was good but, expensive. For example 2 club sandwiches, crab cake appetizer, 2 waters w/ lime, and a really good hot chocolate about $70 + tip. It is open 24 hours tho. The patisserie was so cute, as well as delicious. We ate @ the breakfast buffett it was great too. Clubs @ Aria: GREAT...try Dueces for a grown & sexy atmosphere. Haze was great too. The R&B artist Ceiara's birthday party was there while we were there it was awesome! Pool: Beautiful, but too chilly to use it during our stay... Business Center: Ok here is where the nickel & diming began for me personally. Aria charges $1 per minute to use the business center w/ a 15 minute minimum. All we needed to do was confirm our seating and check our bags + print 2 boarding passes which takes 2 minutes to do. I think thats kind of excessive. I ended up using the business center @ Planet Hollywood for $5 flat, we were there returning our rental car at the Avis in that hotel. Concierge: No complaints @ all. Check Out: You can checkout by using your folio on the tv but we had prepaid for our hotel in advance so we didnt leave a credit card on file so it was unavailable to us, but I just called the front desk and they checked out for me. Bell desk was called to take care of our luggage, and about 5 minutes later our bags had been taken to the shuttle drop/pick up zone. Easy! I would stay there again, its a beautiful place.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cJust Average--I've been in Much Better\u201d", "Author": "Aggies", "ReviewID": "UR86772773", "Content": "My spouse and I stayed here 3 nights starting Oct 24, 2010. We had an early morning flight and were not able to check in early. That's understandable. The front desk was great. They basically checked us in, then told us they'd call us (on our cell phone) when the room was ready and we could come to a separate marked area of the front desk (marked \"Keys Only\") to get our keys. About noon, we received the call and went to get our keys. There was no area marked \"Keys Only.\" We had to find someone to ask and were told to stand in line at a single \"window\" at the end of the counter. When we got to the \"window\" (there were 4 people ahead of us), they were shocked to hear we were told about the \"keys only\" sign, because they hadn't received their sign yet. We went to the room. We were the LAST room before the corner suite. That is a long, long hike from the guest elevator. I guess because we had a buy 2 get one night free, we were put at the very end of the \"standard\" rooms. I would STRONGLY suggest that IF you make a reservation here that you make it perfectly clear that you want to be close to the elevators. I'm telling you, honestly, it's between 1/8 and 1/4 of a mile hike from the elevators to the end of the hallway. The room was AVERAGE at best. Much smaller than any of the other rooms we've been in in Las Vegas. No TV in the bathroom, no place to sit and put on make-up. VERY small bathroom counter space. The room was DUSTY and I mean dust everywhere. We happened to see housekeeping outside and she asked \"you just checked in, right? So your room is made up?\" I told her it was VERY dusty and she said, \"I dusted it, but my vacuum cleaner must throw off dust.\" Yeah, right. My spouse told her there was a light out in the bathroom. She offered to re-dust the room, but I told her it would do for today. However, it was NOT dusted the next day. Despite a tip, even the ashtray was left dirty the second day. It had been dumped, but not even wiped out. The TV screen had splatter marks on it, the wall had splatter marks on it. Somebody either celebrated with champagne or splattered soda on both. Neither was ever cleaned while we were there. Day 3 was more of the same. This time the ashes from the ashtray were even left, so I know they didn't dust. The light bulb in the bathroom was NEVER fixed. As far as linens go, they are OK. The beds are comfy. The pillows \"different\" but OK. They do not do any linen changes unless you call housekeeping and ask that your bed linens be changed. I can agree with the \"saving water\" issue, but other hotels leave a card that you put on the bed if you want your linens changed. Not Aria--you have to call housekeeping and request they change the linens the next day. Towels were changed daily if \"you threw them on the floor\". I wasn't intimidated by all the electronics in the room. It was easy to understand. However, I also wasn't impressed by it. Give me better housekeeping and I don't care about all the electronics. When we went to use the on-screen check-out, we found out they had \"accidentally\" billed us for all 3 nights (remember we had a buy 2 get one free). That necessitated a call to the front desk--it took about 10 minutes of on-hold to get through to them. She was very nice and said she'd correct it immediately, which she did. Self-parking is not convenient for hotel guests. It's great for casino visitors, but not guests. It's a very long walk from the parking garage to the guest elevators and a long, long walk to your room especially if you are at the END of the hallway. NOTE: If you travel with medical equipment that must be plugged in--bring an extension cord (at least 9 ft). There are NO plugs that you can get to on the walls. The ONLY plug is on the desk and supposedly for a lap top. We ate at the coffee shop (Cafe Vettro) on the day of arrival--average food, average prices. One morning we stopped for coffee at Roasted Bean on our way to the parking garage. Had coffee and bagel. At Roasted Bean a bagel w/cream cheese (2 containers of cream cheese) is $3.25. The bagel was hot and toasted correctly. Next morning we went to Jean Philippe Patisserie. Coffee and bagel were the same price as Roasted Bean, but the Bagel did not come with cream cheese--I paid $1 for ONE cream cheese packet. The order took about 20 minutes--ridiculous. The bagel was cold, so evidently they forgot about it, they screwed up our order and gave us AND CHARGED us for extra pastry. Don't waste your time on Jean Philippe Patisserie. It is just ridiculous that it can't be run any better than it is. You place your order, pay for it, then step out of line and WAIT for your name to be called. Even if it's JUST COFFEE, you wait to get it. It's close to the guest elevators, so I guess they can get by with doing things like that. But walk half way across the casino floor to Roasted Bean and you'll be much better off. Sorry we won't be staying here again, unless they GIVE us the room for FREE. While all staff that we saw (front desk, housekeeping, servers, etc), were very friendly, the cleanliness, the difficulty of parking and walking to room, and the lack of amenities (extra TV, clean sheets, plugs for medical equipment) make this hotel not the correct one for us.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, customer service needs some adjusting.\u201d", "Author": "allisonlight", "ReviewID": "UR86755350", "Content": "-Housekeeping was incredible.

The hotel room was great, we liked it alot. The room is clean, and then bed was very comfortable, probably because of the fact that it's still new. The view was great too. We had the view facing the west side of the strip on 21st floor. That means we saw Vdara, Rio, Palms etc. The view was very nice at night. We enjoyed it so much. And we also enjoyed the room alot for its hi tech stuff. Upon our first entry, the curtain opened itself, and the music was turned on automatically as a welcome. It was amazing! And there was a control panel next to the bed, the control panel can control every night within the room (including the lights in the bathroom!), the curtains, the TV on/off and channel selection, music channels, etc. So you pretty much can stay in the bed most of your time and just relax. It's definitely a room for honeymoon, vacation and relaxing. We also like the bathroom as it's clean and the light is good, we can make the light softer and stronger with the control panel. So if you want to have a bubble bath with dim light you can do that. If you want to have stronger light when doing make-up, you can do that too. We just love the room. They also provided robes for use. Very very nice. It's also convenient to walk around the City Center as we stayed in Aria. We ate at the Jean Philippe Patisseria, Jillian Serrano, Cafe Vettro and the Buffet at Aria. They are all good food and within Aria. Actually I just ordered take-out from Jillian Serrano and Jean Philippe so we can enjoy the room more. For Cafe Vettro, we dine in there as the restaurant was nicely designed. The pool is very nicely designed. We enjoyed the pool alot too. The water is well heated, not too cold, not too hot. And I don't think the casino floor smell badly like others do in the older hotels. Maybe because it's still new, so it's good that we can enjoy the smell-less casino now when it's still new. I also like the waterfall and the fountain at the entrance of the hotel. They look very nice and very soothing. You gotta check out the galleries along the walk from Aria to Mandarin Oriental. They are nice and no fee to get in.

We paid only \u00a360 / night for the hotel through netflights.com. The car park is accessed from Las Vegas Boulevard and the second floor is where the bridge to the front of the casino is located. The reception area is located at the front of the hotel at the opposite side to the car park bridge and it may be easier to walk along the front pavement past the main Valet Parking to get to it from the self park bridge. The Check-in lines seemed to be slow however the time we were at the check-in desk was quick and efficient. We were allocated a Standard King room on the 17th floor (17260) which was not far from the lifts and faced away from the strip so looked out over the Rio. The room was quite large and tastefully furnished with a comfortable bed and plenty of storage space. The bathroom was very well appointed with large shower alongside the soaking bath. There were glass doors separating the WC, shower/bath and twin sink areas. There was a nice range of soaps, shampoos etc. A good hairdryer and dressing gowns (although no slippers). The room safe was unusually in the bedside drawers. The pool area was much nicer than the photos show with 4 pools and 4 Jacuzzi pools. The landscaping was very nice with plenty of sun beds. There were some nice restaurants in the hotel and at the Crystals Mall next door although we found most to be on the pricy side ($40 each for an entree + extra for sides + $30+ for a bottle of wine) \u2013 gone are the days when eating out in the United States was excellent value.

The show tickets are also getting more expensive although there are plenty of half price or discounts available at Tickets4Tonight. We saw the Viva Elvis show which was good but not great and we saw the Lion King which again was good. The only issue we had at the hotel was with Housekeeping. On our second day (1st November) housekeeping had not showed up by 6pm so we called to be told they operate 24 hours. I asked to speak to the manager who said she would get someone straight on to it. They arrived about an hour later with some chocolates as an apology and cleaned the room thoroughly. The next day (2nd November) the cleaning was done promptly and thoroughly however the next day (3rd November) the beds were made and towels changed but no cleaning was carried out. I got the impression that they did not have enough staff to complete all rooms and a significant number of rooms were only being serviced where complaints were made.

We spent 5 nights in a Corner Suite, which we booked 6 months in advance on Aria\u2019s website for $275 per night (plus tax). It was the nicest room we\u2019ve ever had in Las Vegas. The layout was a little odd because of the corner placement, but it was very comfortable and luxurious. What we liked about the room: We loved the high-tech controls, which allow you to change room temperature, lighting, TV, music, and curtains from your TV or from a bedside panel. You can even set the lights to go off/on at a specific time, or in a certain number of minutes. We loved the three large flat-screen TVs with HD programming (one in the bathroom so you can soak in the tub while watching TV). We enjoyed having a second half-bath to use when one of us was in the bathroom. It was great to have drawers in the bathroom to put stuff away instead of having everything out on the counters like most hotel rooms. The shower had a bench to sit on while shaving legs. There were always at least 6 towels, so we never had to ration them. The high-tech toilet with multiple bidet functions took some getting used to (especially the warmed seat), but we liked it, too. The toiletry selection was the most extensive I\u2019ve ever seen: shampoo, conditioner, soap, bath gel, lotion, shaving cream, disposable razor, shower cap, Q-tips, sewing kit, dental kit, and bath salts. It was nice to have a good-sized refrigerator, with icemaker, in addition to the minibar. (No coffeemaker, though.) Every morning, a local newspaper and a NY Times were hung on our doorknob. What we liked about the hotel: Service at Aria was GREAT! By far the best service we\u2019ve had at a Las Vegas hotel. Everyone from the front desk to the housekeepers was trained to greet all guests with a friendly smile. We\u2019ve never had such prompt housekeeping service in a Las Vegas hotel. Aria seems to have a real service culture. When we checked out, the front desk person noticed that we\u2019d been charged for several phone calls that failed to connect, and took them off the bill before I could even mention them. The staff wasn\u2019t just accommodating, they were actually proactive in trying to ensure a good experience. Aria has a great location in the center of the Strip. The walk from our room to the Strip was comparable or shorter than other hotels we\u2019ve stayed at. We had drinks and several meals at the hotel, and all were excellent. The casino is nothing unusual, but nice. The hotel as a whole doesn\u2019t project a unique character, but everything is beautifully decorated and in great condition. What wasn\u2019t perfect: 1. We arrived at 1:00, and there were no lines at the check-in desk, but we did have to wait until 2:30 for our room. We hadn\u2019t booked a view suite, and we didn\u2019t ask for a special view, but the check-in guy volunteered that he was putting us on \u201ca high floor with a nice view\u201d. We got all excited\u2026 but his \u201chigh floor\u201d turned out to be the 9th floor, with the top of a parking garage taking up half the view. Not a big deal, but I wish he hadn\u2019t raised our expectations. 2. They seemed to be running short on conditioner. The other toiletries were replaced so frequently that at one point we had 6 bottles of bath gel, but we only ever got one little bottle of conditioner. 3. The bed was a big puffy marshmallow that was comfortable for the first five minutes, but provided zero back support, so I woke up sore. It would be great if Aria had the same fabulous beds as MGM. 4. The Aria gym wasn\u2019t as good as you\u2019d expect for the price ($30 per day, or $80 for a three-day pass). It was a standard hotel gym. Aria\u2019s ellipticals were disappointing. They were a good brand (Precor), but they had a front drive, and were much harder on the knees than our rear-driven home machine. One day we went to the next-door Monte Carlo gym, a better value for the price ($19). It was smaller and more crowded, but we didn\u2019t have to wait for equipment, and the True ellipticals were rear-driven. However, the Monte Carlo\u2019s machines didn\u2019t have individual TVs. Overall, Aria\u2019s positives far outweighed the negatives. For the first time, we are planning to go back to the same hotel on our next trip to Las Vegas, if we can get a reasonable room rate.

I was ticked that even though my suite was prepaid by my company the hotel took almost $7000 in authorizations on my credit card durning my 10 day stay, regardless of the fact that I never actually billed anything to my room. The people running the place had no idea what was going on in the area. I hate to know that I probably have a better functional understanding of the area then they do. The bartenders were lackluster and overall I was underwhelmed. The suite was lovely, but I like Vdara more. The bathroom was large and had a nice view of the strip.

As a plus we were able to get an excellent rate through my wife as she is a travel agent and is \"in the know\". Upon arrival we were more than impressed. The lobby area is amazing beautiful, and the scent of vanilla that gets pumped into the lobby is great (if a little TOO strong). It was so nice to come back to the hotel after a long day sight-seeing and not be inundated with a \"theme\" as so many of the other hotels have. The room couldn't have been nicer. We were placed on the fourth floor of the hotel, a non-smoking floor, and were pleased with the cleanliness of it. It would have been great to be higher up to have a better view, and our \"mountain view\" could have been a bit more \"mountainous\", but that's what you get on the fourth floor. Next time I'll go for the \"pool view\" option. The room itself had a massive bathroom, double sink and low-flow toilet, as well as walk in shower and tub combo which was more than big enough for two. A nice touch was that after a day of wandering about the room attendants had placed all our toiletries on little \"placemats\" so as to keep them off the marble tops. Impressive! The bed was great, if a little soft, and the pillows were perfect. We considered purchasing two for our own bedroom back home! Each time the room attendants came and cleaned the room we came home to an absolutely spotless new room! We only sampled the buffet once, for breakfast, and were very impressed. At $14.95/person we thought it to be very reasonable. The pool area was very nice as well, although we just passed through and didn't have a chance to sample the supposed \"death ray\"...? The concierge staff were great, and they helped us arrange to renew our vows Vegas style. Remember to tip your concierge! We valeted our car, and were happy if not blown away by the service. Again, tip your valets! We aren't gamblers, but it was fun to watch others and walk in and around the various tables. We didn't find the casino too smokey, but it was apparent.

We were very pleased. The hotel is modern and beautiful. Check in went quickly. We had arrived several hours before the official check in time and there were no nonsmoking rooms available. We wanted to settle in right away so we took smoking rooms and they were fine, not smoky at all. The rooms were very comfortable. Housekeeping did a fine job all week. The hi-tech controller was pretty easy to operate and controlled the drapes, tv, lights. I have more trouble working my phone. The conectivity panel for the tv has connections for HDMI, S video, composite, ethernet, USB, and two electric outlets. The in room safe is big enough for a laptop but is fairly shallow. This was possibly the nicest hotel room I had ever stayed in. The hotel is big but we learned our way around within a day. We had a rental car; the location was good for us. Easy access from the highway via Flamingo. The hotel is situated on the Strip (LV Blvd) between Flamingo and Tropicana and we had no problem getting in and out. Currently, construction at the nearby Cosmopolitan has the sidewalk closed off. You can detour across the street via the pedestrian bridge. When leaving Aria headed for north on the Strip, you can also cut through Vdara and Bellagio. No matter what, be prepared to walk. People with mobility issues will have no problems within the hotel itself (other than the fact that the place is huge), but the surrounding complex might be tricky. There are stairs, but also escalators and elevators. The tram is most helpful when going between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. We had breakfast in the buffet almost every day. We liked it. We also went to Bellagio's buffet and Vdara's Silk Road for breakfast, both were very good also. The Todd English pub in Crystals was great for dinner. The Viva Elvis show was better than expected.

I knew when the City Center complex was being built it would be impressive. We were greeted by staff instantly who guided us into the check in lines.

They made eye contact and greeted us most of the time - which you don't see very often in Vegas due to the amount of people around at any given time. Our room in the Sky Suites was luxurious and had amazing views. We were there for a bachelorette party so it was the perfect space to have friends come and spend time before heading out on the town. No detail was forgotten in this room. The heated toilet seat was amazing in the middle of the night and the steam shower was great after a night out dancing. The lounge for the sky suites offered light snacks and evening cocktails and was a comfortable space to relax in between activities. Friends of ours had rooms in the main hotel and they were the best we have encountered in vegas yet. Decorated beautifully, spacious, great views, state of the art technology and our friends have given their accommodations their seal of approval. The swimming pool at Aria was amazing - we were there in July so it's super hot and you spend a lot of time at the pool. It never felt so crowded and there was plenty of staff coming around to look after drinks and keep the pool decks clean. We booked a poolside cabana one day and it was incredible. The poolside cabana's at Aria are the best we have seen and our cabana attendant was great. He took great care of us and by the end of the day we felt like he was an old friend. The restaurants that we dined in at Aria were also exceptional. Julian Serrano served up amazing Tapas. There were so many choices and we were hard pressed to find one that we didn't enjoy. It was a great atmosphere too - and even though the restaurant was busy it was not loud which we definitely appreciated. We also dined at Jean George's steakhouse and the food was exceptional and came out cooked exactly as we wanted it. The lighting was a bit darker than I would have liked it but it still gets a recommend from me for sure. The buffet at Aria is one of the better ones I have seen with many different serving stations, and offers enough variety for all tastes. The food tasted great and it was incredibly clean. Finally Cafe Vetro served up a great breakfast after a night out at the club. Our server was lovely and again spent some time getting to know us and making sure that we were well taken care of.

We booked the hotel in July (got a very good rate on their website for deluxe room). We were so looking forward to spending time in Las Vegas and at the Aria. The weather was bad at Bryce and we decided to come into Vegas a day earlier. We called the Aria Front Desk who at first seemed taken aback that we called them directly and not central reservations number. They then proceeded to say rooms were available but they would be unable to negotiate a rate with us that was anywhere near comparable what we were paying for the two nights already reserved. We decided to just book a room at another hotel and go to the Aria the following day. We checked tripadvisor reviews and booked a room through expedia for the Ballys Hotel. We arrived at Ballys in the late afternoon and checkin was swift and pleasant. Room was large, clean, nonsmoking as requested and on a reasonably high floor. Hotel is not new but well maintained and service is prompt and courteous. They are adjacent to the Paris Hotel. Very centrally located. Bellagio is across the street and Aria is also close by. We had breakfast the next morning and drove to the Aria with plan to just pre checkin and leave our luggage until a room was ready. I was given baggage claim check and told to go to pre-checkin. Lines at checkin are extremely long and SLOW at the Aria. When my turn finally came I was told that she couldn't register us as it was my husbands name only on the reservation ( I booked deluxe room for two and provide both names to reservations agent). She then said okay she would take my information and my husband needed to come back with me with his photo ID when we came back. We went to see the Hoover Dam and as promised the Aria did call in mid afternoon to say the room was ready. We got backt to the Aria close to dinner time. We checked in and called for our bags. Unlike other reviews the bags did come in a very reasonable time. We were WOWED by the beauty of the room and all the modern amenities,electronics,etc. I was taking pictures/videos of the room just to post online. That was when I discovered that the free wifi internet didn't exist and they wanted a daily charge for this. When I booked the room , I particularly was interested in the Aria as it posted a \"no resort fee\" and when I reserved the room was told that wifi would be included in the room charge. When I went down to the dest to query this I was told that \"this won't be consolation to you but like the other Vegas hotels we are going to a resort fee in November\". Decided not to make a big deal out of this and went to dinner at Lemongrass. We had an excellent meal (service was also very good) and then went to explore the Vegas strip. We got back to the room very late and that was when we learned a valuable lesson. If sleep is of any concern to you on a vacation before you are smitten by the beauty of a place take the time to check out the bed or whatever is most important to you. The bed is \"pillowtop\" but were clearly not replaced since the hotel opened. What made it worse was the boxframe it was on was totally shot and needed to be replaced. We struggled to find a spot that we would not sink to the bottom or the middle and finally just slept on the floor. Yes I did just say that and between my husband and myself we have travelled all over the world for business and/or pleasure and never had to do this. My husband went to the front desk in the morning and was told they would need to have housekeeping check out the bed. He said this was unaccesptable. Without any apology or offer of compensation they offered to show him another room with king bed (he requested that they show him a room with two queens thinking that we'd have a better chance of at least one good bed). They said the room with two queens would be an additional $30 charge. We were told to wait outside a room for security to show us the room and \"try\" the bed.. I think we waited at least 30 minutes or more for security. The second room was pretty much the same as the original but the bed was marginally better and for one more night I just wanted to settle in and enjoy the rest of my time in Vegas. I had left the privacy light (everything in this hotel is electronic) on when I left our first room as all our belongings were still in it. We came back to the room to call for a bellhop to move our bags only to find the room ajar and two men in the room switching the mattress. I am still clueless why they didn't offer to do this in the first place. They then looked at the box spring and said maybe they needed to put some plywood between the mattress and boxspring!! I know this can be done but in a 10 month old five star hotel???? We went out to enjoy our last day/evening in Vegas and pretty much spent the rest of our time anywhere but the Aria. Came back at the end of the evening only to find that the bulbs in the lamps by the bed needed to be replaced. Called housekeeping twice before someone came up and then he looked at me and said \"did you try everything to see if they worked\". Yes the remotes worked and the bulb needed to be replaced. We didn't bother to call for a bellman on checkout and just took our bags to the parking lot ourselves. Checkout was not long but not once was an apology for our inconvenience even expressed by any of the staff. If Vegas is on your list of places to go to please realize that there are so many hotels to choose from that please read reviews carefully before you choose hotel. Look beyond the surface as some of the older hotels in this tight economy may actually be providing better hospitality and services (Ballys did give us a book with several discount coupons). The Aria and City Center are well located and the hotel is beautfiul and modern but they need to make serious changes in how the hotel is managed. We have just gotten back from vacation but do plan on writing also to Aria and MGM management re our experience which I see from other recent reviews is unfortunately not uncommon.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbria", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "BrendaCumbria", "ReviewID": "UR85479499", "Content": "The hotel is in a wonderful location for exploring Vegas.

Like most buffets, the food is about average, but I did enjoy the fact that there was a huge selection and most of the food was not heavily processed junk. We could get real vegetables, real fruit, etc. There was a small line up (3 minute wait) when we checked out, but we were offered to just leave an e-mail address and have our bill sent to us. We opted out of that, but it was nice that they offered. We didn't get a lot of time to spend by the pool. However, the pool area small compared to some of the more popular casinos. It probably wouldn't have mattered much to us, but it could if you are used to the gigantic areas like at the Luxor. The casino staff were pleasant, but the drink hostesses rarely came by and when they did it was often 30 minutes before they returned with a drink, if they did at all. We tip these ladies well and it still didn't really do us any good. Most of the time I just want water or club soda, but that was hard to come by. The only negative part of our stay was the ODOR near the spa. I can't call it perfume or scent. This smell was gag-inducing horrible, overpowering and rank. Even walking by the hallway to the hallway to the spa was a \"hold your breath and walk quickly\" experience. This is something that definitely needs to be fixed. I would never book a spa appointment due to the...stink.

On arriving at the hotel at 10pm after a long journey there was nobody to greet us or help with our baggage. We queued at check-in and were told that there were no non-smoking rooms available and no King bed rooms available so we would have to stay in a smoking room with 2 queen beds and ask to change room the following day. We asked if they could just sort out the room change for us the following day but they said no. So at 9am the next morning we approached reception who said they wouldn't know what rooms were available until later on. My husband complained about the inconvenience of this and at first was getting nowhere but spoke to the supervisor who said that she's put $60 of credit on our room account for the inconvenience. It took a further 2 visits to reception and 2 phone calls until we finally got moved into the correct room at 5pm the following day. This spoilt the first day of our holiday. The concierge gave us the wrong directions to a restaurant we were looking for. It turned out that the $60 credit wasn't added to one of our rooms so we had to request this again as well. On a positive note, the hotel is beautiful and the location is perfect. The rooms are lovely and we've never slept in such a comfy bed and the breakfast buffet is fab and very reasonable during the week. We felt the hotel lacked a bit of atmosphere compared to some of the other major hotels.

The hotel check-in was quick even though we arrived at a major rush hour. They made sure to add more employees to accomodate as many people as possible. We asked to have the highest floor available and we were given the 17th floor which gave us an incredible city view. The room was far from the elevators but it didn't bother us at all. The rooms are a decent size and the layout is well designed. I had read reviews of people complaining about the electronic room control but we can't complain about that. The bed was incredibly comfortable and it was hard getting out of bed every day. For the food we ordered room service twice and we were pretty surprised by how good the food was.

Ok arrived at 200 pm , me my wife and my mom and also my 2 year old son, Check in was quick and simple, two king rooms that were non smoking and that were joined, the only thing they could offer us was on the 5th floor. I would have liked to have been higher but didnt complain and took it . Rooms were clean, a good size, and far from elevators, once i got out of elevator on the 5th floor i counted 230 steps from elevator to room. May not sound like much but to do over and over and over it begins to take a toll. I was told that the hotel was suppose to have another bank of elevators, but when the economy tanked, they saved money by eliminating some elevators, could be true, dont know . But my two rooms 5237 and 5239 were a good walk and i dont know how top architects could miss this design flaw. anyway both rooms had minor electronic issues, one room could not get curtains to open, and they other room couldnt get tv to work one day.. Both issues were corrected within one day. Ate at chinese rest. Blossoms which was very very good, everything we ordered was a nice size portion and the quality of the food was excellant. Cafe Verte we ate at also, food was just average. We gave the Buffet a try for lunch. A great variety but a lot of the choices just didnt taste that good. So I would say the buffet was just average. The casino does have a strong smell of vanilla aroma that started to make me a little sick. Room service was very good. Upon check out had 6 bags , called bellman, after 20 min , called back they still didnt come 20 min later was getting to close to my flight time , ended up carrying own bags, waited over 40 mins for bellman and never showed up. With all gambling even though I had 120.00 comp dollars showing on my players card, they said that i could only convert those and use on slot machine and i couldnt use it towards any of the meals that I had charged to my room. I thought this was a bad buisness, Very tight on comps slim to none . I think with some work that the hotel could be a real winner. but they do some real stupid things. like 15.00 a day for internet service.

Our shuttle dropped us off in the bus lobby and we easily found our way to the front registration desk. The check-in line was only 5 minutes, the best I have ever experienced in Las Vegas the previous 8 times. The check-in process was quickly and efficiently handled, and we found ourselves upgraded to a Cityview on the 29th floor upon arrival in the room (Our package paid only for a regular view).

Our initial impressions were very favourable: massive courtyard, massive lobby, all decorated tastefully. The hotel looked very modern indeed. Our room was on the 50th floor and sported stunning views of the city and mountains. Our room was modern and high tech--perhaps too much so. It took several minutes to figure out how to turn the lights on--everything was touch control but unfortunately the main control pad was very unresponsive (took me ten minutes to program in the wake-up chime. They really should contact Apple for their touch-screen technology.) So why do I sound somewhat less than enthused? For starters, I thought a 5-star hotel was suppose to pamper you with amenities. This hotel certainly had the amenities but everything was extra cost. Want to dip in their pool? That'll be a $30/day \"facility fee\" please. Work out in the gym? Same $30 fee. Cool your water in the fridge? There's a bar fridge but it was intentionally designed to offer *no* extra space. They'll deliver you a mini fridge...for an extra fee of course. The room didn't even have a coffee maker--a standard amenity in 2-star hotels. I didn't bother to ask because I knew what the answer would be.

The bathroom was top-notch - marble surfaces, separate bath and shower, private toilet.

I, too, booked a non-smoking room and was given a smoking room for my first night. No, I couldn't tell much difference and they offered to swap after the first night, but really why bother asking for my preference. I wonder what they would do if I were allergic to cigarette smoke? Given that it is a casino I suppose there is nothing they can do. The layout of the resort is odd. Having to walk through the casino every time I want to get to my room is odd. Having long, long corridors without much lighting is odd. Having to show my room-key everywhere I go is odd. Not being able to find various restaurants (one of them doesn't even have a sign) is odd. Not being connected to the monorail is odd. Although typical for a Vegas casino, it is really frustrating not having coffee making facilities in your room. It is also frustrating to not be able to have a newspaper delivered outside your door each morning. I'm sorry, but as a business traveler I require those things.

Bathtub in the corner suite is killer. Especially at night. Lets just say it lets the romance blossom. TV 's in the room are great. Never any sound except what we made in our own room. Coming in the hotel- Everyone loved the vanilla smell as you enter (no where near overwhelming). Casino is clean modern and cool. I never really gamble at the big hotels anyway, so couldn't tell you much else (I did not lose at Drai however). Spa and pool are really, really nice. I can see how this place will soon become a classy, fun pool party that is not overtaken by spring break crowd. How do I know this? Because it is a little expensive. But we came to Vegas expecting to spend a little money and this place is worth it.

Everything you need (later in the morning and during the day) is within relatively short distance, and very diverse. I like staying at different hotels everytime I go to Vegas, so I probably would not stay there again if I returned, BUT like I said, only because I want to stay at other hotels I have not stayed at.

Nice place, buy has several annoying issues. First the room. It looks sleek, but has a ridiculous and very glitch prone central control unit which controls everything on the room, from lights to tv to curtains. The remote is somewhat slow to respond, but also has some kind of setting to predict what you would want, so when country to turn one one thing for example, some other thing in the room will also turn on or off for no apparent reason. Trying to turn on the lights above the bed, a few times I also ended up with a tv streaming music or opened curtains. I don't know if that was just my malfunctioning unit, but if not, the idiotic automated presets have got to go. Often in the middle of the night, I preferred to go to the bathroom in the dark rather than try to turn anything on. Another annoying feature is the fact that there are no electrical outlets in the room that are in the vicinity of the bed. Which means that if you want to plug in anything like a cell phone or a laptop ( and I had both) you have to leave it across the room by the tv where the two outlets are located. The hotel promised to bring me an extension cord which they keep around just for such complaints but it never arrived. For a hotel attached to a conference center which is hoping to receive business clientele, that does not make sense. Internet is available, but at $15 a day is way overpriced. Options to grab a quick meal are limited, with only one cafe selling very expensive sandwiches and deserts ( which ate very good by the way). The problem is that for breakfast and lunch the lines are ridiculous, since you order one at a time and there are no other quick food options. The sit down restaurants are very good but extremely expensive. In the steak house, a $50 steak requires the side dishes to be purchased separately.delicious, but feels like a rip off. The architecture itself is impressive but rather cold, feeling very un-Vegas. there are not enough check in and out windows and the process takes a while because of thw long lines.

The pool area is fantastic, with many pools and beds to choose from. Again, was worried about the smokiness of the Casino, but this was not a problem, they also have none smoking tables. My husband managed to have many Free drinks while playing - not quite the same for me only allowed water or orange juice!! The location of the Aria is great, central to the strip. You can walk through The Crystals and it will bring you out opposite Planet Hollywood and right near the Balagio! The romote that controlled everything was just great, felt like kids again, setting an alarm to open the curtains for us every morning was just amazing! Conciege went out of their way to help, we had booked a table at 'off the strip' one night, luckily we mentioned this to them, they informed us that it was some miles away and a taxi would have cost $80 for a round trip!!

We wanted to try the Aria because it is one of the newest hotels on the strip. I read up about it on tripadvisor before we went, here are things I read about and experienced first hand: 1. The hotel smells like vanilla when you walk in. A little strong for my taste but better than smoke. 2. Nobody ever came to offer us a drink while we played the slots. We walked next door to the Monte Carlo 3 times over 3 days. They were much more prompt with gaming drink service. 3. They do not have an abundance of 5 cent slots. Better gaming at Monte Carlo if you're not a high roller. I mostly prefer Jacks or Better. 4. The Jean Georges Steakhouse is phenomenal. Easily the best sea bass I've tasted in my life. Very attentive staff. Surprised us with a dessert and wrote \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate with chocolate. 5.The plug in the bathroom is located in the most inconvenient place. I don't know who's idea it was to put it there but it is really not smart. You literally have to clear off the entire counter if you're going to plug anything in, or you''ll knock everything on the ground. 6. It's an older crowd. You will not encounter hoards of sloppy college kids here, which is great. But when I come to Vegas I don't mind a little ruckus. We are in our late 20s, it was a little too tame for me. 7. The buffet sucks. Lack of variety, poor presentation, food tasted bad. Spend more and go to the Bellagio buffet, you won't regret it. 8.Great location. The Planet Hollywood shops are really close and will have something for those of us that don't spend thousands on Gucci and Fendi. Only 15 minutes walk to the center of the strip. Lots of close restaurant choices. 9. The decore is very modern. Very cold, not exciting. Minimalist. The entrance leaves something to be desired. It seemed like whoever decorated it was trying to disguise that it is in fact a casino. It was like a really nice convention center everywhere you went. Over all good experience but for the money I'd rather go back and stay at the Palazzo. Their rooms are more lush, twice as big, and the environment is far more exciting.

The technology in the room is very cool and everything is controlled through the TV and remotes. The people that complain about the remotes/technology probably couldn\u2019t figure it out. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The casino is a little different and took a day to get used to, but it is still nice and not as smoky as some.

Hallways are large, but if you don\u2019t want to walk, request a room near the elevators. The buffet is great and the caf\u00e9 is also a nice place to grab a bite. One thing I found is that employees struggle a bit to give you directions out of the hotel. They will send you to Crystals or all around to catch the monorail. If you want to go to Bellagio, even easier is to use the walkway from the north valet, through Vadara, and in to Bellagio (6 minute walk mostly indoors). I also found it much easier to walk to Monte-Carlo if you are heading in that direction. Everything seemed very close staying at Aria vs. some of the other hotels we have stayed at in the past.

So glad i did. Im not a fusspot but i do like my luxury hotels and want surroundings that make me feel good. This did the trick. CHECK IN: First thing you notice is the beautiful vanilla scent wafting through the air, not too overpowering, but gave it a comforting feel . Id love that in my house. Was a busy Saturday morning so as expected room wasnt ready in time. Got a couple pool passes to pass the time and then got my key about 2ish. ROOM: Booked a basic resort room through City and Show (worked out at \u00a3140 a night for 2) and was expecting a much smaller area. The room was for me, pretty spacious, lots of floor space, nothing crammed and the large floor to ceiling windows covered the whole back wall. The bathroom was smaller than say Bellagio, Venetian, Wynn but was very modern and spotless. As for the much mentioned controls for the room, i didnt have any problems at all. It is touch screen and very simple ( it has pictures!!) Bed was extremely soft and comfy, slept like a log. HD TV was a nice surprise and plug points for every electrical gadget possible. Was on the 51st floor and had a great view, not strip but Vdara and all the way across to Palms. It was just the lights at night that i wanted, it was so amazing to look out at. CASINO: Im not a gambler so cant comment on machines or tables or the sort, just the feel of the casino area was very different from others. Still busy but not as bright and bustling as the usual. Very dark, but to me suited the feel of the place. The most modern looking and trendy i have been in. FOOD: Had the Buffet at breakfast once only. On a par with the rest. Loved the Jean Phillippe Patisserie section so much, we went there for pastries and crepes the next day. Handy just next to the elevators. Great coffee there also. LOCATION: Ok, so it is situated behind Crystals but when you consider how long it takes to get from your room in most Vegas hotels to the street, then this is absolutely no different. I tried the whole tram nonsense from Bellagio but definitly took longer as you have to walk through the Bellagio spa tower route, up stairs, up more stairs then exit at the far end of Crystals. Depends where you are heading i suppose. I prefered going through Crystals from and exiting at the Planet Hollywood walkway. Much easier and quicker to get to the strip. The only issue i have with location is a personal one. I much prefer the other end of the strip with Venetian, Caesers etc. As you travel up towards the MGM area it gets a bit less touristy and more porn slapper. No big deal really. Overall, i love the Aria and how clean and spacious it is. Upstairs on promenade level is so serene and found the staff to be very friendly and didnt grumble when i paid for my newspaper in dimes. Love that. It has a younger, trendier feel than Bellagio, though not rowdy or wild.

We ended up getting a Deluxe room on the 11th floor and it was amazing. The view was great and the bed was heaven. Im definitely considering buying one from the Elements store for $2200. We tried room service one day for breakfast and it was delicious and delivered in a timely manner. Other than the check in wait time, this hotel was absolutely amazing.

The prices for flight and hotel were great. Neither my husband nor myself had ever been to Las Vegas ( hard to imagine since we are in our 60's) We never had any desire to go and said Las Vegas would be the last place to go on a vacation. Just goes to show, never say never. From the moment we landed to the time we left it was a fantastic place to visit. We are not novice travelers either. We lived in England for a year and are seasoned travelers. The Aria was breathtakingly beautiful from the moment you stepped into the lobby . The delicious fragrance that permeates the main floor is intoxicating. I would like to smell that everywhere. We don't gamble AT ALL but it's fun to watch the players. Our room on the 19th floor was perfect and the view stunning, you look out towards the Rio Hotel. The Aria is a little out of the way but who cares, it's fun to explore and walk around given the outdoor temps were in the high 100's . Coming from Washington State it was temperature shock. We went to the Elvis show at the hotel and could have gone to that show every night. We never used any of the services so I am unable to comment of that aspect of the hotel. I will say as previous reviewers have commented on; the remotes in the room are sort of confusing and not user friendly. By the time you figure them out it time to leave. We loved Las Vegas so much we are going back in December. We won't be staying at the Aria but The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. It will be interesting to compare the two. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone but go online and try to get a \"special\" price. One last comment , the elevators at the Aria might be the fastest in Vegas.

We booked a great deal and upgraded to the Penthouse City View for about $200 more. The upgrade was DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY! The Penthouse rooms are part of Aria's Sky Suite series rooms and all bookings for Sky Suites automatically mean private stretch limousine transportation from the airport (and back). We were greeted at the airport by a friendly driver who helped fetch our bags and showed us to our limo waiting outside. We asked about a stop between the airport and the hotel for something to eat but the driver was not authorized to do that. After a 10-15 minute ride, we drove through a rolling gate to our private entrance at the hotel and shown to a Sky Suites-only check-in and concierge desk. There, we received our room keys and access to the Sky Suites-only elevators. The concierge then showed us up to our room personally and we were blown away. Beautifully appointed with modern furnishings, fully automated lighting, curtains, entertainment centers including iPod jack inputs...over 1,400 square feet of decadence and luxury. Operating the various room functions actually...FUN...using the touch panel provided in the master bedroom. Turning on and off individual lights, closing inner and/or outer curtains, temperature adjustments...it was all changeable...even putting the \"Do Not Disturb\" notification at the door could be done from the bed. Shower with steam bath, Toto heated-seat bidet, bubble tub, walk-in closet and of course a television in the bathing area - you know, just in case. Any fears we had that the little people would be allowed into our oasis quickly diminished when we noticed that all entrances to Sky Suites areas were manned by security around the clock. Whew. As an added bonus, we were also given line-jump passes for the very popular buffet restaurant and another restaurant at Casino level...restaurants that regularly had long lineups outside. Considering the cost of to-and-from taxis, time spent lining up at a crowded general check-in and busy restaurants...our upgrade was already paying for itself. It was fantastic walking down at any time in the morning and waving our line-jump card, strolling past the grumbling herd of cattle to expedite our feasting. Even better - free snacks and beverages, including evening wine, were available all day every day for Sky Suites guests. Judging from the outrageous price for in-room beverages and snacks, this alone practically covered the additional upgrade cost for us! Admittedly we were a little piggish with them (okay, a lot piggish) but they were very nice to have. All the Fiji water, Sam Pellegrino, soft drinks, cakes, cookies, fruit etc. etc. etc. you could eat. The casino and hotel property itself is HUGE. That is...it's ENORMOUSLY, GIGANTICALLY huge. There are entire wings of this hotel that, by themselves, probably show impressively on satellite yet we never saw them simply because we had neither the time nor the energy to travel there. Getting from the front door back to the Sky Suites elevators and into our room was an odyssey - one afternoon a briskly-walked (nearly running) return from the front door to fetch forgotten sunglasses clocked in at a staggering 12 minutes...enough time to fly between Washington D.C. and Philadelphia at full cruising speed. If there was a downside, this was it. While there was a tram that ran from Aria to City Center and Bellagio, we wished there was one INSIDE this hotel. Perhaps a full-time fleet of charged Rascals might be in order here. It's almost as if they wanted to create exhausted, hungry and thirsty people and force them to walk through their plush, well-stocked casinos before they got to their rooms. Wait... Some things we wish we'd known beforehand: we brought a laptop with us, but our concierge told us laptops were available to guests if they wanted them. We're not sure if this was a Sky Suites-only perk but we suspect it was. We also wish we'd known about the availability of private cabanas in the pool areas - they looked beautiful, and of course included flat screen TVs (presumably in case sunning and swimming got dull), but it was my understanding they were best pre-booked before arrival.

Every staff member I encountered was friendly, professional, and eager to please. Check-in was a breeze on the Friday night of the October long weekend, and check-out on Monday was just as quick. We never had to wait or line up for an elevator. Several banks of elevators for different floors make the trip to and from your room very efficient. The buffet food was very good - the servers work extremely hard to clear your table, and refills of the complementary wine at dinner came promptly. We did not eat in any of the fancy restaurants - we just enjoyed looking at the exquisite decor. There are several bars and clubs to choose from, depending on what mood you are in you can go to a lively bar, a casual sports bar, or the quiet \"View Bar\" which we preferred after a long day. We had dinner one night at the 24 hour Cafe Vettro - a very comfortable mid-range restaurant with delicious food. We split a salad after seeing a full head of lettuce being delivered to a guest at the next table. The room was very quiet and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in. The electronics are fun and efficient, especially when turning in for the night. One click of the button on the headboard shuts off the lights and closes the curtains. The soaps, shampoo, conditioner and lotions are of only moderate quality - you'll get better quality at a Four Seasons or Fairmont. I missed not having a hand held shower. The only complaint we had was that the pools closed too early. Two, including the adult only Liquid Lounge closed at 4 p.m. (we missed out on that one, which I was looking forward to) and the remaining pool closed at 6 p.m. I guess they don't want to pay the staff to keep them running.

I had heard a lot of hype about the Aria, its dramatic architecture, its cutting edge technology, and modern design. Firstly, the technology does not disappoint. It was definitely one of the most technologically sophisticated rooms in which I've had the opportunity to stay. Tons of review have mentioned this fact - the bedside remote that controls everything in the room, which can even tune the TV to the preferred morning news program for your wake-up. I must admit it definitely ups the ante (apologies for the gambling pun) for technology in Vegas hotels. However, technology does not make a four star hotel. Service standards do. That's where Aria, like many of its Vegas siblings, falls short. Yes, there is a very cool button that indicates \"Do Not Disturb\" vs \"Service Room\". However, one would think that the \"Service Room\" button would be tied into a central database which would send the housekeeping crew up when it is lit. I press the \"Service Room\" button at 8am when I leave for my conference, and when I return at 5pm, my room is not clean. I had to call down. What was the point of the tech if it's not being used? Also, the design is quite unique and modern, but scratch beneath the surface, and you realize the average quality of the products and materials in the room. Bathroom products are clearly marked \"Made in China\". The W Hotel chain can use Bliss, but the Aria can't manage to get some known name brand? The tub looks cool, but its made of fiberglass. In fact all the fixtures have a plastic feel to them. In fact one can only see that the tech and design is covering up what is really a run of the mill Vegas megahotel.

I did email the hotel a good four days before arrival to mention we were visiting for a special occasion. On the hotel website it said they would respond to every email within 48 hours. I never received a response. Upon arrival I mentioned it to the reception and they apologized and immediately called to have someone follow through on my original request. The same day they had chocolate covered strawberries and coconut macaroons sent to the room. That was nice. I was extremely nervous after all the reviews about the mini bar and how you can't even touch it or move anything without being charged for something even if it was not consumed. That must be a major issue because they even encouraged us at checkin not to touch anything to be on the safe side. I found that really ridiculous because I shouldn't have to be literally afraid to go near something in fear of being charged for it. Luckily there were no issues with that when we checked out. We did have a strange charge to the room which we later found out were the complimentary strawberries they sent to the room. Also not an issue when we checked out they apologized and immediately removed them from our room bill. Wondered what would have happened had we taken advantage of the nice man offering \"express check out\" had we not asked to talk to a clerk to question the charge to the room...but as I said it wasn't an issue. The only other bad thing I can think of is the Liquid Lounge Pool. I found it almost intimidating the way they stand at the entrance almost like it is some top secret exclusive \"for snobby priveleged guests only\" type of a place. We walked up and there was a security guard standing there with another gentlemen and all we asked was \"is there a charge to get in?\" and her response was \"I don't know, you'll have to ask this gentlemen\" He explained there is no charge to get in but you will be charged $30/person for food and drinks in order to use the pool. To me that's a YES, that was strange and frankly a turnoff. I am a paying guest and I didn't think that was fair to pay to use a pool at my own hotel, but, whatever. On the good side: We loved, loved, loved our room. It was so clean, had the most amazing bed I have ever slept in and an incredible view. Except for construction going on at the new Cosmopotitan opening in December, it was fine. We didn't hear any noise and just overlooked the cranes and so forth. It was still amazing at night! I loved the way you could personalize the room with the touch screen at bedside to open the curtains, turn on the lights and turn on the TV to wake up to. That was awesome and very user friendly. The room was completely cleaned every day, including vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, changing the linens and refreshing the toiletries daily. I say this because you could tell it was cleaned top to bottom unlike some others that just surface clean. There were plenty of towels and pillows, usually we have to ask for extra of both. I found the employees very friendly and pleasant all over the hotel. Even housekeeping was very friendly and asked if everything is okay and did we need anything when they passed us in the hallway. As others had mentioned, I liked the way you had to show your room key in order to get to the elevators to your room. That made me feel secure. I liked the high speed elevator since we were on the 27th floor. We never waited for an elevator either going up or down, one was there as soon as you pressed the button. The food was amazing, even at the buffet. It was alittle weird at the cashier checkin at the buffet though, you pay and then have to wait to be seated and that was a little bit of a wait even though there were empty seats all over the restaurant you can't just sit wherever you want. Also I should mention there is a outdoor cafe \"breeze cafe\" which was not open the whole time we were there. That was weird it said \"seasonal\" but it was 100 degrees and September? Perfect weather to be open! Didn't quite understand that. Drinks at the pool bar were delicious but be prepared to pay top dollar. We paid $50 dollars for two drinks! They were 32 oz drinks but seriously? We also noticed the waitresses were few and far between at times at the casino. We waited quite a while at times for a drink but not a huge deal for us since we aren't big drinkers but it would have been nice not to have to wait a good 15-20 minutes for a drink once we ordered. Overall, it was a wonderful stay and a very nice hotel. Oh, we did smell the \"vanilla ish\" scent others complained about but I didn't think it was that overbearing.

My boyfriend had been to Vegas several times and always stayed at MGM because its a great value and right on the strip, but wanted to try somewhere new. We were excited to try Aria because the rooms are very high tech and you have a little tv screen looking remote to control everything in your room (lights, tv, etc) and we new the hotel was new so it would be fancy and very clean. I felt like the hotel was tailored towards a older crowd. My boyfriend liked the poker room, but the rest of us were looking for cheap penny slots to play for awhile and had a hard time finding any. A lot of them say penny slots, but have a minimum bet of 40 cents or so. So that was kind of a bummer. Also, the waitresses weren't around that much with free drinks. We went to the MGM and played penny slots for hours and hours with all the free drinks we could ask for most of the time when we wanted to play slots. I think if we go back, we'll stay there instead. Aria is very nice and we had a view room which was kind of neat.. you could see the strip out to the side. The only other thing I wasn't crazy about at Aria was that it's a little off of the strip, so its not as easy to get around as the MGM or other hotels.

LOL i guess that's reasonable because we would've eaten about 5 lobsters each. we also ate at lemongrass, the thai restaurant in the aria which was fantastic. the casino is action-packed and modern. fun place to gamble. the elvis show is not the best cirque show in town but still pretty good and worth seeing. it's a great tribute to the king--not cheesy, no real bad impersonators or anything--and if you're a big elvis fan then it's a must-see. the aria rooms are a bit of a conundrum. the PROS: ultra modern and plush. the bed is absolutely one of the most comfortable hotel beds of all time. ever. seriously. i can't stress this enough. REALLY COMFORTABLE BED. the technology is probably difficult to figure out if you're really old or not tech saavy but we thought it was very cool--one remote controls the entire room from the curtains to the lights to the temperature. there's also a decent size flat screen tv. bathroom is a little small but the adjacent shower/tub combo is great. the provided shampoo is sulfate free (my wife tells me that's outrageously high-end for a hotel to provide). we had a view of the front of the aria--the strip was partially obstructed by the two diagonal citycenter buildings but still great. the CONS: the room itself is kind of small. and for us, the sleep quality wasn't the best--but HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE you ask since their bed is the most comfortable hotel bed ever?! well, in the morning, the hotel room lights up because whilst the automated curtains are really cool to play with, they do a horrendous job of keeping out light! Our family likes our hotel room as dark as possible so we can sleep in. in this regard the aria room failed badly. the top of the curtain pretty much let's a lot of vegas sunshine in. it's just a design flail. they sacrificed function for form. overall the aria is a spectacular hotel if you're in the mood for some ultra modern luxury in sin city. it's really a 4.5 star but it falls just short of the 5 star because of the reasons above. we'd probably go back for a grown-ups only stay.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed My Stay\u201d", "Author": "karlab", "ReviewID": "UR82202356", "Content": "Went with three girlfriends, all age 30, to the Aria for three nights - Friday - Sunday. This was my first time to Vegas, so I was not sure what to expect, especially after seeing some negative reviews of Aria on TA. I was very happy that we chose Aria. Check in was very quick - we requested a double queen room, and were afraid that we were not going to get it since there are so few, and because we were supposed to check in Thursday night, but due to flight delays it ended up being Friday AM. We ended up getting the queen room! After we got in we went to CVS, which is literally right next door to the hotel, to stock up on water, soda, sunscreen, snacks, etc. We saved a lot of money buying these items at CVS (it is open 24 hours). Room - Our room was very nice, it was plenty of space for 4 women. There are two closet areas and a bureau. The double sinks were perfect for getting ready to go out at night. Almost everything in the room is controlled by a remote, which could be frustrating if you don't know how to use it. But there are lights in the room that are controlled by switches. The beds and pillows are amazing, they are sooo confortable. The linens were really nice as well, nice soft towels and sheets. Our room was cleaned every day by 5 pm. We had a problem with the safe one night and they sent an extremely nice engineer to come and fix it for us, at around 2 am! Food - We ate breakfast every morning at the Jean Phillippe Patissierie which had a great selection of coffee drinks, breakfast items and sandwiches. Prices were pretty steep- iced tea for $4.00 and a croissant was $3.95. They did have some coffee drinks that were $6 - $7 which I thought was crazy! They have an amazing yogurt parfait for $7.75, which is expensive but it was soooo worth it. We had a late night snack at Cafe Vettro one night, the food was pretty good and prices weren't too bad, it was about $70.00 for the four of us. Three pools to choose from, all were nice with plenty of chairs, umbrellas and tables. The pool area was clean and well maintained. There is an adults only \"Liquid\" pool that we didn't check out - I think they charged adminission to it. All in all we had a nice time. The staff were all friendly, and there are plently of places at the Aria to eat a meal or pick up a snack.

The Good - The room was not large but well designed and the bathroom was particularly well designed although we found it strange that the double hand basins had no plugs so the for washing/shaving etc. the water continously ran away- not good for water conservation. The main feature of the room is the high tech use of the television and remote for controlling curtains, lighting, air conditioning, etc. The pool area is another good feature, plenty of sunbeds for the three pools and the fountains into the pool and cool mists at the entrance and cafe are welcome in extreme temperatures. The Bad - Why did they build this hotel at the back of the CityCentre development? It is difficult to access The Strip, especially for seniors, The view from our 26th floor \"Strip View\" room was terrible. The two leaning yellow apartment blocks completely dominates the view and looking downwards is a 30foot wide channel filled with service pipes. We assume that they ran out of money and could not afford to hide the pipework. If you like modern architecture in the minimilistic style then OK but this is not what Las Vegas is about. We expect each hotel on the strip to have its own theme and to demonstrate this even to excess.

Found best plan of action was to use the South exit through Monte Carlo to the strip. The exit through Crystals to the walkway to Planet Hollywood and a little known exit from the North Valet through Vdara into the Bellagio. The tram was pretty much useless for Aria.

Our room was nice, technology managed everything in the room which my husband had fun playing with daily! When got to our room, there was a coffee cup sitting in the hallway outside our door. We wouldn't have noticed it but it was still there at the end of the next day. We had brought a couple of drinks from the Casino up to the room and the next day, the coffee cup was gone, and replaced with our used drink glasses....which were still there when we checked out on Sunday. Again, not a big thing and it became a bit of a joke between us as to when they would finally be gone!! The complaint I have about Aria is the location. It's location is set way back off the strip in between The Monte Carlo and the new City Center. They don't make it easy to get to the strip, forcing you to go through the City Center Mall every time. It's easier to just go over to the Monte Carlo and take the tram to the Bellagio. You avoid all the construction going on and the pedestrian walkways which are blocked. As usual, Buffet was great, pool area was nice and the spa was terrific, if a bit pricey. Tip: If you book a spa appointment, do it early in the a.m. You get to use the spa and fitness center all day. It has a private pool, overlooking the general pool area and is quite nice.

Later in the evening I was approached my a \"Host\" and told I had to purchase tickets through her to be able to get the 2 for 1. Well of course her tickets were more expensive. Also, I had $350 in free play. The players club put the money on my card. When I got ready to use it, it wouldn't work, so I went back to the players club, and they informed me I had already used it.

Rooms: very high-tech. When you walk in, the tv turns on with some music, and the curtains open up so you can see the view. Everything is controlled by the tv remote. You can even check up-to-date flight status, adjust all the lights, curtains, etc. all on that remote. If you don't like all this technology, you might get frustrated, but I loved it. The regular rooms are not suites, and are sized as regular rooms, so keep that in mind. It's a decent size, but if you're used to other Vegas hotels and all rooms being suites, you'll think this room is small. Spacious closets, soft bath towels, large flat screen tv. The distance from the elevator to our room was quite a trek, and we weren't even at the end. Bed: wow, what a soft and comfy bed. I believe it was a memory foam pillow top they have on the mattress. I had no problems falling asleep. Bathroom: I heard this hotel is an eco-friendly green hotel. That being said, they have those sinks/faucets that spray the water out in a certain way. After using the sink, I looked around the counter and my clothes and it looked like a had a water fight with myself. It is a dual sink, and maybe I just have a lot of stuff, but there was barely enough counter space for 2 people. The toilet is separated from the rest of the bathroom by a frosted glass door and wall. So technically you can see a silhouette if someone else is in the bathroom with you. The shower head is awesome. To get to the tub, you have to go thru the shower, and I'm not really a fan of that, and that's just a personal preference. The amenities are the standard amenities, however, there was no cotton swabs or cotton balls. Food: I did not eat at any of their establishments. Sportsbook: Not a fan of the setup. No free drinks there either. Casino: the layout is pretty wide. Also, they try to cover up any smoke smell with some sort of light vanilla scent. No theme at this hotel whatsoever so it doesn't feel like you're in Paris, Italy, Egypt, etc.. It is just a clean, modern/contemporary hotel. Parking: I am cheap and won't even take advantage of the Vegas free valet. Self parking used to have ridiculously large spaces when they first opened which was such a waste of space, but now it's normal. They have a handful of low emission/alternative fuel parking spaces available, but unfortunately all but 1 car was legitimately parked there. It takes a while to walk from the parking to the guest elevators, fyi, and you take an outdoor (but covered) ramp to the caisno as well. Pool: 3 pools, and the beach club, Liquid. I didn't have a chance to utilize it but it looked like your standard fare pool. Spa: Didn't use, but I would love to check it out as it did look very nice.

The casino is nice. Not themed at all like some of the other hotels on the strip. The restaurants I visited seemed overly pricey. $20 for a martini. $20 for an appetizer and the main courses went up from there. Expect to spend a lot if you want to sit down to a nice dinner at this hotel. I will say that there is a great pastry and gelato cafe in the casino with reasonable prices.

Dining room table, 3 flatscreens, sofa. .Fully automated 1000 sq ft 1 1/2 bath delight! Seriously everything is automated. Touch screen controls windows, TV, radio, lights, alarm. It can be programmed to open the shades, dim the lights and turn on your favotire TV show in the AM. Much better than the typical larm clock! the toilet!! OH the toilet. Gross conversation but it did make me google the $1000 Toto Flush for a possible addition in my master bath. Cleans both men and women with heated wather (no need for TP, if you are daring) blow dries you all while sitting on a heated seat! I was a little nervous and worried to try it but my wife and I both agree, pretty impressive and useful! Bathroom was narrow but efficient. Double sinks, full jacuzzi, flt screen. The pics online do it justive. COMPLAINT: The sinks in the master bath were horrible, splashing all over. Very difficult to handle the and contain the back splash due to the narrow and shallow doubel sinks. Small issue but a complaint none the less. Pools are decent. I highly reccomend a cabana off hours when the price drops (Sun to Wed). 42 inch plasma, misters, a stoked bar, Wi Fi and cabana girl. If you are splitting the costs with others absolutely worth it! We were in our cabana watching golf and football on the sofa, posting online bets and lounging in the private patio from 11AM to 6pm. BUY THE PITCHERS of booze and not individual drinks. Much better value. Casino is nice, propety is expansive and worth exploring. We ate breatfast every day at the restaurant by slots. Began with a V, I think vet I cant remember the name but is overlooks the back entereance of the hotel and is HUGE. Phenominal food. Literally ate there 5 mornings and never got sick of it. Best fruit platter, eggs and BREAD!!! Sports book blows compared to the one at Palazzo. Huge screen but not a great feel. The SPA and workout facility are 5 STAR! Make plans to spend time here. Workout room is $30 per day without spa reservatios so book and workout same day. You can utilize all facilities if you are booked same day for a massage. I would book late massages and work out in the AM. You can keep a locker all day and go back and forth as much as you please. Great relaxation and healing rooms to enjoy. TRUST ME take advantage of the spa. Excellent wlittle co ed outdoor relaxing pool overlooking the crazy party pool. Did not venture there, it is small, loud and not a couples place..unless you are single and looking to get after it. If it was a boys trip, we would have been there in a heartbeat.

I'm glad this stay was not on my dime. We arrived around 9:15 pm; check in was prompt and friendly. Our room was nice but, other than being 'modern' I wouldn't say it was any better than any other hotel room I've seen. The view was horrible (over looking construction and, due to its concave build, our room looked into someone else's). I probably would have accepted this given the seminar's discounted rate, but I also booked nights on either side at full rack rates. The tv did not work. I called and requested service; an hour and a half later, still no one shows. When I called back, I was told that they were super busy and asked if I could wait until the next day. Their description of a \"separate shower and bath tub\" is somewhat flawed; yes, they are separate, but together. You have to step through the shower to get into the bath tub. If you wanted to take a bath while your husband showered, it is not going to work unless you want to wash your hair at the same time. And because there is very little ventilation around the glass doors to the shower, it had a constant sour smell. It was also slicker than snot and I was always concerned one of us would break our neck in there. You cannot actually use the mini fridge in the room. It is computerized so that if anything moves, you are automatically charged for it. No place to put your own snacks or beverages. There are also no vending machines on the floors or convience marts within the hotel; thank goodness for the CVS at the bottom of the hill. Skip the Viva Elvis show. The sound system is horrible. If you think you are in for a WOW! factor because it is sponsored by Cirque du Soliel, think again. Save your money and buy his records. Spent $25 for a beer and one cocktail in the lobby; the same order at the pool bar (literally just around the corner) was $10 cheaper. Still haven't figured that one out. When you check out, you go to the front desk where you checked in and then have to walk to the complete other side of the hotel to grab a taxi, and this is not a small place. Actually, it is too large and everything is very spread out. There are two saving graces: 1) the beds are to die for; scrumptuous bedding and a mattress that feels as if it were made just for you; and 2) Jean George's Steakhouse.

Aria did not have a big slot selction.......and the machines didn't pay out at all. Also, I did not like how almost all of the blackjack tables had automated shufflers.

We had watched City Center being built and were curious to see the project as it neared completion. We knew the architects involved in the project by reputation and so booked 3 nights there in September. The Aria exemplifies the best and the worst of modern architecture: the best being the use of computers to design angles and spaces that would have been virtually impossible a few years ago: the worst being the starkness and coldness of the building materials used. The inside of the hotel is imposing and uninviting. The seating in the large lobby consists of granite benches, for example. They may be practical but hardly comfortable. The colors in the hotel are dull. There is very little \"life\" to many of the spaces. That said, our room was a refuge from the coldness of the lobby. Because the hotel has recently opened, the rooms are immaculate, bedding comfortable, and bathrooms clean. Our room, just a standard king, was spacious and well lit. Our view of the mountains and pool areas was lovely. (The pool areas were our favorite spaces in the hotel. There are several pools, plenty of lounges in sun and shade, and landscaped very nicely.) When you walk into the lobby you will notice an odor, not necessarily bad, but pervasive and a little sweet. I asked about it and was told it was \"Vanilla Mist\" and was used in all the public spaces to mask the odor of smoke from the casino. At first it seemed a little overwhelming, but we eventually got used to it. However, anyone particularly sensitive to odors and perfumes should avoid this hotel, for sure. We did not eat any meal other than breakfast in the hotel. The buffet (which came with our package) had so many choices you really had to pace yourself. We did see the Cirque du Soleil show featuring the music of Elvis Presley one evening and I would offer one word of advice. There is not a bad seat in the theater so don't worry about getting a seat close to the stage. We were in the third row and actually wished we had been further back. The performance, by the way, was very entertaining - loud but entertaining. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bargain at a nice, centrally located place to stay, but don't expect the rates to stay low for long. The hotel was crowded with conventioneers and other guests taking advantage of the bargains, but as business picks up, I'm sure the rates will too.

The rooms are ultra modern with keyless entry, single source control for lights, drapes, audo/video and room service but lacked the little niceties like nightly turn-down service that we expect when paying this much per night. The bathroom amenities were 'down-market' in white plastic containers, but the linens - both sheets and towels were well-appointed although the mattress was a tad on the soft side. Room service was surprisingly quick in a hotel with 4000-plus rooms however the bar service on the casino floor was very slow indeed. There wasn't much variety in the slot games compared with a Wynn or Bellagio The location means a bit of a walk from the entrance to the strip although there is a free tram that runs between Monte Carlo and Bellagio. The mall 'Crystals' that is connected to the hotel by a walkway - Tiffany, Versace, Gucci etc. was empty except for a few scattered souls wandering about. We tried one of the restaurants - 'Blossoms' which did have excellent service and although they described themselves as 'classic Chinese' had a very limited menu and limited wine selection. The two entrees with two glasses of wine and a beer and sharing one dessert came to $135. The front desk staff were pleasant enough but seemed a bit disorganized and although we arrived at 11am and they promised that there would be a room ready by 12 - we had to keep checking back with them every hour (their request) and finally got to our room after 3pm.

Overall, we had a great stay. It's in an ideal location and connected to the Mirage and other MGM properties on that side of the strip via tram (we didn't take the tram). We booked through a SW Vacation package which included airfare and choice of MGM hotel. We picked the \"deluxe room\" and were facing the Rio and the new Cosmopolitan hotel, currently under construction next door. Here are the highlights: - Hotel location: Well-located next to the Mirage and Bellagio. 24-hour CVS drug store is right next to it to pick up essentials if needed. - Architecture and ambiance: Stunning architecture with tons of water elements all over the property. The lobby is \"grand\", but like other reviews mentioned, the vanilla-esque smell was overwhelming and distracting. We didn't really care for it. - Check-in: Pretty easy. I had read previous reviews and had set my expectations accordingly about a possible slow check-in, but it was pretty effortless. There was staff to greet us and point us in the right direction and line. - Room: Beautifully appointed. Great details like the scale in the bathroom; the safe in the nightstand which can accommodate two laptops and more; the big bathroom; technology. The dark wood furniture, although very chic, shows some wear already with chipped nightstands. Pillows and beds are incredibly soft and feathery. Not bad if you like it, but if you prefer firmer beds or pillows, this may not work for you. Also, we loved the floor to ceiling windows. We were a bit distracted with the construction air horn blowing every once in a while from the Cosmopolitan (they were doing construction on the pool), but it wasn't so bad that we thought we had to move. - Housekeeping: Did a good job. No complaints. One of the days, it was already 3:30 and they hadn't hit our room yet, but it eventually got done. - Pool: Wait service was good. They have several pools to choose from. Never had an issue finding a chaise, but I got to the pool pretty early in the day (10:30 am). Folks showing up later in the afternoon had a hard time finding a place to settle. - Food: Ate breakfast at the Cafe Vettro, which was very good and very reasonable. Not a buffet, but a menu structured restaurant. Also had snacks (gelato, pastries) at the Patisserie shop on the Casino level. I've been to France several times and the pastries are just like there. Incredible. It was always packed. If it's too crowded, try the quick little \"To Go\" bar/cafe near the North valet, I think. Grabbed coffee there several times when the Pastry shop was too crowded, even for coffee. They also seem to have nice restaurants on the Viva Las Vegas floor, but we didn't have an opportunity to check any of them out. - Casino: My husband are not huge gamblers, so we played a bit, and had fun. Won and lost some. - Check-out: I sense that they're still trying to figure out the best way to manage this. There was staff available to greet folks checking out and advising folks about express check out if you didn't want to check your room bill (which we did, so we waited in line). It was a little busy, but it usually is at check-out time in large hotels. They were staffed adequately, I think. - Hotel staff: Staff across the board for our stay were very pleasant, nice, and helpful. I'd read otherwise, but did not run into any issues with staff at all. - Internet access: Wifi is pricey ($15 per 24-hour period). We found that we could get it for free the first couple of days we were there, but then as soon as the weekend crowd hit, the hotel added their security and locked down access to paying customers only. Business Center rates are a rip off for any kind of internet access or printing. - MGM-property perk: We purchased tickets to an event at the Mirage from the concierge at the Mirage and were able to bill it to our room at the Aria, which was nice. - Adjacent shopping mall: Architecturally stunning property. Still a little vacant, but has all the standard Vegas stores and still being filled by retail stores. It had been a while (6 years and 3 kids later) since we had been to Las Vegas. We had not heard of the Aria, nor had most of our friends somewhat familiar with Vegas, but we wanted to stay in a 5-star resort. We'd recommend it highly to our friends going there and would stay there again.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMGM Groug of Hotels should be ashamed of the Aria!\u201d", "Author": "didi014", "ReviewID": "UR80535654", "Content": "We received an invitation from the Aria & booked for 3 nights incl. our anniversay Jun 23, 2010.

I had been very curious about the Aria and this was my chance, so I went for it. Check in was nice and smooth, very quick actually. I booked a deluxe room. I did not book a city view room but I was given a high floor. I was not sure what to expect for a view. My first impression after stepping off the elevator was that it looked like a nice cono building or luxury apartment building. It had a nice feel to it. When we walked in the direction of our room, 32-167, we were pleasantly surprised. The hallway has a panoramic view of the strip! It was outrageous! I thought that was an incredible touch. The room keys don\u2019t work like standard room keys. All you have to do it hold the key up to the round sensor on the door and it opens. There\u2019s no slot to stick it in, which is perfect for me since I always seems to have trouble with those. As soon as you walk in the room for the first time, the drapes open to show you the view. Considering I did not pay extra for a view, I thought my view was great. Immediately in front of us was the Cosmopolitan, so we were able to see the construction. They are making great progress. To our left, we could see the Aria corner suites and the Rio in the distance. To the right we could see Planet Hollywood very clearly and a piece of the Eiffel Tower. The room was beautiful but small. However, for a small room they used the space wisely. I really liked the color scheme and the furniture. It was very contemporary but very plush. The room is very high tech. All of your controls are next to your bed. You basically don\u2019t have to get out of bed to change anything, including the temperature. There is even a channel that tells you if flights are on time, which I thought was awesome! The pool at the Aria is nice but not spectacular. I thought it was bit of a walk from the room. They do check for room keys at the entrance to the pool, which is a plus. Beverage service at the pool was not good at all. Nobody serviced our section. It was like we were invisible.

We have always stayed at the MGM Grand, but decided to do it up since it was a special occasion. We were able to get discounted rooms due to our player club status. We upgraded to a Deluxe City View room when we arrived. They didn't have any Corner Suites available, which is what we really wanted. The hotel lobby and casino area are beautiful. It has a very artsy feel with sculptures everywhere, very nice to look at. The casino itself was not as big as I thought, but a good size. Table games were never less than $10 for you gamblers, but we didn't expect them to be any lower. When we got to our room the automated lights and window sheers were nice at first. You have total control of the lights and curtains by the touch of the remote. They also have an alarm clock that also controls everything. You can set a wake up or sleep timer and it will adjust the temperature, open the curtains, turn on or off the TV. That is pretty cool. The cool wears off though when you just want to turn on a light. Sometimes simple is better. The bathroom was very nice with a shower and tub. I will post some pictures of this because it is hard to describe the look. The toilet was secluded which was nice for some privacy. The bedroom was nicely decorated. There was a desk with USB ports and plugs. There was a mini bar that was fully stocked, but very pricey. $8 for a bottle of Fuji water. The bed was very comfortable. The view from the room was also pleasant. You cannot really see the strip from the room because the hotel is about 300 years from the strip and there are other buildings that are included in City Center that block the view. We could see Monte Carlo, NY NY, MGM, and Planet Hollywood. The main focus of the view is the middle of City Center where there is a fountain and pretty lights. We did not get room service, but the prices were very high and we did talk with someone that had ordered something and they said it wasn't that good. There is access to a monorail that connects City Center, Vdara, Aria, Monte Carlo and Bellagio. The monorail puts you out at the back of the Bellagio which is a pretty long walk to get back to the strip, but beats walking in the heat. You have access to the mall which has some nice upscale shops and good places to eat. As far as the restaurants in the hotel go there are several high dollar places to eat (see my review on Sirio). The buffet was good, but I heard the Bellagio has a better one. The one thing is we didn't want to eat 5 stars every time we went out. We sometimes wanted something quick so we had to go to the Monte Carlo or across the street to get any type of fast food. Overall, it was a nice trip, but if we had paid full price for the room then we would have been upset. If you are looking for an artsy, high tech place to stay then I would recommend this hotel, if not stay somewhere else.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWorst Service of any place in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "g8trdmd", "ReviewID": "UR80293044", "Content": "I have been to Vegas 6 times.

We go to Vegas about 3 -4 times a year. We were a little anxious to stay there due to some of the negtative reviews regarding poor service from hotel staff in housekeeping, checkin and maintenance. Because we received the players club promotion of $79 plus 2 free buffets we thought we would give the hotel a try. The moment we arrived to the hotel lobby to checkin at 9:00pm a young lady took us immediately to a checkin person, His name was Keith. An extremely polite and enthusiastic individual. We spoke with him for about 10 minutes exchanging pleasantries. He made every effort to get to know us and told us about he and his wife. We told him that we just had an anniversary and he sent up to our room a wonderful box of Jean Philiippe Chocolates., We also mention to him we wanted to have a late dinner at Lemon Grass so he immediately called the restaruant and reserved a table for us later that evening. He then gave us great directions to our room on the 20th floor with a very nice view of west Las Vegas. Our room was far from the elevators but it was'nt a big deal as you get use to the distance, because you are farther from the center of the hotel you get a better view. I really like the high tech room and the system was very user friendly. For most guys who like TV remotes it is very straight forward. If you are like myself who likes to TV surf alot the batteries do run out. The bad news is our batteries did run out on the TV remote and then you cannot work the system. We called maintenance and they delivered new batteries in about 1 hour. When we arrived at Lemon Grass restaurant the hostess was extremely friendly. The bus person brought us water and tea immediately and then the waiter greeted us. He was very friendly and also personable. A few minutes later another staff person came to our table to make sure we were being served. The price is a little expensive compared to comparable Thai or Vietnamese restaurants of this type of the strip but we enjoyed our meal. We also had breakfast at Cafe Vettro. Again, friendly and efficient staff. The breakfast portions are large and I am glad my wife and I shared a breakfast. The room has a privacy switch and I accidentally push the button in the morning so housekeeping did not clean our room. We we came back to our room at 5:00pm we called housekeeping and a housekeeper came within 10 minutes to clean our room. I had a very nice conservation with her and she told me that the supervisors are changing systems on a regular basis to ensure that hotel guess are receiving the best service possible. She was very thorough and I was happy to tip her. Every time we passed housekeeping staff in the hallway we were always politely greeted. My wife used the pool area and was very satisfied with the facilities. Make sure you always carry your room key because they ask for your key to enter the pool area and room elevators. We thought the casino had a limited variety of machines especially penny, nickel and quarter machines. The minimum bet for the penny machines was actually 30 to 50 cents. We have our favorite machines at other casinos so we just went there to use the slots. My wife went to check on tickets for Viva Elvis but the show was dark that night but was given a a password to get a great discount for KA at the MGM ticket office. We got $150 tickets for $55. They were great seats and the performance was sold our that night. It was very easy to park in the parkade and an easy walk to enter the hotel not like the lots at MGM, Caesars Palace, Mandalay Bay etc. Overall we had a great stay and and had a great experience.

Visited Aria again briefly this week...I ran into Elena, the staff who found my purse (last review)...She gave me a hug and shared how she had received total kudos from my review...she deserved it! So since, I know someone from Aria is reading this....Let the feedback begin from the last visit! Everything went well with a couple exceptions (btw thanks for the awesome player's rate and no resort fee)...I will give credit that reception was much better in its organization! Also, someone must of read that the bathroom was poorly planned because you could actually see the electric socket the time! yippie..they moved the kleenex box... Problems: The greeting Valet guys TOTALLY dropped the ball...When I arrived they did not ask me if I needed a bell person and were yelling at each other...It was not THAT busy. It was not the organized service I experienced the last time I arrived. It pissed me off...just because I don't drive an Escalade and am not a hot chick, don't ignore me...I would of tipped you well but now I just right this... New Hotel, but get matience some brown paint...I actually had to change rooms so I saw a couple floors of rooms...The doors need to get cleaned more often and they need some paint..Drunk Vegas people are bouncing off the doors like crazy...or at least that is how it looks with all the nicks I saw...on the plus side...my room was in solid shape once you got past the door... Biggest Off issue: The Buffett...or more specifically the STAFF In my rate special I was comped 2 buffets (worth about $60) which was cool. I invited a local friend and we had dinner...The food itself with a couple exceptions (lamb masala) and the desserts was underwhelming. The bright lighting in the buffett area makes it look like a cheap cafeteria which was unusual...The biggest issue we had was actually the STAFF...not the guys serving the food (they were pleasant) but the SERVERS...My friend even said to me when our server had a bad attutude that she has noticed a couple servers who looked REALLY unhappy to be there...We know it was toward the end of the night but leave your sour expressions at the door...you are almost going home!

Which was nice after our terrible taxi ordeal. We got the worst taxi driver in history, he was rude, tried to rip us off and the car stunk like he had had been living in it. After this taxi journey we will never use Las Vegas taxi's again!! Anyway I digress! Miguel met us at Aria and was very courteous and helpful and so was Christopher on checkin. We asked for a quiet room and were given a room on the 4th floor with a part pool view but it was very quiet which is what we wanted, the exception was saturday and sunday when noisy neighbours were thrust upon us. Tried to call security but lines engaged. Tried several times to phone, front desk, bell desk etc. After reading the reviews we thought this was typical of the hotel but on checking out we realised the phone we had been trying to use on the desk was broken. Had we tried the phone next to the bed we would have found we could have got through as we used this on the last day for the bell desk. How annoying as we had tried to call room service several times and always got the engaged tone we felt like idiots! Room wasn't clean on entry but after going to front desk and complaining they had someone go clean the room quickly and gave us 2 free breakfast buffets for use anytime during our stay. We had planned to eat at the buffet during our stay so free breakfasts were a great way to check it out. The buffet- A big disappointment. The service was great, the waiter was good fun and kept our drinks full but the buffet didn't have enough stations or choice. We ate at the Mandalay Bay buffet for lunch and found the food excellent but our waitress was very uninterested and curt and didn't replenish our drinks. We are returning to Vegas at x-mas as we will not be going to either of the buffets again. The room- Comfy bed, pillows were best ever, fantastic shower, toiletries very nice especially the shampoo. Some days had hairspray and mouthwash but some days not. Bathroom door handle was broken, they never fixed this but we never complained as we couldn't get through on the broken phone..But you would have thought the cleaners would have reported it in stead of trying to hang it back on broken... MOUTHWASH- after complaining about the room not being cleaned we went to the casino whilst the cleaners were sent back in to clean. Prior to complaining my hubby had opened the mouthwash and had some (just arrived after 15hrs traveling). When we came back to the room he noticed the bottle was full. He took a mouthful and it was water. Mmmmm where was that from?????? Also robes were removed from our room and had to ask for some more. Hubby started leaving a tip again after we got a nice cleaner!! Summary- We would not say this is a 5* hotel, we would rate it a 4*. We have stayed at numerous 4and 5*'s such as MGM 4* and Encore/Wynn 5*. We would stay here again if the rates were more reasonable but current rates they are asking are over priced. We think this hotel is somewhere between MGM and Bellagio.

The pool was great. They had 3 pools and tonnes of loungers. It was very relaxing and had tonnes of palm trees and plants to make it very tropical. The casino was huge which I really like so we could always find a free slot game that we liked. The location of this hotel was great too.

Our fears were baseless, as we had NO problems whatsoever. Here's some details, both + and -: We encountered no \"unfriendly\" staff. Everyone we dealt with was pleasant and friendly. Check-in took about 5 minutes max. This was @ 1:00 pm on Monday. Labor Day. Check-out took even less, like 2 minutes. This was very early in the morning however. We had a corner suite, which had a spectacular view, but the sun came in in the late afternoon, requiring us to close the drapes for a couple of hours. The food at the buffet was outstanding, even better than the Wynn's buffet. We had one breakfast and one lunch at the buffet. The pool area was spotless, and the pool towels were clean and fluffy--no old towels. The room was very clean, but not spotless. The carpet & the tile floors needed to be better cleaned in our opinion. Maid service was great, with no problems. If you want your room cleaned early, simply call Housekeeping and request it. Don't forget to leave a tip every day for the maid(s). For whatever reason, we could hear people talking in a neighboring room through the small vents in the bedroom & bathroom. Strange... The living room remote had dead batteries when we arrived, and the technician was there in about 5 minutes after I called to replace the batteries. We had several burned out light bulbs, and the maintenance guy arrived in about 30 minutes to replace them after I called. Yes, the Aria is a BIG hotel, which means LOTS of walking. If you are averse to walking, you may wish to consider staying elsewhere. However, our experience is that most of the \"larger\" hotels in Vegas require just as much walking, with the Wynn, the Encore, the TI, the Rio, the Mirage, and the Flamingo as examples. If you need to be close to the elevators, request a room close to the elevators. A corner suite is NOT close to the elevators. All the high-tech stuff in the room was fun to play with, but you can't touch the \"Master\" switch near the door, because if you do, all your settings disappear. At least ours did. The soft bed was fine, but I didn't care for the oversized pillows. I may bring my own next time, or ask if they have some others that aren't so big. There is a shop on the Casino Level called Elements. It contains curios, snacks, drinks and other essential you may have forgotten. It isn't hard to find, as it is on the maps, and listed in the guide in the room. Not cheap like an ABC store, but nicely stocked. Overall, we loved our experience at the Aria. It was like being on a grand luxury ocean liner, with all the amenities. Really no NEED to go elsewhere.

The front desk staff was friendly and professional, our room was ready upon arrival and there were no long waits to speak to anyone. The computer for the room curtains, tv, music, lights ect is very easy to use. No issues at all with the room keys. The crowd at the hotel was mostly 21 to 45ish, well dressed, and having fun. It was very busy and a lot was going on. I found the service to be excellent, friendly and helpful from everyone at the resort, front desk to room attendants. We had a corner suite, I definately recommend this, it was large and beautiful, great views from all the rooms in the suite, clean, well stocked every day, and cleaned in a timely mannor. Turn down service every night. I was there for 5 days and it was over a weekend and the service was excellent every day. The pools were very nice and we liked the DJ spinning music, awsome touch, the drinks were the same prices as any other high end resort, and strong. The gelato at Sweet Chill was so good, try the turtle gelato, you'll love it. We played Mega Millions and Roulette and were up for both, yay. Although I really did want to win the mega millions jackpot:( I won a few hundred instead.) oh well maybe next time. It is not confusing at all to get around the resort, don't really know how people think it is, they may have problems with direction in the first place. Also I did not think a 2 minute walk to my room at the end of the hall was excessive as I have read on here. Some complain the rooms are far away from the elevators. I guess if you do have issues with walking I can see that, otherwise, it is not long at all. The Valet service is excellent, and very fast. I did not have to wait long at all for the car at anytime. In my opinion the staff go out of the way to make sure you are happy and content with everything. I definately feel that this resort will be hard to top if I do stay anywhere else next visit, I like to try a different place everytime, but I really want to spend some more time at the Aria.

I found the City Center where it is housed to be horrid though. Completely sterile and offering absolutely nothing for anyone but millionaires. They were all obviously out of town since the place was totally empty and quiet. I can't imagine how it will stay afloat in this economy or any other really. Do bring a fat wallet to the hotel though because the Aria itself manages to gouge you at every turn. Suntan lotion for $20, wireless for $15? Just accept it and you'll be better off, but make sure you get a good deal on your room, because they will be getting the rest of your money one way or another.

I was offered a free room for the weekend by MGM/Mirage marketing so my \"value\" opinion may be biased, but I would definitely pay to stay at Aria in the future. Check In: Check in was crowded when we arrived at 12:45 on Friday afternoon, but the staff was organized and we waited just a few minutes until we were helped. Our room was ready and were able to check in immediately. Check out was a similar experience; quick and easy. Room: We had a deluxe room (fairly standard room I think) and it was nice and well appointed. The bathroom was a little bit smaller than I would like and the beds were softer than I prefer, but all in all the room was very comfortable. All the rooms have a fancy integrated electronic remote comtrol that controls everything from the lighting and curtains, to the television and music. It was an intersting novelty, but shouldn't be the reason you stay ar Aria. Fortunately, we did not experience any technical malfunctions with the remote. Casino/Common Areas: I really liked the casino area. Not a convoluted mess of tables, not difficult to navigate, amble assortment of games (variety, betting minimums), friendly dealers and pit bosses. All good. I was a little dissapointed at the numebr of auto-shufflers at blackjack tables. I wish they would have more tables with traditional shoe dealing. I also like how the casino has small bar and lounge areas strewn all about. They provided a nice respite from gaming and helped to make one feel as though they weren't in the mist of a throng of people (did that make sense?). Spa: Went to the spa on Sunday for some steam room and relaxation. The spa is set up very well (large steam room, hot tubs, cold tub, outdoor pool, shower, etc) and the staff is increibly helpful. However, the outdoor pool overlooks Liquid, the adult pool/club, and the music from Liquid is lound and somewhat disrupts relaxation time. Also, for $30 the spa is the best deal in town, in my opinion. Buffet: We had a free buffet and went for breakfast on Sat morning. If you're into buffets I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. For me... I would have rather paid for a normal breakfast somewhere else. Pool: Didn't really give the pool much of a chance, but it wasn't my favorite pool.

My trip to Aria started off on the wrong foot. As part of a conference, the hotel had blocked off a group of rooms at a reduced rate for attendees. When shown the rate upon check-in it was $10 higher an night than what was advertised. When I brought this up to the clerk she rudely asked me why I cared because \"it was not that big a difference\" and refused to even look into the issue because it \"looked like a good rate\" to her. After a full day of traveling I gave up on arguing and just turned in. I've noticed this on a lot of other reviews too but when I checked into a \"non-smoking\" room it had definitely been smoked in recently and over time. I brought it up to the staff so did something to improve it as the smell wasn't so bad the next day. Despite the rocky beginning, the rest of the trip was wonderful. The conference facilities were top notch and I was impressed by not only the food at the conference, but also the attentiveness of the waitstaff (maybe they should be running the front desk, at least they smile!). I'm sure its hard to make tasty food for 1,000+ people but they did a spectacular job at it. My room was spotless and the housekeeping did a wonderful job each day keeping it tidy. The rooms were trendy and modern and I was pleased with my view. All of the room functions are automated so you could, for example, program the shades to open as a wake up call. Very cool. Ate at two of the restraunts - Lemongrass (Thai) and Sage (Contemporary American) and would recommend them both. The service at Sage was particurally nice. Even all of the dealers in the casino were friendly! I didn't have a clue what I was doing so they were kind enough to show me how to lose my money. ;-) No, but seriously they were professional, yet friendly. One more thing that I've come to expect from high end hotels, but still hate, is all of the add on charges -- for example the business center charged $1/minute (yes!) for internet and entrance to the gym was $30/day.

[Another reason that we decided to stay at the Aria is that, unlike the MGM/Mirage hotels and the Venetian, the Aria does not charge a \"resort fee\"]. Happily, our entire experience was excellent. Although we arrived at noon, we were immediately given keys to our room (and our wait at the check-in was only five minutes). The room was beautiful and clean and we had a \"Strip view\" although we had not payed extra money for it. My only negative comment about the room can be that it was smaller than we expected (relative to the size of the rooms at the Venetian or in the Augustus Tower at Caesers), but we were nevertheless very pleased with it. The room was cleaned well every day. We had Sunday brunch at the buffet: the quality of food and the variety, as well as the service, were both wonderful. Again, I can make only one negative comment about the buffet: you have to pay extra for the \"champagne\", while at all the other buffets at which we have had the champange brunch unlimited champagne is included in the price of the brunch. The hotel is set back a considerable distance from Las Vegas Blvd, which was a \"plus\" for us because we we happy to have the chance to walk-off some of the calories consumed every day.

The Sky Suites also come with free limo service to the airport and free wifi, which are very nice money savers. The room had a separate bedroom and fantastic bathroom with soaking tub (with jets), great shower, and a very fancy toilet (think heated seat). We went to the buffet for breakfast ($15 pp) and it was actually a better deal than most restaurants. We went to Vdara one morning for breakfast and it was quite pricey. Casino was fun, nice smell (which someone else mentioned) and good layout. My husband played poker a few times and said the room and service were nice.

The first room they gave us had a very strong urine smell: think public bathroom at a truckers' rest-stop. The second room reeked of a variety of disinfectants used to hide a similar bathroom odor and this was in a different floor too! The front desk was extremely unhelpful, telling us that our noses was too sensitive and that if we had a problem with vanilla then we should stay at another hotel. She even arranged to get us rooms at the Bellagio at extra cost to us. Umm... trust me, the smell was NOT vanilla. And also, what kind of customer service was this? The next day, after finding a nicer front desk manger, we were able to switch to a third room. Although it was an improvement, there was still a strange, faint chemical smell to the room. The whole experience soured our stay at the ARIA. Although the exteriors are very pretty and modern-- albeit extremely BROWN-- the hotel is very poorly designed. There is only one set of elevators on each floor and confusing branching hallways that lead to dead-ends. If you're unlucky, you can have a very, very long walk to your room. Room numbers are five digits long and easily forgotten after a few drinks. Although it isn't obvious, the ARIA is actually behind the Strip. It's not a bad walk to the casino through City Center, but if you return late at night (it's vegas, who doesn't?), the City Center is locked, which means you have to walk around the City Center in a roundabout way to get back to ARIA. It's very inconvenient. Plus, it's another roundabout walk through the weird branching hallways to your room. The room was compact with high tech buttons everywhere. In fact, I found it a little too high-tech. When I accidentally pushed the wrong button, I shut off the entire room. The lights, tv, and shades shut automatically without any way to cancel it. There is very little counter space in the bathroom and I disliked how the tub was located inside the shower. Our bathroom lock was broken. Also, the beds are too soft. Sleeping in it is like sinking into quicksand. The ARIA casino and shopping area is worth a visit for its shiny, shiny modern newness.

While there is not another hotel complex in Las Vegas that can match Aria & City Center for impressive architecture, art & public area WOW factor, there is a decided void in terms of customer service. Electronically controlled drapes in the guest rooms simply does not make up for quality customer service. For 3 days we left requests to have 3 burned out bulbs in the bathroom replaced, but after 3 days they remained burned out. Why would a guest even have to ask to have burned out bulbs replaced? Is that not a function of professional housekeeping? And the air vent in the bathroom had absolutely not been cleaned since it was installed. It was covered in dirt & lint & we got on a chair & cleaned it off, after leaving 2 notes asking for it to be cleaned. Even though the kleenex box in the room was empty on arrival, & the one in the bathroom ran out the first night, & we place both empty boxes on the counter tops, they were never replaced for 3 days. On the 3rd day we finally went to a main in the hallway & asked for kleenex, but (get this) she had \"NONE\" on her cart. Was that the problem? Did the hotel forget to order kleenex, which meant the maids had none? Over a 3 day period the soap bars were never replaced, nor were the shampoo & other amenities replaced. There were no glasses in the bathroom & only 3 with the ice bucket in the room, & none of the 3 were replaced over the 3 day period. Each evening we washed them out in order to reuse them. And we heard LOTS of customer service complaint from other guests, no matter where we were in the hotel. Ordered 1/2 price appetizers & drinks in a lobby bar/restaurant named Union, during happy hour, & if we had been paying full price for the stuff we got we would have sent it back. Even at 1/2 price the food quality was very inferior. Something is not right at these City Center operations yet. Perhaps the well publicized financial problems are having a negative impact on employee levels, since training seems to be non-existent. Fantastically beautiful facility, & definitely worth a visit to \"view\" the property, but would we stay there again? Not in the near future, & not until we start reading that things are operating as they should for a facility that is so over-priced as to be insulting ---- \"when\" the related service levels are non-existent.

Surely their pee in the pool is more harmful than a little spilled white wine. * No food service pool side during the week -- only 3 pre-prepared sandwiches. Restaurant only open Fri, Sat & Sun. (told this was a new policy) Seriously?!?!? No food at the pool in summer at a \"5\" star hotel? Crazy. * Hi-tech console in the room was busted.

Having visited Vegas frequently over the last 15 years I love the chance to visit new casinos and see what the latest and greatest is all about. Did the Aria live upto the hype? Here are the some of the issues I dealt with; 1. Not allowed to check in: My friend was on a flight 2 hours after me and had booked the flight on Orbitz. On calling the Aria they were told that nobody could be added to the room, and Orbitz required a complete cancellation rebooking. My friend emailed me the confirmation so should have been no problem right? Wrong. Despite all common sense they refused to check me in despite me brandishing the email and reservation # from my friend on my iphone. Their apparent reason was that I could be stealing someone\u2019s reservation. Yes, I wrote a random email, had the person\u2019s first and last name and reservation number and decided to do that instead of actually make a booking myself. Regardless of the fact they could have just told me if the person booked in and didn\u2019t recognize me they would throw my stuff out, or even more obvious that they would take my credit card and charge me $500 if it wasn\u2019t legitimate, both common sense solutions that I would have been more than happy to have submitted to. Common sense = FAIL. 2. Room control not functional: I make a generous living working in Wall Street IT so I\u2019m more than comfortable around technology. The room control may have had intuitive controls but the delays and the missing icons made it a nightmare to even control the TV. Next time just give me a remote control (apparently our friends had a remote control but we didn\u2019t). Using slow confusing box to control TV = FAIL 3. Blackout Blinds not blackout: My friend with the bed nearest the blinds was woken up each morning by the bright thin light coming out from the top of the blinds. Blackout Blinds not doing their job = FAIL 4. No Pool signs: Received details on the 3 types of pools the next morning and went to find my friend only to find no signs detailing which was the adult pool, and it took 3 staff before somebody finally pointed me in the right direction. Simple signs = FAIL 5. If its an adult pool, why the screaming kids?: One father boisterously and loudly played with his 3 kids for 2 hours while numerous annoyed glances were exchanged by everyone around the pool and the staff couldn\u2019t have cared less. What\u2019s the point of having an adult pool if you\u2019re going to allow screaming kids to mess around? Screaming kids = FAIL 6. No alcohol in the pool: The staff couldn\u2019t care less about the loud kids, but the moment we slipped into the comfortable water with a plastic cup of wine the pool Gestapo were all over us. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? It\u2019s Vegas! What do you mean I can\u2019t have a drink in the pool? I don\u2019t remember a single pool in Vegas that didn\u2019t allow me to drink in it. Annoying kids but no drinking in pool = EPIC FAIL After staying at the Aria for 2 days we moved to Planet Hollywood, which was more than functional for all our needs for vastly cheaper than the Aria would have been (and with plenty of people drinking in the pool).

The hotel itself is beautiful as most new hotels are. The decor is cool and exciting although a bit cold. The rooms are quite nice as well, a little smaller than what you will find in most of the newer hotels in Vegas but still quite acceptable. The in room technology features are way ahead of any hotel I have stayed at in North America, you can access all room functions from your bed side which is a very nice thing to be able to do. I have seen this at a few hotels in Asia and wondered when hoteliers on this side of the Pacific would catch up. The bed was quite comfortable if you like very soft beds. The bathroom was a nice size although still smaller than the Wynn/Encore or Venetian/Palazzo. The shower and bath are separate but combined in one glassed in area similar to how many of the hotel bathrooms are being done in Asia. You can't have 2 people taking a bath and shower simultaneously for that reason. The restaurants are nice but pricey with average food. The crystals complex attached to the hotel is nice but very high end and restaurants are quite expensive with average food. Where this hotel seriously misses is on service. I waited more than 45 minutes to contact the bell desk to get my bags sent up to my room upon my arrival, I finally gave up and called the concierge who got hold of them and got my bags sent up. When the bellman brought my bags up we noticed that the desk lamp was not working and he said that he would send someone to fix it right away. We were in our room for four nights and nobody ever came despite the fact that I called or went down and spoke to the desk 3 other times. On our third day at the hotel we met the maid who apologized for not having made one of our rooms because she was called to do a room on an emergency basis, she said she would do it after lunch. When we returned at 9PM with our 2 young boys it had not been done, again we notified the desk. Last but not least the workers at the hotel seem to be very disinterested as do the supervisors. We had food basically thrown at us at by a staff member at the buffet, I asked to speak with a supervisor and I was basically told by a waitress that the supervisor was too busy to talk and she would tell her what I wanted and then the supervisor would decide if she wanted to take her time to talk to me. By the way make sure to bring your ID to the buffet or they will make you go back and get it if you want to do a room charge. This was the only place in the hotel where I encountered this. Last but not least I was shocked to see only one person working at the ice cream parlour on the mezzanine level where they serve small breakfasts during the breakfast rush. There was a lineup twenty deep being handled by one girl who did the best she could on her own.

We booked our room a month in advance and requested 2 beds in our room (traveling with my Mother). My only real complaint was about the not getting the 2 beds in the room! After reading a review on TripAdvisor about the bed situation, I called to confirm our reservations and to make sure that we would have a room with 2 beds. I was told by the Concierge that they couldn't guarantee a room with 2 beds and it would be based on the number of people checking that day if we would get a room with 2 beds AND she would place us on a \"priority list\"!?! What the *&#@? That little piece of information is not mentioned anywhere on the site when booking the rooms. We arrived on a Wednesday for our 4 day stay (105 degrees at 10 am), we were waited on by the nicest front desk rep - Jane. She explained the room situation and told us about the roll-away bed (a pillow top - Wahoo!) that would be placed in our room. She was apologetic about the situation, but wasn't offering any discount or comps. A $12 billion dollar hotel built - over 2800 rooms and it only has about 250 double rooms? Unbelievable! The room has all the bells and whistles - a technophobe's dream. After the initial newness wore off of using the remote for just about everything in the room, it became tiresome. I just wanted to close the freaking curtains and turn down air without push a whole lot of buttons! The king size bed was super comfortable (mother and I alternating sleeping on the Pillow Top Roll-a-Way bed! Yeah!). The bathroom well appointed - separate toilet closet, stand alone marble shower and tub -very nice. We had a super view from the 14th floor...beautiful. Hallways are bit long and a nice hike from the elevators. Breakfast: The lines are long at the (Cafe Vettro - serves B, L, D 24/7), but there is another outlet (The Roasted Bean) that serves just pastries and coffee for a quick breakfast. We ate at the Denny's across the street across from the complex. Don't waste your money on the Buffet - it looks like a old high school cafeteria from the 1960s serving similiar fare found in a high school cafeteria - breakfast $16.95. The buffet at the Bellagio is phenomenal and highly recommended - take the tram inside of the hotel complex to get over there (it is the sister property of the Aria). Try Julian Serrano's for the tapas and Chill upstairs for gelato or ice cream (yummy). We heard that the steakhouse upstair is great...pricey...but good. Overall.... This a great place for a getaway weekend (romantic or with your friends or whatever)...it has everything if you don't want to leave the property. This is definitely an adult hotel - we didn't see anything kid friendly about it. $30 per day to use the pool and fitness center - it is worth it! Hey, don't expect 2 beds in a double room...just book a suite!

The toilet is a trip as well and you'll have fun figuring it out. There are two sinks and the lighting is bright. The buffet was okay, but nowhere near the quality or quantity of the Bellagio. However, their prime rib was succulent and the desserts/gelato bar were great. The thai restaurant Lemongrass was very tasty and seemed to us to be very authentic. The casino was a bit dark, but I thought it was very nice and easy to manuever around.

The young woman checking us in found our reservations immediately and gave us the non-smoking room we had asked for and it was a Strip/City view which turned out great. We had made the reservation 3 months prior and I checked again 2 weeks before our arrival. I asked for a room close to an elevator and she quickly had us on the 21st floor The whole area smelled of that faint vanilla scent that I had read about. It was a pleasant contrast to other hotel/casinos we have stayed at. We got to our room so quickly we didn't have the \"drapes opening and music playing\" that was described. But we did the opening ourselves and loved the view. Turned on the tv and there was my name at the top of the screen. My husband who is a non-technical person had the bedside contols figured out in a few minutes. The room and bathroom were absolutely clean. Towels stocked, bath products complete. Our bags arrived quickly. We unpacked still looking for flaws after all the reviews we'd read. We brought along an extension cord which solved any outlet problems although we could have done without it. The bathroom sinks were no problem. I have hand painted talevera sinks in my home that are shallower than these at the Aria so we had no problem with splashing. We liked the shower and had no complaints about water pressure. The bed was super comfortable and we didn't hear any hall or noise from other rooms. The view at night was so beautifiul I didn't close the drapes until I was done reading in bed. The front desk took an imprint of our credit card and we liked the convenience of that. We signed for our meals and ate all but one at the hotel. The Cafe Vettro was our choice for breakfast and got to know some of the waitstaff by name, and they ours. Everyone was courteous and cheerful. We loved American Fish and the Jean Georges steakhouse on the night of our anniversary. We played blackjack every day and enjoyed the fact that we didn't smell smoke, our hair and clothes never smelled smokey, and we were in the casino every day. We found the environmentally friendly store \"Elements\" and got some incidentals there and also a very nice jogging outfit. We walked a lot checking every restaurant menu and just marveling at the ultra modern architecture and furnishings. At 108 outside we didn't use the pools but they were busy most of the time.

I did not feel comfortable using the bathroom, so did not get a shower or shave, and had to use a public restroom. I also missed the breakfast I had paid for, though they did cover that.

This hotel is absolutely BEAUTIFUL inside and out. It is located right in the middle of The Strip, between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. The rooms were very nice, and the beds were EXTREMLY COMFORTABLE!!!! We had a really nice 42\" flat screen. The room lights, curtains television and room temperature were all controlled by the remote. The bathroom is AWESOME!!. The garden tub and separate shower were located together behind glass doors. For even more privacy, the toilet had it's own stall with a telephone on the wall. A mini bar and refrigerator were in the room; however, since we never use the items in the mini bar or refrigerator, I asked that the items be removed. Unfortunately, they told me that they could not remove the items from the refrigerator so I could use it for my own personal use. (They have to unlock the refrigerator for you upon request). So this was very disappointing because every hotel and and cruise ship I have been on, I have requested this, and there has never been a problem. For a hotel this nice, the check in process could be a lot smoother. There were several guests checking in when we arrived; however, it was very difficult, and quite confusing to see who was being waited on. There were no lines, or ropes that would have made it easier to see who was next in line. Another observation was that the front desk clerks were very unfriendly.... not just one or two, but all of them. None of them greeted the guests with a smile. They all acted like they hated their jobs. I thought it was just me, but I heard other guests commenting on how unfriendly they were as well. The front desk clerks could take some lessons from Aria's security personnel. Every single one of the security personnel I met, was extremely friendly and helpful. Incidentally, the concierge that assisted me was very, very nice as well. One of my favorite spots at this hotel was the pool area. I really enjoyed relaxing out by the pools in the mornings. It is BEAUTIFUL, and the music was great too. I just wish that the pools were open at night, at least until 10 or 11 p.m. I would love to lounge by the pool, in the evening.

No, the room was checked out of early that morning and when I told the desk clerk of the condition, he said they could get housekeeping there in \"a couple of hours\" to clean everything out; even though the bed was made, we had no assurance that the sheets had been changed so we opted to say we wanted a different, CLEAN room; put on hold for a long time and he finally came back to say there was a smoking room available.

We then headed up to the pool and changed into our suits. We found plenty of lounge chairs both in and out of the sun. The pool area was beautiful. The attendants were constantly removing towels from empty chairs. The waitresses were always available and accommodating. Had a good turkey wrap sandwich and yummy cocktails. At 3:00 we left the pool and headed to check in. At 3:15 we were in our room. Our luggage was delivered in 10 minutes with a bucket of ice. We were given an explanation of the electronics of the room and the safe. Our room was spotless and loved the full wall of glass view. I really liked the vibe of the hotel. Very laid back and not a lot of kids. The Viva Elvis show was fabulous. The live band was just awesome and with the speakers under each seat you actually felt the vibration of the bass. The Jean Philippe Patisserie was excellent. My only negative comment would be on the buffet for dinner. Just did not care for the atmosphere. We did try it again for breakfast and were given a table looking over the pool. The meal was somewhat better. We have stayed at the Bellagio and the Venetian. I would rate the Aria #1, with Venetian #2. We passed thru the Bellatio via the tram from the Aria and it was a madhouse in the Bellagio lobby and garden area. We could not wait to get out of there. Also went across the street to Planet Hollywood shops. What a difference in cleanliness. I commented to my husband that we never saw grimy fingerprints on the Aria glass doors. We were always glad to return to the Aria. Would definitely stay there again and recommend it highly. We also did the Red Rock Canyon tour with a stop at the Spring Mountain Ranch. A very enjoyable day. The night helicopter flight over the strip was great. It took a while to finally get on the helicopter but they apologized for the delay and said it was due to a large family group in front of us. Which I believe as we saw a family of about 20.

It is architecture heaven in sin-city. Aria also has a promenade w/ a gelato shop, a cirque de solet theater for Viva Elvis which I mentioned in another review. It's great. Back to the list on the promenade: the pool is up there, its very grand indeed buffet is up there: best I've been to. you can go directly to the promenade from your elevator, unless you booked in the sky suites, which I havent been to. All in all the best hotel I've been to.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Resort\u201d", "Author": "WallaceR", "ReviewID": "UR75285952", "Content": "I have wanted to go to Vegas for a long time and at the last minute I booked a trip and got a great deal with Aria.

The girl on reception was bordering on rude, not a great first impression on arrival at this resort. I checked into my room, which had a great view, was clean and spacious. The property is huge and could do with some better signage to help you find your way around but once I spent a few hours wandering around I started to appreciate the beautiful modern building. Despite my reservations about service I found most of the staff to be welcoming and friendly particularly in City Bar and Todd English Pub, where the staff contribute to a great atmosphere, the staff looked like they were having a great time, while offering what can only be described as outstanding service! So much so I would love if job there! I also spent 3 days in Liquid Pool Lounge and 2 out of the 3 days were great, my host Sam, with servers Michael & TJ offered outstanding service. On the day that Sam was off the host was friendly enough but she spent most of the day wandering around complaining and really looked like she didn't want to be there.

We travel to Las Vegas two to three times a year and have stayed at a number of other hotels throughout the years. This was our first time staying at Aria and were pleasantly surprised by the hotel and accomadations, espescially after reading so many negative reviews. Check in/Check out: No lines for either and both were accomplished in under 5 minutes. (Weekday). Room: Standard Deluxe Room with one kingbed. Fairly small room but decor and electronics are all top of the line. The view from our room was not the greatest as the Aria sits back from the strip and view was somewhat obstructed by nearby City Center buildings. However, we don't spend alot of time in the room so having a spectacular view is not that big of a deal. Room was cleaned well each day at about 2pm and we never had any issues with room cleanliness, key cards, electronics, plumbing, etc. Casino: Good variety of slot machines in different denominations. We personally did not have much luck but did see a 25K win on a 5 dollar machine and a 8K win on a quarter machine. Table games are plentiful and they always had at least a couple of 10 dollar blackjack and Pai Gow tables available so they are not trying to price anyone out of playing (well at least they are comparable as what the other MGM properties are asking for minimum bets). Really enjoyed the layout of the casino floor and overall experience. Restaurants: Jean Georges Steakhouse- Probably the best steak I have ever had. Jean-Paul Philippe Pastry (Patisserie) Shop: Great selection of sandwiches and pastries and good quality. Buffet: Food was alright but did not like the layout of the buffet area. Felt like you were standing in a school cafeteria lunch line. Would walk over to the Bellagio if I was going to do a buffet again. Pool: Nice large area with lots of lounge chairs and palm trees. Did not have any issue obtaining chairs as is usually the case at most strip hotels. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay at Aria again. I am not sure if the large number of negative reviews of Aria are due to people having higher expectations for the hotel because it is new or what. I think Aria is comparable to Bellagio which is where we have been staying on our recent visits.

It is a gorgeous hotel inside and out. Staff is the friendliest I've ever seen anywhere in Vegas and I've been coming for the last 15 years. Arrived on Tuesday morning from the east coast and early check-in was a breeze. The room was at the very end of the hallway and it was worth the walk - spectacular, very modern with a gorgeous view of the mountains, the strip and Vdara. The king bed was plush and the LCD panel to control all the curtains, lights, etc. was fun to play with. The bathroom was very cool with the sunken tub behind the shower, double sinks, ample lighting. Water pressure in the shower could've been better but hey, we're in a desert. It was peaceful and quiet in our room. I loved it. Have read a lot of complaints about the long hallways in Aria. If you have an aversion to exercise, simply request a room close to an elevator when you check-in. Seems like a no brainer. Casino is very cool, very dark with a plethora of slots and table games. Poker room sucked - everybody was playing over at the Venetian. Don't expect free stuff, coupon books or comps like you get from the downtown casinos. Aria wants your money, plain and simple. No coffee makers in any of the hotel rooms, I'm assuming in all of LV. No Starbucks in Aria, had to go to Starbucks in Monte Carlo next door and it's not open 24-7. Or buy crappy weak coffee from one of the bars in Aria. More than a little irritating and only negative I found. Pools were exquisite with plenty of brand new loungers to choose from, lots of palm trees and shade. Very relaxing. Saw ZERO KIDS, which is a very high thumbs up. You also won't see many hotties here so if you're looking to hook up, it'll be with an old cougar at least twice your age. Got a lot of R&R at the pools every morning after feasting at the buffet, which was quite good. Two omelette stations, great selection of everything. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Sweet Chill has delicious ice lattes. Jean Phillipe was a one-stop shop for pastries, muffins and all the sweets I could ask for. Viva Elvis is the show at Aria by Cirque du Soleil. Pretty good but Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian was twice as good - it depends what you're into. Took the free tram to the Bellagio several times, which was very convenient. Walked through the shops to get to the strip. Bellagio hallways were always packed with people and it was VERY LOUD with noise. Saw some kids and more than a few baby strollers. Lots of maneuvering to get through Bellagio. Bring some worn in walking shoes or flip flops. Made the mistake of buying new shoes for this trip and got some blisters. Got extremely annoyed by the people on the strip handing out porn/lady of the evening business cards on the strip. They'd shove them in your face as you walked by. If I need a hooker, I know where to find them. Stayed half of the trip at Aria and half of the trip at the Golden Nugget downtown. I'll do a separate review for GN but in complete contrast to Aria, Nugget was a madhouse with kids screaming, running up and down the hallway in the casino and outside of our room in the Gold Tower. Searched for 30 minutes at the pool at GN for two lounge chairs (are you kidding me???). No one at the entrance to the pool was checking peoples' room keys...looks like GN is letting people off the street into their pool - nasty! Saw two women with 8 little kids hogging the modern seats next to the jacuzzi. Did not look like they belonged, if you know what I mean. Don't want to SEE or HEAR kids anywhere in LV. This is supposed to be where the adults go on vacation.

There is no flow in the design, it's like the designers got to do whatever they imagined. Not Vegas-like either...! One night when coming back to Aria, we saw the cleaning crew with duct tape and plastic bags on their hands and knees taping the floor. We asked them what they were doing and they said they have to taping off each of the matte granite tiles in order to polish the floor... which they do nightly. I can't believe they have to tape over the matte granite tiles and polish the shiny granite tiles, then go back over and hand clean each matte tile.... if you have been there you know, what a chore and the result of the bad design.

She's worked in the hotel industry, so I knew we had to get a 'decent' hotel in Vegas. I booked us a 2-queen deluxe suite. We got there around 6 pm on a Monday night to check in. The lines were long to check in and after waiting about 20 minutes, it was finally our turn. I had a feeling they were overbooked or something since it had taken so long in line. Turns out they were out of queens and the only thing they had was a king smoking room. UGH! After dealing with the desk clerk, who didn't seem very empowered, and having her check with the manager (who had a line of desk clerks waiting to help their customers too), we were finally able to get a non-smoking king room without the strip view. I'd rather have non-smoking than the strip, so we decided on that room. Fortunately, I didn't mind sharing a bed with my friend, but if it had been almost anyone else in my room, I would've been really annoyed to have to share a bed. When I asked why we didn't get a queen, she said \"When you book the room, you're entering your bed preference, but it doesn't guarantee you'll get that bed.\" We also asked for a discount and they gave us $10 off a night. I was hoping for more, but oh well. The room ended up being on the 5th floor and facing the strip, so the view wasn't quite as bad as I expected. Overall the room was very nice and spacious with plenty of closet space for all our stuff. We ate at the 24-hour restaurant for breakfast every day and it was good. A little pricey, but not bad. Everyone else in the hotel seemed friendly (besides the front desk staff) and I liked how it seemed a little classier than other hotels and it wasn't a bunch of 21 year olds running around either. The location was good. Easy to take the tram over to Bellagio or walk on the strip. We took taxis several times and I liked how they queue the taxis underneath the drop off area, so there was always one waiting, but not clogging up the front of the hotel at the same time.

We stayed at Bellagio last year and we were so impressed with their large bathroom with marble bathtub and large shower hall.

We really enjoyed lying on their heat stone beds and all their amenties. - The swimming pool area was large and we could find a quieter area for sun tanning. However, we did not like the loud party music on the Sunday afternoon. I guess some party-goers would enjoy that very much. - The restaurants on main lobby were very good.

We usually stay at the Bellagio, but thought we would give this new place a try. Big mistake. Obviously Aria started out to be one sort of hotel and because of the economic downturn, they decided to cut corners wherever they could. Let's start with the elevators. There must have been a whole bank of elevators cut from the final plans. Our room was 125 feet (we measured) from the elevators and we were not even close to the end of the hallway. I am all for exercise, but after a day in the Vegas heat or a night on the town, your room needs to be somewhat closer than a half a football field away. Housekeeping is very sporadic. We would leave the room at 10 am and return at 5 pm to find that the room had not been cleaned. We were shortchanged on towels on two different days. One day the room toilet stopped up and maintenance was called. They showed up over 2 hours later and did not clean up after themselves. Nothing like coming home to a filthy toilet at midnight. The rooms are supposed to be high tech and everything is controlled with a tv remote. This sounds good in theory, but turns out to be a pain when you have to scroll through a menu to turn the lights on or off or to open or shut the curtains. There is construction going on all around the Aria that is nowhere near complete. The constant beep-beep of trucks backing up starts just after dawn. The Aria is located back off the strip and it is difficult to get anywhere from there. During our stay several sidewalks were closed and you would actually have to walk a few blocks north to cross the street to go the the south strip! The Aria never let you know in advance which sidewalks were closed. This is information that could have easily been posted and saved patrons long walks in 110 degree Vegas heat. In fairness, I have to recommend the Aria buffet. It was the only thing at the hotel we liked. The choices are limited compared to other buffets, but everything was of high quality and the desserts were the best I have ever had anywhere in LV. My advice, however, is to avoid the Aria for lodging even if you get a great rate.

So when Aria offered a terrific deal on a Saturday night stay, and the airfare bargains coincided, it was a no brainer to give it a try. (Normally, a person with a relatively open schedule can avoid the crowded weekends -- why pay three times the price for the same room on a Saturday as a Tuesday?) Found the Self Park without problem, but the problems began with the walk from the Self-Park to the Hotel Lobby (at the opposite end of the property from where the parking lot connects). Dragging even lightweight carry-on bags that far and across so much carpet on the first floor in the July heat was . . . well, a drag. The staff at check-in seemed inexperienced and slow. We had reserved 2 queen beds non-smoking, but the woman who finally waited on us indicated those were all gone -- \"bedding and smoking are not guaranteed\". Well, okay, but if I'd wanted a King bed, I might have gone to the Trump Tower. She did manage to snag a smoking 2 queen that popped up on the system just before it disappeared. Hint to hoteliers: there's a BIG shortage of 2 bedded rooms in Las Vegas (and elsewhere), and not everyone who travels together wants to sleep together. Places like the Venetian have figured this out and charge more for 2 beds (and we gladly pay), but THEY SELL OUT quickly. Traipsed back to the elevators, dragging luggage on carpet and checked out the room. Pretty cool (see pix) looking -- though of course the actual temp was hot -- with a huge bathroom (double sinks and a huge shower with a large tub oddly placed in the shower enclosure). The glamor level was high, but the substance just didn't seem to be there. Cool electronic remote to control drapes, tv, lights, etc., but one of the reading lights over the bed never would work. Cushy beds, but frankly I've felt better back support on the more ordinary beds at the MGM Grand (and certainly the next night at the Hard Rock Hotel). It took a pretty long time to get the room cooled down adequately, but it did get reasonably cool by the time we went out to eat, etc. For all the glamor in the room's fittings, the toilet paper and tissues were blatantly cheap and crummy. Casino area / lobby / bar areas was really loud -- may be a function of Saturday and lots of people because it's new. Lots of restaurants -- Julian Serrano was a terrific choice. And we heard from a friend who was also not particularly enamored of the Aria that the pool area (which we missed by staying only one night) was its best asset.

I can find coffee, tea, fruits, cookies, juices through out the day, making it very convenient for me.

If you ever going there, do try the their famous butter cake! The pool was wonderful, we tried out the Liquid Pool, got food and drinks. The food was fantastic and the drinks was not deluded like some of the places I've stayed. Service was great, the surrounding was beautiful and the live DJ was the gem. If you are there on the weekend, do go to the Haze if you like the club scene, enjoy the pole dancing, amazing skill! Very entertaining. Music was awesome, danced until I couldn't stand straight.

When I received an offer of $79 for weeknights and $119 for Fri & Sat, plus food comps, I thought I would give them a try. Knowing that MGM is notorious for big properties that don't seem to have enough staff to accommodate their guests' needs (esp at peak times), I went into this expecting shortcomings - and I was right. Check-in (arrived at midnight) was simple. I was not offered any options on the room (view, etc) and really didn't care. I was however offered, since I was using a debit card, to not have any money authorized (charged) for incidentals. I thought this was really fascinating since I stay in approx 30 hotels a year and have never heard this before. It was explained to me that I could opt to have $130 a day (in addition to my room rate) charged to me or I could waive that and not have the ability to charge food, in-room movies or phone calls to my room. (This could be a good option for travelers on a tight budget.) There were very few food options at that time of night and I could not figure out, with all of their signage, brochures and interactive directories, where I could get something to eat at that hour, without asking a concierge. The room was beautiful and very high-tech. I won't go into details on all the features - you can prob get that on their website. The drama of having all of the lights slowly turn on and the curtains open as you first enter the room is very impressive. When the toilet would not stop running, it took close to 10 minutes from dialing the front desk to the time someone actually answered the phone. On Sunday, late afternoon (after peak check-out time) I had to watch let 2 packed elevators go before one came that had room for 1 more person. The buffet was lousy (see review) but Sirio's was excellent. Upon check-out, I wanted to check my bags at the bell desk and leave them until my flight, which was later that night. I walked up to the bell desk and was told I would have to go outside to do this. In 105-degree heat, this was the last thing I wanted to do. I went outside to find approx 10 people on line waiting to do the very same thing. This is really absurd when you're there because you're NOT LEAVING - why would you have to go OUTSIDE and stand there in the Vegas heat, only to come back inside. I really wanted to just grab a cab and go elsewhere to gamble, but I didn't. Most casino staff was very friendly. Hotel staff was friendly but made it clear that it was all going to be done \"by the book\" and they would not go out of their way to make any accommodations. Just a few more little annoying things: Wifi is not free anywhere in the hotel, use of computers in the business center is expensive, and you cannot just buy stamps, you have to give the clerk your postcards or mail and they can apply metered postage.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAria is a must stay!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jmr74", "ReviewID": "UR74372611", "Content": "Aria is one of the best hotels on the Las Vegas strip. My wife and I stayed there for five nights from August 1-6. We had a deluxe city view room which had good views of Monte Carlo, the city center, and Planet Hollywood. The bathroom had dual sinks, a shower/bath tub combo, and private toilet closet. If you can splurge a little more, then get the corner suite, it's pretty sweet. The remote system isn't as bad as people make it out to be, just work with it for a few minutes and it will be worth it. The bed is way to soft and we have a temper-pedic so we were ready to get back to our bed. The TV was nice and the his and hers closets were more than enough room for our clothes and shoes. The casino is a little dark but who cares, you are in Vegas and the scent of the hotel/casino is nice. It doesn't have any smoke smell anywhere, which is GOOD. The pools are nice but I'm not a real pool person, especially in August. When it's 106 outside, I'll be in the casino where it's cold. The buffet is pretty good and the service here was good. If you go for breakfast, get an omelette, real good. If you go for lunch, the mongolian beef and orange chicken were as good as it gets. The pizza was good as well. The desserts looked good but I don't really eat them so I can't give you a report on them. Viva Elvis is a must if you are an Elvis fan. The show is 90 minutes and very entertaining and worth every penny. We were in the third row dead center and it was awesome. Check out the Gold Lounge after or before the show, they give out 2-1 drink tickets. The only downfall of Aria was the Deuce Lounge. They are handing out 2-1 drink tickets everywhere in the casino. We accepted the voucher and decided to try it out. Big mistake. We ordered drinks with our 2-1 vouchers and twenty minutes later, still nothing. It was not crowded either, maybe ten other people in the club, big disappointment. So we left after sitting there for almost thirty minutes and no drinks, by the way, the drinks there are expensive, I'd say twenty bucks on average.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "TexasCrapsman", "ReviewID": "UR74368440", "Content": "We approached Aria with some apprehension due to the number of negative reviews but decided to stay here because of a great offer.

Hotel is very attractive--it is modern looking, but we did not sense that it was cold or impersonal. The room was very nice--not as large as the Wynn or Encore but plenty of room. Decor was very modern. Room technology was not a problem. We had a spectacular Strip view from our floor to ceiling windows. No noise from outside or from other rooms. The only down side to the room was seating: the two straight back upholstered chairs did not offer the comfort you get at the Wynn properties. Bath was smaller than the Wynn but very adequate. The bath has a separate shower and tub, but they are located in the same compartment. Showering and bathing simultaneously was a problem for a lady concerned about her hair. The water closet is separate, but the separating panels are obscure glass. You don't get the same amount of privacy that you get from a solid wall. The beds were very overrated. Staff was very efficient, helpful, and friendly. Housekeeping service was outstanding. Food service was great. Breakfast in the room was tasty and very quick.

On June 1, I made our reservation for a non-smoking room with two queen beds. I fully paid for the first night. When we checked in on Sunday, August 1st at around 5:30 p.m., we were told that we couldn't have a room with two beds. I questioned this, since I had reserved two beds and paid for the room two months prior. The man at the counter, who was named James, told me that according to their policy, our reservation was only a request and was not guaranteed! I explained to him that my husband has chronic severe back pain and terrible insomnia and that there was no way we could share a bed. After several minutes of discussion, James offered to have an extra twin bed put into our room. At this point, I had no other options, so I accepted his offer. One of Aria's main selling points for their rooms is their wonderfully comfortable beds. Unfortunately, even though I had a fully-paid reservation made two months in advance, I never got to sleep in one of those comfortable beds. James told me that the only way you can be sure to get a room with two beds at Aria is to make a reservation for four people, which adds $70 per night to the cost of your room. Even if I were traveling with my father, they would expect me to share a bed with him. What about if two straight guys are traveling together and are sharing a room to reduce their costs? At Aria, they might have to sleep in the same bed. I think it's important for people to realize this. I know that I will never stay at Aria again, even though there were things that we liked, because of this policy. I paid for a room that they gave to someone else and received an inferior room with absolutely no concessions made to us. And to top it all off, it was a smoking room, complete with an ash tray that hadn't even been cleaned after the previous guests left. We also had to endure three nights of smoke coming under the door from the adjoining room, since apparently our next door neighbors were smokers. Once again, Aria displayed complete disregard for our reservation. Not everything was bad, however. We had paid the additional charge for a deluxe view room, and it was nice, although nothing compared to what we've had before at Bally's, Monte Carlo, and even Excalibur. We were able to see the City Center complex, New York New York, and the MGM sign, although not the hotel. The technology in the room was fun, although we stood in a dark room for five minutes when we first arrived until we could turn on the lights. Forget their comments on the website about the curtains opening and the TV turning on to welcome you to the room. Nothing like that happened for us. The bathroom was large and functional, although without an exhaust fan, it was warm and humid all day long. The dressing area was nice, but it would have been much nicer with a mirror over the counter instead of a painting and some handy electric outlets. One other thing that has totally turned me off to the Aria is that soon after we arrived in the room, we noticed blood on the window right in front of the chairs. We cleaned it off ourselves with a wash cloth and then disinfected the area with hand sanitizer. That, along with the dirty ash tray and hair all over the bathroom floor by the toilet made us realize that our room was probably not nearly as clean as we would like it to be. Even though each room has it's own temperature control, it took two days of constantly running the A/C and keeping our curtains closed to get our room down to 72 degrees. Many times it was cooler in the hall than it was in our room. The tram that runs by the Aria is very convenient, and we were excited about using it. We rode it to the Bellagio several times and loved this amenity. However, when we first tried to locate it, we were extremely disappointed to discover that two Aria employees blatantly lied to us in an effort to get us to spend more time in their casino. We had watched the tram from our window the night before and knew that it made a stop on the north end of Aria. We left our hotel room and headed towards that end of the resort. When we were almost to the lobby, we asked an employee where to get on the tram, and she said we had to walk all the way through the casino to the south end of the resort to get on the tram at the Monte Carlo stop. I pointed out to her that the website said the tram stopped at Aria, and she said no, we had to walk to the other stop. We did as she suggested and stopped shortly to ask another employee, who also directed us to the tram stop on the south end. Once we got on the tram and rode it north to Bellagio, we discovered that the tram did indeed stop right where we thought it did, and we were, in fact, very close to that stop when the employee told us to head in the opposite direction. It became obvious to us that the employees were instructed to direct guests to the more distant tram stop, because that insured that they would walk through the entire casino and hopefully stop to gamble along the way. As I mentioned earlier, my husband deals with significant back pain, and we didn't appreciate the long, unnecessary walk that we were subjected to by a resort policy that forces their employees to lie to their guests. We ate at the buffet, but I'll put that in a separate review under restaurants. I will say that the pools were a highlight of our stay. There are three beautiful pools, and we had no trouble at all getting lounge chairs each afternoon. The pool area was very clean and the water was the perfect temperature. We really felt that the pools and surrounding area were the nicest we've experienced at an Las Vegas hotel. The maids were very slow in cleaning the rooms. There were many rooms that still had their service lights lit at 6 p.m. each day. We were surprised that our maid saw us leave our room one morning because she was working right next door, and yet when we returned to our room three hours later, it had still not been serviced. The internet is $15 a day in your room, but they don't advertise that. I had to call them to find out. Also, the signs along the strip aren't very good. I believe one employee we talked to use the word \"atrocious\". Our first attempt at finding the self parking led us to the back of the hotel. I assume the signs will improve once the construction is completed. The elevators were very efficient. That's quite an accomplishment, considering how many guest rooms there are. If you are lucky enough to get the room you reserved at Aria and have it be clean, you will probably have a pleasant stay there. The architecture is breathtaking, and the TV and other technology in the room were very enjoyable. Unfortunately, their very poor reservations policy will prevent us from staying there again.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat new addition to Vegas\u201d", "Author": "msmall", "ReviewID": "UR74089901", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Aria from July 25th-27th.

I was told by the wait staff that I could take them up to the kitchen staff and they would be glad to warm them for me but it just seemed like such a bother. The cheesecake, however, was simply divine. The staff at Aria were exceptionally pleasant and courteous. Anytime we had a question about anything, staff were readily available and seemed more than happy to give us an answer. The valet service was a little slower than we had been accustomed to at Vdara but then Aria is a much larger hotel so that is to be expected. All-in-all I would definitely stay at Aria again.

I've gone to Vegas once per year for the past 6 years. I've stayed (in order) at Excalibur, Imperial Palace, Imperial Palace (again), Paris, MGM Grand, and Aria - the latest being for March Madness with my girlfriend, my friend and his wife. I will no longer stay at the budget places such as the IP but I am big on keeping the fixed costs to a minimum. Here are the bullet points of all you need to know vs. what everyone else wrote - I'll save my complaint (a big one) for the end in case you don't want to read my whining! - Massive hotel with a lot of empty space. - Yes it's a dark casino but it is not a big deal. - I had no problem with the remote control or the maid service as some have cited. - The beds ARE great. - I attended the brunch buffet and it wasn't the Bellagio, but it was good. We ate at nice restaurants outside of City Center because frankly the value didn't seem to be there. - The mall (Crystals) is nice but upscale - you often cut through on your walk to Aria. - You walk almost as far to the tram as to walking to the Bellagio or Monte Carlo directly. - Yes you have to walk through the casino floor dragging your luggage to get to the elevators. - The slots, table games, and poker room are all good not great. I want to say $15 minimum blackjack. - Anyone that wrote on here \"the slots are tight\"... well, let's just say don't let their poor luck sway your judgement. - Check-in is absolutely and utterly the worst that has ever existed at any hotel in the entire world! It takes people 15 minutes to check in and the lines are random. It's really a customer service, hotel check-in and complaint center all rolled into one. Now here's my inexcusable experience: - We have 4 people (2 couples) in a room so we require 2 double queen beds. I had read on trip advisor MANY people saying they ordered 2 queens to be stuck into 1 king bed. I couldn't let this happen with 4 people and would pay $100 more to be certain this wouldn't happen. So I took steps... 1) I called to confirm the two double queens. It can't be guaranteed but I needed it to be. They said Iw ould get the two queens. 2) I called the conceirge and explained I was thinking of switching to another hotel because I didn't have confidence they would honor our two double queens since my flight was arriving late (11pm Friday night). I received a response \"please don't change your reservation, you can be absolutely certain that we will do everything in our power to ensure you have a pleasant stay and we understand the two beds is part of that. I printed this email and brought them with me. So we get there around 11:45pm. Took FIFTY minutes to get to the receptionist. Sure enough, sorry we need to put you in a king room. I was so aggravated. I showed them the email and how I predicted this whole thing. Had to wait 15 minutes for the manager, and in the meantime the receptionist can't help anyone else. Gridlock! I am pretty good at negotiating in cases like this and not just being a jerk about everything. Here's what I was able to muster.... still inadequate, and let me tell you it took a lot of conversation to get this far. - We would get two separate king-bed rooms for the night. They would charge us $109 additional for the second room and I could do nothing to get out of this. I got a lousy $50 food credit I used on the buffet. Then, after a fight, basically, I got them to guarantee we get a double-queen room tomorrow by 12pm or else we stay in the separate rooms with that 2nd room comped for the remaining two nights. Sure enough, they had our room ready by 11am. After an exhausting flight from Boston, I look at my watch and it's 1:20am. That's right folks, ONE HOUR and FORTY minutes to check in and pay an extra $109 than our agreed upon rates. So, yeah, I'll let you decide for yourself. For myself, I will never stay at Aria again simply for the reason that Vegas hotels are so competitively prices and I keep getting comp room offers from Harrah's casinos.

The reason I did not give this a better review is the poor service. Due to the fault of the hotel we were forced to move after 2 nights of our 4 night stay. We got minimal help with the move and were still expected to help carry our bags. This took an hour away from our visit. They did upgrade our room (only to the next level) but it would not have hurt them to give us a bottle of wine or a snack plate. The next morning, I emerged from the shower to find out that the hair dryer was missing. I was getting ready to go out with my son who lives in Vegas and was in a hurry but an hour later, I still did not have a hair dryer. Again it was their mistake but they just didn't care. They told me they would bring up a dryer when they had a chance. Not acceptable service. Checking out was slow and their solution was to place someone in the line to tell everyone they did not really have to go to the desk to checkout. Well there are circumstances when you do not trust them to get the bill right so you have to stand in line. This is one of those times.

Very contemporary design, but still very comfortable. We got upgraded (for free) to a corner suite for our anniversary, which was a nice surprise. I suspect they did this b/c it was relatively empty compared to the other big hotels/casinos/shopping centers that we visited (like Cesar's and Belagio), but we were fine with that! I suspect it's kind of empty in the casino (again, fine with me) because all of the shopping isn't open just yet, but it's going to be every bit as nice as Cesar's Forum when everything is open... My wife does the shopping, so I wan't bothered at all. The pools (all three) were pretty damn nice. Lots of tall palms. Seems like they would have made one of them adult only, but it the back one had almost no kids every day were were there, so it wasn't a big deal. On our first night, after we went out for dinner, the guest services manager had them take chocolate covered strawberries and coconut pastries to our room. They were delicious. Another GREAT surpise. The only things I can complain about: (1) the wi-fi wasn't free once we had to \"downgrade\" from our corner suite to the regular room. (We decided to stay an additional night, but they wouldn't let us have the corner suite at the AWESOME $109 a night that we were paying -- it was supposed to be $325 a night. So we moved to what they call the deluxe room facing to the west, away from the strip. It was $129, but still very well worth it. We stayed on the 52nd story. ASK FOR THE TOP! Great views, even without the Strip!) I know you don't go to Vegas to use Internet, but we had to use it for some school/work issues. If it's free at a $69 Best Western, the City Center can spring for it, too. (2) The best, while very plush, was too soft and the down top was very hot... However, given the fact that you can control the air (and curtains, TV, radio and everything else) from a remote next to the bed made it easy to turn the air down to 60. I got my wife a massage at the spa, and she loved it. Spend the money, fellas. It's worth it. All in all, we had friendly service at a great value.

There was a staff member near the check-in who was directing visitors to the appropriate desk. There was hardly any wait and we were checked-in and up in our room within 10 minutes. The reservation included an upgrade to a City View and we had requested 2 queen beds. Walked in and were greeted by name on the screen and the blackout drapes opening. Room 12-026 was exactly what we had requested, however, it wasnt much of a view as reported previously about the City View rooms . We also found that it was a LOOONG walk to our room and we really couldn't see us doing it every day. A call to the Front Desk to ask for a room higher up and closer to the elevator and they quickly and pleasantly changed our room. However, they could not provide us with 2 queens, so we decided we would just a share a king bed. The room key was changed automatically and the new room 16-054 was much better. It was only 6 doors down from the elevators, but we never heard anything from either the hallway or our neighbors. Rooms are very luxurious although the electronic gadgetry takes some getting used to. Rooms have 2 wardrobes with plenty of hangers each. There were also robes and plenty of towels. In fact, we liked the robes so much, that I bought one to bring home ($60 at Elements downstairs). Bed is extremely plush and soft which we thought would be a problem as we both prefer a harder mattress, but we both agreed that we had never slept better. Also, the safe is not apparent and I would not have known where to look if I had not read in TA previously that it was the bottom drawer of the nightstand. Mini-fridge is fully stocked and very expensive ($8 for large bottle of Fiji water... ouch!). Decided we would just buy anything we needed elsewhere. The pool was very nice and not crowded at all and no towel games were played. We found the best place was the pool on the right hand side which had both shade from the hotel and umbrellas. There were plenty of servers and prices weren't too ridiculous $14 for a 12 oz drink. Cafe Breeze at the pool had a good selection and was reasonable. I played some slots, but found they weren't really paying out, although that was true of all the casinos. I did get a couple of good payouts at Venetian and Bill's but they were the exception. The one thing I found missing, but didn't realize it until after I had been to the Bellagio, is that there is nowhere to sit down either in the lobby or elsewhere in the hotel outside of the lounges and restaurants. The Bellagio has small tables and chairs spread out throughout the main floor which allow for conversation and a rest for your feet.

I had made my reservation months before online and when we arrived around 10 pm there were long lines to check in. There was no organizatioin as some lines moved quickly and others did not. Unfortunately I was in one that did not. When some officious looking woman in uniform came over, I thought she was going to do something, but instead she shyly told us to not congregate but make sure we were in line. Thanks. The gentleman in front of me apparently had some issue that required several trips to a stern manager, who kept shaking his head no. I would've appreciated it if the manager would have stepped in, dealt with the guy and thus sped up the line! Very quickly I was becoming unimpressed. When I finally made it to the desk clerk, I got a half hearted greeting, and when I asked what that was all about (as in you are aware I've been waiting now 20 minutes for him to finish) she quickly replied \"sorry he wanted to change his room.\" Then she tells me that they are booked and can't give me the Deluxe room I reserved (and consequently paid for) but one on a much lower \"smoking optional\" (come on smoking optional???) floor. She'd even take $50 off the rate. Not just no but heck no. I could have and would have stayed at the Palazzo, the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood or any other hotel on the Strip for that price. Which is what I'll do next time. Smoking optional? What does that mean but it's a smoking floor? Shame shame shame. So discussions with another \"manager\" and instead of two beds we can get one in a \"deluxe room\" which I should've have been offered to begin with! I had wasted already and hour of what was a brief visit to Las Vegas so I asked for a late check out and was told no. Housekeeping knocked on our door at 9 am. That will teach me not to set the \"privacy\" switch! I am not what the purpose of knocking was really because either the room was vacant or we didn't want to be disturbed, in all places Las Vegas at 9 am! The view was great -- if not exactly as depicted online. The room was cool but by then I was too tired to mess with all the gadgets. I liked that we could hook up our iPods to the sound system and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. The bathroom was nice. I wish I had better things to say about our stay. Check out was efficient, and I got a mechanical \"sorry\" when I said our stay was disappointiing. When I heard that they are struggling, it was easy to see why.

The lobby lounge has complimentary snacks and drinks, including mini Fiji and full size San Pellegrino waters. The whole staff is very warm and efficient. It is simple to get to the casino from a door on the lobby or promenade levels; both are either guarded or use a lock and need your room key to access. The complimentary limo transports to and from the airport eliminate the need for a rental car or taxi. My only complaint is that there is no Starbucks in Aria and the Roasted Bean is insanley expensive. There also is no food court for a quick bite or pick-me-up. I highly reccomend Jean Pilippe Patisserie for anyone with a sweet tooth or wants a light lunch or breakfast.

The room was new and well-thought out- sorta. I liked the tub/shower combo with the tub in the back and shower in front. My view was toward the west, with a view of Vdara and Harmon street. The much-lauded control panel was more annoying than helpful. Very big, heavy and wired- An iPad it's not. Want to turn off a lamp? Go to lighting, then guestroom, then choose the light you want to turn off, then push that button. Video checkout was interesting (see photo). They want you to input your email address with the tiny TV remote control (not the bedside control panel)! Are you kidding? All in all, I think Aria is a flop. This is not a Vegas hotel. Feels like you're in a large chain hotel in any big city in the world. Part of that is because you are so far back from the excitement and lights of the LV Strip.

I was still bracing myself for the worst. I have been to vegas several times before but decided since its the newest hotel on the strip, why not? The one major thing that I had a problem with throughout my stay was the STAFF! The front desk lady was so condescending and insisted there were no double bed rooms and only king sized bed rooms for non smoking. I got angry at that because how was it possible that on a monday night after the huge weekend rush, there would be no two bed rooms available. She said the only one she could offer was in a smoking room. I could tell she just had a bad attitude. She stuck us on a stinky floor with a crappy view of the back. The reason I was annoyed by the stench was because for such a new hotel, the smell of smoke residue is unbearable. The other thing was the cleaning staff.

The new City Center on the Las Vegas strip is an amazing grouping of hotels, shopping plaza and condominiums.

We checked into the Aria from the north valet (valet is free and convenient) which is quite a walk to the main lobby but close to the room elevators. First thing of note: the staff at the Aria \u2013 quite frankly, I believe everyone we encountered \u2013 was courteous, polite and helpful. They must work hard to find the best of the best. With that, check-in was fairly quick and the reception associate helped get us adjoining rooms on a high floor. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous and over-the-top. The beds are comfortable, the TV had a ton of options for music and TV (not that you want to be in the room that long), the bathroom with a separate shower and large tub was awesome and best of all \u2013 the room can be controlled from a computer panel. And at night, you can hit the \u201cgoodnight\u201d button next to the bed and it will close the curtains, turn off the TV and turn down the lights. Amazing technology.

There are plenty of bars to grab a cocktail and enjoyed Union (good happy hour prices) and Sage. Note about prices: the nice places in Vegas are expensive. Don\u2019t be fooled by the low room prices of any of the top end hotels; the food and drink will be on par (both price and quality) with a city like NY. For the kids, we took them to McDonald\u2019s in the food court at the Monte Carlo (which is attached to Aria) and they were thrilled. The casino has the games you would expect and there were $10 blackjack tables available throughout our stay, which is becoming harder to find. I guess $5 is gone for good from these nicer casinos. I have stayed in about 20 different Vegas hotels and this rates in the top 2 (along with the Venetian) and because of the newness, I will give it the top spot.

I left Las Vegas on yesterday and couldnt wait to write this review (I almost wrote the review before leaving!). The City Center as a whole is gorgeous, and Aria is definitely top notch. I booked a room under a Camp Vegas promo that included a $50 resort credit (for food and beverage only), free t-shirt and cap, and a $30 voucher to be used in the spa/fitness center. The hotel location is great and they have built a walk way that will put you right on the corner of the PH property. Or if you go the other direction (south), you can cross the street in front of Monte Carlo. There is also a shuttle that runs from City Center to other hotels (we caught the shuttle the first night to Treasure Island, cost was only $8. Monorail also runs through City Center, but did not take advantage of that). Upon walking into the hotel, there was a hint of a vanilla scent coming through the vents, so the place smelled wonderful (it wasnt an overpowering smell to us as other reviewers have indicated, but everyone's sense of smell is different :)). Check in was quick and painless and the attendant who assisted me was great (thank you Sadhika!!!). We were even upgraded to the 23rd floor which had amazing views of the pool area and the mountains. When you walk into the room, it comes alive, and that was cool! The curtains automatically opened, the tv came on, and so did the lights. There is a remote that controls the entire room which we didnt find to be very difficult to use, but we also love electronics sooooo.....we were in heaven:) The bed was so comfortable, you could literally lay in it all night and all day (you can even purchase one when you get back home, how cool is that??) Bathroom was huge with double sinks, seperate space for tub/shower and a glass w/c. Overall, room was great!! Only word of caution: DO NOT TOUCH ANY OF THE SNACKS IN THE TRAY ON THE TABLE, THEY ARE SENSORED AND IF YOU JUST PICK IT UP TO LOOK AT IT, YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CHARGED!!! Ate at \"The Buffet\" twice for breakfast and once for lunch and the food was amazing ($14.95 pp for breakfast/$19.95 pp for lunch/dinner). So many choices to choose from (the crab legs were delish!!!) and the staff was very friendly. Also ate at \"Cafe Vettro\" twice (open 24hrs) which was also good (buffalo wings are to die for :)). We also visited the adult pool lounge (Liquid) which was very cool. They were even giving away day passes for ladies so it was free (and only $20 for guys, which isnt bad). Its a more intimate environment but lots of energy in there. It is tucked away so you almost dont know that the general pool area is on the other side of the wall. And when you visit the general pool area, you cant even hear the music coming from Liqiuid. The water felt great and the food was good (a little pricey, but hey, its Vegas!!). We are not big gamblers but did spend a little time in the casino and had a great time. You can hardly smell the evidence of people smoking, and that was great. We also visited Crystals, it was nice walking through the different shops. There is a little place in Crystals called \"The Cup\" that makes delicious smoothies (if you go, try the Mango and Lemon Cream smoothie, I promise you will be hooked :)). Also ate at Wolfgang Pizzeria and it was good as well :) We had planned on going to the night club \"Haze\" inside Aria, but instead ended up going to TAO in the Venetian. However, Haze looks like a really nice club and is probably a nice place to hang out for an evening of good music and good fun :) There are some charges that I have seen other people mention that Aria does implement, like the internet ($15/day, i believe) for example as well as the fitness center ($??). I was there for fun however, so it didnt bother me about those fees, I hadnt planned one using either of those services anyways. If I had to say one bad thing about Aria, it would be that they charge $130 PER DAY for incidental charges (this seems a bit high to me, why not charge ppl as they incurr the charges as supposed to charging someone before they have purchased anything??). Please use a credit card as they will only authorize the transaction and as long as you dont mess up the room or charge anything to the room, they will remove the hold when you checkout. If you use a debit card (which they discourage, but can be done), its a hard transaction, so they will take the money out (if you stay 4 days like we did, thats $520!!!, and who knows the how long it may take to get your money back). This was my third trip to Vegas in the last 3 years, and I definitely plan on going back to visit Aria (more than likely next year since Ive been going every year!). The City Center is a city in itself and while staying there, we sometimes had to remind ourselves that we were in Vegas! You really dont have to leave the property for anything if you dont want to. I like the idea of staying at a different place each time, but after the experience that we had at Aria, the question is not \"IF\" we will return, but WHEN!!!

I go often and I have seen the Aria under construction for months. Well I went on the website and since they were running a midweek stay discount I decided to check it out. Well it was so much more than I expected. Check in was simple most of the counter was manned so check in was a breeze. We had booked a deluxe room (which is their standard room). Upon entering the room the electric shades opened and music started playing WOW!!!. The TV has your name on the screen and many options of delightment! The TV, lights, shades are controled by a control panel located next to bed. The bonus is that if you don't get all of the high tech stuff there is a regular remote too for the TV. The bathroom is very hip and functional. I cant say enough about the bed except WOW. It felt as if it was one huge fluffy pillow. Even a gentleman on the elevator said wait until you lay on your bed!! It was soft but comfortable I didnt even feel my husband get in or out of it. That's how it engulfed you. We had a room close to the elevators becasue the halls are EXTREMELY long. As promise from the woman at check in there was no noise. Our view was behind the building looking at the mountains which was just fine for us. The casino was lively and fun. The stores there are very expensive but what would you expect from such high end designers. We did partake of the breakfast buffet but bonus it was just before they started the lunch buffet so we had both for the price of breakfast. I like how they don't close the buffet but just transform the different foods at the appropriate time. Again great service there too. We self parked which was an easy in and out. Check out was quick and correct !! I have stayed at many of the high end hotels for a lot more money and haven't had an experience like this one.

Please forward this to management, regional managers, if any. I stayed at Aria this past weekend from July 23rd, 2010 through July 25th, 2010. I want to share with you my experience. Let me note, this is my second time at your hotel. The first time I stayed in your hotel was in March 23, 2010. Let me also say, I did NOT want to stay at Aria this past weekend because I had complimentary rooms at the Venetian. However, my wife loved Aria soooo much from our first stay, she wanted to come back. And I want to stress that I shouldn't have listened to my wife. We checked in on Friday around 5:30pm. I thought it was going to be a good trip from the get go. The valet line was running smoothly and there was no line at the checkin/registration section. We found our room 16-262 easily, which was by the elevator. Unlike our previous stay, we were placed far from the elevator and on the right side of the \"split.\" Entered our room and as expected, the curtains opened, the lights turned on, the.....the tv was frozen. My wife unpacked while I kept turning the TV on and off. Pressing the channel up and down. Pressing menu, guide, menu, etc. Finally after about 7 minutes, I called the front desk. Told them about my TV. The lady at the front desk said she would said some one up to fix it. The lady said it was probably a glitch. It happens often. \"Wow,\" I thought to myself. \"This sucks.\" \"This happens often?\" Something a guest and a possible future guest shouldnt be hearing. Being a guy, seeing the TV turn on with my name on it is probably the thing I anticipated the most. Forget the lights turning on, forget about the curtains. I want to see my name on the TV! But no, no name. No nothing. Just a white \"Aria\" written on the bottom right on a black background. About 10 minutes past. Still no one came up. My wife wanted to go downstairs. I wanted to wait for someone to fix the TV. Anyways I listened to my wife again and we went down. I dont know if someone had to come to the room to fix the so called glitch or if someone could do it remotely. I was reluctant to leave the room. But I didn't anyway. When we came back, the TV was on, working normally. We got ready that night to enjoy the nightlife. My wife was rather mad because there was no outlet by the large mirror next to the closet. She wanted to do her hair and makeup. But wanted to sit down and be extremely close to the mirror. She kept getting frustrated because usually at home, she sits down to do her hair and makeup. Because she was getting frustrated, she was getting me frustrated. In comparison, Venetian has a separate vanity with a chair in all their rooms and suites. Let me note that the first time we were there, we didn't go out to a club, so this is essentially the first time my wife has had an experience with the vanity. The more I heard her complain, the more I WISHED we had stayed at the Venetian. First, the TV, now no outlet, no chair for the vanity. So both my wife and I found flaws at this hotel. Something we didn't experience in March. We eventually got into a fight. I called the front desk to ask for a roll-away bed. The person at the front desk said there was a charge of $35/night! What? Are you kidding me? I said nevermind. Of note, I wanted a roll-away bed just in case I might not want to stay in the bed. I heard my wife keep complaining about how she cant do her makeup right. Her hair doesn't curl properly. I told my self I Needed a roll away bed. I was getting irritated already. I tried to call housekeeping to avoid the $35/night charge. I couldn't even believe there was a charge. Venetian does not charge. At this point I felt, this would be the LAST TIME I would stay here. Housekeeping said they would transfer me to the front desk. Oh geez. I said nevermind. Just give me more pillows and blankets. I rearranged the two chairs to make a \"bed\". At least it was better than the floor. I could hear my wife, still irritated. I tried the front desk one more time. I just couldn't take it. I told my wife SHE wanted to stay at this place. I wanted to goto Venetian! Poor service, no TV, cant even get a roll away bed! She wanted to goto Venetian now. I told her we were already here so lets just deal with it. I called the front desk again to try to get a roll away bed. Surprisingly, the gentleman I spoke to said ok. Wow. I was shocked. I ordered room service. Got a burger again like last time. The best thing I noticed from both this trip and the last was your ROOM SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH! Food is awesome. Food is hot. The delivery people are kind. However, it doesn't take away the tv was broken, that there are no outlets by the mirror, that the vanity mirror didn't have a chair, that there is a charge for a roll away bed. At lease the food was good. The next day, we went out. Picked up our car from valet. When we returned about 2 hours later, we pulled into the valet. My wife and I were sitting in our car for over 5 minutes. I could see the line of cars getting longer in my rear view mirror. There was no one directing traffic. A car pulled all the way left and was able to get valet service faster. Unfortunately, I was too close to the car in front of me and I couldnt' go to the left hand lane. About 7 minutes had passed now. There was still no one directing traffic. I managed to pull left hoping I could get faster service. I sat in the car with the AC on and the valet runners kept going by me. I decided to go out to try to track one of the valet runners down to get assistance. At least 3 runners passed me up. Let me note that they did see me waiting but kept going. I decided to speak up and finally one lady turned around and helped me. This was ridiculous. No organization. No direction. 10 minutes waiting for valet in 110 degree heat! We ate at the Aria buffet for lunch with the complimentary buffet for 2 at around 4PM that day. The cashier was rude. I said I have comp buffet and would like to charge it to my room. She looked at me with strange stare and repeated what I just said. I said \"yes\". I would like to charge it to my room using the comp buffet. She asked for my room number and last name. I told her. She said, \"Christopher Salazar?\" I said, \"yes\". She didn't ask to see my ID, which I thought was odd. She didn't ask for my players card. The way she asked questions and the look on her face was very un-customer service like. We went out again that night (July 24). We came back around 5am again. Ordered room service. Again, room service was outstanding. Probably the best thing thoughtout this stay I have noticed. I checked out via the control4 panel at a little before 12PM. Checkout was easy, just like my last stay. However again, the Valet service was terrible. Waiting for about 40 minutes in the heat. The valet runners had to yell out the names of the people waiting for their cars. I told my wife maybe a loudspeaker system would make things more efficient. To sum things up, this is the WORST Vegas hotel experience I've had. I'm 30 years old. I've stayed at almost every MGM/Mirage property in Vegas. From Circus Circus when I was 8 years old. Later on Excalibur, Luxor, New York, New York, Mirage and Treasure Island when I was a child and teenager with my parents. To more recently Luxor, Bellagio, MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay in my adult years. I have never had a problem with valet, customer service. In general the problems I experienced this past weekend. In fact, I felt so strongly terrible about this weekend I decided to write this letter. I never complain (except to my wife.) I enjoy MGM/Mirage hotels and I was looking forward to spending time at MGM/Mirage more often, especially when my kids are a little bit older to enjoy the experience I had when I was a child. But, again, this one weekend may have changed my mind completely about the standards MGM/Mirage I thought carried. My income isn't very large but I do enjoy gambling. And I do enjoy Vegas. Im from Los Angeles so it is the perfect get away for me. Enjoy Vegas better than San Diego, San Francisco, Napa Valley, or Santa Barbara. My Players Club profile doesn't show I've been putting a lot of money into MGM Mirage because like I've mentioned many times, Venetian offers me complimentary rooms. The Wynn as well offered me complimetary rooms as recent as 2008. Not discounts or \"casino rate\" but actually complimetary. Of course, I would spend my hard earned money somewhere else where the customer feels welcomed and taken cared of. Im not looking for complimetary rooms. I just want the staff educated in customer service. Educate them to take care of their customers. Work on the valet service to provide better efficiency. I come to Vegas 2-4 times a year. Like I mentioned this is my second time this year with a strong possibilty coming a 3rd time in the fall. Customer service at the Aria from July 23, 2010 through July 25, 2010 was extremely poor. Im in the medical field so I know what customer service is about. I hope you strongly take this letter seriously. Thank you.

It's hard to capture the essence of a new hotel experience in one review, but here goes. Overall, I was very impressed. It was very evident that MGM Mirage took a great deal of time and effort to design the Aria Hotel and Casino, while keeping a clear eye on the future of Las Vegas. In many ways, it\u2019s years ahead of the other hotels. In some ways, this helps; in other ways, this hurts. Aria is the centerpiece of the MGM Mirage City Center Project \u2013 an extremely ambitious plan to design a full-feature, high-end residence and resort complex in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. Unfortunately, during construction, the U.S. economy experienced the worst downturn since the Great Depression, and MGM was forced to sell Treasure Island just to keep the CC project going. Along with Aria, City Center features the Vdara, Mandarin Oriental and Harmon Hotels; as well as the Veer Towers condominium complex. But Aria is the centerpiece: it was designed to bring tourists in, as well as prospective buyers to the CC condo residences (the sales of which, are not going well at all). All in all, Aria is a pretty amazing place. Since it\u2019s the \u201ccenter\u201d of City Center, Aria is set back from the Strip quite a ways, which is a bit of an inconvenience for normal foot traffic visitors. You definitely get the feel that you\u2019re \u201cin the middle of something\u201d rather than being \u201cpart of something\u201d \u2013 at least in my humble view. Kind of like being one of the first houses in a new development that very few others have moved into yet: a little uncomfortable at first, but eventually (hopefully), it will all \u201cfill out\u201d in time. There\u2019s a cool tram that connects Aria with Monte Carlo to the south and Bellagio to the north, which definitely saves on walking time. CHECK-IN: It took me about 20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon, which isn\u2019t bad at all by Vegas standards. Very good overall. WARNING: This hotel was built for the convention market (which has never materialized as MGM originally envisioned), which is based on solo occupants/guests. As such, the vast majority of Aria\u2019s rooms feature king beds. There are a minimal number of double queen rooms available. If you \u201creserved\u201d a double queen room, they hotel staff will quickly remind you that a twin queen room is a \u201cREQUEST\u201d only \u2013 and purely subject to the availability on the day of check-in. In the 10 minutes that I was actually at the check-in desk, I heard of no less than three separate parties that were irate that the twin queen rooms that they \u201creserved\u201d were not available. It was \u201crollaway bed world\u201d for these guests (in a king room that can\u2019t properly accommodate a rollaway bed in the first place), and that reality seems to have ignited most of the negative reviews of Aria. ADVICE: If you absolutely must have a twin queen room, book with a different hotel. Otherwise, you may be very disappointed when you are told it\u2019s not available. STAFF/CUSTOMER SERVICE: The hotel staff was plentiful, and very attentive. Not sure why all the negative comments about poor staff service. They were \u201call over me\u201d (in a good way) at check-in, and throughout my stay. One night while I was playing the slots, a hotel security person asked me \u201cis that your dollar bill sitting next to the slot machine?\u201d I told him that I was waiting for the cocktail waitress to return with my drink order, and he politely said \u201cVery Good, Sir,\u201d and moved on. I guess he was making sure I wasn\u2019t throwing my money around (kind of ironic, since Aria\u2019s sole purpose is to take my money, along with every other Vegas casino). Aria has staff everywhere you look at this place. The security guys looked like they are UFC/MMA athletes. Very polite, but totally \u201cloaded and ready to roll\u201d if you ever want to try any \u201cfunny stuff.\u201d Kind of like an old-school Italian father with his precious virgin daughter; or a married new-home owner having his first Super Bowl Party with his bachelor slob buddies. Guest elevators were attentively watched by security personnel to make sure you presented a room key before they would let you in. Overall, I got the impression that MGM Mirage considers Aria their crown jewel, and they are guarding it very carefully. Have fun\u2026.but \u201cwatch yourself.\u201d They are also very attentive to the overall look and neatness of the property. When \u201cslot gaming,\u201d as soon as I got up from a slot machine, the staff very quickly pushed the seat back in tight against the machine just as though I got up from the dinner table. Finally, although MGM would never say that they discourage smokers, ash trays are hard to find throughout the casino (which could be a good or bad thing, depending upon whether you light up). Either way, there is no smell of smoke at all throughout the casino, despite the fact that many patrons are \u201cheating up.\u201d There will never be a non-smoking casino in Vegas, but this is probably the best one to effectively remove smoke from the air. Not sure how they do it, but they do it. CASINO: Amazing layout. The hotel has a slight vanilla smell that you notice when you first arrive, but quickly fades as you get used to it. Unlike the extreme and excessive \u201cperfumery\u201d of the Venetian and Palazzo. You arrive at Aria, you smell the vanilla immediately, and then it kinds of disappears into a pleasant area of your cerebral cortex (which I\u2019m sure MGM engineers worked for months to perfect). The overall \u201cbreathing atmosphere\u201d is perfect. The design is \u201ctotal contemporary elegance:\u201d very modern d\u00e9cor with unique artwork, lighting, and wall treatments. The pronounced colors seem to be earth tones of brown, black, gold, silver, and burgundy. Some people consider it \u201ctoo dark,\u201d but I thought it was superbly designed and presented. The gaming tables were the usual fare. The slot machines, I must admit, are the loosest that I encountered in my Vegas trip. I tried a number of casinos during my stay (MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Monte Carlo, Bellagio, and Venetian), and I definitely made out best at Aria. Slot payouts are a more closely guarded secret in Vegas than the Coca Cola recipe is in Atlanta, but I think MGM Mirage is \u201cloosening\u201d their slots at Aria to get more people to come visit (just like the Maloof Brothers openly admit that they do to get you to get off the Strip and come to The Palms). Of course, MGM would never admit that. But consider the simple fact that MGM is offering $400/night rooms for $100 just to get people to come to Aria. That should tell you something. As soon as the economy turns, the room rates will go straight up. One other thing. A lot of people have said that there aren\u2019t many penny machines, but that\u2019s not true. Many Aria machines give you the chance to change the denomination from one cent to two cents to five cents. In addition, for the penny machines, you can actually change the actual electronic games on the same slot machine. I have never seen this at any other casino. I\u2019m not talking about electronic card games that allow you to change from \u201cDueces Wild\u201d to \u201cFive Card Draw\u201d to \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em.\u201d I\u2019m talking about animated penny slot machines. You can go from \u201cArctic Wolf\u201d to \u201cGrand Monarch\u201d to \u201cSavannah\u201d to \u201cCats\u201d on the very same machine with the push of a button \u2013 and you can also change the betting denomination. The new game program loads, and all of the graphic artwork changes on the \u201cheadboard\u201d and gameboard and betting keys to reflect the new game. You could literally play five different penny games on the same machine in the course of a half hour. I have never seen that before at any other casino, and I think that\u2019s an amazing innovation. I also think the new machines at Aria have greatly simplified the \u201cFree Play\u201d and \u201cPoint Play\u201d process for MG Players Club card holders. Very, very easy to input your PIN information and know exactly where you stand on your point balance. Much easier than the old pushbutton \u201cYes/No\u201d numeric keypads on the older machines. Of course, the new machines have Bose speakers as well. Overall, the Aria casino is smaller than MGM (which one isn\u2019t?), and less elegant than Bellagio (utterly classic, in its own league), but it nonetheless holds its own extremely well when compared to other Vegas casinos. It is one of my very favorites. POOL AREA: Very dichotomous review here. I would say that the Aria pools themselves are some of the \u201cweakest\u201d Vegas pools that I have experienced; but I would also say that the \u201cpool area\u201d is probably the best that I have experienced. There are three elliptical shaped pools that must have a maximum depth of three feet each. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I got in it the water. Come on now. I\u2019m not asking for a \u201cdeep end\u201d of eight feet, but I could use at least 4 \u00bd feet. I had to get on my knees to get the water up to my shoulders, and I\u2019m only 5 foot 10. They are superb pools for small kids (you could never drown in these things, despite hawk-like lifeguards watching your every move) -- but not for big kids that actually like to swim. VERY disappointing overall as far as the actual pools themselves are concerned. MGM Grand still reigns in the \u201cpool wars\u201d amongst MGM properties. \u201cThe Beach\u201d at Mandalay Bay is an overrated cross between Spring Break and Disneyland. Though an inferior hotel, Monte Carlo\u2019s pool offering is better than Aria. All that criticism aside, the \u201cpool area\u201d around the three Aria pools is utterly amazing. The palm trees are plentiful, as is the privacy, the availability of chaise lounges, the attentive and friendly pool bar staff, and the overall relaxing feel. It never, ever felt crowded or \u201ccircus-like\u201d at this place. Shallow water meant no cannonballs, I guess. People came and went casually, the breezes came and went comfortably, and the music (good music) played relaxingly -- at just the right volume. Not a PARTY!!!\u2026.but a great time. You could read books or magazines with a cool drink for hours at this pool. The other thing that Aria totally nailed on the design of the pool area is that \u201cthere\u2019s something for everyone\u201d here as far as sun exposure is concerned. A long-time criticism of mine is that Vegas pools are too exposed to the desert sun. You could get slathered in 45 SPF, and if you\u2019re from Wisconsin or Washington (as I am), you\u2019re still going to get burned beyond belief if you\u2019re exposed longer than an hour. Aria very smartly built their pools very closely to the west side of their huge hotel. So if you come in the morning (i.e. 0900-1200), you should be able to find plenty of shade if you want it since the shadow of the enormous hotel blocks the sun. NOTE TO VEGAS TOURISTS: Not everybody who goes to a pool wants to get burned up in the 110 degree desert sun. They want to relax and \u201cfeel the heat\u201d -- without the melanoma. Aria is the perfect place to do just that. One thing that was quite peculiar, however, was that the pool complex was on the second floor \u201cPromenade\u201d level \u2013 ABOVE the casino -- along with the Elvis Theater, buffet, and the conference rooms. The more I think about it, the more that I believe this is why the pools are so shallow. The additional weight of \u201cdeep water\u201d would probably be too much for the second floor structure to support, as most hotel pools are on the ground level. ROOMS: The rooms are the Aria\u2019s \u201dtestament to technology.\u201d As many have reported, when you \u201cwave\u201d the room key at the lock (NOT insert it in any slot), the room welcomes you by opening the curtains, and playing background music on the TV, which also welcomes you personally to Aria by name on the TV screen. Many people have complained about the difficulty of using the \u201csmart device\u201d on the left nightstand that controls the room\u2019s lighting, HVAC, TV, and curtains, but it\u2019s really not that difficult -- and fairly intuitive. Once you practice a few minutes, you should get the hang of it. There are also buttons that act as light switches, so you can still go \u201cconventional\u201d if you would like. The TV is probably easier to use (at least turn on) using the smart pad. About the only thing I was never able to do is turn on the right nightstand lamp. I concluded (at the end of my stay) that it was probably due to a burned out bulb. Overall, the room is decent sized, and very comfortable. The bed is extremely comfortable -- but it might be a tad too soft for some people -- and there are pillows everywhere. The Aria does quite a trade in selling guests their hotel bed pillows (they\u2019ll mail them to your residence). I had a king room, so I had no aforementioned difficulty getting a double queen room because I didn\u2019t \u201creserve\u201d (i.e. request) one. The bathroom is very nice, with the tub actually inside the shower enclosure, next to the shower stall. Very unique design, but it worked well. Pretty good water pressure as well, considering all the plumbing utilizes water saver devices. Never had any difficulty getting the room cleaned up. I had a handful of change on my dresser disappear one day, so the housekeeping staff obviously thought it was a tip. No problem. Although I didn\u2019t intend it, I can see their reasoning, as money left out is usually considered a tip, and they did a great job. My wife tips the housekeeping staff, but I usually don\u2019t, but I should probably start doing it (a couple bucks a day in Vegas is totally reasonable). The safe in the lower drawer of the nightstand is very large (big enough for a laptop), and works very well. Most importantly, I ALWAYS had a good night\u2019s sleep, and there was never any \u201cparty noise\u201d or excess commotion during my entire stay. SHOWS: I didn\u2019t see the Cirque de Soleil \u201cViva Elvis\u201d show, but I spoke with several guests who did see it, and they really enjoyed it. FOOD: I tried the lunch buffet, and it was good. Nothing spectacular, but as long as they keep the crab legs coming (which they did), I\u2019m happy. The sushi, meat (leg of lamb was awesome), and desert selections were also very good. They have gelato instead of ice cream, and it\u2019s delicious. I also didn\u2019t eat out at any of the fancy restaurants, but the Jean Philippe Patisserie was good for a quick bite, and Chill was good for a sweet snack. As has been widely reported, prices are quite high for all food options. The days of cheap eats are long gone in Vegas, at least in nice hotels on the strip. If you want cheap fare, go next door to the Monte Carlo Food Court (or to MGM Grand), where they have a McDonald\u2019s and Sbarro. CONCLUSION: Aria is a GREAT hotel, and I will definitely be going back. PROS: The hotel staff; the overall hotel \u201catmosphere;\u201d the pool \u201clounge area;\u201d and the casino look and layout (and fairly loose slots). CONS: Very limited double queen rooms; shallow pools; location set back from the strip; and room automation might be a little daunting for the \u201ctechnologically challenged\u201d guests.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cWe are so glad we chose this hotel\u201d", "Author": "ammoss", "ReviewID": "UR72366994", "Content": "After reading so many mixed reviews about this hotel we were not sure what to expect but we can honestly say the hotel was great.

We asked for a quiet room and was given an high floor and a room well away from the lifts. If you don't want a long walk ask for a room close to the elevators! The room was fine, the remote control for curtains, lights etc was no big deal at all to master and if its a problem just use the regular switches on the wall!! We experienced no problem with the housekeeping, the room was made up and well cleaned everyday for the 5 days we were there. We had a problem opening the safe (the people in the room before us had closed it with their code.....why do people do that??) but a quick phone call, answered promptly, the maintenance guy was there within 10 mins, he had to wait for security so changed the light bulb that was out while he was waiting. As for the bed......it really was the best bed we had ever slept in, so comfy......if i lived in the USA I would definitely order one!! Ate breakfast at the Patisserie on a morning.....great coffee too......and never a problem getting a table. Also ate at the Todd English PUB next door in City centre ......a fantastic choice of beers, good service and food at reasonable prices. Parked at the self parking and again no big deal , there is a walkway directly into the hotel so easy to manoeuvre cases etc. The hotel location was perfect and easy to access both the Bellaggio and Monte Carlo. Used the pool, nice but maybe chilled just a little too much for our liking and the service around the pool area was very efficient. All in we have no complaints at all about this hotel. The hotel is very modern and is not themed like a lot of the other Vegas hotels, if its the later you are looking for, this isn't the hotel for you, but if you want a bit of luxury and a more relaxed atmosphere I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cThe best in Las Vegas!!!\u201d", "Author": "mjg6541", "ReviewID": "UR72293093", "Content": "We stayed here for my 30th,this place was amazing checked in was fast walked into the room and was shocked bathroom was huge.

Some comments being pretty unreasonable. I will say considering I am in Customer Service, if you treat the employees well, they treat you even better. That said, We stayed at Aria for 3 nights over the weekend. We were celebrating my Birthday friday night. Check-In was pretty easy considering we arrived at 9:30 am. The person who checked us in was very friendly and helpful. Our room wasn't ready yet so we were given line passes to the pool/buffet (this meant we could skip any lines and head right in). We were told to check back on our room in 2 hrs and they put a rush on the room for us. We ate breakfast at Cafe Vettro which was awesome. My husband said the Corned Beef Hash was one of the best he'd ever had. My Steak and Eggs were also great. We were greeted by everyone as we walked to our table and the waiter was very nice. We checked back on our room and were upgraded to a Panaramic View Corner Suite as this was the first available room. The room was gorgeous and easy to use. Floor to ceilings windows from the Master bedroom to the bathroom and through the entire livingroom. It had a great jacuzzi tub also surrounded by windows and a partial view of the strip from north to south. It also had many amenities that you don't typically get in other hotels, i.e. a razor, toothbrush/toothpaste, hairspray, and a large vanity kit. The room also had a minibar and a seperate fridge. We ate at the Buffet twice, once for dinner and then brunch saturday morning. Dinner friday night had complimentary Lobster and Wine for each table and Brunch had Bloody Marys and Mimosas. We tried the Buffet at the Wynn and were not very pleased. The selection wasn't as big and the employees were not very friendly. At Aria the pools were absolutely wonderful and relaxing. Never had a problem finding beds together and the noise levels from each pool never bothered the others which was cool. There were pools where all the kids played and pools where the adults relaxed. Breeze Cafe was awesome and again the service was great. I ordered a fruit plate and my husband ordered a BLT. We shared the BLT and the fruit plate was huge. We shared that as well and barely put a dent in it. The waiter asked if the fruit was okay and we told him we were simply full from the huge BLT and great fries. He then came back with the check and removed the fruit plate since we hardly touched it. He insisted and wished us a great stay. Again, great service. Lots of security around which always made us feel secure. I know people complained about security by the elevators but there were many times that we witnessed people trying to get in that didn't belong in our hotel and didn't have room keys to pass through ( they were trying to get up to rooms for parties). The slots weren't tight and neither was the video poker. Also, waitresses always came around to check on you and your drinks. Overall, the stay was fantastic. Again, everyone we encountered spoke with us and wished us a great stay. The only negative to this hotel is the fact the you spend alot of money. That's the downside with such great service. We tipped everyone well from the bellhops to the valet, waiters, waitresses, and room service/housekeepers. We felt the need to considering how gracious they were and how funny and genuinely concerned they were with your experience. I forgot to mention everyone knew it was my Birthday. I guess it was in the computer system but waiters/waitresses knew when I would charge things to our room and the housekeepers wished me Happy Birthday as well when they serviced our room. My husband and I were greatly pleased with that level of service. Check out was also easy as you do it through the T.V. Again, everything was exquisite. We would probably never stay here again as we try different hotels everytime we're in Vegas, but I would love to bring my parents here to experience a true 5 star hotel.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida, USA", "Title": "\u201cOVERRATED\u201d", "Author": "Stomberlin", "ReviewID": "UR72238120", "Content": "The hotel does not maintain posted check in check out times which means they really can't tell you when your room will be available on a busy weekend.

It is evidently a known fact by locals/cab drivers, etc that Aria has tight slots, tables, and dealers. If you win any money, get the hell out.

I had received a package that included air fare from Dallas, 4 nights at the Aria with an upgrade to a City View Deluxe room, $100 in food credit, a few other unused discounts and airport to hotel transfers for a bit over $1,100. The hotel itself was absolutely beautiful. This hotel has a LEEDS Gold Level certification and the decor was incredible. Very modernistic in every detail. The accomodations were spotless! It is centrally located on the strip. I'll start with the good points. The lobby service was excellent although they did not have any non-smoking rooms when we arrived. The front desk was willing to move us the next morning but when we entered the room, it didn't smell like a smoking room (although the hallways did). We were fine on the floor (22nd). The room itself was spacious and had the most comfortable bed/pillows I have ever slept on. I was a bit wary about the electronics after reading other reviews of the Aria but found that they were easy to master. The thermostat, blinds, lights, television (flat screen) and music were all controlled by a single remote through the TV. The room had an excellent view of the \"Strip\". Double sinks in the bath and a large shower with a non-jacuzzi double bathtub. We were warned at the front desk that the mini bar in the room was weight sensitive and that if we touched/moved the items (way over-priced) it would be charged to our account. There are retail stores close to the hotel to purchase bottled water/snacks and avoid these costs. We read so many bad reviews about the buffet that we were a little intimidated about trying it. Guess that's why there is 32 flavors at Baskin Robbins. We found the buffet to be incredible. Prime rib, chilled King crab, roasted turkey, lamb, ham, chicken, seafood, salads, oriental, mexican and italian dishes everwhere plus cooked to order eggs/omelets (brunch) and pasta (lunch) PLUS a very spectacular desert area with Oreo Shooters ( to die for) and some of the best ice creams I have had. Found the service to be great. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Being my first trip to Vegas in many years, I wish I had set up a players account when I first entered the casino. The players account at the Aria is through MGM and ties many of the casinos together. Would have had some additional \"perks\" if we did. If I had the trip to \"do over\" I'd probably not take the transfers and would have taken a cab from the airport to the hotel. Let's face it, many of us do not make many trips to Vegas. A cab would deliver you to the front lobby. Our transfer bus dropped us at an underground spot. It took the \"pizazz\" out of the arrival. It was then a long walk to the hotel lobby to check in. There isn't any need for a car in Vegas unless you want to travel off the strip. We went for a day trip to Hoover Dam. That was well worth the drive. My advice is to book the rental car before you book into the hotel (Dollar) for the day you want it as there is a variance between what you would pay pre-booking and what you would pay at the hotel. In my case it was $52 vs, $69 per day. If you make the reservation for the last 24 hours you will be in Vegas, you can pick the car up at the hotel and drop it off at the airport for the same price. No need to wait for a scheduled pick up from the transfer companies to get you to the airport. The Aria is in the City Center between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo resorts. A tram will transport you between the three. Wi-Fi connection at the hotel is expensive at $15 per day. To check in for your outgoing flights is $5 at area kiosks. Computer time at the business center was $15 for a minimum of 15 minutes. BUT if you go down to where they rent the rental cars, I was able to connect to several free wi-fi connections for internet access on my I-phone.

The decor is very updated and modern from the lobby to the casino to the rooms. The whole place was pumped with that new car smell. There is security everywhere-it felt very safe. The room was very hi-tech. Nice size, windows from ceiling to floor, big screen TV w/remote that controlled everything in the room-(lights,curtains,alarm,radio-it was cool!) A complimentary robe in the room was available and lots of closet and drawer space. Too bad the ice box was stocked w/stuff to purchase (no room for your own stuff) Warning: Don't touch anything in there or else they will charge you an arm and a leg. If you wanted to have another ice box in your room you could request one- for a price! The rooms were sound proof and so were the hallways. It was easy to go from your room to the casino. As for the casino- I thought it was wonderful. They even have a rare game that aren't in most casinos-\"WAR!\" The same game from my childhood but for REAL MONEY! They had lots of high stakes tables and by all the noise that I heard, someone must have been on a roll. Now for some bad news. It is a good idea if you are staying there to get your directions down or you WILL GET LOST. It is a hard hotel to find. Parking is very hard to find, but once you know how it all works-it gets easier. The hotel is surrounded by other buildings and you can't see the strip. So the view is not so good. The tram between hotels is GREAT! If you stay you can use it to go to the Bellagio and Monte Carlo. The ride is faster than walking and it is prompt. The buffet at the Aria is FANTASTIC! The dessert section was simple delish! The portions were just right-you could try everything and not feel full. The way it was designed should of been better because it felt like being in a cafeteria. It had a horseshoe design and no color.

We booked this place because of a great deal and it looked beautiful. Reviews were all across the board, but it was new so we gave it the benefit of the doubt. I will get the positives out of the way, as there aren't many. - Hotel is beautiful, inside and out. - Smelled great, not too much of the Vegas cigarette stench. - Three pools were nice during the heat wave Vegas was experiencing. That's about it. I knew the place was going to be expensive, so I won't complain about drink prices or food or $15 blackjack tables. I knew what I was getting into. What I will complain about is the service. Check-in took forever as all reviews have stated, so we didn't get our room until about 6 hours after we arrived. Not a huge deal, as we got there early, but inconvenient. Worst part was we asked for a specific floor with our group because of a birthday, and they were great about it over the phone before the trip, but instead got a different room altogether on a different floor, complete opposite of what we asked about. This gem of a room had no working phone and the handle of the bathroom door fell off when we first used it. Had to go to the front desk to ask to get these fixed, and they never were. The room service attendant even made a comment about it Sunday night, called service again from a phone in the hallway and was told it couldn't be fixed until Monday. Thanks for the help. The door handle wasn't a huge deal, just really tacky. But the phone is a problem. What if there was an emergency? Well, there was, albeit in another room of our party. Said member spent all day sunday vomiting, to the point that we made the decision to take him to the hospital to get an IV (heat + not enough water + drinking too much the night before). So we called the concierge to have a wheelchair sent up so we could take our friend to the hospital, but spent 15 minutes on hold. So I went downstairs to get it myself only to be told that it would be 15 minutes before security could get one. At that point, friend was about to pass out and vomiting non-stop so I asked to call the medics. From there the situation was taken care of (and the friend was just fine) by the fine medical staff of Clark County. But when brought up to a manager how troubling it was that none of the hotel staff seemed to care about the situation, or didn't answer the phone or took their sweet time, it was implied to us that we called the wrong people. And that was it. I know that drinking too much and dehydration happen all the time in Vegas, but what if there was a life or death situation going on? Would they show this little concern for the well being of their patrons then? And what if that situation happened in my room, without the working phone? Nobody on the staff seemed to care at all, and that is troubling and anger-inducing. It was a frustrating weekend at this hotel. The few things that were great about the hotel were overshadowed by the bad things and the way handled any and all service. There is a lot of potential at Aria. There really is.

I really didn\u2019t want to give it a 3 star..in fact, I wanted to give it a 5 star, but a couple of incidents occurred that dropped it down to a 4 star rating. As I was ready to write a review for this 4 star hotel, another incident occurred that dropped it down to a 3 star. So let\u2019s begin my story\u2026 Check in: So me and the boyfriend arrived at Aria on July 16 \u2013 18th at 9 in the morning. We wanted to get an early check in to avoid the long lines later and hopefully get our rooms. We weren\u2019t even sure if they would even let us check in that early! We got in line and within 5 minutes we were able to get our Corner Suite, however, she gave us two option, take the room on the 4th floor which was ready, or wait for the room on the 21st floor for about an hour to be cleaned. I rather wait for a better view..and plus, we were there SUPER early, so can\u2019t complain if the room was ready or not. We did the check in process so I wouldn\u2019t have to do it later when I pick up my keys. She gave us a Panoramic Suite, which was awesome by the way. Check in was a breeze, she put a rush for our room to be cleaned. So we really appreciated that. Shout out to the best front desk girl RUBY! You rock girl! Thank you for making the first impression wonderful!!! To bad that\u2019s her last week there. Room: Our Corner Suite was awesome!! Everything worked perfect. Bed was very comphy I love having a lot of pillows and that bed had plenty! LOVVVED the bathtub looking out to the city\u2026loved the remote that controls everything..love how the curtains open up loved how the toilet had many cool features..hehe.. No complaints about anything in the room\u2026UNTIL Saturday morning. So we woke up and decided to go out for breakfast. We always made sure to have our privacy light on because we didn\u2019t want housekeeping in our room. So when we came back to our room, we noticed our cups outside our room..our tv was off (we had it on to make it seem like someone was in our room so housekeeping wouldn\u2019t come in\u2026but not like it mattered), our bed was made, the restroom was clean, etc. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t complain about coming back to a clean room, but um..our privacy light was on..doesn\u2019t that mean don\u2019t come in? Luckily, most of our valuable was in the safe\u2026I DOUBT she would\u2019ve taken anything, but that\u2019s besides the point..so I didn\u2019t wanna be mean and take out 1 whole star\u2026so I just took out \u00bd star. I understand mistake happens..but to future aria guest, just be careful. Casino: Lots of tables, lots of slots, lots of everything. It\u2019s not as dark as some people say. At least in my opinion. At first we won money, then gave it all back and some!!! Overall, we had a good time at this casino..except for some minor issue which resulted in another negative \u00bd star. I was watching my bf play three card poker and we got carded, which is fine, we\u2019re use to it. So he was trying to make small talk with the dealer and I guess she didn\u2019t like it cause she would only answer him one word answers rudely and roll her big eyes at him. So he just left her alone. We didn\u2019t get a good vibe from her..it felt like she hated her job. To top it off, she almost screwed him over. He beat her Ace High with a pair, and she still took his money!!! He said, \u201cexcuse me, why did you take my money? I beat u.\u201d her response, \u201coh did I?\u201d There was no apology whatsoever. Ugh, I understand accidents happen, but that\u2019s our $60 u almost took! So a BIG SHOUT OUT to you KRISTY with big eyes and short curly hair! Please be more nice to your guest and pay more attention. To future players with her, watch your hands carefully. All in all, we had a great time. Food, pool, valet, everything was great. Check out was also quick. Happy with my time at the Aria. In comes Monday morning, I checked my bank account statement. Why did they charge me an extra $260? I called the front desk and they told me it was an \u201cincidental charge\u201d. Um, I never heard of that? She told me it\u2019s for the usage of the gym, phone, internet, etc. So I asked her you guys charge that even though we didn\u2019t use any of that? She told me if you didn\u2019t use it, the bank will put it back into your bank account. Thanks for telling me in advance ARIA! What if I didn\u2019t have enough money in my account?? Isn\u2019t that something you should\u2019ve told your guest? I don\u2019t know if other people knew, but I certainly didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t see it on their website, it wasn\u2019t mentioned at checkout. Mentioning of that, why didn\u2019t it show in my receipt you gave me during check out? She told me that it should show back into my account in a couple of days..so I\u2019ll update this if I get it back or not. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d be back here, ill probably try Encore next time and compare my experience.

Since we usually go to Las Vegas a couple of times a year, we thought we would give the lovely new Aria Hotel a try. We had made the reservations online through the hotel.....2 nights ...2 queen beds. Not a complicated request for most hotel, but the Aria seems to have a problem with that. We had paid in advance for the first night and had the receipt in hand, but there was not one room in the hotel which had 2 beds, or so we were told. We were given the option of a rollaway bed or we could use that courtesy phone in a distance to find lodging elsewhere. Since we were tired and really just wanted to relax, thus the reason for coming to Las Vegas, we opted for the rollaway bed. No one offered an apology for our inconvenience. We walked what seemed to be about 2 miles to our room. The fragrance which began in the Hotel Lobby permeates the entire hotel. That smell might work in the restrooms, but for god sake, not in the entire hotel. It's nauseating. The hallways are long, dark brown, narrow and poorly lighted. It was reminiscent of the really old Best Western from my childhood, but a much longer walk. Then we entered into \"High-tech Curtain\" land. I don't need or want my curtains computerized. If they must be computerized, make the computer work like a computer. I don't want to take classes to be able operate the curtains nor the lights and the television. And I certainly don't want to be sitting in the dark because of the preprogramming. The water closet in the bathroom is indeed, in a separate room, which sounds like it would work well for 2 friends traveling together, however the wall is made of glass. Now, if you are OK sitting on the toilet while your friend is brushing her teeth, then this would work for you, otherwise...NOT SO MUCH! There is a lovely soaking tub in the bathroom. But... in order to get into the tub, you have to walk through the shower stall. It is positioned back past the shower. Who thought that was a good idea? The hotel boast of their large guest rooms. I'm sure that square footage includes the bathroom and the glass water closet, plus the closets, dresser drawers and possibly the air ducts. There was not room for the lovely rollaway bed until my friend and I rearranged the furniture. The rollaway was left in the room, folded! No attempt was made to make it useable. We gambled in the hotel and had the same luck that we had at registration. So we decided to spend our money elsewhere. When it was time to check out, the wonderment continued. Supposedly that computer in your room works for checkout, not just to control your draperies, but ours didn't. We stood in line 30 minutes. But we were so glad to get out of this place, thirty minutes didn't seem so bad. But once it was actually our turn, they now deny that they have our advance deposit. Remember...we a receipt IN HAND! That was another 30 minutes and having to get fussy about talking to a manger! We had to pay a second time for that room. Now we are left with letting Visa fight the fight. On a positive note the housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a very nice job. The buffet which is served in a restaurant of the same name... \"Buffet\" was good...expensive, but good. It was not your $14.95 Las Vegas buffet. The customer service in this hotel is nonexistent, so if you want to spend your money and have a good time....Stay someplace else. This was a surprise to me since I have stayed in other MGM properties and have never experience this. MGM Resorts GET A NEW MANGER for this property, and teach customer service. I really don't have a suggestion for that color scheme and bathroom design until you have to redecorate and that might never happen if none of your customers return.

It's a beautiful hotel but not very hospitable. $30 PER DAY to use the fitness center is ridiculous. I travel quite frequently and I have never stayed at a hotel that charges that much to use the fitness center. And by the way, I checked out the fitness center and it's nothing special that would justify something so ridiculous. There are refigerators in the rooms filled with minibar items but be careful not to even touch them or you will be charged. They have sensors under the items so they will know if you even picked up any items and you are automatically charged. Also, there are no in room coffee makers which I found extremely odd. I think it's a pretty basic request to have a coffee maker in your hotel room but the Aria doesn't think so...but they'll gladly send you up a kettle of hot water for $4 each morning ($28 for hot water for my 7 day stay). I would not stay at the Aria again because I don't like the feeling of being charged for EVERY little thing that is normally standard at any other luxury hotel (or even at bad hotels for that matter). For the money I paid I was expecting some hospitality which is something the Aria doesn't offer...or maybe there's an additional charge for hospitality.

Multiple day discounts are offered and the $30 per day fee is refunded if a spa service is booked on that day. Restaurants were exceptional (food, service, etc.).

Bed amazingly soft and wonderful to sleep in! 5 star hotel and it tried to live up to 5 star. Window was one wall top to bottom - great view. Drapes drawn, music on, etc by the touch of a button and could program music and drapes to open as a wake up. Service was always helpful, polite and friendly. No long line ups anywhere. Attention to detail was not great - there was always something missing from the room - faceclothes one day , a robe the next. Always replaced so no big deal but just not quite up to 5 star standard for housekeeping. Plenty of places to eat but not great cuisine (we didn't try the high end restaurants). I found them expensive for what they were - but that seems to be the case wherever you are on the strip. Breakfast bufet extensive from roast lamb to scrambled eggs and everything in between. At $15 per person make sure you want to eat lots - we did brunch. No coffee in the room. Nice not to have that mess and I'm sure it's environmentally friendlier but really annoying not to be able to have a cup of coffee first thing in the morning without getting dressed and going to get one or paying way over t he top for room service. Internet very expensive. Beautiful swimming pools, not crowded. Crystal shopping centre next door and a good route to get onto the strip - very high end. One of the things to do away from the strip is the Atomic Testing Museum . Really really interesting, well presented and well worth a visit. We walked there from the strip - about 25 mins.

Worth it to get a 3 day ticket and then can use at anytime to go up and down the strip and to downtown and the Outlet Stores.

I'm an avid Vegas goer. I've seen and stayed at a few hotels and know the ropes. So I decided to give Aria a try. I went with my girlfriend during the week, with another couple and we all stayed at Aria. We took the shuttle from the airport, we were dropped off in the BACK. Like literally a REALLY sketchy basement looking entrance. I was paranoid as hell wondering wth the driver was taking us. But apparently the Front desk told me the shuttles drop you off in the back and the taxis drop you off in the front. The front desk was very nice and I requested for a strip view, in which she did give us one, but it my god the walk from the elevator to the hotel room was the longest walk ever. Upon arriving to the room, the music turns on and the curtains open up to show a cool view (the strip for us) and well first thing we noticed was a pull out bed right there. (We never asked for one nor requested). Easy fix, house keeping came and took it away no problem. Then we checked out the bathroom. Very nice, modern and contemporary. Shower and tub together. I soon look over at the soap dishes and find, 3 bars of soap (all Aria's). Weird thing was, one of them was out of the wrapper sitting out on the soap dish, the second one in its original plastic packaging, the third one was flat out in the shower right next to what apparently looked like a half used Aria shampoo bottle. MY question is, how the hell does housekeeping miss these things?! Do they hope that we'll reuse them?? Okay, no problem for me, I ignored it and threw them away, I figured no big deal, easy fix. I meet with the other couple and find out that upon entering their bathroom, there is a huge women's granny-panty right there hanging on the shower. I was like WTF! you can't be serious and he said he was. About location, this hotel is seriously the farthest from everyyythinggg. I could barely make it to Harrahs for a walk. There is a shortcut cutting through the mall or taking the monorail which STILL requires a ton of walking. Overall this hotel had the spirit of \"All show, no go.\" It may look alot like a 5 star hotel, but the service, housekeeping, and overall general up-keeping of this hotel was that of a three star quality. (I've stayed at the Wynn, and Treasure Island, and Harrah's so I know the difference between 5-4-3 star hotels) This place will NEVER beat out the Wynn. They need to step up their game and have some incentives for staying here. I don't think I will ever return here unless I somehow got a free room or a dirt cheap rate that I cannot resist.

Although my business this week is at the Venetian, I wanted to check out this new property. Overall, this is a lovely, striking complex, part of the new City Center set of retail and lodging. I found staff helpful, though a little stiff on average. There are striking works of art, some extremely large (like the solid silver replica of the Colorado River over the front desk), and very interesting overall, so if you stay here, take a little time to walk around. There is a pamphlet to guide you through the art. My room on the 12th floor was spotless and well appointed. Major pluses: what I believe was a 54\" HDTV, though they advertise 42\". A large shower/tub area, desk and two large seats in bedroom, and a very comfortable bed, with a soft surface but firm enough for most. The hotel was designed with technology in mind. I love the input panel on the desk. The panel has connectiosn to the TV, including HDMI, VGA, USB, iPod/iPhone, S-Video, VGA and others. With the right cord, you can connect your laptop or iPod to the TV and sound system. Further, the curtains, lights, clock and TV can either be controlled via wall switches, the TV remote, or the bedside panel. I've seen reviews from those confused by this, but honestly, I can't understand the frustration, as it's pretty straightforward. Heck, there is even an \"everything off\" switch at the door. The casino is on par with other 4 and 5 star hotels in the area: lots of gaming, slots, video poker, etc, and about 2 dozen restaurants. Try Todd English's P.U.B. - relatively affordable, excellent, simple food, and a great beer selection, just across the entrance from the Aria. The pool area is nice, but uninspiring. About 4-5 large pools surrounded by lounges and umbrellas. There is cocktail service at the chairs and a walk-up bar, but know that you cannot drink in the pool. The only exception is at Liquid, a modestly sized, reservation-only pool club with a smallish pool, about 1/3 the size of the other pools. During my stay, it was pretty quiet outside, unlike, for example, Monte Carlo with it's disco parties. Whatever works for you, of course. I suppose most folks are justified in rating this as 5 star. If I could, I would've used 4 1/2. Again, it's a beautiful property with a lot going for it. However, it just didn't have that special energy or character that a few of the best hotels have. Venetian has it's larger rooms. Bellagio has it's stunningly gorgeous artwork and architecture throughout and fantastic pool. Even the dated Mirage has a welcoming casino floor with it's palms and such. Aria didn't have that for me.

Still like THEhotel at Mandalay Bay better.\u201d", "Author": "JCashMoney", "ReviewID": "UR70764346", "Content": "We received three comped nights from Aria and decided to check it out. Check in was a breeze at the invited guest counter. I gave the clerk a $20 and asked him if there were any upgrades available. He told us that we were in luck that there was a room on the 50th floor with a seating area. It turns out that it wasn't an upgraded room at all. Thanks for nothing. The rooms are very nice, albeit smaller than rooms at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay which is where we typically stay. I like the idea of a sitting room and seperate bedroom much better. I also missed having two bathrooms like at THEhotel. There was an issue with the control panel for the room not working. However, they had it fixed by the time we came back from dinner. I'm not sold on the view from Aria, as it's akin to staying in Manhattan. Even with a \"strip view\" room on the 50th floor you look out over what is truly a city; thus \"City Center.\" The windows were dirty, with large handprints on them. The overhang above the window does have the brownish dirt that others have complained of. It's no doubt from when it rains and the dust drips down. Flat front hotels (read, virtually all others in Vegas) wouldn't have this problem, as there's nothing for the dirt to collect on. The pools are nice. However, nothing beats the Beach at Mandalay Bay. These aren't your typical 'party down' type pools, as they are much more laid back. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. There is an adults only pool club (Liquid) that looked like it was rockin' if that's your thing. We ate at the buffet on Friday night which included a lobster to split for two people and all you could drink wine. The buffet was good, however not as good as the Bellagio. Like the Bellagio though, they do charge you an 18% gratuity if you have a party larger than 8 and you want to sit together. That just might be the biggest rip off in Vegas, as it's a buffet! Our two buffet's were comped in the offer we received, so just paying the gratuity wasn't terrible. We also ate at Caf\u00e9 Vettro which was good food, but expensive, and the Skybox Sports Bar and Grill, which also was good but expensive. Lastly, we ate at Jean Philippe Patisserie which has fantastic pasteries. The Cirque Viva Elvis show was good, but definitely not my favorite Cirque show. If you haven't seen any of the Cirque shows I'd reccomend seeing O at the Bellagio and Ka at the MGM before seeing Viva Elvis. Our comp offer included 2 for 1 Viva Elvis tickets in the VIP area. I would not pay $200 each for the tickets. However, with the 2 for 1 they were $200 for both. The VIP area is extremely nice, as the seats are more like couches and there's tons of leg room. However, our friends bought cheap tickets and ended up getting moved down there because there was space available. The bottom line, don't pay $200/ticket for the show. The casino is darker than most. However, it's nowhere near as dark as some have complained. I didn't necessarily like the layout of the casino floor as much as some other properties, as it wasn't as open feeling. It feels like everything is on top of each other. The gambling was good. However, my credit line was payable in 7 days as opposed to the 30 days I have on my line at Mandalay Bay. Why this is the case is anyone's guess, as the credit department for all MGM properties is run out of the Bellagio. Strange. Thankfully it didn't end up mattering, as we came out ahead on our gambling. When we stay at THEhotel the VIP office makes our club reservations for us, or gives us the cell phone number of one of the door men so we don't have to wait in club lines. This was not the case at Aria, as I was told that I would have to make reservations directly through the Light Nightclub group. I ended up contacting my host at the Palms and he comped us directly into Moon without waiting in line. I would have liked to have had the same benefit at Haze nightclub at Aria. I simply refuse to wait in a huge line for hours to get into a club. I did have an opportunity to use the spa at Aria, which was very nice. I didn't necessarily like the fact that there are portions of the spa that are co-ed. All told, the trip was a blast and Aria was nice. Would I stay there again if the rooms were comped? Absolutely. Would I pay to stay there verses staying at THEhotel?

But, since new hotel properties often have their glitches to work through, we decided to give it a try. I've stayed at most of the strip hotels, including Bellagio, Paris, Luxor, Mirage, Treasure Island and Monte Carlo. I must say, my husband and I were very pleased. We arrived rather late - around 9pm so there wasn't much of a line. The Front Desk Agent was very friendly and accomodating. We asked about a city view room and were informed that it would cost an additional $15 per night so we decided to skip it. She spent a generous amount of time locating a room with a nice view on an upper floor. We were pleased to see that the corridor was glass and overlooked the strip. Our room overlooked another tall, glass structure and wasn't what I'd consider to be an unpleasant view, although it wasn't awesome either. The Bellman arrived immediately and was beyond friendly and helpful! His first order of business was to show my husband how to use the in room technology features which I didn't pay attention to. He then observed that we had stopped at the liquor store and ran for some ice! I will also mention, the TV, light switches etc. may also be operated via traditional remote and wall switches as well. The room was nicely appointed and very spacious. We loved the floor to ceiling windows! It offered his and hers closets and lots of dresser drawers. The bathroom had double sinks as well as a private water closet. The combined shower and soak tub were a nice feature too! I liked the bed but it was a little soft. I must mention though, we own an extremely nice bed so I'm not one of those people who are blown away by hotel beds. The linens were lovely and soft. In terms of the technology, I can take or leave that sort of thing but it was neat. I must note, for those who prefer black out window treatments, these let a bit of light in through the top. The room is still restfully dark for napping but you definitely know it's daytime. We worked out in the gym and the $30 fee includes access to the spa as well. It's superb but it would be nice to pay a slighter fee to just exercise. The pools were great but a bit understaffed. Our first day out, we sat for nearly two hours before we were offered a drink. There's a huge cooler with complimentary cups and freezing water which was all we were after in the 100 degree sun anyway so we were okay. We ate at two of the restaurants and they were very good. The cafe right below the elevators offers beautful pastries, fresh fruit and coffee if you're on the run. The $7 fruit bowl was actually worth the price. They are very careful to check for room keys so I felt secure and safe. I noticed many comments on how the machines were tight but really, come on!

This after multiple calls to them to confirm that it would be ready days before we left Dallas. We were not the only ones either....the front desk was filled with UPSET people who were not getting the rooms and suites that they had reserved well in advance (one couple next to us had reserved months before). To be fair, the front desk staff were great, but the managers were terrible. By terrible I mean non responsive and down right sarcastic. I am a manager and deal with customer service all the time.....the front desk manager was a no show. So, we ended up with what they said was an \"upgraded\" dual queen suite which proved to be a total misnomer. - The room was disappointing. I have stayed in Hampton Inn suites that were as nice or nicer than this room and were much larger, last week in fact. The vaunted technology was incorrectly installed as the switches for the room lights were cross wired so you had to walk across the room to control the other side and visa versa. What we read was that the Aria was initially designed for the convention market and when that went south, they tried to retool for the leisure market and they are missing that mark in my estimation. - The mattresses were marshmallows. Soft is not the word. They are unsupportive and if you have any back issue whatsoever, you will wake up sore or worse. - I am used to things be expensive in Vegas, but the Aria takes it to another level. Two cups of coffee and two danishes....$25. Give me a break. - I know that the slots are tight on the strip, but we usually here at lease one someone win a decent pot over a 4-5 day period. This time, nothing. Not one. - We went to the pool area which was packed as one entire pool was not working and off limits. To be fair, here are the positives: - We stayed on the 27th floor and the view of City Center was really great. - The decor of the hotels and rooms was very modern and well done throughout. It certainly had the finish out of a high end resort. - The room linens were of the finest quality and they have all the toiletries you could need gratis except for a razor. - The combination of glassed in large shower with adjacent large soaking tub was really neat. Liked that a lot. - Although grossly overpriced, the food and drink at the restaraunts was good. - The staff, excluding the managers,were extremely helpful, polite and downright nice! They will go out of there way to assist you if you even have a hint of confusion on your face which was refreshing. - It was very conveniently located and much of the strip is withing walking distance. You can actually go straight to the Monte Carlo without going outside and enjoy shopping and a food court on the way. - Thankfully, the video check out worked smoothly, sparing me another trip to the front desk. Here is some input that is neither good nor bad in my opionion, just not our cup of tea. - The place is filled with what looks to be Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian wanna be's. 20 and 30 somethings dressed to the hilt absolutely fill this place. - As such the restaraunts, bars and clubs cater to this age group and as 40 somethings, we felt a bit out of place, but one thing is for sure, the place is hopping with the hip and trendy. So there you have it...the straight word. Do not get sucked in by the website which is, obviously, very cool.

The d\u00e9cor is very modern, which also appeals to me and the room is very spacious. When you hit the \u201cGood Night\u201d button everything shuts down, lights, TV, curtains close\u2026. \u201cGood Night\u201d! \u2022 The pool area is very nice.

The waiter was very attentive and offered to bring out different sauces for the table to sample on their steaks. The usable wall of wine that also doubled as d\u00e9cor is very nice. The Bad: \u2022 The key in the service industry is \"Service\" and it was lack luster at ARIA and since I have seen some posts in regards to the service at the hotel, I was not surprised. Upon arriving at the hotel there were not a lot of people waiting to be checked-in, as I have seen at other hotels in the past. The check in process was very slow. The person helping me check in was very pleasant but never the less the process was \u2018\u201dSlow\u201d, which no traveler wants after traveling all day. \u2022 The room service was \u201cSlow\u201d as well which I experienced after leaving the front desk. Upon placing my order I was given the standard statement, \u201cWe will have your food to your room in 50min or less\u201d. Well it took 1hr and 25mins. Both I and my wife feel asleep waiting on the food. The attendant was very apologetic about us having to wait and gave us a complementary tray of chocolate covered strawberries for the long wait. Now I haven\u2019t did any type time study to determine if room service is faster or slower during certain times of night or day but we ordered our food in Vegas @ 1ish in the morning. I am quite sure that a lot of the guest where out doing what they do in Vegas, not ordering room service and then turning in for the night. So what I am saying is there is no excuse for this type of tardiness. \u2022 The restaurant Caf\u00e9 Vettro continued the theme of poor \u2018Service\u2019. The restaurant had very few people when my party was seated to eat and continued to have very few during our stay. The wait after our order was taking was very lengthy and we had to ask for refills of drinks at the table. When our food finally arrived at the table the waiter was very apologetic about us having to wait and issued out our respective dishes, well all but one. My order was not one of the dishes issued out. The waiter told me that he had to go back and get mine. I was thinking that he would be right back because he didn\u2019t have room on his tray to bring all of the orders, \u201cWrong\u201d! After about 6 or 7 minutes of waiting for my order, I asked the waiter where was my order, which he stated that it would be right out and I stated that my order would be free for this foul up and wanted to see the manager. The manager did comp a couple of the parties\u2019 food and apologized for the wait. When my food did arrive the French Fries that I ordered where cold and I had to request \u201cHOT Fries\u201d!

We had a crappy view on the 7th floor but we didn't care at all - we were happy to be able to check in early and get 2 beds (given that we've read many reviews where they run out of rooms w/ two beds!). The rooms were very modern and clean. The bathroom is spacious and nice. I thought the rooms here were nicer than the ones at Caesars (we stayed in one of the new towers at CP in the year before which had smaller beds). The beds here are super comfy! There IS a safe in the room - we had difficulties finding it at first - it is in the nightstand drawer in between the beds. No ipod dock though which I thought was weird. We were also warned not to touch anything on the mini bar or in the fridge as it is all sensored and you will be charged for those items. At 6am one morning, the battery in our smoke detector was beeping non stop - we had to call front desk twice to have someone come up - they were apologetic and gave us a $50 voucher for any of the hotel restaurants and a service person came up immediately after the second phone call. The swimming pool area is large - we never had any issues finding loungers near the main pool. We ate at the buffet which was okay - seemed pricy at $35 per person. We also ate at the Steakhouse which was delicious. The hotel/casino smells amazing - a vanilla scent throughout. Some ppl maybe thought it was too strong but it was way better than the smell of cigarettes in all the other hotels we walked through. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. I probably would try something new the next time I was in Vegas, but this hotel is nice and the service was decent. In a hotel this size, you can't expect all your requests to be met immediately.

We're not gamblers but for our 20th anniversary, my wife decided to book us 3 nights at this new hotel. We drove from LA and upon arriving at the hotel, I noticed the entry was huge. To park at the valet, we parked away from the entry., carried our luggages and hauled it all the way to the check-in counter. This was not how I wanted to experience my first visit to this hotel, it is big therefore you can easily be ignored by the bell boys. Upon entering the lobby, I was surprised about the vastness of the hotel. It was well lighted, comfortable yet cold. I could tell they spent al lot of time on the lines and curves, amazing architecture. We arrived at 2:30 pm and we were told our room at the 52nd floor was not going to be ready until pm. They offered pass to the pool but our luggage was already with the bell captain. After 5 hours of driving, I just wanted to lay down and rest a bit. We decide to have a snack at Todd English Bistro and the noules mrieneres was excellent and so was the fair selection of beer. When we returned to the front desk, all she could tell me was that my room was not going to be ready until after 5 pm or maybe 6 pm. And she wasn't even apologetic about it. I was ready to move to another hotel until my wife reminded her it was our anniversary and she softened and gave us a city view at the 34th floor. By now, I will take the 2nd floor lobby just to lay down. The room - spacious, modern, powered curtains, clean bathrooms. Nice. The bed was soft and comfortable. The view was fine, note spectacular. Figuring out the electronics drove me, a techno geek to madness. How the heck do I close the curtains without turning all the lights. I feel sorry for the old couple figuring this room out. Where's the safe? Nada! None. What, a modern hotel with no safe? The casino - though I am not a gambler, I did enjoy the expanse of the gambling hall. I compared it with the surrounding hotels and depending on you preference, the Aria casino may be cavernous, liberating, or just lacking intimacy. After all, architecture is the theme. I am a photo hobbyist and I enjoyed the amount of time spent on the design of every corner of the complex. The pool - 3 large pools, one for kids. Quite area for adults. Nothing fancy, comfortable, but busy. I feel like there is always a conference here. My friend recommended the Palazzo for a quieter hotel and pool area.. The food - the buffet was very disappointing. Though there were lots of meat, I only eat fish and veggies. They did have lots of crab legs, some shrimp, miniscule sushi rolls, and lox was the only fish served. Their chinese area was blah! blah! blah!. Go to M Hotel for the best buffet for the price, the locals go there. Lots of restaurant choices but be ready to spend money. Nothing in this hotel is cheap. The show: Elvis...forget it. Wished we didn't watched it at all. What we liked: we enjoyed having a quite drink and night cap at the Mandarin Oriental. Having the monorail to Bellagio also was convenient. The Crystal complex mall was awesome if you want to buy exclusive stuff. Treasure hunting for the various art work around the City Center was fun. The management was willing to listen to our suggestions. Big question: would we return to his hotel. Yes. Is ti worth it, probably not. This is Vegas after all. If you want to experience New York, Italy or France, just fly there. I would. But if you just want a place to sleep in and feel comfortable, the room was good enough for me to come back.

It was my fourth Las Vegas visit within 10 years, last stays included Monte Carlo, Bellagio and THE Hotel @ Mandalay Bay. All being MGM signatures. It was my first visit with no major construction on the strip going on, which was great in itself. One year ago, the new CityCenter had not even opened. So here we are. First the basics:There are some things in LV casino resorts which - opposite to other revievers - don't freak me out any more: a) long walkways (almost ever to cross the casinos) from self parking (go with it, at least it is free - or use valet) b) crowded check-ins in particular on weekends (stay calm an relaxed, come past 3pm and earlier than 6pm) c) Fancy and overpriced shopping & eating @ on site locations (eat & shop elsewhere or invest in the buffets on site if one giant meal per day does it for you) d) Clean rooms just on first view (if you had some thousand room changes a day with messy guests - you clean could you be on a budget?) e) Unorganized Front Desk, almost no personal touch (new computer systems, loads of work, high number of staff -> nope, you cannot do much better on a budget, really) --- I would take the said issues as given; still Aria has some special ups and downs from my point of view based on this weekend stay: Downs: 1) I booked a room with \"strip view\" (=City View category) on a \"high level\" with \"two queens\" via a travel agency. None of that got transmitted to the hotel (which of course is NOT the hotels fault in any way). I got to 18th floor (50+ floors available) in a one king room with a partly view on the strip while mainly overseeing CityCenter entrance. View could be better but was fine, still I asked for a room change on the other issues which they promised to take care on \"next day\" due to overbooking. To make a long story short: See (e) - it never happened so we kept that room. No big fuzz on independence weekend. My point is: Just do not promise what you cannot hold! I do not like that. 2) The fancy in-room-giga-electronic-service-system is somewhat fancy but of no real use from my poit of view. It took more time to operate than it would help. 3) Pool hours & noise level: Pool hours is only 8am-8pm and the noise level by music is far too much Ups: 4) Pool area design. Beside what I stated in (3), the pool area is really nice. There are three pools (a little shallow water) and many shadowy places to hide away from direct sun. 5) Rooms: Rooms are spacy and modern designed. Room cleaning was okay, maybe even better than what I experienced at the Monte Carlo (shabby), Bellagio (Broken Glass under bed and hairs in shower) or THE Hotel (moths through climate system). Strange: They have a somewhat combined shower/bath unit (hard to explain, look hotel website floor plan). 6) Location: Probably best you can have at the literal city center on the strip from my perspective. --- All in all, I cannot give full points due to the \"usual\" stuff to experience in LV (see a-e). But anyway, if you get a good deal on the rooms it is really an upscale casino location in Las Vegas. I would definitely recommend. If you are looking for less people & noise, I recommend going to an no-gaming all-suite hotel like the Vdara on the CityCenter complex.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "White Rock, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNicer than average casino (but if concerned about LEEDS, go all the way and make it smoke-free!)\u201d", "Author": "Quaris", "ReviewID": "UR69698046", "Content": "Visited Aria on 3 different days.

We had problems with the lights --- only had 1 accent light that worked in the bedroom. And the lite bulb went out in the water closet the first day. It took 3 days to fix the lights -- even though the housekeeper had asked for someone to fix these on our second day. When it wasn't fixed after 24hrs I asked to speak to a manager and was told no one was available. The next day when it still wasn't fixed I went down and did speak to a manager who said she would have some fix the lights but could answer how long that would take as it depended where I was in queue. Really after 2 days I would hope I would be at the top of the queue. She did get it fixed that evening. She offered to comp our room upgrade but at checkout I had to remind them of that and they adjusted the bill. The hotel itself is lovely -- modern and edgy. The casino was fine.

The hotel does not offer shuttle service to the airport, so we had to get our own. They drop you off in an underground garage and since you don't know any better, you decide to walk to the front desk. Well, bring your pedometer- it took forever! I thought I was going to have a heart attack carrying 2 heavy bags (I'm only 5'2\", 120#). Check-in was a mob scene, but ok. Then, it was another long haul to my room. Good luck getting into your room- there's no slot for the room key and after standing there for 5 minutes in a sweat with all my luggage, I finally figured out that you have to \"wave\" the key in front of the door in order for it to open (could they have told me that at check-in?) Once in the room, it was dirty with carpet stains, smudges on the window, and long black hair in the bathroom (mine's brown). It also looked like there were blood stains on the tile, but it turned out to be part of the natural tile- bad choice. The room is a \"smart room\" where everything is connected to a \"central control panel\" on the TV, including the lights, alarms, curtains, etc. Another thing they should have explained. There are only 2 outlet on the desk for chargers- not enough for a business traveler. The other 2 are by the front door (not convenient) and in the bathroom. Food was RIDICULOUSLY expensive- I paid $25 for a cheesesteak. There are NO vending machines on the floors, just ice, and there are NO coffemakers in the rooms. Also, internet service is NOT free- $15/day. Not happy. Good luck going to bed early, they flood the windows with spotlights at night- no match for the curtains. My boss also got food poisoning one night. To go anywhere in this hotel is a long haul. Also the decor is cold and modern. The staff are very unfriendly. The service stinks- we went to a hotel restaurant one night and they made us wait to be seated even thought the place was empty. Another annoying thing is that security stops pretty much everyone at the elevator and asks to see your room key. I guess that's good, but annoying when your arms are full of shopping bags. Why don't they just require a key to get on the elevator?? One good thing I discovered was the gift shop downstairs. Way, way in the back is \"cheap\" food with $3 bottles of water and snacks. Another gold mine is if you go out the doors by the Coffee Bean cafe towards the Mirage (a relatively short walk) there is a food court with Starbucks, Subway, Sbarro, and McD's! Woo-Hoo!

NOTE ON SELF PARKING- The garage could be tricky to find, if you don't know what your looking for. you need to be in the far left lane for the Aria garage and it is the second ramp down. The Experience We arrived at 9:30 am and were able to check-in early (normally it is 3 pm). The front desk staff was friendly accommodating. The whole resort was very clean and the air quality was wonderful. The complex is huge, but there is plenty of signage. The Room Our room, a Deluxe Guestroom, was quite nice. It was silent at night. We were on the 20th floor and had a great view of the Strip. The technology was fun, but make sure that you aren't trying to control the lights manually while your other half is playing with the remote! The bathroom was beautiful and the amenities were nice. You should note that if you desire turndown service it is on request. The walk from the elevator to our room was not too bad. The charge for internet is not listed is the $15 per day. The size for the room was just fine. It wasn't huge, but very comfortable. Your not in Vegas to hang out in your room anyway, right? Dinning The buffet was amazing! We booked a $99 a night room with a $75 food/beverage credit. The F/B credit was nice and covered our breakfast each day and a few extras. The breakfast buffet is $14.95 - not too shabby. Parking We didn't have a problem with it. The self parking was easy to find, just PAY ATTENTION when you pull into the drive you need to be in the FAR left lane for the Aria garage. Overall the Aria was great and we will stay here again. My big advice to people traveling, whether to Aria or not, you have to be nice to the staff to get friendliness in return. Expectations are great, but just because the place is new you shouldn't expect they will give you everything for free.

I can DEFINATELY say that Aria was by far the best hotel experience till date. When we walked in, the service man quickly came to collect our luggage with instruction. When we entered the lobby, we were absolutely floored. The aroma of vanilla flowed throughout the hotel, the staff were so nice and courtious. At the check in, the staff had noticed a line forming, some people started to complain about the wait (all of five minutes) and the staff quickly opened more lines. It took us roughly 10-15 minutes to get situated. When we got to our room on the 35th floor, entering the room was a breeze, just wave the card in front of the sensor and your in! once in the room, the view was breathtaking, the bathroom has a double sink with a shower and bath for two...the bathroom is private behind frost glass. The room was very high tech, we were able to conrol everything in the room inc. phone, drapes and tv from remote control. They had FREE WiFi, Ipod hook up etc. The buffet was amazing!!!!!!!!!!! Lobster people, all you can eat for a reasonable price. They have a tram (space aged) that will take you from Aria to the Bellagio and Ceasars Palace. The pool is relaxing, and the location of the hotel is somewhat in the middle of the strip. What I especially liked is that after a certain time, only hotel guest can go to certain areas of the hotel. The only down side of the hotel is that the gym is an additional cost BUT THATS IT!!!!

Vegas has a reputation for overly firm beds. Thankfully that is giving way to the more comfortable beds. But everyone knows that its safer to err on the side of firmness over \"too soft\". Too soft results in very uncomfortable sleep and is extremely bad for your back. They went way too far on the \"comfort\" concept for this one. It was so bad that I literally had to flip the bed over onto the hard side and lay on that in order to sleep. Way too firm, but better than a hammock.

There were plenty of slot machines to play and of course all new. We thought the slots were very loose! There seemed to be lots of tables as well. The cocktail waitresses come around very frequently too. Last but not least, the music playing in the casino was AWESOME!!!

If your going to Vegas on vacation, and looking for time at the pool, casino, shops, yadda, yadda, yadda....book someplace else. My wife and I stayed at Aria for three nights in June. Leading up to our trip I read every review on the property I could find. Having benefited from the shared knowledge of others, I felt compelled to write a review and share my thoughts on this new property. In my opinion, it is a large conference hotel, designed specifically for that purpose (large meetings, trade shows, multi-state conferences, etc). Unfortunately, this hotel opened at the worst possible time for a new conference facility and is having to reinvent itself somewhat into a hotel that caters to the weekend and leisure travelers. Everything at Aria is set up to deal with large numbers of people; the hallways are wide, the buffet is great, the elevators are fast, and the 4,000 rooms are efficient and clean. FYI - for those of you who have had trouble booking a room with two queens - this makes sense - it's because very few conference travelers would want this. Most people out of town on business, or attending a conference, request a king bed, a desk, and standard room amenities. The beds are silly comfortable. That said, we did not have a bad time at this hotel. Check-in was smooth, our room was comfortable, and the casino gave as much as it took (in the end...it still took). We hung out at the pool one day and it was very nice. My only knock on the pool is no drinks in the water. This must be due to the eco-friendly \"green\" factor of the hotel. A pool with a pina colada in it is harder to clean and filter and would probably require a less 'green' filtration system. I'm in Vegas, I'll recycle and be a good person when I get home. When it's 110 outside, I want a cold beer and a cool pool. We had no problems with noise. No problems with house-keeping. And, everyone we met was friendly and helpful. Although, I do think the hotel is slightly understaffed - but that's probably more of a sign of the times than a direct reflection on the hotel. Finally, I'm not sure what the standard is to be a true \"five star\" hotel. Whatever it is, I think Aria misses it by one star. Not because the facilities are not nice (the spa is amazing). But because I think Aria is missing the extras that make staying in an upscale hotel 'upscale'. We had dinner and caught the show at Wynn while we were in town and there is a distinct difference in walking into and around Wynn vs. the Aria. The best way I can describe it is that Wynn has a Private Country Club feel, while Aria is more of a business center with neat stuff. We probably would not stay at Aria again.

To our dismay, we were greeted with none during check-in. The staff which assisted us was wearing a glum face, with entirely no smile. 2) Room was absolutely short of basic amenities This was the main reason why we had to say this isn't worth to be rated a 5-star. We were not provided with any toiletries upon check-in. Also, one set of face/hand towels was missing, no bedroom slippers provided and there was only 1 bathrobe. Perhaps an oversight on the housekeeping but this is pretty serious. It just seemed housekeeping did a half-hearted job cleaning up on the previous guest. Although these items were replaced after we made a request for it, but no apologies given whatsoever. 3) Poor Maintenance of room - Faulty Bathtub, Fused Lamp What more disappointing can it get when you can't even enjoy a relaxing bath after a scorching hot day in Las Vegas. We tried to drain the water off but couldn't cause the sinker isn't working. Made a complaint to the front desk in person regarding this and other various stuffs. Still no sign of any apology and met with yet another non-smiling staff. Said the tub would be fixed in an hour. We went out, came back and it was not fixed. We also got a bedside lamp that was fused..... 4) No Coffee-making facility Not sure if we were asking for too much. But don't the hotel provide water flask and complimentary coffee/tea for guests? Even a 2-star hotel provides that. We do notice the room was very well stock-up in non-complimentary food/ beverages. But, who needs to purchase those fancy-looking chocolates, nuts, drinks in the room when the world-class Jean Philippe Patisserie is just down the lobby, right next to the guest elevators. A decent water flask and some complementary food would do the job. Needless to say, with all these imperfections, this would be our first and last time staying with Aria. There are still many short-falls this hotel has compared with the other 5-star in Vegas in terms of casino, buffet etc, but we think these are pretty minor. We really hope the hotel management puts more effort into making this hotel a deserving world-class 5-star resort.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!!!!\u201d", "Author": "vegaslover99", "ReviewID": "UR68462990", "Content": "Don't pass up the opportunity to stay at this hotel!!

One of the things they are going to change is the buffet and we LOVED the buffet and had eaten at Wynn's buffet the night before and Aria's was so much better. Also no line up to get in and not squashed beside the next table. Great crab legs and everything fresh. The only complaint was they were short of table servers and the older gentleman who was looking after our table was run ragged he had such a big area to cover. This is not a complaint against him he busy the whole time but felt it was very unfair of management not to have sufficient wait staff. He had to take abuse from customers who insisted on immediate service and I felt sorry for him. The night we were there you could have lobster if you paid extra and the lobster was so small it was not worth the time to cook it. Lesson learned...do not bother with the lobster but everything else was so good. The hotel was just beautiful. I am not big on modern design but this hotel was great. We had a comp'd room in a tower suit and it was just so nice. Prior to staying at Aria we were comp'd three nights at the Palazzo so I had a good reference point for comparison. I thought Aria was superior. I just loved the seperate bedroom with the floor to ceiling windows right beside the bed. The bathroom was beautiful and loved the frosted sliding doors to the bathroom. The layout of the bathroom is different from the discription I have read about the regular rooms. The little extras made the experience so much better. A small box of toothpaste and toothbrush, a box with a shaver plus all the usual stuff. The bed was so comfortable we contacted Seally when we got back to Canada to see where we could purchase a mattress like it. Another bonus about the suit was the fridge it the bar area. It had it's own ice making machine so we did not have to go in search of ice....Just loved this hotel room. We thought Crystals was great, it was like walking inside of a actual work of art. I never had a problem walking around with out a place to sit. I always find the walk from Encore to Wynn a long haul and have had to stopp numerous times because if have a problem with my hip. When we arrived there were not a lot of people waiting to be served and there was a host who assisted us to the next available registration clerk so check in was efficient. Our room was not ready and this is the first time in all the years we have been coming to Vegas that we could not get in our room early but this is only a compent not a complaint. After we registered we asked the host if there was someplace we could pick up our room key with out standing in line again and he said we just had to come to him and tell him and he would get us in the next available line. Restraunts.....the 24 hour cafe (can not remember the name) was good for breakfast but were not impressed with lunch or supper. Staff....all the staff with one exception were very friendly and helpful. The man at the players booth was kind of condesending. I had trouble getting my free play to work and it was a long walk from my slot machine back to the players desk to get it fixed and he seemed annoyed with me but everyone has bad days. The players desk was sufficiently staffed and the casino wait staff were excellent and never had to wait for a drink. I was looking for a particular slot machine and asked a staff member and he walked me right to the machine which I thought was great. OK so now I will tell you why I will not return to Aria. I love to play the slots which is why we get our rooms comp'd. I will play for hours on penny machines which are around $3.50 a pull for max bet. I did not like the set up of the slot machines. They do not give you the option of picking the number of line you want to play or how much you want to bet per line. Instead its bet 50 or 100 or 150 ect. I like to be in control of my betting and be able to change the number of line and value of the bet if I feel the machine is to tight or in a winning mode. I really hated this new way of betting and gambling is a big part of my Vegas vacation. I play were i stay so the casino needs to meet my gambling requirements and this casino does not. I did not mind the darkness of the casino and even liked the darkness but gambling experience was not good so I will return to Palazzo for future visits.

We had to LOL because tho our experience this time is better, it was a bit of a wild time last visit. My mother died this year. I came to Aria end of April to relax. My computer guru husband went to the room computer to close the drapes and turn on the tv. Nothing was working. He called the front desk. They were sending someone up. 5 min later the drapes suddenly close, TV shuts down, lights are all off and we're in total darkness. We are stunned and spooked. Mark calls the front desk to tell them what happened, they said they'd send someone up. Waiting again, Mark tried to change some things on the room controls. Nothing worked. Mark tried the TV remote. Nothing works. Suddenly the drapes fly open, the TV turns on to new age nature music, all the lights come on. Mark calls the front desk to tell them. Same answer. We'll send someone up. We're still waiting when I hear a horse galloping and I'm freaking out a little bit. Took me a minute to realize it was the nature music channel. Suddenly the drapes close, the tv shuts down and we're in darkness again, laughing at ourselves and the situation. Finally there's a knock on the door. A young man with a backpack is there to reset everything. He explains the TV remote often stops working when the computer has been reset. *light dawns* They reset the computer 3xs remotely WITHOUT telling us they were doing it, or what would happen. Now the young man remotely resets computer and remotely resets the remote and leaves. He didn't look like or act like an Aria employee. His arrival and departure was surreal. We're back at Aria again because of a great deal, and this time we experienced what they were going for - as we walked into our room the drapes opened, the TV came on to a Jazz station, and the bed reading lights came up. Ahhh, that's the greeting that's supposed to happen. BTW, our first visit we had an incredible dinner and service at Barmasa Restaurant. That and the pool area are fond memories, and brought us back.

Found a great deal for a corner suite at Aria, and boy was it a great room! We were able to set up my son's pack and play in the half bathroom, so that we didnt need to tiptoe around while he was napping. it's a very large half bath! As far as the room goes, we were on the 14th floor and had an incredible view! Our corner suite overlooked the pool, Monte Carlo and the interior of City Center. We could see Paris, Planet Hollywood, MGM Grand, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay and Palms, among other properties. The rooms was nicely appointed. The TVs were big and had lots of HD channels (no HBO thought). The master bath was huge, with a nice whirlpool tub, separate shower and 2 sinks. The view from the bathroom was the best in the suite. The bidet was pretty cool. The bed was cozy and everything seemed clean and modern in style. The room controls, including the curtains, TVs, thermostats and lights, were pretty nifty. Overall, the room was great. On the downside, as cool as the room controls were, it was a pain not to have manual overrides for some of the lights. to turn on only a desk lamp in the living room, you either had to turn on the TV and use the remote control to navigate to room controls and turn it on there, or use the touch-screen controller in the bedroom. The channel guide on the TV was slow, often not displaying the wrong program information, and was unresponsive when we tried changing channels a few times. Other reviews that the halls are long are not understatements... when I was alone, I'd jog through the halls to our suite (at the end of the hall), and it would take 103 long jogging strides, 30-40 seconds of running to get from the elevator. The hotel/casino was beautiful, and not quite as dark as it seemed the first time we walked through on a previous trip. EVERYTHING is overpriced. A coffee that would normally be $3 at starbucks was $7 at their coffee shop. Fortunately we had resort credit with our package, otherwise we wouldnt have purchased anything. We ate at the buffet twice (with our resort credit). Both times the food was pretty much the same, and as vegetarians, had little for us. The sushi was ok. Naan was delicious. Salad bar was small. There were lots of carving stations and seafood entrees that would make it a better value, if we ate them. Overall, not terrible for the price, but I've liked the Rio and Planet Hollywood buffets better. the cookies and other desserts were pretty good. We went to the pool one morning, around 8am, when it was still in the shade of the building. It was nice and quiet, other than music being played. I play blackjack and craps, and my wife and I both play poker. The poker room only had 1 4-8 limit table, only at night. everything else was no-limit, which we dont play. We didnt come back the second night, in favor of monte carlo's poker room. I played a little $10 BJ, and $10 craps, but later went over to MC in favor of $5 craps. One cool thing about the poker room, though, is the Ivey Room, where we saw a few famous poker players in a $150k buy-in game. After we each played for a few days we went over to the players club desk to ask about comps and the woman had such an attitude, basically refusing to check and see if we'd earned a few dollars. She said we should just go to dinner and charge it to our room, and after we checked out, the players club would see about comping the meal. (seriously???) We then went to the poker room and told our story and were given the $9 of comps we earned there as well as a $20 food and beverage voucher to make up for the other lady being nasty to us. When we got up to the room we called the front desk to tell them about how disappointed we were with that woman and they offered $50 food and beverage credit, as well as 2 free spa entries. So, customer service isnt all that bad -- dont let one bad apple ruin the whole bunch. All in all, a pretty good experience. The thing is, unless we're staying at Aria again (which will take a really really sweet deal with resort credit), we probably wont visit again. no reason to walk all the way from the strip, through the overpriced mall, just to get to a bland, overpriced casino. The tram doesnt do much, since it's a longer walk to the back of bellagio or MC to reach the stations, than it is to simply walk straight up the path from the strip. Even though we enjoyed our stay, we'll probably aim for ventian, wynn or bellagio next time we want a luxury hotel. A few notes -- call the valet before you leave the room. if you take your ticket to the north valet, it'll take 20 minutes for them to get your car.

Yikes! I don't know if all the flights arrive in Vegas at the same time or do people not know that at ARIA you can check in at any hour as long as they have a room available? Overall, the hotel is absolutely gorgeous--the design, the colors and textures. It was fun to walk around and be impressed by all the work that went into it. Absolutely, stunning! ROOMS The room was clean although there was debris on the floors of the wing not only where we were staying but also on the other floors where friends were staying on, which is why I did not rate cleanliness as excellent. I loved the set up of the shower and tub! I lamented not bringing bubble bath, but the shower gel worked nicely. The low point of our stay would have to be the temperature controls of the room. No matter how much we fiddled with it, the temperature never lowered than to what we requested. And it was very much 100 degree weather outside. We didn't figure this out until late the evening we stayed since we were out of the room all day. It was hot and miserable and made it difficult to sleep. POOL The pool area was comfortable and we enjoyed prompt and attentive cocktail service. FOOD We love food and dining out and the restaurants did not disappoint. Sure, the prices are high, but for the type of property it is ranked in the league of Wynn, Encore, and the Bellagio, what do you expect?? The prices of a food court or Outback? I don't think so! We ate at Julian Serrano for lunch one day (Yum!! Loved the red, white sangria and tried a bunch of dishes-- too many to name *blush*. Save room for the churros with spicy chocolate dipping sauce). For dinner did the tasting at Sirio for dinner (a great value given the portion size and the selection. also great service!!), and had breakfast at Silk Road at Vdara which is a five minute walk from the guest elevators. If you enjoy breakfast taken to the next level, you must check this out! On Sunday they have brunch. The blueberry ricota pancakes were heavenly and I still dream of eating them to this day!! VIVA ELVIS A fun show, not the original style of Cirque du Soliel show heavy on acrobatics, but enjoyable if you can appreciate dance. An energetic cast, the live band, and video footage of Elvis made it a fun night out. Ticket prices are on the higher end of other Cirque shows. As a hotel guest, you get a comp seat upgrade. SERVICE The staff we came in contact with had a pleasant demeanor. From the security stationed by guest elevators, the Concierge desk, Valet, I felt welcomed. Leading up to my visit and reading the reviews I have to say that it is unfortunate that one lapse of service delivered by one person mars the view of all of the staff. You can tell they take pride in what they do and there is genuine hospitality. Based on the experience I had, I would recommend critically sizing up the negative reviews. Some just vent and spew negativity without even indicating went wrong. My experience as a hotel guest at ARIA was a pleasant one and I would consider returning in a heartbeat.

Whether it's by design or happenstance, I tend to get disoriented in some of these large properties. We only stayed for one day at our last visit . This time we were there for four nights . So we became more familiar with the location of the pool, gym, elevators, restaurants, tram, and the other hotels. in other words, i didn't get lost as much ! Also, the Aria doesn't really have a 7-11 type store where you can go and purchase convenience items, but we found a nice ABC store across the street at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops. It shot up to about 106 degrees that weekend so we had to stock up on water to keep us hydrated. We found that the Monte Carlo is fairly close and they have some of the smaller denomination slots over there as well as a shopping area and McDonald's and Starbucks. It's always nice to walk through the Conservatory at the Bellagio and it's definitely easier to reach with the tram. One thing I noticed are the large numbers of young adults that dress up and party at these larger hotels on a Saturday night. It seemed that the casino was full of them and I can't believe that they were all staying at the hotel. Some were , probably, but I think most were just hanging out. Anyway, you can expect to see a huge influx of the hipsters on the weekend. I had more success at the tables on this trip as well as finding a good Blackjack machine to play on.

It\u2019s different in style and that\u2019s a good thing. We thought the casino was beautiful \u2013 the darker woods and colors were beautiful. We thought the dealers were all friendly. All of the staff we encountered at the hotel was wonderful and very friendly. We will return to Aria in a heartbeat but in the meantime \u2013 I have my Aria pillow I bought to bring home to use on my Bellagio mattress. We miss the beds at Aria already - they were sooo comfortable! The pillows were amazing as well which is why I bought one. We did not have any problems finding our way around Aria and Crystals \u2013 the tram was very handy and we used it a lot. No problems with a splashing sink as people have complained in other reviews. We thought the touchscreen keypad was very easy to use and it was nice to not get out of bed to open the curtains to take in the view! Check in: Very smooth \u2013 no wait in line at 11am on a Wednesday. We were hoping to upgrade to a corner suite but nothing was available as the hotel was sold out Friday night but they had city view for $15 a night. I told the girl no thanks but she did give us a pool view. We got upstairs and the room was still dirty so we went back downstairs. There were people in all of the lines for check-in but we were put in short check-out line (there were people directing traffic at the lines) and we were able to get to a window within a few minutes. The girl apologized and comped our first night stay for the inconvience-we didn\u2019t expect that at all \u2013 just a new room would have been fine with us. We had a deluxe room \u2013 beautiful view of the mountains. Loved our room, very comfortable and a nice size. I have worked in the service industry for years so a little mix up with the room didn't upset me at all - things happen! The Spa at Aria: AMAZING! I did the Vichy Body Experience and it was awesome. I had a pineapple/sugar body scrub and then the Vichy shower to rinse off. It was very relaxing and the therapist was awesome! All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. My husband got a day pass and came down to take advantage of the spa. We used the co-ed facilities together and split up to enjoy the other facilities. We enjoyed the Ganbanyoku beds \u2013 basically large marble surfaces with bamboo pillows (very comfy) and the marble was heated \u2013 it was so relaxing. We also liked the Shio Salt Room. You lay in chairs with headphones on and there is a control on the chair so that you can feel the vibrations of the music in the chair. We were in there for a good 30 minutes. After that we went to the 3rd floor infinity pool. It\u2019s a small pool and is very warm. It looks out over Liquid so we watched the chaos that was Liquid and said it was nothing we would be interested in doing. We split up after that and went to sit in the roman style baths and the saunas. We took showers and met in the fire side lounge. This is a lounge in front of the gym (beautiful gym \u2013 I should have worked out) with a giant fireplace and very comfy couches to sit and read the newspaper. The gym was a very good size and so nice! I really should have used it! The day before we went to the Spa at Aria, we had massages at Qua \u2013 they were very disappointing. I wouldn\u2019t go back to Qua but can\u2019t wait to return to Aria!!! We LOVED the robes at the spa but they don\u2019t sell them. I would have paid at least $100 for one of those robes \u2013 so comfortable. We really enjoyed the spa at Aria and my husband suggested we stay an extra day so he could go back to the spa for another day. Restaurants: Had the breakfast buffet one morning and it was so good! The service was fast, there were a lot of choices and the atmosphere was nice. I probably would have tried a dinner buffet if we had the time. Todd English Pub (technically in Crystals) \u2013 amazing! We went twice. The lobster rolls were so good \u2013 the flavor of the lobster was amazing. My husband had the chicken parm sliders and we split chicken wings \u2013 all were great. The 2nd time we went there he had the fish and chips and I had the prime rib from the carvery menu \u2013 soooo good! Pick a meat, pick a bread and pick 2 sauces and you build a sandwich at the table with all that yumminess. Dessert was by far the best thing we had our entire trip \u2013 a bread pudding with a toffee sauce, salted caramel ice cream (AMAZING) and captain crunch on top. So good! Pools: 3 decent sized pools, one that seemed more geared towards children, 3 hot tubs and then Liquid, the adult only pool. It was very easy to find a chair at the pool after 1pm and the cocktail waitresses were getting around the pool area quickly taking orders. The water felt great. Housekeeping: Everything was great. I left a $5 tip in an envelope each morning when we left the room and the room was always clean by the time we made it back to the room in early afternoon. The first morning after leaving the tip, the housekeeper even left me a note saying thank you and to enjoy our trip. Check out: Checked out at 5am and it was super easy. They still had to comp the one night off the room and that took about 2 minutes and I was out the door. Great service and everyone was friendly.

I was wrong--even in the middle of the night, the line was a mess, and the staff seemed overwhelmed. The man who checked us in was pleasant--we did the $20 sandwich trick and he told us we would be upgraded to a city view room and given a $50 room credit. Great. So, we get to our first room, and it is a city view, but it's also a smoking, double-bed city view--we had requested a king non-smoking. It reeked of smoke, and the kicker was that there were still bachelorette party balloons in the room from the last party. My husband called the front desk to complain and was informed that smoking/bed assignments are a REQUEST, not a guarantee and that actual assignments are at the hotel's discretion. Um, thanks, nothing like making your guests feel special. After much negotiation, they finally agreed to move us to a king smoking room (there were no other non-smoking rooms available) So, room 2...(drumroll please)...is a double, smoking, city view room. In other words, the EXACT room they put us in in the first place, just 10 floors down. Once again, my husband called the front desk to complain, was put on hold for 30 minutes, and then was promptly hung up on. Fearful that I'll have to come up with bail for my husband if he goes to the front desk, I instead go down to complain. After waiting in line for another 30 minutes (it's 2:00 a.m. by this point), I finally explain the situation once again and am promised this time that we will at least get a king bed. So, I go up to the new room (Room 3, for those of you keeping count), try the key and...nothing. The room key doesn't work. At this point we're both exhausted and I'm on the verge of tears--I pick up the house phone and call the front desk, who informs us that we need to talk to security. After being on hold waiting for security for 30 minutes...I get hung up on again. I call back and (I'm usually a very nice person, btw) absolutely freak out on the person who answers, who takes it upon herself to call security up to our room. After another 20 minutes of sitting outside the room with all our luggage, the security guard shows up, and we're finally, finally in our hotel room. So...yay. Long story even longer, we were given a $100 room credit for our troubles and they promised to call us the next day to move us to a non-smoking room. We were there for 3 nights. Never got a phone call. After the initial nightmare experience, though, we actually had a wonderful time. We're not big gamblers, so I can't really tell you what the casino was like, but the hotel itself is like nothing else in Vegas--it's beautiful in an understated, elegant way, and the architecture, design, and layout is incredible. We spent 5 hours the first day at the Liquid pool, and it was heaven--amazing service, relaxed atmosphere, and delicious food and drink. It was pricey, but nothing in Vegas comes cheap. We had breakfast one morning at the Jean-Philippe Patisserie (oh my god the Nutella brioche), and a pretty decent late night snack at the 24-hour cafe, but we did most of our eating off-site, so I'm not really qualified to review the restaurants. In all, we got a very good deal with our AmEx card (around $80 a night) so I'm satisfied with our stay there, headaches and all.

(Of course, it didn't hurt that the casino gave us a generous comp package.) Lest you think this review is rose-colored because just about everything was free for us, I'll divulge that we suffered record losses at the tables during this trip....and still loved every damn minute at this resort. (minus the 6am air horns from the construction site across Harmon Ave.; more about that in a bit). Got upgraded to a panoramic corner suite with floor-to-ceiling windows and 180 degree views of the strip in both directions (even from the soaking tub!!)--IMO, would be worth every penny even if paying the rack rate. This time around, I confirmed many of the previous good impressions I had about Aria, made some new observations (good and not so good), and now feel prepared to accurately summarize and comment on some of the common themes emerging from other reviews on TA that I think might be helpful to those still on the fence about staying here. New observations: --Tried the buffet this time; overall pretty darn good. Impressed with the king crab legs, variety of well-cooked and tasty carved meats, and desserts. Neverbeen to a buffet that had desserts refined enough, in taste and presentation, to serve at a 4-star restaurant. Atmosphere wasn't anything to write home about, but a table overlooking the pools helps offset the swanky cafeteria feel. --Saw the Viva Elvis show with fairly low expectations since I've never been a big Elvis fan, but ended up really liking the production and gained a new appreciation for the King. It's not a typical CDS show, but the trampoline scene with the comic book heroes had plenty of \"Holy Crap!\" moments. Incorporation of at least ten different genres of dance that wifey counted, many of which weren't even around when Elvis was, made it more relatable to our younger perspective. --The pools were relaxing and offered plenty of shade and crowd dispersal since there are three separate pool areas. Didn't hit the meat-market Liquid Club area, but heard good reviews about that too from some young stallions at the craps tables. --Wifey said the spa was a joy and among the best she's been to in any city. --Construction still happening across the street on Harmon Ave. side of the hotel that creates substantial noise in the early morning hours (~6am). Probably the biggest negative during our stay, but staff was very understanding and apologetic; they said the work is supposed to be finished within a few months. Confirmed impressions: --Sage is one of the best new restaurants in Vegas. Superb creativity and execution of dishes, and primo service. Had the seared scallops this time--transcendent. --The wall of cascading water in front of the hotel is hypnotizing; creates a super cool zen-like feel amidst the chaos and glitz that lies just steps away on the Strip. --The beds are total heaven. Had a very hard time getting the wife to leave the bed during the day. --Still amazed by the fact that my clothes had ZERO smoky smell the day after spending the majority of the day and night in the casino, a tribute to their cutting edge ventilation system. Phenomenal green technology behind the scenes in this place! --On that note, the in-room touch control pad is a godsend. It's utterly brilliant to be able to change the room temperature, shut off the bathroom lights, close the curtain in the sitting room, pick some mood music, and put on the \"privacy\" light outside the door without ever having to get out of bed. --Can't say enough about the attention to aesthetic detail throughout the resort. The way they engage all of your senses is remarkable. Even noticed that different parts of the resort have different scents circulating (vanilla in casino, floral in spa, etc.). So much texture in materials used on walls, fixtures, and furniture. Music is hip and at just the right volume. Architecture stunning and edgy art installations everywhere. --Service continues to improve, but not yet on par with places like Bellagio, Palazzo, Wynn. Spoke to several managerial folks in different departments, and they all seemed well aware of the concerns being voiced and talked with surprising candor about the improvement plans that have been implemented. Summary of common TA criticisms: 1) \"it's too far of a walk from the elevators to the room, or from the hotel to the Strip\" --Well, I timed it to give some objective data to help you: 81 sec. from the elevators to our room at the very end of the hall; 5.5 min. (the long way, at a moderate walk) from hotel lobby to Las Vegas Blvd. Too far? Seriously people? Keep in mind that the slight extra distance to the Strip keeps some of the fanny-packed, rubber-necking tourists away and thus maintains the chic feel for the rest of us. 2) \"the hotel decor is cold and sterile\" --actually, I think it's quite the opposite; the interactive technology makes it quite inviting, and the richness of the materials, textures, and styles creates a lot of warmth and interest for all the senses. If anything, the resort is a triumph in good design. 3) \"the service sucks because we booked a two-queen room and all they had at check-in were king rooms, and we had to wait hours for the room we wanted\" --yes, it's true, there aren't enough two-queen rooms in the resort, and they clearly state that room type is not guaranteed at booking, so don't be so surprised to hear this when you check in. If you absolutely need two queens guaranteed in stone and immediately available on a busy weekend, probably not a great idea to stay here. 4) \"it's just not for us, not the Vegas we know\" --I'd guess the target audience who would appreciate Aria most would be the 25-40 y.o. young professional group and/or those with some affinity for modern design and technology. So if you don't fall into these groups, consider the possibility you're setting yourself up for disappointment by staying at ARia. Aria does not offer the same brand of luxury or Vegas feel that places like Bellagio, Palazzo, or Wynn do.

We stayed at the Aria for 9 nights commencing 25 May - which ended up with Memorial Day weekend right in the middle - something we didn't realise until we arrived in the US. I'll break the review down into sections...... Check in: We arrived on a Tuesday night at about 9pm - unsurprisingly, there was no queue at check in. Unlike our previous experiences, the check in agent wasn't particularly chatty but she was professional and efficient. We asked about upgrades and we were advised that there were some available but they were not complimentary. So we asked how much a corner suite would be, and the agent said it would be $50 a night. As we were in Vegas to celebrate our anniversary, we thought why not? So we accepted, and within 10 mins, we had our key cards, a map of the property and directions to the 25th floor. So we didn't experience any of the nightmare delays at check in - more likely as a result of the time we checked in, but maybe perhaps the glitches have been smoothed out - ?? The room - Corner Suite: The extra $50 a night was so worth it - the room was 900-ish sq ft, separate living/dining area, extra half-bathroom, GIANT bathroom with twin sinks and separate bath tub which looked out onto the Strip through the floor-to-ceiling windows. The loo had a heated toilet seat and (get this!) a cleansing AND drying device - !!! The bed was really comfortable - there was a very soft mattress \"topper\" which lay on top of a firm mattress, so it's wasn't like sleeping in a meringue - it was super comfortable. Now - the touchscreen controls........lots of complaints on previous reviews. In our experience, we were able to use the touchscreen controls the second we picked up the unit without referring to the instructions. The icons I can remember included curtains, lighting, heating, TV, music and services which I think included putting on the privacy light, checking your room charges etc. The screen is resistive so works best when you tap firmly with a fingernail. Tap on curtains, there's a tab for each room and then a choice of right and left sheer or blackout curtains - tap your button of choice, and voila, the curtains did your bidding. I personally cannot see what is confusing about that. If you really hate that touch screen unit, there is actually no need to use it at all - all the curtains, lights, room temperature, TV etc can be controlled by clearly marked switches in each room as in any other bog standard low-tech hotel room! My only complaint was that the touchscreen unit was quite bright, so I had to lay it on its face when I wanted to sleep - even pressing dimming button didn't dim it enough for my liking. Housekeeping: For the most part, housekeeping was pretty good. The room was always cleaned to a high standard, even folding away our clothes or hanging them in the wardrobe. They were a bit spotty with replenishing the bathroom amenities - on one occasion, the removed ALL the bottles, even the full ones, and did not replace them. We had to ring housekeeping to bring us some more - which took about 20 mins with a prompting phonecall. There was one day when they didn't clean the room, but most likely it was because in we were in the room for the best part of the day recovering from a big night out. However, they did leave a message on our phone explaining that they tried to clean the room but the privacy light was on. They said to give them a call when we wanted the room serviced. So whenever we had a lie in (and we had a lot given that we were in Vegas!), we called housekeeping when we were ready to have the room serviced - and on every occasion it was. There was a turn-down service, but we were usually in the room getting ready for the evening when they came round so we weren't fussed about missing out on the chocolate on our pillow! Restaurants: We often had breakfast in Cafe Vettro which was always excellent - although a bit on the pricey side. The corn beef hash was the best I've ever had. Service was excellent 90% of the time, good for the remaining 10%. We had dinner in Blossom where experienced some of the best service in any restaurant we've ever been to. Food was delicious too. We had dinner at the Buffet twice - both times excellent. I only have the MGM buffet as a point of comparison - and then, it was for lunch so not a direct comparison. But I will say that the food on offer was fantastic - particularly the desserts, the chocolate pudding was to die for, and some of them were so pretty to look at, it was a shame to eat them! The Chinese food was divine - especially the sea bass in miso glaze, I had about 6 portions! Pool: I loved the pool scene here - there were 3 fair sized pools, plenty of loungers, always managed to find a pair together. One of the pools had more kids than the others but the other pools were always pretty peaceful. Good drinks service although pricey as with all Vegas pools - $8 for a beer. Casino: By far the most generous casino with the loosest slots! I did really well with the Sex and the City and the Monopoly slots - hit big each time I played them. The staff were great - one staff member went to get me a new copy of my player's card whilst I carried on playing, another saw us queuing at a bill breaker machine - she broke our bills for us. Location: Couple of complaints about the hotel being located far off the strip - we found that if you went out the North Valet entrance, walked past the art gallery and the few boutiques, you were on the Strip within 10 minutes walk from your room. We did use the tram but we found it was so much quicker and easier to walk - even when I was wearing sky high heels! Overall impression: We previously stayed at the Signature, the Palazzo and THEhotel, all stays of 7-9 nights, all superb hotels - in our experience, Aria topped them all. The superb room may have tipped the balance in its favour but the great facilities, the stylish decor, the lovely chocolatey/coconut aroma, the convenient central Strip location - it was definitely our best stay in Vegas.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ceredigion Wales", "Title": "\u201cwhat's the problem\u201d", "Author": "antmeister", "ReviewID": "UR66592159", "Content": "Just arrived home from my annual holiday to Vegas.

By way of example, shuttles and limos from the airport arrive in an un-airconditioned space under the hotel with no help from a bell desk to be found. Be prepared for the typical Vegas maze through the entire length of the casino floor with all of your luggage in tow before you find the hotel lobby (you retreat 1/2 the distance back to the guest elevators after checking in). I know the game - I'll wander the maze to find food, theaters, shops, etc..., but please, not with my luggage after an extended wait in the sun at McCarrent Int'l Airport for a cab or limo (those who don't know, be prepared to wait up to an hour for a cab, shuttle, or limo during peak travel times). The buffet, creatively named \"The Buffet\" lays out an impressive spread, but given the investment in the basic dishes presented, the lack of minor touches and effort fail to make either the gourmet or regular dinner meal worthwhile. For example, a nicely grilled flank steak was on offer - great bark, nicely cooked, but not seasoned in any way and the taste of the meat was lost. Why did they bother? New Englad clam chowder was prepared with a roux that was not adequately mixed (flour texture and taste were dominant) and the clams and potatoes were sparse at best. Likewise with many of the other restaurants on property - great selection, but those that I sampled just fell short. If I'm going to order a $12 sandwich, I'm going to be let down when I've had better in any other major city for less. Why did they invest in a tandoori oven on the serving line if it's only going to be used for naan? The rooms look wonderful, have great views, and are spacious with nice amentities on hand - great lighting and entertainment controls. But then the desk chair I worked at was poor at best and the hotel needs to find where Marriott and Hyatt purchase their beds as this one missed the mark. As stated, the views are good, but not well insulated from sound - road noise and sirens were heard throughout the night and I stayed on an upper floor. The bathroom is very large with great tubs incorporated into the shower area - a great concept that loses it's muster because they didn't spend the extra $5 to get a worthwhile showerhead. If you're short, bring a stool as the commodes are rather tall. The hotel and casino have a wave-based pattern coupled to an almost minimalist design throughout that uses 70's colors - avacado green, browns, and other dark earth tones that attempt under-stated elegance but simply fall flat. The staff are inefficient - I stood in a line three deep for 20 minutes to check in and appeared to have a typical experience with flat, un-enthused staff. The dealers (I played some table games and poker) added no excitement or conversation. I did happen upon one cocktail waitress of the five that served me that had a great attitude and understood customer service. Her tips reflected such (and no, she wasn't flirty or the most attractive, just considerate, consistent, and worked hard at her job). A+ for building design as energy efficiency and smart building design features are noted throughout. However, please turn on the air conditioning in public spaces like guest room hallways, the lobby, and concourses near the pool. All-in-all, if you catch a rate less than $140/night on a weekday, it's well worth the money for the room, but not as a destination in and of itself. Save your money on the weekends. If you want all-inclusive real elegance, go to the Bellagio, real excitement, go to Planet Hollywood or the Rio, or a spa-retreat, make your way to Cesear's or Mandalay Bay. Better yet, give Tunica, Mississippi a try. And, as these sorts of reviews are often left by sour pusses who lost money or had some bad experience, I was here for a conference, gambled and left about even, and didn't get drunk and do stupid things.

Both were acceptable but certainly not fabulous and VERY expensive. In particular, one felt quite ripped off at Serrano. The portions were incredibly small. And I know that tapas is small plates to share- I've eaten tapas in Spain. But this was a joke- quality wasn't bad- just portion size.The pool area was the worst. Zillions of kids- hideously loud music blaring from many loudspeakers- shallow pools with warm water and chairs touching chairs- And no rules about babies with diapers in the pool. YUK!

The lobby and the layout is huge and confusing but i'm sure that has some sort of revenue strategy attached to it. At first the overpowering scent of vanilla was annoying but it masks the gross cigarette smell and after being anywhere else in Vegas it is a joy! the casino is dark and spooky and kinda makes you hesitant to gamble because of a resulted uneasy feeling. BUT after you get to the room, all those little picky opinions that dont really matter go out the window! the room greets you with slowly opening curtain and brightening lights along with mood music. There is plenty of room for snacks on the counters, outfits in the closets, makeup on the sink.

The Breeze Cafe and Cafe Vettro were good choices for lunch (we had fish and salads). Good food at a fair price. 4. Jean Philippe Patisserie was to die for. (I believe its the same place as in Bellagio BUT a lot better because it has table and seats. No more schlepping chairs to enjoy those crepes). 5. A 2 minute walk to the tram. 6. 3 pools (not the speciality ones) that were heaven. Never had a problem finding a chair and BEST of ALL there was SHADE! Bellagio has few umbrellas for those of us who dont want to fry or spend big $ for cabana. Needed: 1. A card swiping machine is needed at the entrance to the pool and EVERY person who enters should be required to swipe. This is a high-end hotel which will go downhill very quickly unless some control is exerted. 2. I heard a number of women griping about the \"decor\".

My question is that if there were no more non-smoking rooms availible why even ask the manager in the first place. After spending another 30 min explaining that a person in our group had asthma and other medical condition, the front desk person replied to me \"I have asthma too, I guess I shouldn't be here...\" What kind of rude answer is that? We've made no preference request in terms of bedding, location or anything else for that matter, i was even willing to upgrade to a different type of room In the end, it was basically \"take it or leave it\" type of deal. He then told us to call back down stairs 6am the following morning to see if anything had open up. Appearantly this 5 star hotel's staff could not be bothered to call us if any non smoking room had opend up. -Readiness of the rooms: 2 light bulbs were missing in one of the two room, 1 light switch didn't work. A/C thermostat didn't work properly (fan won't start or stop at the set temperature), the touch screen Computer unit that controls the curtains and lights froze was hard to use (although very cool feature...had it worked properly). -Location: Too far from the actual stripe.

We arrived early afternoon. The lines were nuts, it seemed to lack order.

We had our carry-on luggage and were hungry. No one offered to take our stuff so we could walk about the strip easily, so we sat in the lobby for about 40 minutes. When we went back to check in we were told that they didn't guarantee kingsize beds on nonsmoking floors. We were told that our room would be ready in 3 hours! Insane. We just wanted a place to put our stuff and to eat. When asked if they could do anything we were told we could take a smoking room, and we could move once the room we booked was available. We did. It was nice to be in a room, but it was obvious that it was haphazardly cleaned. The fridge wasn't full and shampoo was missing from the bathroom. Also, the name on Aria's in-room control panel was someone else's. Were we in someone else's room? Was someone else in the room I supposedly had booked? It took three phone calls, and one night of sleeping in the smoking room before our room was available. (The room and the floor reekend.) Further, it took us making the phone calls, Aria employees never called us to let us know the room was available. The rest of our stay was better. It seemed that the overall customer service was lacking from many of the employees we came across. On our last day a \"pool waitress\" actually took a few minutes to explain what she had to offer and where to go for other foods. It would have been nice if the first waitress we had on our first day poolside would have taken a moment to explain it. It was also on this last day that we were at the business center to print our flight confirmation. It was actually nice that they said we could have free use of the computer/printer for flight confirmation. Of course, we were then spoken to rather rudely when we opened up the internet browser and were killing a few minutes before our flight confirmation opened up. \"I thought you were printing your flight confirmation. Internet usage is not free!\" The hotel was nice, as in clean and new. The rooms were great, again, clean and new. The pools, three of them, and hot tubs were all nicely cared for and great to lounge by. The service overall lacked. And it lacked badly! That being said, there also were workers, like the last pool waitress we had, a young man named, \"Ericson\" who worked a snack shop like area in the casino, and a guy named, \"Drew\" who worked the taxi stand area, that all had great personalities and the level of professionally we expected.

I took advantage of the offer. However, I never received a receipt until my AA called for one. My room was not cleaned one day. I alerted the front desk. They offered to comp me one day. I really didn't want the comp, I wanted my room cleaned. However, it was 9 pm at night, and I also just really wanted to go to sleep. Another day, my room was cleaned but they forgot to give me fresh amenities. I was out of shampoo. They sent me up some, but it was annoying. I would have preferred simply to have shampoo as part of the room refresth. The Aria is a super cool property, but needs a good process improvement initative. This place definitely still has a few kinks. Give it a few more months, and I am confident they will have figured it out and it will rock.

Lately we have made Bellagio or Paris our usual spot. This time we decided to try Aria for the first five nights of our trip. They had a spring special on suites, so we got a one-bedroom suite in the sky suites section. The limo driver was waiting for us when we arrived at the baggage claim, and was very patient when our luggage didn't come down the conveyor belt. Turns out it had arrived on an earlier fiight and was locked in the airline's baggage room. I can't say what the regular check-in at Aria is like, but the VIP entrance and desk was great. We arrived several hours before the published time and they accomodated us immediately. The decor of Aria is contemporary. We are more fabrics, wood and details rather than stainless steel and metal pipes, so it wasn't really our thing. The other negative is it is loud in this hotel. They actually have microphones scattered around the casino that detect the ambient noise level and turn up the music in response. It is inescapable. The only other significant negatives ares that it is a LONG way to the Strip; even more so than what we thought was a long way before, and the other buildings in City Center (of which there are many) block the views of what Vegas is all about. You see mostly blue glass towers from your room. The VIP section has a complimentary coffe, snack and breakfast bar available most of the day, with wine and noshes in the evening; that is a nice touch. One glitch we encountered was a problem with check-out logistics. The suite came with limo service to and from the airport. Since we were moving to the Mandarin Oriental (also within the City Center) afterward, I asked if we could in lieu of a trip to the airport our bags could be taken there. The front desk clerk said no problem, but when it actually came to the even the bell desk said they woudn't do it, and the Mandarin had to send somebody to retrieve them. I should have had Aria drive us around the block and deliver us to the Mandarin. Oh well, a minor thing in review. Their pool area is very nice with several options and slow but adequate service. The chaises are quite close together, so get cozy with the stranger next to you. In aggregate it was a decent stay, but I don't think we will be returning. For less money one can get a Bellagio Suite with better logistics and a more pleasing atmosphere. None of the restaurants at Aria appealed to us, and the property comes off as being a little cold. Because of the alternatives I will give it a not recommended. Oh, one other thing: the City Center spent $3.1 million for that ridiculous metal typewriter eraser *sculpture* in front. It's enough to keep you way knowing you are helping to pay for that.

Near CVS and Walgreens Food was good, but some restaurants(Like the Buffet) were pricey. Also when it comes to a buffet, keeping it simple in layout and food works best. For those that are not all in the gambling scene, the casino is not \"in your face\". Cons: Bed was a little too soft(just a little) I didn't like the mini-bar(where are we supposed to put our food?) Got \"fee'd up\". Fifteen dollars a day for internet :( Thiry dollars to use the gym(What da hey!!?) One hundred thirty a day held for \"incidentials\" :( Really cut into our fun money! All in all I had a good experience. I liked the decor for the most part; however, a little dark. Our room had a decent view(room 20020), but one of the buildings blocked the view of the strip. The food at the Pub was off the chain! The pool and the spa are to die for. Valarie(?) did such a good job on my nails! The staff was personable and nice...without being fake.

Other side notes: (1) used shaver in the bathroom trash can, (2) light bulb by the bed were out and they never came to fix it (3) concierge put us on the guest list for Haze, but when we got there, we were not on the list (4) we couldn't charge our meal to the room b/c it had an X on it; turned out the check-in desk attendant didn't put down our credit card for incidentals. But, she did charge the 2nd night to the room so why wouldn't you put it down? It was just a hassle to have to go to the front desk and get that taken care of. Lastly (5) they did finally change us to a room with 2 beds on Saturday. During this process, they locked us out of our original room. Hello?! How the heck are we suppose to get all our stuff out of our room and move into the new room? Seriously?! Seriously! I gave them 1 star for the fact that they did finally change us to a room with 2 beds on Saturday. And the other star was for the really nice bed they have. Overall - VERY poor.

The impression at the arrival is the one of being in an airport. Large, cold, lobby. Very little help with the bags (that I would have appreciated). The bad service started right away, at check in. Since I was in LV for business I checked in first, and he joined me later. While I was in line waiting for a check in counter to free up (by myself, with one large bag and one carry on), two men went directly in line behind someone who was checking in, bypassing the line and stepping in front of me. The staff person who is supposed to direct people checking in, saw everything and didn't say a word. When the two moved forward to the closest open check in desk I gave an eloquent look at the staff person, who told me \"oh, but one will free up right away\". I replied that i thought it was his job to make sure stuff like that didn't happen. He shrugged and didn't even apologize. The room is elegant and clean, I wasn't bothered by the glass separating the WC area, but I found that the shower/tub area is too big and uncomfortable. I don't want echo in my shower! The decor is a little impersonal, looking more like an upscale business hotel than a LV hotel. But maybe it was intentional. The room service did a good job with the cleaning, but didn't fill up the ice bucket at turndown, and I find the music they play in the room in the evening is cheesy and not adequate to the class of the hotel (would you believe the collection is called \"waiting room?!\" I heard better at my dentist's office). Turning it off with the complex in-room control system isn't easy either. It took me a whole song of Kenny G before I figured it out. The options for breakfast are very poor. Unless you go at Cafe Vettri (the service is slow, the food ok, but nothing great), there are only two coffee shops where the lines are unbelievably long. The first day took 40 minutes to get a coffee and a pastry. Did they realize the hotel has 4004 rooms? The second day we went to the pool, thinking that we could get at least a coffee there. The pool is beautiful, nothing to say about that, but the waitress can only serve you drinks. No food nor coffee. For coffee (they don't have milk, so don't try to ask for a latte) or food one can either sit at the Breeze (slow slow service, and only in the shade), or has to go to a special \"take out area\" behind the Breeze, where two poor waiters try to do their best, but they're totally clueless. Someone has to explain to me why they can't have a food menu at the pool, served right there, like in every other LV hotel. The casino is dark, loud and depressing. There are very few tables and the slots are badly organized. The color schema isn't great and not festive. The lighting is bad, and the music is different in the different areas of the casino, often creating a very disturbing noise. Apparently the management likes Madonna's greatest hits, too. On Sunday we woke up at 6:30 because some loud noises. It sounded like someone was doing some plumbing work in the floor above us. After a late night, it wasn't the most pleasant experience. We found out what the noises were when my husband came out from the bathroom to find two guys washing the window of the room . The noises were due to the window washer platform hitting the building. Of course, the clients weren't notified, and I still wonder why the windows have to be cleaned at 6 am...On a SUNDAY morning....IN VEGAS. We opted for the self check out, to avoid the long lines, and the internet connection was billed twice each day (how does that happen?). Beware of the fact that the way the charges are displayed on the TV makes very difficult to spot stuff like that. A call to the front desk fixed it and we could proceed with the check out.

I read all the reviews on here before we went, so had a pretty good idea of what to expect. We like technology and we like trying new places when we travel, so Aria fit the bill. We arrived around 4pm on a Saturday. Check in was not terribly busy and they had one woman on duty directing people to different lines to keep things moving. It took maybe 5 minutes to get checked in. Front desk clerk was all business-not one friendly greeting or any chit chat, but she took care of business quickly and efficiently, showed us where to go on a map and we were done. You do walk through part of the casino to get to the room elevators, but that's the norm at a lot of the places we have stayed before. Elevators are grouped by floor number, so there was never a long wait for the elevator to arrive. It was pretty cool when we walked into the room and it did it's little show for us-lights coming on, drapes opening, music playing. We had a mountain view room on floor 36. Not a bad view, but nothing spectacular either. Would have liked more of a strip view, but didn't luck into any upgrade. Our windows were dirty with a lot of spots on the outside glass, but I never really noticed it after the first time that we walked right up to the window to check out the view. I really liked the decor of the room. Lots of chocolate brown and white- modern, but not too much. We had fun with the remote that controls the room. It is very easy to figure out, but I did shut off the bathroom lights a few times on my husband by accident. It is a little slow to respond, so don't hit too many buttons at once. The casino was very nice-LOTS of craps tables which is our favorite game. Also able to find $5 tables quite often which was a nice surprise. Lighting in the casino is low, but I loved the atmosphere. Always seemed very friendly and classy at the same time. Ate at Cafe Vetro and also at the buffet. Service was very good at both places. Buffet was best value for breakfast. Our only complaint about this hotel was the cost of food if you wanted something quick and simple. There really wasn't any place that you could get any type of meal for less than $40 for two. We would walk over to the food court at the Monte Carlo quite often for a quick bite at Subway, etc. It was only about a 5 minute walk through the hotel corridors. If you just need a cup of coffee in the morning, there is a short line at the front candy shop-the line up front in the morning goes on forever, but it's really several lines all going to different areas. You have to look for the coffee line. The pool was just opening the week we were there and we went out and looked at it and walked around the area. It was very nice. Lots of little areas where you could relax, lots of palm trees, and several different hot tubs. All the employees that we saw stopped to say hello and see if we needed anything. I was impressed with the level of service in all areas other than the first lady at the front desk. When it's time to check out, you can do it in your room with the TV remote (not the big master remote). We got all the way to the end, were able to see all room charges (which were all correct) and then we got an error message. So we went to the front desk to check out-very busy, so we waited in line about 15 minutes. When we got to the desk, she said we were already checked out, so not sure what the glitch was in the system, but it was all o.k. Overall, we really liked the hotel.

There was a long line when we arrived and instead of the call ahead easing our check in, we had to wait while they found the room we reserved, we were at the window for nearly 15 minutes.

The hotel is MODERN - if you don't want modern, stay somewhere else. This is the major theme - lots of glass and sculptural elements - and obviously the place cost a vast amount of money. Are there some kinks, yes, but I think they are minor for the most part. Pros: Rooms are nicely decorated - spacious, very comfortable bed which is ultra soft like a cloud. May not suit someone who likes a firmer mattress. We got free internet and recommend upgrading to a corner suite, it wasn't much more money. Housekeeping came in 2x per day - room was always made up and clean towels. Make sure to turn off the 'privacy' button on the door otherwise they wil not come in. And don't expect them to do it fast, leave them an hour or 2 to do it. We always got turn down service, chocolates and nice music at night. Pool areas are lovely, always space, not loud music and nice pools. Restaurants are pretty good - buffet is good for brunch but the lines can be very long so get there before 10.30 am. On the weekdays they change over to lunch at 11am which is definitely not as good unless you like crablegs. Try Cafe Vettro for all day breakfast and the food was excellent both times we went there. For more expensive food the steakhouse was great, American Fish was 'ok'. Casino is not really that dark - you can see fine so not sure why people are complaining about it. It was quieter than the Bellagio at night, less crowds but still a good atmosphere. There is a safe in the room - use it to put your valuables in - it is never a good idea to leave cash or smaller valuables out in the open in any hotel. The tram that runs to the Motecarlo and the Bellagio is so great - fabulous idea. Those 2 hotels have more fun slot machines and it was nice to try different places. There is also a Starbucks in the Monte Carlo if you want one. There is a CVS close by the Aria to stock up on water etc. Check in was absolutely fine, 15 minutes on a Saturday evening. They were nice and there was a supervisor on the floor monitoring it all - so they are trying to fix the reported issues. There was always a line at the concierge though, not sure why. For check out - you can do it from your room under 'folio' - much easier and faster. Cons: The rooms need to be cleaned more throughly - there was dust on the table tops and on the floor - not a big deal but seems like the housekeeping was maybe a little too fast. However it was still ok. The walls were quite thin, as in most hotels. We could hear our neighbors mostly through the vent system. It wasn't too loud but a little annoying in the middle of the night. There seems to be a problem with the vent systems - 2x a day in the morning and at night a strong smell of cooking came through the vents in our bedroom. It didnt last more than 15 minutes, but was very strange and they need to fix this. The sinks are badly designed, Very pretty but the splashing is ridiculous. Don't wear anything nice while you are washing your hands - you get sprayed. Plus this must be a a nightmare for housekeeping. I know they can't replace 4000 sinks at this point, but seriously, who put those in??? The Hotel is not poorly laid out, but there needs to be more maps around. And the signage is a litte small. Once you get the hang of it, it's quite easy. Yes there is alot of walking but this is vegas people! The Crystals mall, while beautiful is so full of high end stores only high rollers can shop there. Such a shame - they need to get more of a mix of stores like the Venetian. There is no place to buy newspapers, water, etc. They need one of those.

So, I rated the rooms as average even though the technology and interior design were amazing. I will NEVER stay there again. Apparently they were having a problem with a sewage smell wafting from pipes that run under the casino, and instead of fixing the problem at its source they flooded the casino and Crystal\u2019s shopping center with an extremely strong vanilla perfume scent. It was overwhelming to the point where it was unbearable and unpleasant. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction to it and ended up having to go to a different casino to gamble and shop. Fortunately, the aforementioned scent, or stench at this point, was not pumped into the resort hallways or rooms. Thank goodness or we would have been forced to change our reservations and stay at a different resort all together. I am disappointed that we cannot return to Aria or Crystal\u2019s unless I want to suffer from severe allergies again because it is a beautiful casino and resort with many amazing restaurants. We ate at Bar Mesa, Sage, and Jullian Serrano. All of which were amazing EXCEPT for the overwhelming vanilla stench forced on patrons while they ate. We wanted give them a fair chance and try out several services before leaving, but eventually we had to leave due to the fact we have to breathe to survive. I have been home for two days and symptoms of my allergies are nearly gone but the disappointment of not being able to enjoy other services provided by Aria will stay with me for a long time as we travel to Las Vegas one to two times a year. We have enjoyed staying at the Bellagio and MGM Signature Towers several times without any allergy issues, or any other issues for that matter.

I am not sure how much of a fan I am of City Center, there's a lot of steel and glass and it's set far enough back from the strip that it feels out of place. However, the interior of Aria is really quite nice, and the rooms are also quite nice. Service is pretty good, all of the staff works as fast as they can and as hard as they can to take care of your needs. Beds were very comfortable and I slept very well. I recommend Aria. I think it's a nice place. I am going to list a bunch of minor \"rough around the edges\" things though, I think they will improve in these areas as the hotel continues to settle into full operations. Minor issues: - sign to the ice machine pointing the wrong way - when the sun hits the hotel, there is a lot of expansion on the outside, creates a loud banging noise every 30-60 minutes - blackout drapes don't close fully - concierge for some reason is not available after a certain time... I tried to make a dinner reservation, calling at 8:30 and was told the concierge was closed for the day... there were still staff at the desk though, during checkin there were no concierge staff available to help at 11:30pm (five star resort in a 24 hour town should have a 24 hour concierge) - rooms are already getting a bit rough around the edges, the hotel's decor has things like a glass centerpiece on a glass tabletop, this gets moved by guests and staff and ends up scratching the tabletops up... small wear issues like this are starting to be apparent that could have been circumvented with a bit of planning - included transportation for the Sky Suites did not show up to pick me up at the airport Other things that I felt were awkward: - the VIP rooms (Sky Suites) don't have immediate access to taxi cabs, but the regular suites do... taxi cabs cannot come into the Sky Suites entrance, so unless you take a limo you can't get to the door, but have to check in at the far end of the hotel, and then truck your stuff all the way over... this makes zero sense, but I guess they are planning to transfer you with their limo (in my case the limo did not show)... even so this is a convenience issue that makes getting around town and back a bit more of a hassle for guests staying in the more expensive suites (makes little sense to do this) - the hotel makes a big deal of how the suites recognize guests the first time and turn everything on and open the blinds for you... well if you check in at night, this means you have to run around turning off TVs and music (in my case three of them), closing blinds, turning off lights... everything is computerized and the controls are laggy, so you press buttons, nothing happens, press again and you cancel the previous action which was just slow - there is a connectivity panel on the TVs allowing you to jack in a music player... trying to do this just resulted in blank screens... built in music selections have no electronic music or hiphop, you're fine if you like rock n roll and such though - hotel left a little greeting note, though I checked in as a \"Mr.\" and was in their system as such, they addressed me as \"Ms.\" ... no big deal, but it kind of defeats the purpose of a \"personalized\" note The room service food was good, the two restaurants I tried (Blossom and Lemongrass) were adequate but not stellar. Lemongrass is Thai and served bland food (waiter forgot to ask how spicy, we forgot to mention, Thai by default should have some zing). Blossom was better but didn't feel like it was worth the expense of $200 for dinner for two. Basically, Aria is trying, and these rough spots I think will smooth out over time. It's overall a beautiful hotel and staff work hard, and those are the most important things. These details brought to their attention I think will be dealt with.

The most disappointing thing was the poor design of the bathroom sinks. Both were very deep, but what for?

It appears to be a 50\" flatscreen with HD. Very, very nice. The room decor was elegant, and the beds were very comfortable. The distance to the Strip was far...but there is a nice tram to the Bellagio, where you could use their automated walkway to get down to the Strip and other nearby casinos. From Aria, it was also an easy walk to the Monte Carlo (where food is cheaper and you can charge it to your Aria room). We liked the casino atmosphere--somewhat dimmer than usual, but very sexy.

The check-in person said our room wasn't ready and we would have to return after 3 to see if it was. That was it. So we had to return and get back in line and go through the same process. At the Encore, they process your credit card and call you when the room is ready. The marble floors in our suite were dirty and not cleaned during the 3 days we were there (bathroom floor around the toilet was especially bad). The cleaning supervisor walked into our room while the privacy light was on. Not one service employee looked at us and smiled our said hello the entire stay while we walked around. We also suffered some of the glitches. The drapes did not fully close in the bedroom, the bedroom TV remote was dead on arrival, and the bathroom sinks are easy to spray water around (not sure what they were thinking). We were charged for a $8 bottle of water even though we never touched the wet bar. Room quality was very nice and the casino is huge with lots of options for gambling. Pool area is ready well done but once again service was terrible, we were never offered a drink in 45 minutes. Internet access is free, a nice touch. Self-parking is a long walk, so I would recommend dropping off bags or using the valet. The Aria is off the strip a little bit, so be ready to walk a little more than at some of the other resorts. Views from the rooms aren't great since Aria is surrounded by other buildings on all sides (it feels like you are staying in a downtown area). We ate at three places in Aria. The buffet ($28 dinner) was not good, weird mix of foods and low quality. Only the desserts were good. The Cafe Ventra (or something like that) was expensive, but the food was decent. Service was very slow. Finally the gelato place was not good, tasted more like plain ice cream. We did not really like the brown theme in the Aria.

Room was fairly clean except for a few drops of a sticky red liquid on the bathroom floor, somebody's spilled daiquiri perhaps? Other than that really enjoyed the room, wouldn't pay to upgrade to strip view again though. Even from the 21st floor the view wasn't great as you are so far back from the strip. Now the bad... I will start by echoing the complaints about check-in. Even at 9 pm the line up was long, no queue set-up and very slow. Check-out was even longer. On our first full day in town we went shopping in the morning. I returned to the room at lunch time to drop off our purchases. I left the bags on a shelf under the desk. My wifes camera and sunglasses were in one of the bags hidden under a skirt she had purchased. When we returned late afternoon the room had been made up and the bag with the camera in it was gone. We tore the room apart trying to find it, no luck. We went to the front desk to report it and were first told to check lost and found. The staff did not seem concerned with our plight at all. I insisted on speaking to someone else so security was called. We waited about twenty minutes for someone to show up. The security officer was nice enough but offered no apology or assurance that anything would be done about it. He said they would investigate and contact us. At check out time we had still not heard back from security. The front desk staff was not concerned and said they would call us if they located the camera. Like that is going to happen!!! I was really surprised with the way the whole situation was treated. We once got stuck in an elevator at Luxor and they fell all over themselves to make it up to us, including comped rooms, meals etc. You should be able to leave your camera in the room in Vegas and not feel like it is at risk of being stolen, or so I thought. The only thing they did was waive the charge on a disposable camera we took out of the mini bar, and that was only at my inisistence.

It's a very nice/fancy building with all the modern amenities you'd expect from the latest Vegas mega-resort. The room was very well done - very high tech too. There's a little 7\" control panel by the bed that controls all the lights, curtains, TV, music, etc. You can even set your \"do not disturb\" from there.

The good: Incredible modern architecture, amazing rooms - including technology i've never seen before. from the touch screen control panel next to the bed, you can control almost everything in the room and your experience (for example, you can set the alarm so that the TV goes on and the blackout shades open at your desired time). The bed is very comfortable, and rooms are spacious. The casino is pretty nice, and restaurants are good. The tram that connects to Vdara & Bellagio is pretty convenient. The pools seem nice, but nothing super amazing (except for Liquid, the daytime \"nightclub\" which is behind a wall and has a hefty cover). There's a good overall vibe. The bad: In 2 months, the service level has not improved, and the once beautiful immaculate room already is showing some wear (dark wood looks great, but shows everything). It really all starts with check-in, and I echo what all these others have said, it takes forever. They had several un-manned check-in counter slots at peak check-in time on a Saturday, and they seem to not have learned anything from the queing process at other large hotels. They were able to check us in a bit early, which was nice. When we got to our room the linens had a very obvious dirt stain, so I called housekeeping. 5 hours later, after walking around all afternoon and needing a nap, the dirty duvet was still there. 1 1/2 hours later, we had new linens...my entire nap time (naps are important in vegas!) They did provide a $50 incentive for my trouble, which was nice, but the poor turnaround time was inexcusable for a hotel that is putting 5 stars next to its name. Finally, it's Vegas, you WILL feel part of the masses. however, if you're a Bellagio regular looking for that more exclusive experience, despite its decor, nice rooms, and 5 stars, you should stick with your usual.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "austin", "Title": "\u201cStill working out kinks\u201d", "Author": "jcctexas", "ReviewID": "UR63158108", "Content": "Staff is extremely professional, but still working out details of running a top-notch hotel.

I have stayed in almost all of the so called \"Top Vegas Strip Hotels\" and the experience at Aria far surpassed my accommodations at other resorts. Ill begin with our arrival. We were greeted outside by several very polite and helpful doormen who immediately asked if we needed help with our bags and directed us to the check-in desk. The check-in process was quick, flawless and very informative. Without requesting, the host provided us with a room upgrade which was determined by availability. Several maps of City Center were provided and a very detailed synopsis of the \"to dos\" at the hotel and Casino were also explained. Upon arriving to our room and opening the door, the curtains automatically opened and the television and lights automatically turned on to greet us. The in-room touch screen controls are wonderful and control everything from the curtains to television to temperature controls. Very high tech and efficient. No issues there. For those that don\u2019t like the technology, everything can be done manually as well. The bed is absolutely wonderful and a true highlight of the room. The decor is very modern and sleek. There are many restaurants in Aria to meet almost any desire and taste. Shortly after check-in we ventured around the resort to find a good lunch. We found the lunch buffet on Promenade Level ($23.95) to be surprisingly affordable compared to other Vegas resorts. I can honestly say this was the best buffet I have ever visited. Once seated, our drink orders where quickly taken and lunch began. Everything from Italian and Mexican cuisine to all you can eat crab legs to a full dessert bar with many ice cream flavors were available. It was delicious. We returned a couple days later for dinner ($36.95). The dinner buffet includes the entire buffet once again as well as a whole Lobster per every 2 people as well as unlimited wine. On top of the wonderful selection, all the food was seasoned very well and tasted great. Several previous reviewers complained about how dark the Casino is presented. I think this overall very \"cool\" low light presentation is in line with the modern decor of the hotel and fits very very well. There is plenty light in areas where it\u2019s needed such as at all the game tables and slot machines. Great spotlighting on all the tables. There several pools and an adult only pool located on the Promenade level. The three main pools were designed like a beach complete with the Palm trees and all. Truely the nicest outdoor pool oasis ive seen in Vegas. Overall, this experience at Aria Hotel and Casino was by far the best resort experience in Vegas.

I had no problems with the light controls etc. in the beautiful The bed was just a little on the soft side for me but I got used to it. There was always a security guard standing in front of the bank of elevators. You had to show your room card to go past. One thing that is very efficient about Aria that I don't think anyone else has mentioned is how the elevators are configured. There is one bank of elevators for floors 3 - 7, one set for 8 - 15,. etc.) Most of the time I had an elevator to myself going directly to my floor. There were 6 elevators in each set so you never were waiting for an elevator. Previous reviewers have complained about how far Aria is off the strip. It is no farther off the strip than Bellagio where you have to walk around the lake. To walk from my room out to the strip was about a 7 or 8 minute walk. One thing I really enjoyed were the pools. There are 3 very large pools. The one that is farthest from the hotel building is heated like bathwater. And I don't mean lukewarm. It i is warm like bathwater. I ate lunch one day at the buffet, $19.95 on a weekday. The food was good and the staff was helpful. There were plenty of choices. Other people have complained about the cafeteria atmosphere but I think the style of the buffet is what is called the \"minimalist\" style. The oreo slider dessert was to die for. I do agree with another poster that Arias buffet has the best dessrts. The stafff was very helpful. The concierge printed my boarding pass for me since the business center was closed in the evening. They gave me late checkout til 1pm on Friday when I left. I tried to get late but they were full on Friday night so they could not give me later. I hung out at the pool until it was time to leave for my flight. There are showers in the bathrooms by the pool so if you have a late flight home this helps. Sometimes a person would call in the morning to make sure I receive my wakeup call. Sometimes I did have trouble calling to the front desk and would be on hold. I usually would hang up and just try later or stop at the desk when I was going out. One night when I called for a wakeup call, the operator said \" You are at Aria, right\" which makes me think they hav onlyo ne operator for Aria and Vdara which is why you wait on hold so long. Other than the buffet and my $3.25 morning coffees (small) from the bakery in the casino I didn't eat in any of the restaurants. I did see somene pay $4.50 for a coke at the pool bar. The waiters were friendly and would always give me a glass of ice for my bottled water. I pad $15 per day for wireless. It worked well, no complaints just a bit pricey.

Check in took about 10 minutes (invited guest line) and we were the only ones in line. Our offer included, comped rooms for 2-3 nights, $200 free play each and $100 each in food credit (we have our own slot cards). We booked two rooms so that we both could take advantage of our offers, and we were able to get adjoining rooms. We asked at check in if they would upgrade us to one bigger room vs. 2 rooms, but they said they could not do it?? The rooms were nice, but small, especially compared to a Venetian Suite or the Palms Salon Suite. We were glad to have the adjoining rooms, which gave us 2 bathrooms and more space to move around. The bathrooms were nice, but again, smaller than the ones in the other hotels. The electronic pad that controlled everything (lights, curtains, TV, etc.) in the room worked in both rooms and was VERY simple to figure out. The only thing that did not work was the TV remote in our \u201cextra\u201d room, but we were able to use the electronic pad to change the channels. Our rooms were cleaned every day and we had turn down service each night (Hint \u2013 make sure your \u201cprivate\u201d button is turned off when you leave the room, otherwise, I\u2019m assuming your room will not be cleaned). The beds and pillows were the best!!! I travel with my own pillow and this is the first hotel that I left my pillow in my suitcase. We always rent a car and found the main valet to be painless. We never had to wait for more than 5 minutes for our car and we used the valet 4 or 5 times during our stay. The vp odds are not the best, (same as the Venetian) but we did manage to hit quite a few good hands \u2013 I turned $100 of my free play into $700 on dollar double double bonus poker vp machine, in about 15 minutes. My boyfriend hit many 4 of a kinds, and many of them being bonus 4 of a kinds. We ate at Lemongrass once and Caf\u00e9 Vettro twice. Food and service was good (food not great) at both places. We did not think the prices were too bad, for a five star hotel, but probably would not have had 3 of our main meals there, had we not had the food credits. We did not use the pool because it was cold (60 degrees) and very windy the two days we were there, but the pools looked nice from the view in our room. We visit Vegas 2 times a year and may stay at Aria again, that is if we get the same type of offer.

So off we went, out on the town for a few hours before our big show that we were going to. Get all the way back to the room and yep, key didn't work so, back to the front desk to wait in line behind people checking in. I finally was so upset that I cut to the front, and asked for the key to be fixed immediately. It was like this the entire time we were in the Aria. I heard the same sort of feedback from so many people, I could not believe it.

Asked if we could go to the pool area in the meantime & leave luggage with bell stand. Front desk agent hesitated, but relented. -Came back at 3pm to check-in to see if the 2 queen bedded non-smoking rooms was available yet - was told it wasn't.

No call. -Went back at 4pm to see if the room was ready - nope. -Went back at 5pm to see if the room was ready - this time a queen/queen room was available, but only smoking. Really didn't want a smoking room for 3-nights. -Went back at 6pm to see if there was a non-smoking queen queen ready - nope. -Went back at 7pm to see if there was a non-smoking queen queen ready - yep. -Internet charges pretty high -Unlike other hotels that have reasonably priced quick snack/lunch options for a quick bite, this one does not - had to go to Monte Carlo for that. Thought it was pretty poor form to offer check-in at 3pm & not have a room ready for several hours afterwards (and you'd think in a hotel as large as they are with checkout supposedly scheduled for 11am, if I recall correctly, within 8 hours, they'd have the staffing to clean a queen-queen non-smoking room. Also, you'd think with such a large new hotel, they would have designed it with higher ceilings so the smoke doesn't linger as much - but they didn't. Saw the Elvis cirque show (on-site) - it was pretty good. Decent hotel, but given the options that are out there, if you can get a good price elsewhere, I'd go elsewhere - only because of the front desk/check-in experience.

I asked the taxi to take me there and this driver from Guatemala took me to the \"Rio\". He quickly corrected course and splained to me that he was so sorry. I should have figured when he turned off Las Vegas Blvd from Caesars but I thought maybe there was a back door with all the talk about the Aria being so far off the strip. Still only fifteen bucks with tip. Three nights at the ARIA hotel, Tuesday through Thursday April 20-23. The Aria will open new territory in the resort property wars. This place is elegant, classy, unique, and absolutely a modern comfort. I was pensive at first but from our arrival we were impressed. Walking through the casino towards the check in we were greeted with tremendous scale architecture. Soaring ceilings, pillars so ginormous you felt like you were the kids they shrunk in the movie. Earthen tones with properly placed lighting let the casino games become eye-popping sights beckoning to the gamer that resides inside. Mood lighting everywhere but certainly not too dark. The Wynn casinos are full of light as you enter but they too become sedate and muted on the casino floor, a feminine feel where the Aria also presents great lighted spaces on entry but feels more powerful dare I say masculine with its leather and browns after deeper penetration into the heart of the casino. Check in with Jonathon was a snap and were given room 23270. What a wonderful room. We arrived to open the door by slapping the lock with the keycard, entered and the curtains opened to a wonderful view of the Palms, the mountains in the background viewed through floor to ceiling room wide windows. The light came on and the TV came on to a music channel. It was quite and experience. The beds were the most comfy with extra pillows and soft top mattress. A beautiful room that seemed so techie when I first arrived that I was thinking it was over done. After the second day I can report that these amenities are not overdone at all, in fact I am not sure how I can continue to live without these most appreciated of comforts. The curtains opened with the remote so as I awoke in the mornings I just opened them from the bed and viewed those glorious mountains and sights. Lights all controlled by the remote so when in bed you did not have to get back up to turn out the bathroom light (Light also controlled at the switch), TV, TVGuide, temperature, folio, and yes you can check out on that giant flat panel high def television, I guess 50 inches or bigger. The tub was behind the shower, you walked through the shower to get in the tub. Really nice design. I took a hot bath and filled the soaking tub to the very rim, splashed and frolicked in the water with no worry of spill. Wifey showered right beside me and when I left the tub I just showered off on my way out. Very nice bathroom and amenities. If you don't like seeing your peeps naked then you must use this bath in the singular sense and draw the sliding door closed. We relished it as our own private spa in Vegas. Absolutely loved it! The hotel sent a few chocolate covered strawberry's with a birthday card for my wifeys 18262nd day in life, most generous and thoughtful. The service was genuine and professional with all employees I encountered seeming to be happily employed by the MGM empire and the ARIA hotel. The concierge printed our boarding passes free of charge. A great service that Harrah's only offers to its Diamond crowd. Did I mention that points were clicking away at one dollar fifty per point? My experience has been three dollars a point but at ARIA and the Monte Carlo it seemed to be two times points for my stay and slot play. The slot floor is large and offers most every game my heart desired. The play was up and down but I certainly came close to even and I just lost my stake at Caesars Palace in short time. Now I did ask for a comp for the room charges of 120 bucks and they said, \"Not at this time.\" I was surprised because I did play at least my usual and that is good for a few nice comps in Biloxi. May be they were counting my invite, maybe they made a mistake, I don't really care. It was a great stay. The funniest thing I overheard while in the Hotel, some lady complaining that her bathroom scale was not working! Are you kidding me! Maybe she was a contestant on the reality show \"Biggest Losers\" and was oh so close to winning. There was modern art staged everywhere from sculpture to wall art it was all interesting and beautiful. I also stayed two nights in a Palace Tower premium room in Caesars. I used to love that room and it is nice but spoiled I am by the functionality and beauty of Aria. Fist choice will always be Aria from this stay forward. A beautiful property destined to become the \"best\" hotel on the strip. Cirque Elvis I have seen all the Cirque du Soleil shows except for \"Believe\". The Elvis theatre is another very nice feature to this hotel. As it is specific to this show I don't think you can have a bad seat. I had very good seats in section 203. The show is a Vegas spectacular! No impersonators trying to be the King, no this is a celebration of the King and his life and music all wrapped around a special Cirque show treatment. There was every element a great show should have: Theme, Elvis; Music, Hey he is called the King; Costumes, old Vegas with skimpy sequins and BIG hats, superheroes and jail garb; Band, Best band I have heard in years full of brass and percussion; Lighting, wonderful light show; Cirque du Soleil, yes that famous artistic touch in great performances. Full of fun and pizzazz! Much video of the King and his music but the live band covered the music and the vocals were by Elvis for a great feeling. Some songs are sung by a couple different female leads but this also was excellent. The music was perfectly presented to a wonderful show full of the greatest costuming and Circus type acts that it was a audio and visual feast of \"Sterling Brunch\" proportions! The band was really great. I have never seen a Cirque show that the actors took a curtain call and the audience gave the goods. Yes folks the show ended to a standing ovation, each group introduced and applauded in turn with the band getting a thunderous ovation. The only thing the left out was telling the audience, \" Ladies and Gentlemen, Elvis has left the building.\" This show will be the premiere must see show in Vegas for all the above reasons. If you can only see one show in Vegas then this has to be it. Viva Las Vegas, Baby! Jean Philippe Patisserie Wow this place is addictive, serving a variety of outstanding proper French pastry plus espresso and other assorted dishes. A fine place for an easy breakfast that is memorable. I find myself wishing I had one in the neighborhood. ARIA Buffet. We received two buffets with the offer and Tuesday night we ate the buffet in the Hotel. I was very impressed. King crab legs, while great are always a mistake after the second or third pound. The prime rib on the carving station was so very good I can say it was better than many fine dining restaurants prime rib entree. It was infused with some herb flavor and cooked perfect; after the crab slaughter the prime rib was all I could muster. Yummy. The desert bar was tempting and the cr\u00e8me Brule was very good although small cups caused me to return to consume mass quantities. Chocolate dipped strawberry's that were perfection, no unripe tasteless berries here, each strawberry was bursting fresh full of sweet flavor neatly covered with prime dark chocolate. It was heaven. About thirty dollars a person for the evening meal, always has the crab, Friday and Saturday they were touting Maine lobster on the buffet but I just saw a sign. Lemongrass Lemongrass was a nice lunch for around fifty bucks for two. It is a beautiful restaurant and the food was fresh and well prepared with excellent service. We were very happy with that lunch and the portions were quite large. Two entrees, two appetizers', too much. A great place to eat. I think you must be sensing my theme. We were not inclined to leave ARIA at all. The other casinos we visited seemed less, and whenever we left we always longed to return.

Stood in two lines with two different check in staff finally got a non-smoking room (as requested by my reservation). Deluxe City View rooms: Smaller than any other Deluxe room I've ever stayed in. Average decor. The one touch everything turns off/on thing is cool but didn't really need it. Beds and pillows are super comfortable. City view is really a view of the Mandarin Oriental, driveway and the fountain which is pretty weak. It's not worth the upgrade. Casino: Again, great decor. Dealers and wait staff are pleasant. I don't get the ugly brown color of the place though. Nothing special. Food: Fantastic. I visited all the bars around the casino. They were fun and exciting being in the middle of the action. Out of all the restaurants, we only went to Sirio Restorante, Jullian Serrano and Gold Lounge. They were Great. Pools: Ok...average. Lots of chairs and sun. The pool side service is sub-par. One server worked a very large area making it very slow (30 minutes for one beer). Can't take your drink anywhere near the pool. What's the point then? Any other hotel I've stayed at we can take our drink right into the water. The hotel is close to the airport, so loud helicopters are constantly flying over. LIQUID, the outdoor pool lounge/club, was awesome if you don't mind spending money but you're in Vegas, you have to splurge once or twice right? We got a day bed where you have to spend a MINIMUM of $500 on food, beverage and/or merchandise. Not bad. Spa: We had a couples massage. Above average. Ganbanyoku Japanese hot stone beds...kind relaxing until you get tired of lying on hard surface. The Shiu salt room. didn't get it. Balcony pool wasn't filled with water, so didn't get to use it Shopping: Crystals is a masterpiece of architecture with all the best stores. It's HUGE!!

The front desk employee (Anthony) was outstanding!!!! Travelling with friends, he made sure we were on the same floor and tried to meet each of our requirements (high floor, non-smoking, various room options / upgrades). Needless to say, it was wonderful. We arrived on a Wednesday around noon time and the room wasn't ready yet but it wasn't a huge deal. We checked our luggage and went to lunch. He called when the rooms were ready. The bags were sent up immediately and the bellman explained the features of the room.

Really, with fabulous weather and all the good food we eat, it wasn't an issue. Maybe it's an issue for people who don't work out or walk a lot. The staff everywhere we went in the complex were friendly and so nice. Multiple times I was asked if I was enjoying my stay. We had turndown service every night except Friday.

I (32) traveled with my husband (37), another couple (29 & 30) and their brother (34). I've stayed in the Hard Rock, Flamingo, Mandalay Bay, Monte Carlo & Luxor, with the Hard Rock being my favorite of those, Flamingo Go Room a close second. We live in NYC so we often dine out at nice restaurants, that is not the biggest draw for us in LV. We really just like a beautiful room, a nice casino with friendly dealers, and good cocktail service. I LOVED the Aria! Yes, there were some issues with service, which I will detail a bit more, but for me the pros by far outweighed those cons. We had to wait quite a while for check in, but when our turn finally came, I asked if there were any upgrades available. She offered me either a city view for an extra $15 or a corner suite for an extra $50 per night. We went with the suite. Good decision, the suites are really nice. Ours was done in beiges, creams, dark oranges, and browns, with splashes of blues in the artwork. There was a guest bath in the entryway, followed by dining area with mini bar & extra empty fridge, then the living area, the bedroom and the large bathroom. The bathroom in the suites is different from the regular rooms in that the tub is completely separate from the shower. The toilet came with heated seats & a bidet (interesting!). The bedding was amazing and I could tell a huge difference when I slept in my own bed back in NYC after our trip. Not so good, I think I need a new mattress :( I only ate in the Breeze Cafe, Jean Philippe Patisserie, the Buffet, and their coffee shop but I liked all. However, the service at the coffee shop was not very good , the place was empty when we got there and it took us almost 2 hours for sandwiches & burgers, no appetizers. All of the food/drink in the hotel is rather expensive, a latte in the morning is $6, and the sandwiches/burgers are all about $17. The bars were just ok, I liked Bar Moderno the best, followed by City Bar. View Bar is the lobby bar and I didn't really like it. We waited almost a half hour for a drink from the waitress, after waiting about 10 minutes for her to come take our order. Kind of annoying. These were the service issues that I mentioned. The casino was really nice, and I loved the dealers. I thought they were all really nice and talkative and I wasn't bored at all. The drink service was quick and the cocktail waitresses were also really friendly. I didn't find the casino too dark at all, I would rather it a little dark than too bright, like Monte Carlo. Location did leave a little to be desired, unless you take cabs everywhere. Which we did, so we didn't have much problem. But to walk to/from the Aria is super confusing.

The doorman are very greety and are looking for handouts. The resturants are very good however everything is alacarte. The steak house was very good however they do not disclose things as the side of sourcream and bacon bits will cost you extra!!!

I will admit I was a bit hesitant after reading the unfavorable reviews of this hotel however, there was a part of me that wanted to see for myself. There are quite a few complaints regarding the electronic features of the rooms here. We ALL (kids included ages 9 & 12) could EASILY use the system. I don't understand what was so difficult. There was a large touch screen remove (about 5\"x7\") with pictures of each feature i.e. TV, Curtains, Lights. Unless someone is severely electronically challenged, you'll manage. Yes, there was about a 30 min wait upon check in and I was told our room was not ready but the desk girl said to come back in a hour and instead of waiting in the long line again, I could go directly to the invited guests desk for check in. Simple & Fast. Our room had a GREAT view, the property was set back from the stip but we liked that, unless your a total lazyass it is not that far. The bathroom was nice (two sinks, made it faster when getting ready) Large bathtub, flat screen TV in the room, comfortable beds. It was also quiet which is important to me since I always get disturbed by noisy people in the middle of the night in Vegas. We were very pleased. The pools were nice & clean the cabanas were not cheap $250 per day, $350 on the weekends. My only complaint with the pools was that Heidi Montag was there and she is nasty. It wasn't like other hotel pools we have been to in Vegas that was full of drunk low lifes. The casino was a little dark but I thought it was classier, it went with the decor/theme. It is more of a contemporary look and it doesn't smell like smoke, most casinos in Vegas do. This casino smells really nice. There is also a lovely gelato/crepe & chocolate store that is to die for they also have the most beautiful deserts and those were only about $6 each. We will be back. I think the bottom line is there will ALWAYS be complainers anywhere you go", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "VegasSusie", "ReviewID": "UR61793517", "Content": "After booking Aria for 1 night a month before arrival, we were dismayed at the reviews of this hotel.

Well Aria is that old school with some nice decor and architecture that feel like the designers cared more about CAD then actually being in the space. Food prices are higher than Manhattan, SF or London. Plenty of super high end food. But even hot dogs are $9.

I pull in, I have the valet take my car, I then give my baggage to the bellman, I then wait in the checkin line for 30 minutes (1 person ahead of me) and checkin. I then go to my room which takes forever because I had to walk a mile from the elevator to my room. I then call the bellman to bring my luggage, I wait on hold for 30 minutes. They then bring up my baggage 15 minutes later. So total 45 minutes after I dial. I try to turn on my TV with the remote, the remote does not work, so I call the front desk, I wait on hold for 30 minutes. Front desk girl says someone will be by 1 PM (the next day) to fix it (change the batteries). I goto the buffet and I wait in line for 45 minutes, and then wait for the waitress to bring me drinks which took 10 minutes. I goto the cigar lounge / bar and I order a cigar and a cocktail, I wait 15 minutes, the waitress brings my drink and puts my cigar in front of me then tells me sorry I can't smoke it because I am in a non-smoking section! I ask to be moved to the smoking section and she tells me it is now full. I wait for 30 minutes and she then moves me over ONE table so I can smoke it! I goto my room and attempt to shut off the lights, the lights do not shut off, so I try the manual switch a couple more times and nothing happens. I walk away and a minute later the light goes off and I am happy, I lay down and then the light comes back on, I scramble out of bed and hit the light switch again and it does nothing, I check my watch and a minute later the light goes off, then a minute after that the light comes back on, the light turned on and then off for the next 30 minutes (it obviously queued my repeated attempts to turn off the light). The next day rolls around and me and my wife goto pick up the car from the valet which is on the opposite end of the hotel from where you drop off the car, I wait 45 minutes for them to bring me my car. I come back and it is 6PM and I try to turn on the TV with my remote that was to be fixed at 1PM, the remote still does not work. I call the front desk, I wait on hold for 30 minutes, I then cuss out the front desk woman, she puts me on hold for 30 minutes for the manager, I then cuss out her manager, the manager (who was professional and pleasant) finally sends someone up to replace the batteries. I attempt to turn off the hall light again, again it has trouble so I freak out and start pushing every button in the place a gazillion times and also on the main console, the console wigs out and resets (thank god) after it reset things started to respond better. I then eat at Blossoms which was a good experience, good staff and good food. I come back and use the restroom, while I am doing that I can hear my neighbor going #2 in his restroom through the vent, I can also here everything he said as clear as day while talking to his roommates. I then take a shower and notice housekeeping had given me two conditioners and no shampoo. This crap went on and on for the week I was there. Trust me, avoid this place like the plague, believe EVERY negative review you read here, they are all absolutely true most all happened to me. What to do if you get stuck staying there: 1. Do not use the valet, self-parking at this hotel is your best friend. 2. Do not use the bellman. 3. Always call the concierge for everything, never call the front desk or the bellman. 4. There are 4 physical buttons that are not labeled on the bottom of the main control panel next to the bed one of the buttons on the bottom right will reset the system, do that when you first get there so you can avoid an unresponsive system. 5. Expect to wait around 30 minutes for nearly everything (seriously almost everything) you do there. 6. Leave the hotel, only sleep there, you will be happier away from it. Me and my wife had a great time in Vegas except at Aria. 7. Get a room that is close the elevators unless you want to walk what seems like forever to your room. 8. Be aware that the electric socket in the bathroom is behind the tissue holder. Pros: 1. Big Shower and Tub. Very nice. 2. Technology is novel when it works like it is supposed to. 3. The hotel has a nice modern architecture to it if you enjoy that style. 3.

While waiting forever on the player\u2019s club line to book a special from NYNY that included a bit of free play, I stubbled upon a intro offer for Aria. With the Freeplay I was offered, my night was going to be about the same as NYNY once you add their resort fees\u2026I was curious about the new hotel. So let\u2019s get down to what you want to know and what you need to know\u2026please take the time to read the end where I encountered a security miracle when I lost my purse Getting There: Sign for City Center/Aria off Las Vegas BLVD are not that great if you have never been there. Just look for the Mandarin signs but go straight. That is the main valet\u2026BUT if you want something faster, especially if driving a taxi trying to milk your money at night or trying to avoid stuck LV Blvd, ask to be dropped off at their east valet. The complex can seem like a bit of a monster. Also, my local friends says the self park is a circle of hell.. Do yourself a favor..It is Vegas...Valet it! Checking In: Ok\u2026it didn\u2019t take THAT long BUT they really need to get some better organization. They need someone to shepherd people. I picked a line and it was the WRONG ONE\u2026after a bit of watching new people get into the line to the right us, the people in front of me started making jokes about how we really had picked the wrong line. As a service gesture, I would have appreciated the staff at the counter asking us to come over rather then us having to watch people who just walked in get checked in before those who had already been waiting 15-20 minutes. Placing people in a variety of lines is hard when you are a party of one or two\u2026 The Room: I loved that the room \u201cwelcomes\u201d you.. It is just such a little gesture that starts your stay right. I know some people have complained about it being too techie but I loved it\u2026I had relaxing massage music on during much of my one night stay. I loved that I could change the temp or the curtains. The lights took a little bit but nothing major. My room was on the 18th floor, bright clean and spacious with a mountain view. I asked to be near the elevator as I was a female alone. They do have security checking for room keys at the elevators 24/7. I appreciated the full safe (Regular MBay rooms do not offer this yet which is sooo unsafe, they have a tiny wall safe they doesn\u2019t hope a netbook, let alone a laptop). Mini bar is electronic but has a lock..so lock it if you have kids. If they touch something, you will get charged! That said, my $4 coke was delicious! I loved the built in dressers to cram all your stuff and forget about it. A lot of comments have been made about the unusual bath/shower combo. I liked it overall\u2026great id you need a shave. The bath products were really so-so in quality compared to some 5 stars but I did like the offered a cool mouthwash. FYI Alert Bathroom: The only problem I had with the room was the bathroom electrical socket. I actually had to READ a review on here to find it (behind the Kleenex/bath product caddy in the middle of the sink). I had already told my friend when I called her that that surely a nerdy man who never dried his hair could design a bathroom WITHOUT an electrical plug! It was impossible to even fathom such a design error in a billion dollar property\u2026duh..thanks TP for helping me find the socket... The Casino: This casino is really for the deep pocketed. I was disappointed at the minimum they had on all the penny machines. I don\u2019t mind losing my money to a casino but I would rather lose it 25 cents at a time, If I get to gamble longer, it is a better experience for me! That said, it isn\u2019t a huge casino which is nice and was lucky by winning..thanks BRUCE LEE machine! Food: I love nice places but when I\u2019m on my own, I don\u2019t visit them so much unless it is a top chef\u2019s casual interpretation. At Aria, I ate at their caf\u00e9 verti which was bright, airy and spacious on a beautiful sunny day. Very fresh in design. This is a zen treat. You don\u2019t feel stuck in the darker casino. I would have liked some more options on their menu but the calamari was delish and the salad was nice. They have a dinner roll that is made out of pretzel roll that was AMAZING..gotta love artisian breads! While the caf\u00e9 was fun, but the BEST was Jean Philippe\u2019s little bit of tastiness in middle of the hotel. He does pastry and chocolates for the Bellagio. Be warned that by afternoon they do sell out of their last salads/sandwiches (which is why I ended up at the caf\u00e9). That night ,before they closed at 12am, I went down to get some dulce de leche brioche and gold flaked cup of mousse which was reasonable, tasty and beautiful. The next morning I went down to get the beautiful salad I had coveted earlier..anytime you can eat well for $15 or under $20 I think that is a good deal. The sweets are under $8 and so special. The place was packed but worth the not very wait\u2026highly organized staff. The Lost PURSE and HONEST STAFF\u2026My trip had been wonderful but I made a classic mistake in Vegas. As I left Aria, I sat to spend some more money since I was ahead. In being so busy looking at my luggage/computer, I played and stupidly left my black purse between two games. I was playing 10 minutes at another machine before I realized my error and was sent into a panic. I started retracing my steps nothing\u2026I saw a staff floor member named Elena and said \u201cI lost my purse\u201d knowing my whole trip was now ruined. I was heartbroken\u2026She said the magic words \u201cCoach and black?\u201d\u2026I was saved. I had just one priceless jackpot! I have worked in customer service for over 10 years and I cannot express how nice it was that Elena had just wonderfully done her job. Yes, I know I was lucky that staff found it. I was also lucky that, Elena was honest staff\u2026I know a lot of people can scoff saying it was an exception to the rule. I am not na\u00efve to know that a my designer purse with money, a digital camera, a wristlet, credit cards and my id could of easily been gone forever. What I can say is this, Elena did her job, both honestly and well\u2026She walked me to security. She didn\u2019t just hand me off or shrug her shoulders or make me feel stupid (yes, I already felt dumb enough). I did tip Elena, I did ask to speak to her boss to express my gratitude an praise\u2026If an honest and well-trained employee is the best recommend for any place, then please take my experience with Elena as the highest compliment to visit Aria\u2019s casino. Sidenote: This week I was at the gocery store. I grabbed a cart and found a woman\u2019s black coach purse\u2026I turned it in and thought about how lucky I was to find it! ART: Last note..If you love art there are plenty of cool installations and the conceriege has a walking tour hand out available. I didn't get to explore more just because of my 24 hour visit. That said, I spotted some Chihuly by the valet pick up! next visit will be for the salt spa room!", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Frankfort, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWow - Beautifull Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "leslierph", "ReviewID": "UR61634096", "Content": "Wow - I was impressed with the modern decor in the hotel room and all thru the hotel. We had a regular room and I thought it was quite large. The window was the enire lenghth of one wall, true floor to ceiling windows, top to bottom, left to right, it even turned the corner so you could see to the side also. We were on the 26th floor We had a view of an under construction hotel next door (the Harmon I think?) and we could see a bit of the Rio to the left, and a bit of Planet Hollywood to the right. I loved the entryway with 2 large closets and a granite top in the middle for jewelry etc and 4 large drawers in the middle. The bathroom was also large and the soaking tub was oval and very comfy! We had no problem using the remote panel. Some of the lights could also be turned on/off on the wall (bathroom, entryway, and bedroom switches) The blackout curtains and sheers could also be opened with a wall switch or the remote pad. I told my husband how so many people complained on trip advisor about the blackout drapes letting so much light in the top. We laughed, as you could barely see a thin line of light above the curtains and the light was in no way in our eyes. The room was plenty dark for us anytime of the day. We kept our air on about 62 degrees most of the time, and it was plenty cool for us. Soda in the mini bar was $4 and beers were $6. 2 others in our party had Corner Suites. We saw both rooms. One Corner Suite was on the 53rd floor. It had a 1/2 bath with toilet and sink, round table with 4 chairs, small living area with couch and flat screen tv and large window with remote curtains, bedroom with windows curved around bed on 3 sides and large bathroom with large airjet tub in window with flat screen tv and large shower and get this.. a toilet with heated seats and bidet action (rinse and dry buttons on wall). The other Corner suite was on the 10th floor, and we were surprised by the layout of that room , totally different than the other one. They had a bigger living room, no dinning table and a larger bedroom and a huge L shaped bathroom. Same amount of windows, but the room had views 2 different directions. Both suites had view over Vdara hotel and the 2nd suite could also see out front to Planet Hollywood. The views are not as good as I have had at other vegas hotels. Probably because of the location of Aria within City Center. It is set back a bit off the strip, so you don't get a good view of the strip. Besides that, I thought the location was great. It didn't take very long at all to walk to the strip. Maybe 5 minutes tops as you exit the lobby and walk towards the strip. If you go to the right, you are at CVS and Monte Carlo, and to the left is crystals shopping center, you can either go thru, or on the sidewalk outside continue to Bellagio, or go up and across street to Planet Hollywood. We liked the location. The hotel, while it had numerous restaurants and shops etc. was very easy to navigate. There are 4-5 elevator banks and each bank only went to certain floors. It was a pain to get to our friends room, as they both used different elevators than us, so from our room, we had to go down to casino or promenade level and change elevators to go up to their room. Right next to the lobby was the casino, and the elevators were on the right side of the casino. There were several restaurants and shops around the edge of the casino. The promenade level had the buffett the pool and spa entrance the Viva Elvis show and several more restaurants, bars, and shops. We went to the pool only one day. It was pretty and heated to about 82 degrees which was nice. 3 large pools with plenty of lounge chairs and palm trees. The servers came around often for drinks and food if needed. Cocktails and frozen drinks were about $12-$14 and beers were $7. We did check out the Liquid Lounge, which was just a smaller pool (1/2 size of others) with loud music (DJ) more expensive drinks and food and more plush lounge chairs. They let us in free (2 girls) but said men cost $75 each to enter. We just walked thru to check it out and left. The only advantage I could see is that they let people in the pool with drinks, and the regular pools you could not even get close to pool with your drink. I guess if you were in your 20s it may be fun, I was much too old and got back to regular pool ASAP! I prefer the pools at Mandalay Bay, Mirage, Monte Carlo, and MGM with lazy rivers and wave pools and fountains. Arias pools were a little boring. I guess good for relaxing, only saw 2-3 kids around the pool all day. My daughter was a bit bored. We ate at the buffett for breakfast and for lunch. It was not as large as some other vegas hotels, but most of the selections were good quality. My husband and his father ate at the gourmet buffett that they have on fri and sat nights. It was $35 and included a whole lobster per 2 people brought to your table and unlimited wine (chardonay or merlot) they said it was good. We ate at Cafe Vettro (open 24 hours) for breakfast and it was very good. I preferred it to the buffett. It was probably the most reasonalbe restaurant price wise. We also went to Beso, Eva Longoria's beautifull restaurant. It was very nice and looked like the place to be. We sat near the bar. I had 1 glass of wine, salad, and lobster bisque. It was very good, but with tip costs $45 (just for me) I was glad we went though. We also ate at the P.U.B by Todd English. It was very good and reasonably priced. They had sandwiches and a whole carvery menu where you pick a meat, 2 sauces, and a bread, then put it all together as a sandwich. OUr friends had turkey and brisket and said it was great. There is also a pastry shop (french - jean phillipe patissirie) I'm sure I didn't spell it right, but it had all sorts of rolls and muffins etc and they made fresh crepes and had prob 50 flavors of sorbet and gelato. It was located right by elevators, so easy to take up to room. We went to the Viva Elvis show - awesome. I liked it better than most Cirque shows because it was more normal (costumes and dancing and singing) I also love Elvis, so that helped. My husband even liked it, and he generally hates cirque shows. As far as gambling goes, the slot players in our group never won much and the blackjack (as with most places on the strip on the weekend) were $25 min. My husband did not care for most of the tables having automatic shufflers. Only 2 tables had shoes = and they were $50 and $100 min. I didn't think any of the food/drinks were any more expensive than the other nice strip hotels. We found ourselves walking down to Bills gambling Hall a couple of times to play $5 blackjack and drink $1 frozen margaritas and strawberry daquaris. We also ate lunch at our favorite place , Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris on the outside patio with the Bellagio fountains right across the street. I would definetly stay here again if the price was right. I generally like to stay somewhere different each time though", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "columbus", "Title": "\u201cNot the nicest but definitely up there\u201d", "Author": "wellheynow", "ReviewID": "UR61414230", "Content": "Aria disclaimer\u2026we were invited by our casino host from the Mirage so we didn\u2019t pay for our room and we came home with more gambling money than we came with which always makes a trip nicer. But with that out of the way here are my thoughts. Check in was efficient when we got to the desk\u2014but both people in front of us asked really involved questions (next time buddy save your bell desk questions for the bell desk). So check in took about 20 minutes but most of it was because of bad luck of standing in the wrong line. When we turned around to leave the 4-5 open lines had grown from 4 people in each to over 8 in each so we timed that well. The room is nice. Never staying there before we didn\u2019t know if the 19th floor was good or not but at check in the woman made it sound nice and said it had \u201ca mountain view\u201d. That\u2019s kind of silly to say because it was actually a view of Vdara and other construction still taking place with just a hint of mountain in the back. I understand \u201cmountain view\u201d sounds preferable to \u201cconstruction view\u201d but let\u2019s call a spade a spade. Anyway, other than that the room lived up to it\u2019s billing on the web. Nice colors, efficient use of space. Nothing outrageous but nice\u2014especially the comfortable bed and it was quiet (until the construction started early in the morning but again we knew that going in that it was a new place). It was cool when you walked into the room and everything lit up from the automated systems. We thought the remote control unit was fairly easy to use as well. And again it was nice to have so many features at your fingertips. One of the TV stations shows flight info at McCarran which was nice to not have to look up on our pda/computers. Speaking of which\u2014they charge $15/day for internet access which seems a little cheesy. Just about anywhere else first class we travel that\u2019s an amenity and not an expense. Cheap. It was nice in the mornings to not walk have to walk too far to find coffee and pastries. The Jean Philippe pastry shop is great. The brioche was amazing and the coffee good and again it was conveniently located just off the elevators to quickly grab something and head back upstairs. The casino is nice\u2014subdued colors and spacious. It wasn\u2019t crowded during the day but the evenings were fuller. There was a convention going on (broadcasters) which had swelled the numbers some they said. Speaking of they\u2014every employee and dealer we had contact with was very pleasant. I can\u2019t recall a place where every person was pleasant. Crystal\u2014the shopping mall\u2014is definitely a work in progress. Nice attention to detail in the building of it though and hopefully it will take off. You walk through sections of it to get to the tram which takes you to Bellagio or Monte Carlo. We also walked from the hotel to the strip and it was no problem at all\u2014no further than walking from Caesars to the strip for example. But there\u2019s lots of construction going on so you\u2019re walking under cover for some of it. But it\u2019s an easy walk to Bellagio for sure. All and all a fine stay and we\u2019ll be back. But it seems like Bellagio and Mirage have a more solid feel than this place but again it\u2019s early.

What a mistake. While the hotel and casino are very pretty, that is where the experience ends. The entire staff with the exception of the one bellman who tried to make things right was horrible. We waited 30 minutes to check in at 1030pm. Once we go to the counter, they wanted to authorize an additional $130 a day in addition to our elevated room rates. We stated we were not going to allow this, and they said they would make an exception, and only authorize $130 for the length of our stay...they lied. They ended up over authorizing and we had over $700 of our spending money tied up in this disaster. All they did was offer a line pass at the buffet..lame. When we then got to our 6th floor room, with a great view of the valet lane, nothing worked, the room was 80 degrees, we couldn't get the lights on, the drapes open, or the TV on. In the bathroom, there was still garbage from the previous guest. Nasty. We tried calling the front desk...the phone rang and rang...no answer. Called the bellman to get our bags, they told us it would be 30 minutes, wasting more our time. Finally when our bags got to our room, we lost it. The poor bellman had to deal with all our issues. He moved us to a 16th floor room, and gave us a $100 food credit. We thought, ok, this helps. Boy were we wrong. We got dressed and left the hotel for the night. Went to the valet to get our car, there were tons of people standing around complaining how they had been waiting for over 20 minutes to get their vehicles AT 1 AM!! We we told by the attendant that our wait would be similar. We ended up taking cabs for the night, costing us over $50. Next day we went to the pool. Bad idea. Tried to get into a poolside restaurant with empty tables, we were told it was a 30 minute wait. We were too hungry and figured we could get food from the waitress at the pool. After sitting in our lounge chairs for over 30 minutes the waitress came by, telling us she would be right back. Another 30 minutes go by she finally took our order. 30 minutes later our drinks arrive, she told us that our food would be right out. Guess what? It took another 30 minutes to get the food out, keep in mind this is prepackaged food not chef prepared. 1.5 hours from sitting down to get our order. When it arrived we told them we weren't paying for it. She said she would get a manager. The pool manager at this hotel needs to be FIRED. She took the food from us (which we didn't touch) and offered simply not to charge us. She did not apologize or offer anything to make up for the lack of service and time wasted on our vacation. She made excuses how staff had called in and that the hotel was doing great business etc. She said we were lying and that she was timing us and it didn't take an hour and a half to get our order. The ten people around us who were also waiting for orders assured her it did. I have never experienced such cruddy service at a high end resort. The $100 the bellman comped use did not make up for the experience we had here. Keep in mind also this property has no choices for quick food, only sit down restaurants or over priced bakery areas.

Avoid at all costs until the kinks are worked out. The check-in process was a nearly all day affair! Upon arriving at the hotel, we had to wait over 30 minutes while the significantly under-staffed (but very professional and very nice staff) checked in hundreds of guests. After a long walk with our heavy luggage, we arrived at our first (of 3) rooms. The high-tech room system was not functioning - we weren't able to open the blackout shades or operate anything electrical in the room so hotel management secured a move to the room next door. After a nearly 30 minute wait (and 3 phone calls to the front desk), security showed up with our new room keys. After settling in - it was clear that this room didn't work either. The high-tech room control device malfunctioned here too. This time, the shades stayed open, we couldn't turn off the lights, and the TV couldn't be operated. Another call to the front desk manager (Jennifer) and she offered to send engineering and due to the ~60 minute wait time we decided to spend our time by the pool (that experience is detailed below). After two room software re-sets, it was determined that we would need to be moved again. Again, another 45 minute wait (and 2 phone calls to the front desk) before the bell man showed up to escort us to our room on the other side of the hotel. This room worked (except for the slow drain in the shower which caused water to overflow onto the beautiful bathroom floor). The bellman didn't bring our new room keys (as was promised by the front staff) - so on our way out for the evening, we stopped by the front desk to pick up a new set of room keys. They were still swamped! Not even a manager was available to get us keys without waiting in yet another 30 minute line. We gave up and just went out for the evening. The pool area, while beautiful and spacious, was not a good experience either. It took 1 hour and 30 minutes before we were served our first pina coloda. We flagged down the attendant, who confessed that only 2 people were assigned to the hundreds of pooside guests. We were offered the opportunity to stand in line at the bar for a cocktail - but were adivsed that the wait time was expected to be at least 30 minutes. Did I mention that this was on Friday afternoon? How would they be able to handle weekend guests? To be fair - the hotel did credit us a one-night stay and a $100 food/beverage credit. There's really nothing more they could have offered, but even a free room and $100 of drinking was NOT worth this much hassle! We literally lost nearly one day of R&R.

It is a bit darker than other Hotels. The Casino has a dim look to it. Wasn't a very big Casino compared to Mandalay Bay or Belagio but still was nice and clean. It did have a bit of a cigarette odor down at the Casino. Plenty of High Stakes gaming, as well, as lower and more affordable games to enjoy. I booked a Deluxe 2 queen bed room, non smoking, but was forced into a smoking section, only room with 2 queen beds available, but was given a free city view room at no extra charge. Later was able to move to a non smoking room, EXTREMELY better smelling room/hall ways. Room: I was amazed upon first entry, Lights turned on, curtains opened, T.V turned on Welcoming the Guest and with such a nice view its hard to not be impressed. The touchscreen remote for the entire room was a lot easier than people reviewed it. Had HUGE buttons indicating what you want to control. TV, TEMPERATURE, MUSIC, LIGHTS, Bathroom or Room, SERVICE and CURTAINS If you own an ipod or are under 30 yrs. old (I'm 22) it will take less than 15 min to be fully comfortable and wishing you had one at home. Nice bathroom, nice shower head with a full body tub to soak in. The bed was the absolute most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. So many pillows and great sleep. Only thing for an ipod, make sure to bring your USB charger and audio plug to plug into the control panel. Amenities: The Spa was excellent! got 2 all day passes (6am - 8pm) for me and my girl friend for $60 a great price for Vegas. You can visit it at any time within those hours. Had a full gym to use, but never touched it. Looked very nice though. The Co-ed sections were also a pretty nice touch. And the only Co-ed spa in Vegas. Had a Co-ed Japanese hearted rock thing that was amazingly comfortable, and also had a relaxation room to sit and be calm. Very nice. The Co-ed patio swimming pool was over looking Liquid, the Adult swimming pool section when I went it was $20 men Free Woman. The pool it self was a little of a let down. I am used to to Mandalay Bays pool, and nothing else compares. But the Aria had about 2 or 3 pools, each was only 3 1/2 feet deep. No real \"swimming\" could be done. Also very large Jacuzzis. Night club: Only went to Haze got free passes for entrance and about a 30 min wait. The sound system was incredible with great bass but was rather small and some one cramped, and this was the second Friday of April, I can only imagine in Summer or Holiday. But was a cool place to go to for free with a great vibe and cool atmosphere. Also saw Mel B. Scary Spice from the Spice Girls there at the DJ booth.

Once you exit, there are signs that say valet parking and self-parking. Couldn't be any clearer. We parked in the self-parking and it is quite a journey to the check-in desk. There were four couples ahead of us and the check-in took about 15 mins. People were asking lots of questions and the clerks were very patient and explained everything. We went to our room and it was immaculate. It was a little warm but I used the remote control and changed temp. from 77 to 72. As everyone said, when you walk in the drapes open, the lights come on and the TV has your name on the screen. Our technical ability is average and we had no trouble at all controlling the TV, lights, temperature, and drapes with the remote. Also, if you don't want to use the remote, there are manual switches everywhere. The bed and pillows were awesome...so soft and comfortable. Others complained about the light that came in at the top of the drapes. There is a very small amount but I just can't see how this could annoy anyone. I probably wouldn't have even thought about it if I had not read about in on here. Also, I experienced no water splashing in the bathroom sinks as others mentioned.. We left the next morning around 10am to go shopping and when we came back about 4 hrs. later, the room had been cleaned and was spotless. Left again later and when we returned, the bed was turned down and chocolates were left on the night stand beside the bed. We did not eat at any of the restaurants here so I can't comment on them. Didn't have any luck in the casino but I can't see how anyone could have a problem with the darkness or the smell. Just barely noticed the smell when we first walked in and i thought the darkness was comparable to most other casinos. Also, saw the Viva Elvis show.

We got a good deal online at Aria so decided to book it and see what it was like. We arrived at about 11pm and check in was really quick. The walk from the elevator to our room was slightly annoying as it was quite a distance however the room itself was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. Its a very modern hotel and the in-room technology was impressive although I agree with other comments about it being difficult to work out how to actually turn on and off the lights.

They also have Liquid Pool which we didnt ever go to but every day I would get a \"Ladies Pass\" for it. The casino is massive but we didn't really spend much time there.

If you do want to walk, the hotel is set back from the Strip so you just have to walk down to the main road.

The bathroom was lovely, but weirdly the bath is inside the shower cubicle and the rain shower wasn't as powerful as I would have liked. Also..the sinks didn't have plugs, whichy is a bit annoying if you want to wash your face as you have to leave the tap running..which can't be good for the old eco credentials ! all in all, its a really plush amazing room..and best of all, fantastically sound proofed unlike other Vegas hotels I have stayed in. Casino Is really stylish and doesn't have a particular theme, which is quite nice - we had a great couple of nights gaming and I particularly liked the lighting which for me was just right. Restaurants. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants per se...we did try and get a super late night snack - at about 3am and were disapointed that the only place was the main restaurant which was a bit more formal than we wanted - at least that is what one of the gaming managers said...We just wanted to grab a burger or a tuna melt and a cup of tea to take to bed. The menu was bit fancier than that and the waitress looked down her nose at us a bit when we asked whether we could get the food packaged up to take to bed and they didnt have any disposable cups to take the tea to bed..so I just took the mug..she looked down her nose at that too ! At the end of the day...the place is lovely, but it doesnt matter if you have a million pounds or 100 pounds, when its 3 am in the morning and you've had a few beers, you don't want fancy food..you want a burger and fries!! We didn't go to the pool as it was too cold, but if the rest of the hotel is anything to go by,,,it will be fantastic ! Definately reccomend this place ...but be prepared to be foxed by the electronic room devices !", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver", "Title": "\u201cBad reviews are written by the super picky...Aria Is Great!\u201d", "Author": "dmt19", "ReviewID": "UR60961992", "Content": "Stayed at the Aria April 4 - 7th for a short getaway. From the start I would agree that it is strange that the first impression if you are arriving via shuttle is the underground parking lot where you get dropped off. If you arrive by limo or taxi they take you to the front entrance. Strange but nothing worth really complaining about. Checking in was simple and quick, we asked for the highest floor possible and were given the 51st! Rooms are great and the tech rooms were easy to figure out...however if you keep touching every option over and over again it will slow down to think and try and catch up....typical computer.....again...nothing worth complaining about. Service was great everywhere we went.....everyone was willing to answer questions and have fun....always asking where we were from and having great conversations. Nothing bad to say about staff! Cleaning of our room was done everyday without fail or issue. Restaurants are pricey but we expected that....bars are the same....about $11 for a highball drink....but there are MANY other places in Vegas to drink for cheaper so......not worth complaining about.....we knew that going in. Casino is dark....but that's what makes it different and in fact I like it better than a bright casino at 3 in the morning.....its quite relaxing actually. Location is great....I do not understand how anyone says it's a 20 minute walk to the strip? it's like 2 or three minutes! If you go to Vegas and don't like to walk your pretty much screwed. AGAIN the location is perfect....right in the heart of it all. I cannot understand some of the bad reviews I have read before I went......forget them all......ARIA is the next great Vegas hotel. I would definitely go back again. Unless your picky about stupid things like the color of the carpet in your room, the smell of the hotel or that you have to walk......you\"ll have a good time.

My husband and I have traveled to Vegas on numerous occasions and stayed at the Monte Carlo and MGM. After reading about the new City Center, we decided to book a reservation at the Aria. Upon arrival, we had a very good experience checking in. The reservation clerk was very professional and experienced and there was little wait at the check-in counter. Our room was on a higher floor with a wonderful view of the strip. Everything was very comfortable in the room with no outside noise at all. This is most likely the most sound-proof room that I have ever stayed in. We had no problems with the remotes even with our limited technological ability. As for location, there is a short 5 minute or less walk to Las Vegas Boulevard with sidewalks and an escalator. There is also a tram available to the MonteCarlo and Bellagio. When in Vegas, we always prefer to walk - that is what it is all about!!!!! The restaurants at Aria are all up-scale and were not busy during the time that we visitied. We preferred to go to other buffets and to the food court at the Monte Carlo. If I had a family traveling, it would be difficult to find reasonable priced food at the Aria. I understand their thinking as it is the one up-scale MGM/Mirage property. Also, remember that the Players Club for the casino includes all MGM/Mirage properties - 9 or 10 in all. The pools are beautiful - 3 pools and 3 hot tubs. Hours are advertised as 9-6, however, we were told that they close at 5 when the pool is not busy. Hours need to be more flexible. Doors opened at 9 AM sharp. We arrived a few minutes early and were turned away. I would also think that in the summer, many would want to relax at the pool with a cocktail after 5 or 6 PM. If arriving and departing by airport shuttle, be prepared for a less than expected experience. Taxis and limos are permitted at the front entrance to the hotel, however, shuttle busses are sent to the very sterile basement through a tunnel. To get to the reservation desk, one must then travel up two sets of escalators and through the entire casino with suitcase in tow. When we went to depart via shuttle, we had a difficult time finding the basement entrance and had to approach 3 hotel employees before someone could help us. Everything in the hotel is designed with atmosphere in mind. Someone missed the first and last impression when they thought the shuttle entrance! We loaded the shuttle by the restaurant supply trucks!!! Hopefully, the hotel will reconsider this option. It makes the guest feel like a second-class guest. All in all, I would return to the Aria.

They haven't been on a vacation in years, and also haven't seen their grandkids for 10 yrs because of my fathers illness, not being allowed to travel to europe (NO FLYING). So, we arrived at 7pm on Monday, and were checked in within 15mnts. Given great rooms that were so modern and comfortable we never wanted to get out of bed! I can understand that most people would think it's kinda pricey, but we come from the most expensive country for daily living in the world, and price wise for all ammenities seemed normal to us. When my parents arrived on Tuesday, they couldn't wait to see their grandkids, and start gambling. We gave them their spending money, the whole trip was on us, and we had a great time while they were with us. They loved the hotel, unfortunately they were given a smoking room, as the hotel was booked up, but there was NO SMELL of smoke at all! They thought the rooms and especially the bathroom was soo luxurious, that they are planning to redesign parts of their home in the same modern design as Aria. Housekeeping was emmaculate as well as service. The valet parking work hard, so tip them well, we did. The kids used the spa and the pools, and said they were top of the line, as was the casino. I loved the fact that although people smoked, you couldn't smell it or that the smoke lingered on your clothes. The scent they have going thru the air is one of Vanilla and spices.

Check in went fairly smooth (under on hour!), considering the amount of guests checking in and only about 4 employees working the front desk. Upon checking into our room, we decided to go check out the casino and get something to eat. Much to our surprise, when we returned to our room, we noticed someone had been in it. And shockingly enough, $200 in cash was missing! Now mind you, this cash wasn't just sitting out in the open\u2026someone would have to have been looking for it. The room had been made up prior to our check in and the room had not yet been turned down so there was no reason what so ever for ANYONE to have been in our room. Aside from the missing money an ashtray had been emptied so we knew someone had been in the room. After getting the run around for a half hour at the front desk, my husband finally gave up trying to actually talk to someone in person, returned to our room and call the front desk. After sitting on hold for twenty minutes, he was told someone would be up shortly to take our statement. Apparently, their idea or shortly and mine aren't the same! After waiting 45 minutes, the \"report writer\" for the hotel showed up. Which is odd considering we here told by the front desk that security would be coming. And YES...there is a safe hidden somewhere in the room(sort of like playing hide and seek)...which was discovered on the 3rd day we were there! Because God forbid the secret location would be mentioned at check in or better yet, by the \"security/report writer\" that had taken our report! Having been a police officer for fifteen years, my husband was more qualified to take that statement then the person who was sent to our room. After being giving the standard reply of, \"We will look into it and let you know\", he left the room\u2026never to be heard from again! I would like to say I'm surprised by that, but sadly, the customer service we received at this hotel couldn't have been worse. From that point on we left the privacy light on, so as not to have anyone in our room. Of course, I have come to realize that the privacy light is merely a suggestion to housekeeping. Since regardless of it being on or not, there was always someone in our room. In fact, on our last day there, the privacy light was on and housekeeping still came barging in, while still in our room packing. Since this happened on our first night at the hotel, we never ate at the restaurants and avoided their casino...they already made $200 off of us, why spend more?! After waiting two weeks for \"someone to get back to us\", I send an email to the \"customer service\" (using that term very loosly!) dept. Oddly enough, I received a reply email saying that they didn't have any way of contacting me about the report, which was why we hadn't heard back. Yet the response from them wasn't a reply to my original email, rather a new email sent to my other email address. Which is odd considering they had \"no way of contacting me\", yet could send me an email to an address that they apparently didn't have?! So the long and short of it...we are out $200, since they are \"still looking into it\". Chalk it up to an expensive learning experience...not like they wouldn't have gotten that money either in the casino or at a restaurant, but I would have liked to get some enjoyment out of spending my hard earned money! The only decent employees working there are the ones who depend on tips and understand the meaning of customer service, such as the cocktail waitresses and the bell men. Such a waste to have spent the money to build this hotel and then drive paying customers away by terrible customer service.

Check in: Checked in early friday at 11am. Staff at check in was polite, and there was a small line at the main check in desk, so they moved us over the VIP check in and waited no more than 2 minutes and received a room even though we were waay early. There is some kinda scent that is pumped thru the ventilation system on the main floor that is such a nice change to the normal old cigarettes smell in most Vegas hotel lobbies and casinos..You had to show your room key to get to elevators to go to rooms, so at least they were on top of that securty detail. Room: we were on the 20th floor and got a pool view room with 2 queen beds... the walk from the elevator was FAR.. really far... they should have considered to banks of elevators when designing this place. The room was clean (except for a few spots on carpet). Nicely appointed, good size, good closet space. The remote control system is way too gimicky, and even though ours was working fine, could not figure out how to simply turn off TV. Bathroom was clean as well. No issues with water pressure. Didn't find marble slippery. Service staff was friendly, always greeted you when you saw them in hallway. Soap in room was really harsh and drying. Casino- didn't gamble much but it is dark.. way dark. Pool- didnt go, cuz it was windy and cold, but sure saw people down there.. Restaurants- Julian Serrano- even for a tapas restaurant, the portions seemed really, really small for the price. Not worth it in my opinion, and the Sangria was lacking flavor. The Buffet- could have used more selection for hot food. The Indian and Mexican food was not up to par. Had the usual crab legs and shrimp and carved meat thing going on. Desserts were good. There are better buffets on the strip. Cafe Vettro- open 24 hours, good after you are done clubbing, food pretty decent, slightly overpriced. Nitelife- Haze. The latest club to open on the Strip. Waaaay to young for my taste and not alot of dancing space...if you want to waste your money to do bottle service, then it may be ok for you. Drinks like most other Vegas hotspots are overpriced. Got comp admission. Gold- lounge on promenade level, no cover. Door staff and bartenders were actually friendly at this place. Better music than Haze. Was not packed at all, but there are supposed to have grand opening this week. All other lounges/ bars seemed kinda empty to me.

The more I read, the more nervous I got. In fact, I even considered switching hotels about a month before I left. But I am so glad that I decided to stay. The Aria is beautiful, and the staff is so friendly. When we first checked in, which was around 7 pm, so it was pretty quick, they didn't have any of the rooms we requested available (2 queen beds) so I immediately expressed my dissapointment and asked what they could do. We were offered a $50 food and beverage credit. But not even a miniute later, she suddenly found a 2 queen bed room. AND, she let us keep the credit. The room was beautiful, we had a few of the mountains, which was nice. I thought the control panel was extremely easy to use. I could understand how some guests may find that difficult, but I thought it was fun, and it was the first thing I ran over to when we walked in. I couldn't wait to start playing with all the features. The hotel is massive, and even after staying there 5 days, we still got confused when trying to get to different places. The hotel is connected to the Monte Carlo and getting there is pretty easy. So is the Tram to the Bellagio. We went to the Viva Elvis show, which was amazing. His music is so iconic, that I think any one from any generation would like it. It's so colorful and bright, and its Cirque du Soleil performers were incredible. It's a must and I'm so glad we got to see it. The dining options at the Aria are a little too refined for our tastes. Everything was very upscale, but very expensive. There weren't a lot of options for people who just wanted normal food. I asked an employee why the Aria doesn't have any sort of food court, and we were told that Aria is going for a 5 star, 5 diamond rating, which is obvious. We decided to go to the Jean Georges Steakhouse. I had the 8 oz Filet Mignon, and my friend had the 10 oz strip steak. We each ordered a side, no appetizers, no drinks and no dessert and our bill was $100. So, it's kind of expensive, but worth the splurge, plus it helped that we had the $50 credit. All in all, the Aria is amazing. I felt that I needed to write this review because I cannot believe the things that other reviewers were complaning about. Don't believe what you read. The staff was so friendly, everyone is so nice and we never had a problem with housekeeping.

Get up to front desk mess of over 200 hundred people waiting in a crowd to check in NO Definite lines or line system..waited over 40 minutes to check in it was a mess rude counter person trying to make lines total confusion. This was a Friday afternoon total mess,, tons of people complaining at front desk for service...everyone is angry at the wait times staff just ignoring your comments Finally check in no one brings us up to room we are left on our own to find elevators this place is giant ...SIGNAGE VERY HARD we had to keep asking where are the elevators,,,difficult to read very dark casinos that smell like vanilla to mask smoking smell. and to get you to gamble more . Get up to our room on 52nd floor view is spectacular, room is nicely decorated NOTHING WORKS. the tv will not turn on with remote, the curtains keep opening and closing, and the lights only work in one section ..WE keep calling front desk to ask for help we even ask the maid she has no idea says to keep calling front desk... no one answers wait forever no one answers the phone we call another department who says we have to call front desk right now we are annoyed and tired from flying so we decide to deal with it lator ...after calling more than 20x the line ups at the front desk never end no service ,so we call food and beverage who locate the team who repairs the electronics a guy comes up after waiting for him over 30 minutes to say the batteries are dead in the remote, I ask how come no one checked this before we got there he says there is a team but they do not have time to do everything ... than he says we have to reset the room which takes an additional 30 minutes it finally works but our morning is shot waiting for the repair .. we miss breakfast because breakfast ends at 11am so we find a cheap spot to eat. During the night while we were sleeping the curtains open an close a few times without us touching anything some electronice malfunction...than we go down to the pool...the pool is very nice there are three of them with hot tubs all around .We order two drinks pay waitress with a $50 travelers check she disappears we wait over an hour than have to go the bar to find her...they say at the bar \"o she did not come back an tell you we do not accept the checks,,, you have to pay cash here our cashes are not set up for that\" so we get our check back pay cash....exhausting again no service and again no communication to staff to let weary travelers know anything. I panic thinking maybe waitress thought it was a big tip??? Our next adventure was eating at the buffet which promised a lobster each it is only one split between you it was dried out and the food was ok not great the desserts are great but for $40. you can do better on the strip.We told the waitress she said we had to tell the manager about the dried out lobster he told us he would tell the cook it is called pass the buck in that hotel NO ONE TAKES RESPONIBILITY FOR ANYTHING THERE...I go to the casino all I wanted while playing was a bottle of water the waitress told me she does not serve in that section no one ever came to offer anything so I left for greener pastures which was Planet Hollywood better at service...always being served drinks It is a huge hotel they need to fix tons of things like service , heres a good story three guests told me they booked three months in advance only to find out when they got there hotel overbooked so one of the guests had to sleep on the floor , finally after two days they switched their rooms after freaking out at the front desk ...it was computer glitch another story was from another guest she enters the room to find an inch of dust and a dirty sock left on the floor she called front desk no one came up to clean it up either she was left to do it she will never return either...everyone that I ran into complained about the same thing NO Service anywhere So pick another hotel like Bellagio or Wynn encore is a better bet ,,this place needs a management shakeup and will close if it does not improve fast ,,people want service not issues when they travel. Anyways we go back upstairs to get dressed and walk around BRING COMFORTABLE SHOES LIKE RUNNING SHOES SNEAKERS PLIMPSOLES Las Vegas is huge... We go to ticketsrless to find out bout the shows and food we buy a half price ticket to Treasure Island buffet...food is ok not great but we are so hungrey anything would be good. Price was $25 pp we got tickets from the ticketsrless place it saves you some money... We decide on a few shows we went to see Peep show do not bother it was crap Holly Madison cannot act or dance or even sing for beans she only exposes herself once and it is the most boring show I have ever seen..I actually feel sorry for her she should of stayed with Hefner as he would of supported her better than this will..It is in Planet Hollywood main strip ..however this place after the show is amazing tons of fun lots of action busy.. I liked the energy in the place and they had to close down some of the machines to change them for the new cards coming ,the management were very nice to me they gave me a card with $15 on it for my inconvience. I went back a few times there, I really liked the ambiance,,, and the restaurants in the Mall were very good especially the Italian one, they also serve cheap breakfasts there for $5.99 ..great job Planet Hollywood !!!!now you have to get a world class show in there and you will be winning hands down Holly Madison is not world class sad but true!!! Holly what did you do with the money your mom gave you for acting lessons??? Next show Zumanities from the Cirque de soleil bravo Guy Laliberte great show very entertaining and tons of fun the cast was amazing very entertaining professional I give it 5 stars loved it and the music dancing tons of fun very sexual but fun...in New York New York great place to gamble too lots of fun and the music was great. Very energetic place No I did not win anything but still had fun and it looks like NY... I recommend this hotel to anyone. wanting that experiance. The Bellagio is my favorite so far the restuarant we went to was Olives main floor,,, it was wonderful we sat at the bar the food is delicious the bar tender that served us was Chris he was great fun and professional. He Knows his wines and food and recommended what we ate ..very impressed great service and go there it was about 35 per person and it was worth it if you want good food with wonderful bistro ambiance this is the place !!!! Do not eat at Wendys for breakfast no matter how desperate you are it was awful the eggs were runny and the biscuits were not done properly and the service was slow Dennys was ok but the waiter dropped the toast on his hands and got angry when I asked for another order, he raised his voice and said \" O comeon it only touched my hands it did not hit the floor \" this was on the main strip across from New York,,, he was a bit rude and the breakfast was not that great... The breakfast place in Planet Hollywood in the Mall section was very good and reasonable so go there for your food everyone does that knows it.. water is cheap at 7/11 2 bottles for $2 that is a great deal when hotels are selling them at $4 each you need to drink it is very dry there you get dehydrated we took the public bus called the duece to the old section which is very charming take the express instead called the ACE IT IS REALLY FAST and direct and cheap get a pass like we got. we also ate at the RAINFOREST cafe in the MGM Grand what an experiance it was great food fun place and I felt like I was kid again at Disney land it is a nice hotel too. I will be writting my comments to them about the AWFUL ARIA and they are the managers of that place it was shame because we saved up for this holiday and were greatly disappointed at having to complain no one wants to waste their time with issues all you want is great time without problems . it is called a holiday for a reason right? Anyways if I ever go back it will be either the Bellagio or Wynn ,,,,,,,sorry folks for the bad review however I was not the only guest who thought like that most of them that I spoke to at the pool had the same opinion of the no service at the Aria....", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cAria was like a dream....\u201d", "Author": "MrsKrys", "ReviewID": "UR60064043", "Content": "I am a travel agent,so I was watching this hotel for over a year and a half because I wanted to see its architecture and beauty for myself. I had never been to Vegas before and I could NOT wait to stay at this hotel. I chose the Aria, because of its overall beauty, and its location (City Centre) I stayed at the Aria January 8th-12th, this was a VERY popular time, for there was eight conventions in town. When we arrived the absolute beauty of the outside of the hotel is just magnificent all those angles and glass. It was so cool to watch the monorail pass by. The first thing I noticed when I walked into the Aria was the smell, it smells so delicious, its like chocolate and vanilla (or just really sweet--mmmmmm). Once we got to the lobby there where a few line ups, but there was a coordinator who showed us to a short line. Well the front desk attendants where very pleasant and welcoming, and apologize for the delay for we had come on one of the craziest weekends with all the conventions. I was then informed our suite with 2 queens was not available until 4:00pm. Well I had called and requested an early checkin because we were there at 10:00am. So I asked her if we could just get any room for now, just so my friend and I could freshen up. She said no problem. So I gave her my cell number and asked her if she could contact me when our room was ready, because we were going to go check out the strip for the first time, and get lunch. She assured me this would not be a problem. So we get to the room, and it is very futuristic, everything is electronic. When you walk in the curtains open, television turns on, and you are welcomed into the room with a delightful voice. It was very cool to play with everything, and try and figure out the remote. A somewhat funny even occurred when I was showering, all of a sudden all the lights in the bathroom turned off. So I stayed calm opened the shower door and like magic the lights turned on.(I guess the 3 light switches all do different things--I found out later that we were suppose to get a guest service rep help us to our rooms, and show us how all the switches and electronic remote worked-NO IMPRESSED-Make sure you get shown how to use these). It was about noon when we left the room. We hit the casino for a bit, very nice. The Aria has a shopping centre in it, it is VERY high end, but still worth a walk through, because there are so many unique objects. Once we made it outside we noticed that walking out to the main strip was a good ten minute walk. I have to say my favorite part of the outside of the Aria is the massive triangle over hang (its hard to explain my in my pictures) thats made of glass and is just amazing, and a waterfall wall. I also want people to know that there are different rooms available, and each room category (modern to extravagant) are separated by different elevators and different doors. You cant get to an elevator without the appropriate key. I did like this very much, the security of knowing that there was a big security man standing by each elevator. When we hadn't heard anything by 6:00 we decided to head back to the hotel. When we went to the front desk to check if our room was ready they told us that there was never a room put on hold for us. So by this time I was getting frustrated. Once I explained the situation, they did eventually get us our room(30 mins), but it still wasn't the one I requested. The poker rooms were great, and kept small, but scattered. Sports bar was very nice, and theirs a delicious bistro before it. Very large amount of Slots, alot of blackJack, overall my favorite casino out of most. The waitresses were very prompt at serving you. Theres also a nice coffee, sweet shop near the casino, and some very nice restaurants. All the lounges were very laid back, and classic. Overall I would definitely stay in the Aria again, because it is in a great location on the strip, very upscale/ unique, great casino, lots of shopping available, rooms are fantastic ( love the futuristic feel) and the absolute beauty of the architecture of this hotel.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cfor the beautiful people\u201d", "Author": "candeux", "ReviewID": "UR60061860", "Content": "My husband & I just returned from our latest trip to Vegas. With so many hotel options to now choose from on the Strip, and not having received a special invite from Aria, we still decided to check out the new kid on the block in the massive City Center (which is what $8.5 billion on 67 acres gets you - a LOT of new hotels/casinos/shopping). We're both architects and were very curious at the lure of the starchitect cachet of Aria and its immediate surroundings. The Strip is visually stimulating and Aria is no exception. The room technology is impressive as other reviews have stated. Little expense seems to have been spared and a lot of attention to detail paid. Congrats to the design team. However, from our point of view, we can't give it our full approval. Appreciative as we are to the aesthetic, It's just not us - this hotel is geared towards VERY image conscious, young, 20-something. \"beautiful\" people who see nothing wrong with having it literally all hang out at the Buffet (yes, the young blonde loudly insisted her sheer cover-up was sufficient - the management & diners disagreed). There were all ages, races, shapes and sizes to the guests but the sweet young things were definitely front and center. The service, although very polite and nice enough, was definitely spotty. Thankfully we didn't have any major issues w/ our room except ever-present sporatic housecleaning. And the times that I did call down to the front desk, well, it was faster to go speak to them in person than wait on the line. With that said, it's not all bad . . . Pros: -GREAT bed (it can be yours for @ $2500) -lovely Spa & Salon (the staff here were the most pleasant in the hotel - even if a prerequisite for the Salon staff includes a tattoo or piercing) -casino is not THAT big (and the machines & tables were friendly!!!) -Buffet has wonderful selection for food -great public art (although there's generations of people who don't know what a typewriter eraser is) -easy walk/connection to Bellagio thru Vdara But there are the Cons: -the sickeningly sweet smell that tries to cover the smoke (smells like the same scent that's used in the Venetian) -poor service: hopefully these are just growing pains that they must improve to keep those 4000+ rooms filled -poor design: I'm disgusted that it took me way too long to find the outlet in the bathroom to plug in the hair dryer - moving the tray AND tissue box each time was absolutely ridiculous - THAT is not smart or well-designed - form still follows function! -if you have a Strip view room, the lights around the entry fountain manage to peek in through the edges of the blackout blinds -misc. \"bugs\": after the elevator stopped unexpectedly, had to convince myself that consciously I knew it could not freefall - but there were other elevators out of order and it's only been open for 3 months -what is it going to feel like in mid-August with all that glass? we could already feel the heat gain off the reflections in late-March.

Upon arrival to the room, was very surprised at how small it was compared to other Vegas suites I have stayed in. The windows were filthy which really destroyed the view of the construction going on outside on the other buildings in City Center. The electronics are great when they are working, which in my case was off and on. At one point the lights went off and the drapes closed for no apparent reason. The TV locked up and it required 2 calls and a 5 hour wait to get it re-booted and up and running again. Don't even bother to try to get maid service.

My husband and I travel to Vegas often so have experienced many of the hotels on the strip. Prior to our visit to Aria last month, Mirage and Mandalay Bay were our fav's. Aria has, by far, become our new favorite. So much so that we are returning in April for another stay. My husband surprised me with this trip and we were arriving from different cities...he arrived at about 7:30 am and was promptly given a room. The rooms are so modern and decorated so well! It is a fully electronic room...from the curtains, to the lights, to the TV. Very cool! Although, I must say, it was a little difficult to figure out the remote and how everything worked...and I consider myself to be good with technology. When my husband entered the room for the first time there was a nice surprise...don't want to spill the beans because it makes you feel like you're getting some special treatment or something. When I arrived at the hotel and entered the lobby I was blown away by how GOOD it smelled. Whatever scent they have running thru there is phenomenal...something like a vanilla/citrus mix. The casino was HUGE but easy enough to get around. I LOVE the decor of the casino/hotel. No theme...just new and modern...kind of refreshing. My husband spends most of the time in the casino while I spend most of mine at the pool. So...when picking out hotels I tend to go to pick those with the nicest pools. ARIA did NOT disappoint. They have three pools, plenty of chairs (although it was March so not full) and the wait staff are constantly coming thru. Lots of palm trees, plants, etc. Also, someone mentioned lack of security. We only stayed for one night and on two different occassions, on our floor, we saw security going into two rooms. Not sure if that was coincidence or not but wanted to notate it. We only ate one of the restaurants; Jean Georges (not sure if I'm spelling that right) and it was DELISH!!! My husband and I split the porterhouse and it was probably the best steak I've ever had...second best was at STACK in Mandalay Bay. Someone also mentioned that there is not a sundries shop...there is. It's in the shop (which does look like a clothing store) at the bottom of escalators leading up to the pool...around the corner for the bakery/dessert shop. Anyway, I think that about covers it.

We were excited to try the newest luxury hotel, Aria, but were disappointed overall with our stay. The building is very beautiful with lots to look at. The rooms had a great initial appearance, but that's when the problems started. First, there was rotten food in the unlocked mini bar that was obviously there for some time. We called to have it removed but no one ever showed. We really wanted to order room service which is much easier to do if they include a menu in the room. We called to request a menu which they said they would send right up, but no menu ever showed up. We figured we could at least put some drinks on ice and relax without room service only to find after a long walk to the ice machine, there was no ice, the machine was broken. We reported this problem but as you can probably guess, no one showed to fix the ice machine. Do you sense a trend? On another topic, the remote control option to open curtains, turn on lights, manage music and other entertainment had great potential but unfortunately, the software was painfully slow. Hit a button and wait became the norm. We recommend you pray you hit the right button and don't hit it more than once because bad things happen. The check in process was somewhat disorganized. We could see they were trying but more work needs to be done. We had two couple in front of us and it still took 30 minutes to get checked in. The clerk was slow and should have asked for more information about us prior to searching for our reservation. She attempted to use our name which was very slow. We finally offered a confirmation number which moved the process along. The rooms were quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The food was a bright spot. The dessert shop had great options for a reasonable price. The coffee was great! The buffet was OUTSTANDING!. The choices and quality were far better than any buffet that we have ever been to.

I chose the Aria for our group largely because it was brand new and that it would likely draw a good crowd. Some of my gambles paid off, while others added to my daily hangover. We chose to stay here for four nights, so I can honestly say that these issues were not isolated, so without further ado... The technology is sweet, but also a nightmare. You can control the entire room on one touch pad remote. Cool until you actually NEED to use it. Most of this is because the touch remote is unresponsive making TV useless. The lights weren't labeled well, so you have to push every button or deal with the touch pad. On a positive note, you could set the alarm to open your curtains and dim the lights. Not cool when pranksters set if for 5am and have ESPN and lights turn on. Arg. $30 gym fee. Needed to do a quickie workout, but found out at the spa there was a fee. I am not paying for a 30 minute jog on an elliptical. After a long wait, I got the manager to comp this for me and a few friends. Casino is so so. Aside from getting my rear kicked on every table, the casino was small and not well planned. It took us a very long time to figure our where anything was located. You cannot see easily because it is very dark and the ceilings are low. Therefore, you need a GPS to find the sports book, poker rooms, cashier, and a quick bite. Positive note, cocktail waitresses were very friendly. If you are staying, I would immediately learn the floor plan and city center layout. This will save you TONS of wasted time and energy. Pool is nothing special. Everything about the Aria is a scam to milk your wallet, and the pool is no exception. Some pools are very exclusive and Aria guests don't get preference. Many private cabanas that are surrounding the pool area rent for $1000. If your making Kanye $$ then this would be BA. The pool definitely caters to the rock star crowd and was pretty boring. Monte Carlo pool was rocking though, saw tons of people having fun. I know this because the Aria tram access is overlooking the MC. Music and food everywhere and a good balance of amenities. Aria failed on making it classy AND fun. Perks... not for me. We were there during March Madness and the hotel was booked solid. Because of this, I'm guessing they payed little attention to non-VIPs. Room service, not great. I didn't test this extensively, but when I needed towels on the fly we waited an hour. I also had a question for the front desk and could never get someone to answer. Called about 5 times or 10 minutes. They wouldn't provide us with basic requests, ie-cups for the room. Most service staffers were extremely friendly though. 50% have been laid off since the open, so I'm guessing they are highly motivated. Bathroom was pretty nice. Not good for a group of friends since the shower and toilet are only separated by glass. Created a few uncomfortable moments. Shower leaks all over the outside marble and the water flow is weak. Took us 5 min to locate the sink outlet, which was hidden behind a marble kleenex box. \"Towels are kinda scratchy!\" Never visited the clubs at Aria, but the word is that Haze is a pretty happening club. Tough to get in and I'm guessing they want guys to drop $1000 for a 2 bottle minimum table. Keys had problems. Like most hotel keys, there are easy to demagnetize. This caused many of us to make the 10 mile walk from room to front desk. Once one key is remagnetized, the others are invalid. This was very annoying. Check-in and check-out can take a long time depending on when you show up. I didn't have this problem, but mid-day arrivals were 15 people deep. All in all, it was a good stay due to the novelty of the casino/hotel. One and done for me, and I would recommend this to anyone who is new to Vegas. I have stayed elsewhere and recognize the many faults at Aria. If you are familiar with SPG hotels, I would compare this to the Aloft. It is trendy and clean like a W Hotel but has the attention to details and value of an Aloft. Hope this is helpful! PS. Can't leave this out. I've been to almost all of the big name casinos and I will give the Aria one closing complement... the women that were converging on this casino and hotel were amazing! Hottest women in Vegas on this survey. Most were passing through to clubs, or other venues. Around midnight, it was an amazing to see. Oh yeah, and I gambled with Mike Tice, previous Vikings coach.

Prices for food, buffets, and drinks are similar to all other locations on the strip in Vegas. We also had a 75.00 credit with a promo code we used so that got us free ice cream, drinks, and part of a meal. The room is very high tech with a touch screen that controls everything. It is very neat...we enjoyed just playing with all the controls. The bathroom is very large with double sinks which was great since we had many people in our room. We were a younger crowd, and enjoyed this hotel. People of all ages seem to stay at this hotel, however it was mostly middle aged people, as it is too expensive for most Spring Breakers. The staff is very accomodating. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay as great as possible. We had a problem with our bathroom door handle and the toilet flushing on its own. They came up immediately to fix these problems. We also accidentally broke the toilet lid trying to figure out the problem ourself, and they never charged us for it. Very nice!! The pool area is Gorgeous with three pools and 3 hot tubs. There is also a luxury pool called Liquid, but it was not open yet and I'm assuming it will cost more.

We took a shuttle from the airport since 5 of us arrived on the same flight. For some reason the shuttle dropped us off in the basement and it took us a good 10 minutes of walking to find the front desk. I was impressed when I walked in the room and the curtains opened and the music and lights came on. It was very clean and spacious. As previous posters have already written, the room has a touchpad control for the TV, curtains, temperature, lights, alarm and music. There are 2 closets with robes, plenty of drawers to hold clothes, including a drawer in the bathroom to hold toilettries. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I never heard a sound from the other rooms except when I was in the bathroom. Except for one of us that had the connecting doors to another room, none of us heard a peep from our neighbors. The bathroom is tiled along the floor and walls, so there was an echo which is probably why I heard sounds from my neighbor only in the bathroom. The bathroom had a big shower and a huge soaking tub...very luxurious! However, there are a few bugs that the Aria needs to work out. Out of our group, I heard the following complaints from my colleagues: -2 TVs weren't working. -2 people set their alarms on the touchpad to wake up and it didn't work -About 4-5 of us couldn't get the internet to work in our rooms. Apparently not all of the cell phone towers are hooked up yet from what one of us was told by the staff. -1 person was put in a smoking room even when he requested non-smoking, and had to wait 1/2 hour on hold to be moved. Then the bell hops showed up 45 minutes early from their scheduled time to move him and he wasn't ready. -All of us experienced long hold times when calling the front desk. I gave up after 10 minutes and went to a colleague's room to use their internet. Luckily I was never charged since I was never able to hook up. -Almost all of us had trouble with our cell phone coverage in our rooms. Although it was neat having the touchpad, it didn't quite work right. I was watching TV late one night and selected \"lights off\" and the lights AND the TV shut off. Then it took a good few minutes to get the TV back on. I hit something else with the lights, and the curtains opened up! This happened a few times when turning off the lights. I learned to just go through every light on the menu and turn them off one by one. The Aria is a bit away from the strip, but there is a back way that you can take a skywalk over to the Bellagio. You will still have to walk through the Bellagio to get through the strip, but the Bellagio is beautiful, so I didn't mind. However, for those that want to be right in the action, this might be a little bit of an issue. The rooms were very spacious and quiet with extremely comfortable beds. I believe the hotel \"officially\" opens next week with higher rates. Although the little issues weren't a big deal during my stay, if I was paying the prices they will soon be commanding, I wouldn't be a very happy guest.

Every bit of 4.5 stars. I actually really enjoyed my three night stay. It is dark, as other have reported, but this appeals to the gambler in me. I do not feel comfortable (or even really enjoy) gambling at bright, airy places like the Wynn, Venetian, Mandalay Bay, etc. I prefer places like Mirage, Aria, and somewhat MGM. The room was fantastic. The bed was extremely comfortable and the view I had, although there was another building between the Aria and the strip, was nice as well. The furniture is very contemporary and, again, dark in the room. White comforter and light colored carpeting. A nice contrast if you that's your thing. The in-room safe was a bit hard to find... and it was eventually found after about 15 minutes of searching and re-searching. It is in the night stand drawer. The dealers in Aria were really friendly... as was the rest of the staff. I very much enjoyed playing craps there and spent about 12-15 hours playing craps all night with them. They had several $25 tables and so that was my main game for the trip. I am a dice setter and not once did the dealers talk to me about setting the dice and were really chatty in between rolls (I tip a lot as well). The pit as well as the dealers were extremely outgoing for me. The poker room has a lot of locals and very good players. It is nice and the seats are very comfortable. I noted that there were no drink holders on the tables nor did they have a drink rail for your drinks. The drinks simply go right on the table on a bev-nap. Don't sit at a game unless you're comfortable with making moves on players and having them make moves back at you. I had a spa service at the Aria with Ramese (spelling may be wrong). She gave a wonderful deep-tissue, classic massage in very comfortable surroundings. She came over from the Bellagio where she had worked since it opened. The facilities are very nice and the coed, outdoor area features a wading pool that overlooks the adult pool area. An interesting sight to behold at 4pm. There is limited seating outside on the deck and if you dare to go out, make sure you take a bathing suit with you and be prepared to either sit in the wading pool or to layout on the stone walk. I prefer Canyon Ranch's aquavana to the amenities at the Aria spa, but the massage was every bit as good as those at CR. I would recommend. The downside to the property is what is lacking at most higher-end strip properties... a quick stop food court (the Venetian has mastered the art of offering great food options for anything from quick and on the go to a five star sit down dinner). There is an overrun coffee shop in the morning... But that seemed to be it and I avoided food at the Aria for this reason alone. Most of the dining seems to be out of the way of the gambling and I only found my options when I intentionally went looking for them. Another downside to this property is the distance that it is setback off the strip. There's really no upside to it. It's about a 30 minute walk to Paris (roughly) due to the winding manner in which you have to walk. I made the walk several times over the trip and I got used to it, but I never enjoyed it. Especially after a few margaritas. For gamblers that don't plan to leave the resort, I'd say it's a pretty good destination. Especially if you can get used to the limiting food options and make the most of it. I know they have a sports book bar/pub that's probably very usable for some quick eats, but during March Madness it was hard to even get close to the place it was so overrun with people... so no good review of it. I do recommend Aria and I do plan to return and stay there.

We had the bell service gathered our luggage as soon as we arrived. Tried to call the service number as soon as we got to the room but no answer after 15 minutes. Not a big deal as we used that opportunity to explore the hotel. We came back to the room around 3 pm and called the service line and got our luggage within 10 minutes plus the bellman brought in some ice and explained to us all the function of the buttons/remote etc. Speaking of the remote, it is not that difficult to figure out if you have some tech skills. If you can't figure it out they also have manual switch overrides for all the lightings and tv (42\" 1080p LCD - with all HD channels!). Love the \"keyless\" entry! We have the mountain view which was not bad at all. I agree that the drape didn't have the total \"blackout\" effect but the bedding were awesome! One note to those who uses any electronic sleep aid (CPAP etc. - I use one) to remember to bring with you an extension cord (at least a 6') because there isn't a plugin close by the bed (it's right behind the mattress). My wife and I really liked the vanilla scent as you enter the hotel lobby area (kind of remind you that you are \"home\" after lots of walking during the day).

The \"wall of water\" outside the front entrance is a good photo op spot plus the sound is very soothing.

Rip off. -The bathroom faucets are a joke. Again, form over function. There is no way to run the water without splashing yourself and everything sitting around your sink. The rest of the bathroom is a bit strange, but functional. -There is a fitness center as part of the spa. Unlike most hotels, there is no option available to just go in and work out for free or a nominal cost.

The hotel property is absolutely massive. Despite an awe-inspiring use of glass in the construction of Aria, it is quite dark once you venture into the belly of the resort. There is no sense of any real character, but it is without doubt an architectural marvel and doesn't fail to impress as a building. For me, it is overwhelming, but I'm sure it is sheer heaven for avid gamblers. The rooms are outstanding. Very plush and well appointed. The bed and pillows are the softest, most comfortable I have EVER slept on. The room is totally \"wired\" with a state-of-the-art system that allows you to control everything from curtains and lighting to TV or check-out via a single, easy to use remote control. Waking up to my choice of curtains opening to reveal the sunrise and the gentle introduction of light from my bedside lamp is unique and thoroughly indulgent. Affordable even for the most frugal of corporate travel budgets, though I imagine the rates will change as the economy improves. If you get a chance to stay while rates are reasonable I highly recommend it. Even when the rates do increase, it's well worth experiencing. The bathrooms have all the mod-cons and are VERY lovely. The pool area is exquisite and a must-see, even if just to walk around or have a drink/meal in the fresh air. Last but by no means least, the staff at Aria are simply superb. As a woman traveling on business it's not always comfortable to have a drink alone at the bar. The bar tenders engage you in conversation to put you at ease while you sip a night cap.

My friends and I wanted a great 5 star hotel and that's what we got. I've read some reviews where ppl arrived on friday and had to wait almost on hour to check in!...I arrived on Friday as well and it took about 15-20 minutes TOTAL (we arrived just before 7pm). We booked rooms with double beds and they claimed there were no queen rooms availalbe...minor inconvenience...but with every hotel review i read (yes, including other 5 star hotels) there was always somebody who didn't get the exact room they requested...it happens to alot of ppl at every hotel on the strip. Anyway, the hotel is nice and classy...not too dark (i can definitely see everything, see where i'm going, and see my room number thank you). As for the room, it was fabulous...and NO it wasn't small for a 5 star hotel lmao. IF you're comparing the room size to Encore or Palazzo, then yes...it is smaller. But if you're comparing to Wynn or Bellagio, well..ummm...it's the same size...ppl get over it. I loved the technology in the room. I read that some ppl had trouble with this (i don't see why), but if you can read and have fingers, you can figure how to use the all-in-one remote...it's not hard ppl...and i'm not tech savvy at all. If you figure you can get up and open your own curtains w/o that darn remote, then by all means...but don't complain. If you don't like using the remote to change the tv channels, then use the other standard tv remote that's provided...but don't complain when there are other options for you to choose from. Oh yeah, the hotel is NOT too far back from the strip...where do ppl come up with these things. It took all of 3 minutes to walk from the hotel to the strip.And the walk thru the casino to the elevators...omg i can't believe ppl complained about this too!! You walk thru part of the casino to get to the elevators...this is not a new concept exclusively at the Aria lol. As for the maid service, we didn't have a problem at all. No money was stolen (even though we left the money for housekeeping we had to label it before they would take their tip). We turned on the service light and when we came back towards the evening it was clean. We didn't request service expecting it to be done within 1-2 hours. Our room was cleaned every day...not one problem. With that, the only complaint i did have with the hotel is the buffet. We went for dinner and immediately left. Yes, a waste of $90 (30/person). That food was not up to par with a 5 star hotel. I've had better food at Emerald Coast (miami) and even Golden Corral lol.

It all started when we checked in on Friday night, the wait was a horrible experience. It took at least 40 minutes to check in. Guests were requesting a manager, and it wasn't until 20 minutes later that front desk decided to call the manager. Saturday we requested house keeping service before leaving to go to lunch and when we came back the room was still a mess and the tip we left was gone! I called to complain and they apologized and said they would send someone up and tell the manager. No one came up until we called again. They finally came by when the turn down service came by. My boyfriend and I decided to leave and have a nice dinner, which was the only pleasant thing at the Aria. Of course that had to get ruined when we went gambling. One of the waitresses came around calling beverages. So I asked her for a drink. I repeated myself twice because she looked at me as if she didn't know what I was saying. I finally asked, you did say beverages right. She got an attitude and said \"didn't you just hear me say beverages?\" I was livid! And not only that my boyfriend tried to order a drink and she walked away. Sunday when we were leaving we called the bell hop desk, it took them an hour and three phone calls later for them to finally tell me that the request was never put in.

The Check in and Check out process was a nightmare and it was very difficult to find someone who had any good information or reliable knowledge of the property and what the property had to offer. I originally booked 2 rooms and requested 2 double beds for each room and upon arrival I was told that there were no rooms with double beds available in the entire hotel. After 10 minutes at the front desk the woman who helped me found a room with queen beds but told me that the other room was a king bed. I was then told that I could call up for a roll away bed. Once we got to the room, I called to request a rollaway bed and was told that it was not available. At that point, I then had to request a 3rd room for my group. I ended up booking another room which cost us money that was not originally planned for. I can\u2019t help but think that a rollaway bed was not provided so that I may book another room. Another problem that I had was whenever I called the Front Desk, Bell Desk, Concierge, Operator there was an exceptionally long wait and hold time. Once I was connected to the bell desk to have my bags sent up (after 10 minutes on hold) it took almost 30 minutes to get the bags after the person on the line said it would be 10 minutes. We went to the spa and had 12 noon massage appointments \u2013 the masseuse was 30 minutes late and the massage did not start until 12:30pm\u2026this made our time spent in the relaxation room less than relaxing.

When we got there, they said they had overbooked their hotel, and this happened to a bunch of other people who arrived at the same time. They said they would offer us two rooms with ONE king bed. We asked for a roll away, and they said they didn't have any left. What kind of brand new hotel doesn't have a sufficient amount of roll aways? Especially a vegas hotel. We said we obviously can't function with ONE BED cuz we planned to have 4 people in the room. We asked for an upgrade because it was their fault for overbooking, instead the receptionist just straight up said NO. without giving us a reason. I even told them it was my BIRTHDAY, which it really was, and she said \"I'm sorry, but no.\" It didn't help either that the receptionist was giving us attitude the whole way, even though we were calm and understanding of the situation. Their staff seemed to lack any type of professionalism or courtesy. we ended up just taking one room there, and the other people went to vdara, which from what I heard was just as bad. they gave them a \"suite\" but it was a regular sized room, which was smaller than our NORMAL Aria room, but cost 50 dollars MORE. on top of that, their front desk put them on hold for 40 minutes at 4am in the morning. what is so urgent that the front desk has to put you on hold for 40 minutes?

I was in a group of men over for a Vegas trip and we are a mix of ages and job types, yet we all pretty much agreed on everything and so I will summarise on here. First impressions are wow - we arrived by limo bus and were dropped at the door and had our luggage taken from the bus to the door. Took 20 minutes to check in and get keys to the rooms and all as booked and no surprises. This could have been better had there been a host in the foyer directing guests to a window as they became free (this is what happens in most other Strip Casino/Hotels) as opposed to take pot luck and pick a queue and hope...we got the lucky queue that was fast!!!! If the Aria reads this - take one person from the friont or back taxi areas and make them a foyer host - I guarantee your feedback will positively rocket!! Next impressions are that brown is everywhere and that the casino is the worst lit on the strip. Carper is so soft but beware electric shocks....not joking.....touch the wall before you press the lift button - best tip I can give!!! The rooms are very plush and clean and as everyone has said the mattresses - wow - best ever!! Servicing of the rooms was very late for us two days - after 5pm and we had vacated at about 9am to return at 4.30pm for a nap to find not done. Lager from the in room fridge is the same price as the bars and cheaper than ordered up room service!! Shower is great as well and we had an adjoining room and there was no noise from next door at all. Has to be a five star rated hotel that appears to have ironed out the opening glitches and if the check in was better manned and the rooms cleaned earlier - then would be a 100% review for me - as it is it gets 95% from me. Hope this helps. Some random ietms about Vegas now (some are especially for UK visitors): Eat at the Outback by the Casino Royale - you will get a superb steak at a great price. If wanting to see the Hoover Dam - visit the shop directly across the Strip opposite the end of the road to the Aria as they give the best price in town by about $10 a head (we asked on the coach and all had booked via different places). Do the Gun Shop and fire some guns! Amazing experience and also a $5 vocuher in the brochures in the back of cabs. Take some photos in the gun arcades as well - they will oblige if you ask. Go to the Old Vegas end of the Strip at Freemont Street and see the covered roof show and the open air free shows every 30 minutes at night - great to watch! Get a players card from every casino Chain you visit (MGM is most of them..) as you will get discounts on foods - especially the buffets. Cheapest price for casino used cards is $1.30 a pack plus tax ($3 for 2 packs inclusive) that we could find anywhere and is in most gift shops - some charge $2 a pack plus tax though. Sapphires was over priced and way too busy to enjoy - be warned!

Upon arrival at the hotel the shuttle bus driver informed us that we could not be dropped off at the front door as there was no room for a shuttle bus to enter. We were dropped off in a lower parking garage and told that we would have to go up a set of stairs, through the casino to the front desk.

My friend and I was stuck with dragging four bags through the casino it took us about 10 minutes to get to the front desk.

We are both in our 30's and enjoy fine dining / hanging out. We are not casino people - might play $100 max. Our favorite hotel the last few years has been THEhotel. Aria looked promising with all of its modern features so we switched this year. We booked a corner suite. This is primarily why I rated the hotel 4*. The floor plan for the corner suite shows windows in the bathroom and advertises incredible views. Our bathroom was in the interior, so no window. Also it appears that the standard corner suites all have an off-strip/parking lot type view. You need to pony up lots more $$$'s for a city view or panoramic. Never had that issue at THEhotel, a corner suite there has always come with a good view, I suspect this is location - Aria is surrounded by lots of tall buildings and I suspect very few rooms have an actual good view. I was tempted to give 5* because of service. I went to plug my iPod into the high tech system. Plugs available on the TV, but no way to access them. When I called and asked I was told there should be a connection panel, but it was removed from our room for maintenance. They instantly upgraded us to a 1 bedroom Aria Sky Suite with a working connection panel without us asking. This is a more private area of the hotel, about the same size room, but so much better. Pool view was much nicer, bathroom was amazing, space is utilized much better than the corner suite we saw. Internet access in the Sky Suites is apparently free. Incidentally for all the high tech I was unimpressed the with the connectivity. I couldn't get my laptop to talk to their HDMI port and I didn't have a VGA cable with me. I did plug in the iPod, but it only played in the one room - I would have thought everything was connected room to room. The suite did have very decent speakers below the TV, but every 30 minutes or so it would reset and forget the iPod was there. Very strange, these high tech toys seem like they weren't researched well or they went too far down to the lowest bidder. We have never had a chance to do a Vegas pool, but took the opportunity to check out the Bellagio pools while eating a Panini for lunch. Nice, but later we went to the Aria pool for an hour. The pool was definitely heated - if outside temps were 5 degrees higher I'm sure we would have tried it. Others seemed to be having fun, we used the hot tub instead. Aria's pools are large and look like they will be a good time in the busier season. Again on the tech, I think their IT systems aren't all there. We were told we'd get a $75 credit on check in (discount code), this didn't show on our bill. This easily could have been because our room was switched. I didn't complain because we made several drink / water purchases that didn't show up on the bill either, but unfortunately our large salon bill did show up :-(. I think we broke even and I wasn't going to complain about $75 anyway after the great upgrade. In the future we will choose either Aria or THEhotel based purely on price, but the price comparison will be a standard THEhotel V Suite versus an upgraded Aria Corner Suite.

Day one started with finding a pair of mens underwear in our bed.YUCK! The linens had not been changed from the prior guest. A closer inspection of the sheets revealed makeup ,and I won't go into anymore detail there. Upon reporting this to the houskeeping staff and requesting a new set of linens, we were told that a manager would be right up to speak with us. That never happened. I left a note stating my displeasure. Upon returning about five hours later, we found that while the bed was made, the same linens were still there! The floor had not been vacuumed, and there was dust and hair on the bathroom floor. Now I'm not talking about a white glove treatment here, this was just unacceptable cleaning. Another call to the front desk this time resulted in a $100.00 credit to be used in their restaurants, an apology, and a supervisor to our room. While a very nice gesture, considering that my total bill at the Aria last week exceeded 1,500.00 for just the room, they probably should have done better. I let it go and appreciated that fact that room was spotless when we returned. Some other items, the urban technology in the room with the HVAC, lighting, and curtains controlled via your TV remote or the bedside touchscreen needs some fine tuning. Technology is great when it works...and a real pain when it doesn't. The bathroom sinks have a tendency to splash water regardless of the volume, so don't brush your teeth after you're dressed or you get soaked. And if you're looking for the nice room darkening curtains that you may have had next door at the Bellagio, you will be dissapointed. With three months under their belt since opening, we expected that the bugs would be worked out and the staff would have been weeded out to retain only the best. While we received some great service at the View Bar located off the main lobby, most of the servers and staff in the other bars and restaurants could do with some basic customer satisfaction courses.

Visually this hotel is impressive however it does feel like your pulling up to an airport. checking in is a nightmare. There is no velvet rope to assure an organized line with people just scrambling to find a shorter line. The front desk is quite unimpressive with an odd sculpture THE WATERFALL outside of the valet is beautiful and should have also been behind the front desk instead there are office windows with an ugly view of nothing behind them. NOW the smell on the casino stinks of sewage masked by an awful vanilla smell they have pumping through the entire casino and lobby. The SMELL outside the valet was so AWFUL on wed, evening March 8th we couldn't even wait outside. TRULY DISGUSTING. We smelled it faintly the rest of our stay.JUST GROSS. The casino is quite dark which did not bother me so much as the stupid layout which is a series of pockets of machines. PENNY MACHINE after PENNY MACHINE after penny. I think i saw only ten 3 coin quarter machines in the entire place. The walk to the valet when checking out is absurd. SO be prepared to LUG YOUR LUGGAGE all the way to the back of the casino far away from the front desk. THE BEST PART OF THE HOTEL IS THE BEDS. Absolutely hands down the most comfortable beds and pillows ever AND THE HIGH TECH FEATURES IN THE ROOM WERE GREAT. The bathroom was beautiful but the water pressure is AWFUL with a stupid shower head that trickles out combined with a gorgeous tub with no jacuzzi jets in it. (what a waste). Such a high tech room but be prepared to search for a power outlet to charge your cell phone there none by the bedstand and it was hidden behind the kleenex box in the bathroom and one by the front door. It was kinda ridiculous. Overall i would not stay here again the smell of the casino was nauseating and just too cold and sterile for my taste.

Room: Average size, but cozy. Enjoyed the tech side of it. And there are about 6 plugs, not sure what reviewers are talking about there not being any plugs.

Quite frankly I almost changed my reservation multiple times but ultimately decided to give the property the benefit of the doubt. We stayed in the city view 2 bedroom penthouse suite and here is my take, for what it is worth... Te Property - The City Center / Aria facilities are both enormous and impressive. You can spend quite a bit of time just wandering around the facility and taking in the architecture and art work. However, the layout is such that it takes some effort to figure out how to get off the property and to anywhere else. A casino is a casino so I won't say much about it other than it is quite dark. The Service - Everyone we interacted with was both friendly and helpful. The limo drivers, attendants, sky suite personnel, housekeeping and security were all great. We had zero problem with check in and our room was ready when we arrived at about 2pm on a Thursday. The Room - We were underwhelmed with the room. While the decor was both modern and tasteful the suite seemed smaller than the 2000 square feet advertised. This could however just be how it was laid out as it wasn't really an open floor plan. The automated controls were interesting and worked just fine in all the rooms. The TV in one of our bedrooms and the bathroom did not work and our bathtub also had some challenges. In addition, the carpenters missed some spots while painting the walls. These are little things but things you would not find in true 5 star hotels. The bed is as magnificent as others have said, you will want to take one home with you. The Restaurants - I can only comment on 2 of the restaurants - Sirio and the Buffet. My wife and I had dinner at Sirio and it was excellent. The service was attentive but not annoying and the food was superb. We shared the Gnocchi, she had the lamb and I had the Osso Bucco and they were all worth getting again. We only ate breakfast at the buffet and it is marginal. However, the morning buffet people watching is entertaining! If Aria is trying to position itself as a 5 star hotel, in my mind right now, it fails to do so.

I went down to ask about moving to a room with two bedrooms (we booked a one bedroom) and were told it would be an additional $400 per night, even though it wasn't that much of a difference online. We declined, however they did send up a rollaway bed. My brother is 6'5\", so the rollaway was a little small for him, but he made do.

The hall smelled smokey, but not the room, so we didn't move the next 2 nights. The restaurant help was not good at all...they need to work on that! And the food took FOREVER to arrive. We had a late night meal and then made the mistake of going back for breakfast, and the same thing! VERY expensive meals and our friends had wine to the tune of $20.00 per glass! My family was staying at the Monte Carlo, so we walked over there and had a GREAT breakfast twice at the Cafe for about half the price! The security was very good, my husband ran back to the room while the cleaning person was there, and they made sure it was his room with the key. They also won't let you upstairs or into the pool area without a key which is nice. The spa and ammenities are amazing. We paid $30 to work-out, but that included use of the spa and it had ALOT to offer. We spent 4 hours in there and enjoyed it very much. The pool is the spa area is wonderful! All in all, like any new place, they have some issues to work out, but the rooms are great and they are so willing to upgrade and compensate to make people happy.

Our room was nice but not fabulous. My guess is that the dark browns that dominate the decor will get dated very quickly. We found that Aria had a number of customer service issues. Our room didn\u2019t have a TV remote control. The staff took a very long to deliver the remote and more than one call from us. Unraveling a problem getting my husband authorization to charge to the room took longer than needed. From the Aria staff, we received three different, conflicting, and erroneous directions to the Dollar-Rent-A-Car booth in the hotel. When we arrived in the room, two of the lights had burnt-out bulbs. Probalby the worst problem was the delay in housekeeping services. On one day, our room hadn\u2019t received housekeeping service as of 5:30pm. We called to request it for our room. At about 7:30pm that night, as we walked down the hall, we noticed that most of rooms\u2019 light called for service. It was our impression that these rooms had the received housekeeping service yet. The electronic pad that controls the lights, TV, blinds, is cool but it's very bright and makes it hard to sleep. While most of the operations on the pad worked, some functions didn\u2019t (or maybe it was operator error on our part but we don't think so...)

Since I have never done a review I figured this was a good one to start with. My wife and I live in Southern California and frequent Vegas about 9 - 12 times a year. I am in my early 30's and my wife in her late 20's. We are standard middle to upper income people. We come to Vegas to drink, play slots, enjoy a good meal, and occasionally go to a club, and go to the pools in the summer, and often times we bring friends. We are not high rollers by any means, but have not paid for a hotel room in over 4 years in Vegas and often our free rooms include free money for gambling and food credits - GET PLAYERS CARDS AT EVERY CASINO YOU VISIT - IT PAYS OFF!!! Anyway, if you are this type of person, here is my review. First things first, if you are driving in, the only way to get to the valet is off of the strip, and don't make the mistake of trying to come in from behind off of Frank Sinatra Drive, there isn't an entrance...oh and don't make the mistake of entering off of Harmon from the strip, that takes you to the ULTRA CONFUSING back valet, a mile form the real entrance. So expect delays on the strip just getting to Valet. Aria is massive and is way back off the strip. Check in - we came in at midnight on a Friday - no rhyme or reason to the lines, kind of find your way to the front and hopefully you'll get lucky in a fast line. Front desk was cool enough and helped us promptly. Then he directed us to the elevators - if you ever got the idea they try and get you into the casino, you literally have to take your bags (if you don't use the bellman) and walk everything through the middle of the casino which was kind of weird, and unlike every other casino. By the way, we don't use a bellman as anyone who goes to vegas knows it can be forever to get your bags. Room: we had the standard room. very nice. bathroom had a separate toilet, a tub and a shower that were in the same enclosure but separate from each other...the only downside was a small sink area, it is dual sinks, but not much room to put anything. Opposite the shower was two full closets and 5 large drawers with a counter above them...ample room for clothes for a 3 day stay. nice bedding, the HD TV had many many channels and the HD actually is in HD...unlike other hotel (ahhem Hard Rock, Mandalay Bay that have HD TVs but no HD)...the cool part of the room is that everything is controlled by a touch screen remote next to the bed, our worked fine all weekend and was convenient to use while lying in bed to open and close drapes, turn lights on and off, operate the TV and the Thermostat. Casino: Modern Chic is how I would describe it - but no real theme or soul that I could figure out...forget about \"loose slots\" and \"luck at the table\" - every casino has the same slots and table games, and any seasoned vegas person know it is all luck. the bars were cool we got a drink at a few, and all of them offered some sort of vantage point to overlook the casino action. We enjoyed ourselves, cocktail waitresses were quick, but overall it didn't do much for us. We kind of like the vibe at a Mandalay Bay of Hard Rock or New York New York better - I can't describe the difference other than to say there is a better theme and atmosphere at those casinos. Buffett - we thought it was awesome, very nice place, food was extremely fresh, even the sushi was top notch, they also had king crab legs which I asked the lady to steam for me and she did! The waitress there could not have been any faster to fill our drinks and remove old plates...it was a little pricey though at 27.95 on Sunday night Misc - there is a tram to Bellagio that takes a bit of a hike to get to. Long waits at the valet line on Saturday mid day and Monday morning when we left - the valet guys have to run a mile to get to cars and it seems they are way understaffed for this. Don't really consider walking to another hotel in nice clothes, it is a hike, but just take a cab, no big deal. One funny thing, we came back to our hotel room saturday night and there was a foldout cot in our room - now obviously this would concern some people, but we are pretty easy going and they apologized and had somebody there to remove it in a few minutes. Over all, it was a very nice place, the casino seemed a little small and had no real theme that we could put our hands on. Crowd seemed to be our age and fairly high end fashionistas. The place is huge and you can't quickly get anywhere fast...as a frame of reference, to walk to the nearest casino across the street (Planet Hollywood) took about 20 minutes. If we get free rooms again we would probably go back, but we would go to Mandalay Bay or Hard Rock if given the choice. Random comment about the trip - we ended up a Paris one night, and there is a new Amazing Race slot machine that was a ton of fun.

I will start with the staff because they were exceptional. Everytime we passed a staff member in the hallway they were VERY warm and friendly. It actually surprised me at first because most other hotel staff will smile or say hello but don't actually go out of their way to be this friendly. Just wanted to point this out because it really stood out for us and was one of those \"little things\" that really made a difference in our overall impression of this place. Also the buffet staff (not so much the cashier though) were so friendly and helpful. Always on top of clearing the plates, refilling our coffee or getting us more juice. It was the kind of service you always hope for but don't always get. By the way, the breakfast buffet was fantastic! Prices were about the same that you'd find at any other nice hotel in Vegas. And for the good quality of food that there was, we certainly didn't feel it was too high. As for the room. I loved it. We had a great view of the strip. The light/blinds controller is really not hard to use. Not sure what others are complaining about. Seriously it's very user friendly. I am by no means a technology geek and I figured it out in less than 30seconds. My 13 year old figured it out in even less time than that. :) Personally I had no issue with the shower/bath area combo. The tub was large and the shower pressure was good. Sure it's a different idea but not at all a bad one. The sliding door to the restroom is heavy and I can imagine someone getting their fingers caught in there. Ouch! Might need a rubber bumper to prevent that from happening. Almost happened to me so I wanted to mention that in case management reads this. The beds were large and comfy! The \"wake up\" setting on the controller was great as was the \"goodnight\" setting. Also, the room was peaceful and quiet at night. Not sure what the other person meant about \"wind\" noise because we didn't hear any at all.

Amazing that it sits right on the Las Vegas Strip. If you enjoy a walk, be prepared with comfortable walking shoes. The place was built to keep you from straying. It is not tourist friendly. It is more of a piece of structural art than anything practical. The rooms are small. Other than the bed, which is wonderful, be prepared to learn all the technolgical aspects of the so-called \"room of the future.\" The bedside touch screen control system might fascinate you for a moment until you realize it regulates almost everything. Lighting, TV, drapes, housekeeping, etc. The bathroom is also small, but interesting. The tub/shower combination is exactly that. A large shower that opens to an oval soaking tub. You can litterally sit on the side of the filled tub allowing the shower spray to hit your back; nice touch. But, most of us spend a minimum bathing. The double sinks are so close together - it would have been easier to put a large single sink - more practical. The water closet is walled off with frosted glass and door, and has a telephone next to the throne. In fact, three phones adorn the room. The 42\" HDTV is great. Above the 20th floor is where you'll get any views. The floor to ceiling windows allow ample sunlight as most of the hotel faces east or west. The worst part of the \"room experience\" and the major reason I'd never return: the furniture (other than the bed) is so very uncomfortable. No sofa or love seat. Armless, cushioned benches is the easiest explanation. And, is standard in all rooms other than the suites per the housekeeping operator. Kudo's to the quick elevator service. I never waited longer than a minute. The casino is very, very dark and unwelcoming. It snakes around inside the curving structure and I literally got lost. The table minimums start at $25, although the penny slots are abundant. The main hotel restaurant is Cafe Vettro. Customer service excellent. Limited menu is extremely overpriced. Hamburger $18, coffee $5, etc. Okay, okay... the Aria is not Motel 6. Customer service is good, far from excellent, however. The regular rates are in the $200 per night range.

We hesitantly decided to stick to our plan since we had gotten a really good rate. All that I can say is that our experience was wonderful and largely met or exceeded our expectations. First off, the decor of the hotel is very contemporary. If you do not like that sort of thing you will probably be disappointed with this hotel. I'm surprised to see so many people comparing the Aria to the Bellagio and other \"classic\" looking hotels on the strip. The Aria really is unique and has a style all its own. It was refreshing to us it that it is not a theme hotel trying to emulate another style from somewhere else in the world. We were granted an early check in and they took the time to help us find a room high in the building with a view that we were happy with. In all of my travels I have found it to be very rare that they actually give you a choice of rooms/views while checking in. We did not experience any chaos at the front desk as described by others. Our room was incredible and we loved the automation. By far the biggest highlight was the incredible bed that, after returning home, inspired us to begin shopping around to try and find something comparable for home. Our dinner at Sage was a highlight of our trip. Most notable was the Absinthe after dinner. They bring out a cart of multiple types of Absinthe and then go into great detail about the history and various ways you can prepare it. Heads were turning as they poured flaming absinthe into my glass in the finale of what was a wonderful presentation. I will agree that the staff is a bit \"green\". They do not carry themselves with the sophistication and professionalism I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. Although the service really was never bad, many just seemed awkward, lacking confidence, and overwhelmed. During check in while discussing the details about Sage the desk person began talking in vast detail about where to get a good hamburger. Although not really \"bad service\" it just seemed a bit odd. We did have one glitch with the automation in our room however we called the desk and it was all resolved upon returning after lunch. Overall, if you love classic elegance like at the Bellagio than this may not be the perfect hotel for you.

We checked in late because of our flight, no line but the lady that I dealt with was very rude and inconsiderate, we of course, asked for an upgrade and she wanted a ridiculous charge to move up to the 12th floor. We went to our room on the 3rd. floor and it over looked the roof and all the plumbing on it. Went back down to check in, spoke to another lady , very nice and helpful, she gave us a room on the 51st. floor - 4 rooms from elevator, no problems. Not sure if it's the check in process or the people working. Rooms are as every other review, great. House keeping even stopped by our room 20 min. after we got in and asked if all was o.k.

The pool area is very nice with 3 pools, spas, cabanas, and lots of mature trees and vegetation, only one of the pools is currently open and it is heated. Security were strict at all times about showing a room key before allowing you get to the elevators. Elevators are dedicated for 8/9 floors with 8 elevators for each section, which means you never wait any longer than a few seconds for one. The Viva Elvis show was good, but on the night I went was only half full so the balcony section was closed and people were put up front instead. It's more of a singing & dancing type of show compared to the normal Cirque acrobatic spectaculars we are used to, but there are some acrobatics involved, and the way they've integrated Elvis singing into the show with the band and performers is truly wonderful, and technically brilliant.

The front desk staff is young and unseasoned. It is a very long walk from a set back hotel to the strip. The buffet is incredibly over valued ($34.99) and pales in comparison to the Bellagio or Borgata (if you have been there). Room elements including drapes, tv, temperature etc. are controlled by a tethered small lcd touch-screen panel box that is about the size of an old dial telephone console. This universal control unit is confusing to use and is a waste of time to have to figure out when you are on vacation. I still do not know how I feel about the bath tub being located inside of a walk in shower essentially creating a giant wet chamber. BTW, if you like to sing in the shower, you will never sound better! I guarantee that. All of that being said there was much good. The nite-life crowd is very young (18-22) and noisy. The rooms were elegant with giant flat screens TV's and cabinetry. Some room walls are painted brown and some are painted tan. Ask for the tan. It feels much more open and light.

Nowhere near as hard to control as other people on here have stated, you push the button for what you want to control, press the back button to go back. The only disappointing thing about the room control was that it wasn't on 'my side' of the bed, but I got over that minor detail because I am an adult and can cope with such small things. :) We absolutely loved the matress, like sleeping on a cloud sounds cliche, until you have slept on this bed. I have never slept that well on vacation, anywhere. The only thing that kept it from a 100% positive review was the shower head wasn't all that great for pressure. Aside from that, I couldn't think of anything that I had a problem with.

Our first experience was the less than stellar greeting we received when we accidently came to the sky suites entrance instead of the strip entrance.

After he was done with the driver, it was our turn. He told us we were at the wrong entrance. I tried to explain that someone from Aria had told us to come in this entrance. The bellman (while my husband was pulling our luggage from the trunk of the car) told me that whomever told me that was wrong and a liar. He then pointed in the direction of the lobby and told us we had to go over there. No hello, welcome to aria, can I assist you, nothing. Upon check in, we received a room that was at least one quarter of a mile from the elevator. We dragged our luggage to our room and went down to the casino to play. The next morning, we left the room at 7:30 in the morning. When we got back at 5:00, the room had not been touched by housekeeping. The roomcleaner in the hall explained that she couldn't clean our room because she worked until five pm and would get in trouble if she stayed overtime. I called housekeeping and was told by the employee who answered the phone that they had a lot of rooms and if one room is dirty other rooms wouldn't get cleaned!? We did call Karen Ulna (Director of Guest Services) to ask her about the level of service we should expect at Aria. She was very apologetic and did give us a Food and Beverage Credit to make up for the lack of customer service we had been shown. My impression was that every disgruntiled union employee from other hotels in Vegas had come to work at Aria. Skip the buffet - food was so - so and had a very 70's cafeteria feel to it. We ended up calling the entire place Spacely Sprockets - very modern, didn't really care for that style of decor.

I still had to go up to the TV and work it manually from controls on the TV because they audio video system did not work.

Although all other pools in the city were open, the Aria staff gave me a \"BS\" story why their's wasn't--very bad idea. There were days where housekeeping did not even clean entire parts of the suite---unbelievable. I stayed in and $800 per night suite which was very small---about 60% the size of a comparably priced suite at the Wynn or Bellagio. The decor was very \"hard edged, cold and sterile\". The furniture was literally hard---as in rock hard. The arms of the couch in the living room were made of a material that was as hard as a desk top---you could not rest your arm on it without your arm hurting. The lighting in the bathroom was so bad I could not even shave well, there would be no way a lady could do make up etc. I talked to over 50 other guests who had the same impression I did---they hated the place and will never go back.

No luck and the woman kept my $20! Oh well, worth a shot. We has a standard king on the 36th floor. I really liked that the door unlocks by just placing your key near the sensor. I left my card in my wallet and it still worked. When you open the door, the curtains open and lights come on. It takes a couple minutes to figure out all the cool technology. You can control the lights, temperature, curtains and just about everything else right on the TV remote. The decor is very modern. Lots of clean lines and dark browns and blues. The TV hangs on the wall and is quite large.. maybe 42\". The bed was amazing!! Very soft, very luxurious. There is a safe inside one of the nightstand drawers to keep cash and valuables. The chiller is very well stocked. No room for anything you might want to add in there. We called down to ask about bringing up a mini-fridge for us to use and they said it would be $25/day! No thanks. The bathroom was very nice, large walk in shower with adjustable spray. Only complaint here is that the vanity has only one sink and not much room on the granite for other items. The casino again is very modern. It's much darker than most casinos. Makes everything seem more serious. We did have a nice time playing craps, roulette and blackjack. The dealers were very professional and friendly. I spent quite a bit of time in the poker room. It is awesome. Very comfy adjustable seats, great dealers, fast drinks and good atmosphere. We ate at Jean Phillipe, Lemongrass, and Sirio. Food was great at all of them. We enjoyed the atmosphere and decor of Lemongrass the most. There is a tram that runs from Monte Carlo to Bellagio. There is a stop in the middle at Crystals. It's faster to walk from your room to the Monte Carlo tram than if you want to go to Bellagio. It's just right out the door by the poker room. The location of Aria is too far to make use of the Monorail, so if you want to visit The Venetian or Wynn, do yourself a favor and take a cab. My wife gives the spa high marks for her facial. We didn't get to spend much time in Crystals, but it is beautiful. The shopping is super high end.. not much in our price range. We prefer going to The Forum at Ceasars for shopping.

It's a magnificent hotel with fairly luxurious rooms. The service was great and the staff was very courteous. I see what people mean when they say it doesn't feel Vegas-y - it's contemporary and not themed at all. However, I think it's still very Vegas-y in its excesses, which is what I enjoy about Vegas. It certainly did feel a little bit like they cut some corners in making the place. The walls were a bit thin - I could hear conversations next door if they stood close to the shared wall and if they were talking loudly. The water tap for the left sink in the bathroom was also off-center slightly, which caused the water to splash out - we opted to share the right-side sink. The in-room technology was also rather buggy. We were all guys and gals in our 20s who use technology quite a bit in our daily lives (we had a computer science major with us, even), but the panel was a pain to use. The main problem was that the system is underpowered - there's a noticeable lag after each command, and if you make multiple inputs while it's processing your last command, the lags stack up. Very annoying. The good news is that it's easy enough to not use the touch panel and use the regular remote instead. Those complaints aside, the room was fantastic. The room decorations were very contemporary, which I liked, and there was plenty of space at 520 sq ft. The bathroom was awesome - I've stayed at a few other properties on the strip, including the Venetian and Palazzo, and I think the Aria bathroom was the best I've seen (other than the off-center water tap I mentioned above). It's smaller than the Venetian/Palazzo bathroom and doesn't have an in-bathroom TV, but the tub/shower was amazing. Again, to compare with the Venetian/Palazzo, the room was obviously smaller, but otherwise I actually liked it a lot better - the bed was nicer, the decoration was much smarter. I also liked the twice-a-day housekeeping service - it was nice to be able to go out for the morning/afternoon, come back to a fresh room, then go out again for the evening and return to a fresh room again. The casino was a little darker than some of the other casinos but not very much so. I think this is a matter of aesthetics - if you like the ultramodern contemporary look and feel of the place, I think you will enjoy the casino's ambiance as well. I did not gamble much at the Aria because it was a little pricey for my group. One thing I'll note as well is that a few of their slots changed games/$ through our stay - I noticed a Crystal Forest penny slot in one area one night, but when we came back it was different game. I'm hoping they're just trying to work out the layout of the slots, because it'd be pretty annoying if they are going to be constantly changing games. There is a noticeable smell in the casino, but it was fairly pleasant and low key, unlike the Venetian where I felt like I was being drowned in flowers. I really enjoyed the mid-strip location of the Aria. This part is fairly self explanatory and I don't need to tell you Vegas vets why the location is great, but I'd note that the tram that goes from Monte Carlo through Aria to Bellagio was actually very useful - we used it every day, both when we went north and when we went south. Overall, Aria is one of my new favorite properties on the strip. I love how it looks, I love the rooms, and I love the location. In terms of ranking, I am having a hard time deciding whether I like it better or worse than Palazzo - I really like the aesthetic of Aria and the location, but Palazzo has the edge on the rooms and the gambling (well, not at the Palazzo, but at the Venetian).

No major problems encountered. Check in and Check out was painless, but this could have been our timing. The hotel is very nice, clean, and enormous. Lots of browns and earth tones. The technology in the room was simple to use, though we did unintentionally turn off everything in the room several times by hitting the wrong button and the desk lamp had a blown bulb which we reported but was never changed. There is a north entrance off of Harmon that is good for going and coming as the cab stand is right outside the door. Whereas at the front entrance the cab stand is a short walk away. There is no check in/out counter at the north entrance so use the front when initially arriving. Electric doors at both entrances, but require that you hit a button for the door to open. We ate at Sage (nominated for a Beard award), Bar Masa (Japanese Cuisine), Chill (Ice cream, sandwiches, and coffee), and Jean Philippe patisserie (deserts, sandwiches, salads, coffee) and another smaller coffee shop over by the tram called the coffee bean or grind something like that (deserts, sandwiches, coffee). Great food and service at all places mentioned. On the first day we tried the buffet and though the selection was modest the food just didn't taste very well, except the deserts, but excellent service by our waiter. We did room service each morning for breakfast and were pleased with both the food and service. You must try Sage and Bar Masa for dinner, well worth the money. Would avoid buffet however. One of the swimming pools and 3 hot tub pools opened while we were there (Sat). They are very nice and heated to ensure comfort. Laid about there for several hours with temps in the 60's quite comfortably. Nice cabanas too. Our room was on the 19th floor, south west side facing Mandalay Bay and the mountains and we had no problems using our Verizon cell phones (Driods) or the 3G laptop connect card. Therefore we did not use the hotel internet service. As previously noted by others the floor to ceiling windows were really dirty on the outside, but that didn't detract much from the awesome views. The Crystal City Mall was nice but we didn't buy anything there. There are some nice shops in the Aria itself. There is a really nice store/gift shop at the north entrance that has about anything you could need along with souvenirs etc. There is a CVS just a short 5 min walk up the street as well. They don't have many towels in the room (2 sets) and if you put on the privacy light at night, and skip turn down service, this can be a pain. The staff and dealers were very friendly. We put a hurting on them at the craps and blackjack tables and made enough back to all but cover the cost of the trip. Played slots and video poker a few times but didn't win anything with those. Nice sports book and poker room also. We used the tram to go over to the Bellagio to see the fountains. We took a cab to the Venetian to see the Blue Man Group where I had booked tickets from Vegas.com and we had great center stage seats. I recommend the show if you never seen it--It is really cool. We passed on the Elvis show at the Aria so I can't comment on that. Go and stay at the Aria, you will have a fine time. Everything cost big so take lots of money, your gonna need it, unless of course lady luck smiles on you.

The shower and tub are in one \"room\" with a glass door, and the toilet in a separate room with a frosted glass door, there are two sinks but hardly any room on the counter.

Everything went wrong straight away; from the limo service to the hotel to the check in experience. The suite was nothing spectacular...but that's not really the point of my review. More importantly, it's that I was actually yelled at by one of their staff members. This was while I was searching for the ladies room, and didn't understand exactly where it was...it was confusing due to the fact that it's joined all within the same entry as the men's room and the companion restroom. I have multiple sclerosis, which is a disease of the central nervous system; this can cause me to have great confusion at times. Which lead to the employee of this hotel to YELL REPEATABLY at me, and to even go so far as to point me out to OTHER GUESTS, and make a very snide comment about me. My husband immediately went to speak with the hotel management about this employee, and they were allegedly \"flabbergasted\" at the employee's behavior. But then the management never bothered to do much more than to apologize to my husband for me. They never made a point to walk over to me to apologize to me personally. Furthermore, there is absolutely nowhere to sit in the casino, unless you spend money in a restaurant or at a slot machine. Doing these things is fine...but what about when you just want to take a break, and want to sit and relax without spending money for a few moments??? Sure, there is some granite benches (very few) located in the main lobby. But that's it. If you have a disability such as I do, you are just out of luck. It's a complete seperation of healthy people and people with disabilities. After thinking the experience over, my husband and I are strongly looking into a lawsuit against this hotel. We feel that no one should ever be yelled at by a hotel employee...especially not us, considering we have spent between Bellagio and Aria dollars well into the 6 figure range.

I pestered the heck out of Walter in the Concierge desk. He started about a month before ARIA opened and was very helpful about handicap facilities and all the room amenities. We arrived on Saturday afternoon, at the invited guest\u2019s desk and were given the handicap room I had asked for. However, when we Got to the room we discovered that it did not have a sunken tub, so we called down and asked to be moved to a regular deluxe king room. This only took 10 minutes and we were settled in. The room is much larger than a standard hotel room, room to walk around, look out the floor to ceiling windows and everything is electronic. The flat screen HD TV was great, and everything was accessible from it. The lighting, the drapes, the guest services to check your bill, a station with a TV guide type of style, movies galore, wake up, radio, you name it. For someone in her 60\u2019s it took me a few hours to become comfortable with it, but after that it was a snap. There is a refrig, stocked to the hilt, don\u2019t touch or you bought it. In the hallway, there are double closets and the softest robes you will ever put on. The bathroom has double sinks and plenty of space for your \u201cstuff\u201d The toilet is in a separate room, with glass you can not see thru. The shower is huge with a large seat in the back of it. After the shower, you can step into the sunken tub and soak your tension away. It was lovely. The towels are extremely large and very, very soft. There is a hair dryer already plugged in on one of the shelves of the vanity. All the products are just great, even their soap with logo is in a shape that fits your hand perfectly. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, mouth wash were all supplied, along with a lovely kit in the middle drawer, with cue tips, cotton balls, sewing kit, shower cap, etc. Now I did read in advance that there were no outlets near the beds as everything is electronic. So I left my C-Pap machine at home, there is a very large clock on the night stand, as well as phone and also a phone in the toilet area. There were 2 chairs to watch TV with a small table in between them and also a desk and chair under the TV. We soon ventured down to the casino floor, very airy, NO smoke smell; Walter told me that there are sensors to absorb the smoke under the slot machines. I never had a problem breathing, and I usually do. There are thousands of machines, mostly the newer style, I wished for more triple reel slots, but I hear they are coming. There is a new 4 screen Sex in the City, a penny machine and for $2.00 you can play all 4 reels at one time and we did quite well with that machine. Because we play a lot of MGM places, we took the brand new monorail over to the Bellagio and had a great time. The year of the Dragon is set up in the Conservatory and very well done. Tram was fast, easy to find, and if you can\u2019t there is always someone around that will kindly escort you directly to it. We ate the wonderful Steak House and had great steaks with fresh cut fries and Brussels sprouts that were saut\u00e9ed in a pan. They were wonderful. They have 4 kinds of sauces for your steak, but I asked the waiter for some garlic butter and had it within 4 minutes. Also, a place you should not miss eating is at the sports bar. The best sweet potatoes fries I have ever tasted. We also ordered hand cut fries topped with garlic and Parmesan cheese. The sliders were first rate. ARIA is a first class hotel with every amenity you could ask for and more. I Highly recommend that you check this hotel out on your next stay in Las Vegas.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201chas so much potential by its looks\u201d", "Author": "NYSinger1", "ReviewID": "UR56422268", "Content": "I travel to Las Vegas a few times a year.

Upon arrival, only one clerk working check-in on Friday of Valentine's weekend (lengthened by President's Day on Monday). Once about 20 people were in the queue, they added a couple more clerks, but then committed the cardinal sin: individual lines heading to separate clerks. Better to have one feeder line so you don't get stuck in the slow line. This is basic people-herding, and I'm surprised they didn't implement it. Check-in was an exercise in putting off their upsell, which I did not appreciate. Clerk did not have our reservation information, even though I'd made the reservation online two weeks prior. Stopped at concierge desk and would have been better off making our own reservations: system was painfully slow and the clerk couldn't find the boxing event we'd asked about even though we later (and instantly) found it in their weekly events brochure. Room was very nice: technology all over, dark and quiet, and the bed was dangerously comfortable. Very clean and we had excellent room service. I too was charged $20 for tech service from the mini-bar even though I hadn't used anything. Bathroom is spacious and clean, but the lack of electric outlets is a problem. The hotel itself shows well, but 5-stars are usually brimming with world-class artwork. Maybe I missed it. Food overall was surprisingly lacking, with one excellent exception. Serio Restaurant is overpriced and under-everything else. Gordon Ramsay would go hoarse in that kitchen. Calamari was greasy and chewy and when I pointed it out, all I got was a \"thanks for the feedback, but we're still working on our menu.\" Hello? How about, \"sorry, sir, I'll take that off your bill and dessert is on the house.\" Standard reply at any better restaurant. I didn't pay to provide them feedback on a bad meal. Ravioli trio equally bad, and salads left much to be desired. As bad as Serio was, we found Sage outstanding in almost every way. Food was outrageous! Foie Gras brulee is not to be missed and was well worth the $10 surcharge. Wagyu beef was divine, as were the diver scallops and crab. Service was prompt, friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Only hiccup the entire evening was the late arrival of the bread, which bumped into the first course. But we had moved tables, so I guess it's forgiveable. We had an excellent time in the casino and found most of the dealers engaging and friendly, with a couple notable exceptions (we didn't stay long with the grouches). We tip really well, so that may explain why we made money AND got good service. Drinks were top shelf (Glenlivet, Hennessey, etc), arrived fast, and poured generously. The ventilation system is definitely underpowered, though, and the temperature was generally a tad too warm. Check-out was smooth, but Aria should add a complementary shuttle bus to the airport and move the taxi pick-up location closer to the main lobby. I've stayed at other 5-star hotels and the Aria is not in the same league. I'd give it 3 1/2, maybe 4 stars, but there's much to be worked out.

It was hard to figure out how to get around but that applies to almost all the Las vegas casinos. The casino was not dark but almost soothing.

It was very comfortable and fun as the servers were always there asking if we wanted a drink. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Check-in was fast enough even though we had to wait quite a while for our room to be assigned. The room was great, and had plenty of room. The computerized board that ran all the items in the room was fun to play with and nice to have right beside our bed. The shower was great and roomy with an effective showerhead. The bed was sooo comfortable but I could see how some people would get a sore back from how soft it is. The Aria is a little far from the Strip but Las Vegas is about walking.

We checked in on a Saturday at around 4pm and it went pretty quick for us (2 groups in front of us and maybe 10-15 minutes later we were in our room). We asked for a king room a few doors away from the elevator based on previous reviews about the long walk to rooms on the end. They accomodated and even gave us a strip view room on the 9th floor. Would have liked to been up higher but the room had a great view anyways. I really liked the style of the hotel and all the brown didn't bother me...actually I think some of it is purple but it looks brown becuase it is kinda dark. Security at elevators didn't bother me and I felt better that they were there. I found them pleasant not rude as others have stated. Couple comments on the technology...I too found the technology to be cool and easy to use with the exception of a couple things that I'll point out...I couldn't figure out how to turn the TV off from the master remote panel...I could just be dense and there were some unlabled buttons on the bottom that maybe would have done it...but luckily they also give you a TV remote and the few times I needed to turn off the TV I just did it with that remote. The other thing with the TV was the cound...it is very low and its hard to hear a differnece as you turn it up on the master panel...but the panel is working you just have to keep tapping the up volume button a LOT to start hearing the difference. I also wanted to comment on some of the reviews related to rooms not being serviced. I think that in some instances this may have been the reult of the technology in the room as well. There is a panel next to the door twhere you can trigger the privacy signal or a service signal. Our first night as we went to sleep we put the \"privacy\" signal on...the next day we left and never flicked it off...we didn't realize it was even on when we left and as a result we returned to our room at 5PM and found our room was not made up AND I noticed we had left the privacy signal on. So when we left for dinner and gambling later in the eve we switched it over to Service but by then i think it was too late and when we got back at late in the evening it still wasn't serviced...we didn't care all that much as we still had two clean towels...then about half hour after we returned there was a knock on the door and they were there to service the room...we just told them we wanted towles and the obliged and left. They didn't wake us up. Next days we got our \"signals\" right and the room was serviced as we would expect. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants so can't comment on that....we did enjoy and use the tram to Bellagio and the walkway and tram to Monte Carlo where we enjoyed the blackjack atmosphere. Also as other have mentioned the beds and linens are amazingly comfortable. Overall I think they are working on the bugs and are making progress and I enjoyed the stay...I'm not sure if I would return here or stay at other properties at similar prices.

I have stayed in almost every hotel in Vegas and numerous 5 or 4 stars around the world. I was excited to stay at the new Aria. NEVER again. I work from the room on the Internet. I had to fly to Vegas for a meeting but I can still work from my room. I was allowed to check in at 10am..nice. Let me tell you the good things about this hotel...NONE...there are none. There was no Internet access for 2 days. No explanation except soon. Staff did not know what was going on. When I would call down to check updates....no matter who answered they did not know it was down. Kept telling me to log in...The way the hotels are laid out in City Center you can't use your cell phone to hold a conversation. Many people I talked to said the same thing with different carriers. I could live with the Internet problem as I could teather my cell to my computer. No cell reception or very poor. They isolate you so you can't get across the street (since I had time on my hands) They want to hold you hostage to the $25 2 egg breakfast. The Four Seasons breakfast is not that much. Trust me THAT is no Four Seasons. Lets see..the ice machine was not working. The rooms have this hi tech system. You walk in and the lights come on and the drapes open automatically. They also close for no reason leaving you in pitch black darkness. The lights above my bed kept flickering. The shower, tho very beautiful would not get past warm. The Internet came back up at 8 pm and had to work until 2 am to catch up. It would go down almost every hour and have to log in again. Long walk to return a call too. This is picky but nobody knew where the shoe shine stand was. (always get shoes shined before meeting) One guy hidden in the mens room. Too bad if ladies need a shine I guess. This is the scary part. The very next day I started working on my laptop and left everything out. Legal documents, hard copy and on screen. My prescriptions laid out to take after eating. The RED privacy light was on. I went downstairs to eat, gone 45 min. I come back up and now the RED privacy light is out. I open the door to find the bed had been made but things looked out of place. There was a bottle of hotel hand lotion on its side with no cap on the glass table by the window. I did not move it or use it from the bathroom. I go into the bathroom and there are 2 hand towels neatly folded on each sink. One was filthy. The other small bottles were all knocked over too. Someone had been in my room. Outside by the next room is a maid and the supervisor with a clipboard. I asked why they were in my room and WHO was in my room. They do not know etc. Someone came into the room with the maid or after the maid and moved things around leaving an open bottle of lotion next to the window. I called the manager and explained to him..I got an I am sorry sir....that is it. Ok I got a really cheap deal on this but still it is a security issue and he was of no help. Knock on door and it is the housekeeping supervisor I showed her the state of the room. Why is this here? Why would they replace with dirty towels? I told her I was checking out. When I checked out the bill had a $20 Internet cable that they told me to try to see if the wired Internet worked. It was on the desk when I left. They charged me for Internet access that they did not have and most of all...there were 2 local phone calls made from my room. Proof that someone else was in that room. I checked out and moved to another hotel. Last thing...you check out dragging your bags on wheels to get a cab and are told to walk all the way around the circle drive to the cab stand...I mean like 2 city blocks. I asked the guy at the cab stand and he started ragging on this place too...I told them this was nuts. Nuts is an understatement.

We were simultaneously impressed and disappointed, and overall felt that, given the degree of competition amongst fabulous hotels in LV these days, we probably will not return here for another stay. Here is a summary of our experience: Pros: Gorgeous architecture and good proximity to things, which will be even better when the rest of the City Center opens up. Our room was quiet and the bed was very soft and comfy. Cool automation in the room for lighting, curtains, tv/music, housekeeping, etc. Cons: Casino air ventilation not as good as some of the other resorts (obvious cigarette smoke smell). Sketchy service at restaurants and lounges (specifically, American Fish and View Bar). Mediocre food at higher-than-mediocre prices (specifically, American Fish and the hotel Cafe Vettro). Irritating spa experience which was anything but relaxing, let me elaborate: groups of people were herded together by the hostess into the \"holding pen\" for the spa treatments, wet towels lay strewn all over the floors and the showers were dirty (used bandages on the shower floor, shaving creme not wiped off the shelves, etc.), had to wait for them to find my size of slippers (and ask again when they forgot), employees seemed flustered and stressed (not exactly the mood you are seeking when visiting a spa). The excuse that I was given was that it was a particularly busy weekend due to Valentine's Day, yet when my husband visited the facilities two days later he also found wet towels strewn all over the place and the employees just standing around chatting and watching tv instead of tidying up. Also, it seems reasonable that a spa could anticipate more visitors on a Valentine's Day long weekend and either increase staffing or limit spa bookings so that the experience can be more enjoyable. It was clearly understaffed on the day that I visited the spa, but given my husband's observations on the less busy days, that's not the only problem with that place. I walked away from the experience with a bad taste, wishing I had just bypassed the spa altogether. Unfortunately, the more memorable times of our weekend were spent outside the Aria resort, so we're not likely to return anytime soon.

We had a great time, and the hotel exceeded our expectations by far with only one minor glitch. We've stayed at Bellagio, Encore, and The Hotel on previous trips, and would put Aria on par with these resorts. Housekeeping was the only problem. Had to call every day to have the room cleaned, however, upon checkout I informed the clerk, and they rebated us $56 which I thought was the right thing to do. First off, check-in was very easy, however there were very few people in line. The whole process took 10 minutes, and we were given our choice of room (high floor, mountain view), and did not have to wait for it to be ready. I could see how check-in could be spicy if it was busy, given the lack of a central line... Think grocery store or Costco (am I in the quickest line? paranoia) Lobby and all the common areas were awesome. The hotel is beautiful (especially if you like an updated contemporary look - think W Hotels). I think it is very well laid out, and it was quite easy to get around. The casino was darker and brown with some natural lighting (a first in Vegas!!), but we enjoyed the different look. If you walk into almost any other casino on the strip the impression is that they were all designed by the same guy. Large brightly patterened carpets with bright lights, and old style finishing regardless of the hotel theme. Aria's casino is the opposite. A little darker and more modern. Plenty of choice on the gaming with lots of different minimums to suit whatever you like. I loved the poker room... the dealers were professional, and their was a festive atmosphere at the tables. I never waited for a seat. We don't play slots, so I can't comment on the quality or winning frequency. We never had to wait for a seat at any of the gaming tables either. Dealers were all friendly and helpful. Wish there was a Starbucks onsite, but you can get to one in under 5 minutes in the connection to the Monte Carlo. The Jean Phillipe Patisserie on site serves coffee, and breakfast items as well as great sandwiches at lunch. We ate at Cafe Vettro for breakfast and enjoyed it. Had dinner at Sirio onsite which was excellent - great Italian in a beautiful room. Had the breakfast buffet on our last morning - plenty of choice and good value (14.95 each). I thought the location on the Strip was fantastic. Very centrally located. Quick walk through Crystals (the attached mall) gets you to the strip in under 5 minutes. We used the tram to Bellagio a couple of times as well - very convenient. Walked to the fashion show mall across from Wynn.... Took about 30 minutes at a very leisurely pace. All in all it's a good location - easy to get almost anywhere by foot or cab. Lastly the rooms: Very well laid out, adequate size, and super comfortable bedding. Loved the electronic control of everything in the room. Thought the remote was intuitive and easy to use. We had a probem with our tv handheld remote. Called the front desk, and it was fixed by the time we got back to our room (a few hours later). All in all, I disagree with the negative reviews, and am not sure what people were expecting or were complaining about. I think this is definitely a 5 star resort given the amenities, the high quality dining, top brand shopping (LV, Prada, Paul Smith, Tom Ford, Tiffanys etc...), decent service, and luxurious accommodations.

So, if you are looking for a traditional vegas feel place this is probably not for you as it has a very modern chic big city feel. We arrived at 6pm on a Monday and check in was was very fast. I noticed that throughout the day this hotel seemed to have much shorter check in lines than the other hotes. First we were given a room with a terrible view on the 3rd floor right next to the elevator and overlooking the 3rd floor roof with total view of the hotel spotlights secured to the roof. We asked to changed and got a much nicer room on the 21st floor. We did not face the strip but view was still pretty decent. One cool thing was they can activate the room change without having to go downstairs to get a new key card. When we got to the room the bedside phone didn't work and we only had one robe. We called down and they came right up with a robe. Engineering knocked at 12:45am! to fix the phone. We were in bed so we didn't answer the door. Complained the next day and got comped a $55 breakfast for the inconvenience was in our minds was adequate. The service at the cafe was wonderful. Waitress was very attentive and friendly and full of smiles. The room was very nice and the sunken tub was fabulous after a long day of walking. The bed however was so soft I found it hard to sleep in. It was comfy at first but way too soft for anyone with any aches and pains. You really sink in on this one. I did not sleep well the entire week and that would be enough for me not to stay here again. The entire room is activated by the key pad on the bedside table. We are pretty tech savvy people but found using this to work the TV to be quite the pain. They do give you a regular remote thought to to use if you feel like it so I am really just whining here. The location of the hotel on the strip is decent however, it is a very long walk to get to the street. You cannot cross the street at this hotel you have to walk about a quarter mile in either direction to get to a crosswalk or overhead bridge. We found this to be a bit annoying. Would have preferred to just walk out and on to the street. The spa was great. For $30 you get a nice selection of sauna, outdoor heated pool, jacuzzis etc to use. Would highly recommend the spa. There are no additional fees at this hotel (i.e. resort fees other hotels charge). We did not gamble much at the Aria but it got pretty busy in the evenings. Other times of the day it is dead. We got such a great deal at the hotel that we decided to try it. i don't think we would stay here again though. We would probably try one of the other hotels before coming back to this one.

The room technology for the lights, curtains, tv, etc. was very easy to use and had no hiccups at all. The food was very good and the room service was excellent. It was a bit pricey but I was vacationing and what I didn't spend on food I was going to spend at the tables anyway so I didn't mind. The only con we experienced was the minibar. When we arrived it was missing a few items and it did show up on our account, but was quickly resolved with a visit to the front desk. The staff was always pleasant throughout the whole resort from the valet, front desk, dealers, elevator security, housekeeping, room service, etc. They were always welcoming and genuine. We do intend on returning soon and will plan on staying at the Aria again when the weather gets a bit warmer so we can take advantage of the pools.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "charlotte, north carolina", "Title": "\u201cThe best place I have ever stayed!!\u201d", "Author": "momongo", "ReviewID": "UR55556870", "Content": "We just returned from 5 days at the Aria and it was EXCELLENT!!!

Our waitress Esther was awesome, she actually had our cream warmed up for our coffee before she brought it to us, it made the coffee so creamy and smooth, we loved it. The place was spotless, people were constantly cleaning and shining everything and all the artwork everywhere was so interesting. There is nothing to complain about as far as I am concerned.

I've been to Vegas a few times before, have stayed at the Luxor, New York New York, MGM Grand, and Bellagio and Aria is probably my favorite of all of them. Why? Well a few things come to mind...First it's more of a low key place. Some may say this is a downer but not for me. I like going out to see shows and have a crazy time as much as the next guy, but it's kind of nice to come back to a hotel that's just plain comfortable and classy. Second, the casino is easily my favorite in all of Vegas already. For some of the same reasons...not all crazy with people going berserk everywhere. Maybe it was a fluke, but my time in the Aria casino was fun and people seemed to be actually enjoying themselves...not being either depressed from losing or obnoxious. Again, your experience at the hotel may vary. Third, the rooms are great. Big standard rooms with an entire wall being a floor to ceiling window. I was even in the back facing a construction site and didn't really mind it. Room tech is cool and not really that hard to use. I can see my parents having a problem with it but anyone who uses an ipod should be able to handle it easily. One downer: the ipod connection in the entertainment area requires some weird wire that you probably don't have, or didn't think to bring. However the \"connectivity console\" or whatever it's called is pretty cool. Two USB connections for charging a camera or iphone or whatever. Some power outlets also and even a video input if you want to use the HDTV for something. Internet is about $15/day which is a downer but I suppose it's not too bad. I guess the hotel is on the expensive side (my room was comped so can't comment on that)...the restaurants are pretty high end. I've heard the tapas restaurant is very good. I personally only ate at the buffet for lunch and at Jean Phillippe for morning pastry and sandwiches. Both great and both reasonably priced as far as I'm concerned. I should point out that I'm from NYC where everything is \"expensive\" compared to most areas. I've also heard that there are great deals on room at the Aria if you look around. Vegas is dead these days and the Aria in particular seems pretty slow. Summing it up: Great hotel, slightly expensive. I suppose if it's your first time in Vegas you should go ahead and stay at the Bellagio or one of the more themed hotels to have that experience. Others that just want a good quality high end hotel in Vegas should seriously consider Aria.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "milwaukee, wi", "Title": "\u201cNice, solid 4 star resort\u201d", "Author": "bran99", "ReviewID": "UR55422671", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 1 night last week due to a great rate.

Staff: The check in person was not very bright, I asked her what resturants were still open(it was about 10pm on a friday night when we checked in) and she had no idea and wasnt able to find out) . Then we asked the slot club person when check out was as our chick in lady didnt tell us, and she told us 11am, then in the morning I called to double check, and they told us it was 12. Nothing major but just odd that everyone didnt know the basics. Food: Only ate at Cafe Vetio(sp?) as we had to use a food credit asap. We got the buffalo wings( maybe the worst wings i have ever had in my life, just terrible). My wife and I both had burgers, they were good, but definitly overpriced at about 20 bucks for a cheeseburger. Overall: This is not the Wynn or Encore, but it is price accordingly.

Had to wait with about 30 people in line to check in. It was slow with only six desk clerks working until a seventh arrived to check us in. Service was pleasant and very thorough. Elevators are located midway through the 3+ acre casino but are monitored by security. Getting an elevator was never a problem since each cluster of eight is dedicated to 5 or 6 floors only. The hallways on the floors are extremely long and often had a very loud and annoying buzz/squeal coming from the utility room. Upon first entering a guestroom, the lights and TV come on automatically and the drapes draw open. The room itself is super-high-tech meets architect-on-steriods. The space is beautiful and artfully decorated. However, there is no electric receptacle near the nightstand. This presents a problem for anyone who wants to charge their cell phone overnight while keeping it close by. It is an even bigger problem for people like me who need a place to plug in a c-pap machine for sleeping. I tried moving the mattresses only to find that the lamp cord disappears behind a wood panel behind the nightstand. Eventually the front desk sent up two engineers who moved the nightstand (with safe inside) to gain access to an opening in the paneling which led to a receptacle. For the duration of our stay the nightstand remained about six inches from the wall so I could unplug without help when leaving. The engineers replaced some CFL light bulbs and had to have the TV rebooted. It takes a while to get familiar with the electronic controls. They are not intuitive enough for me and could be greatly improved upon. The bedding was super comfortable and the room was very quiet. There is no shampoo shelf in the shower and no aerator in the sink faucet which means the water comes out in a hard stream and splashes everywhere. Dinner at the Buffet was excellent except for an alarm of some kind with strobe lights and a loud recorded voice kept going off. Our daughter's room was not serviced at all one day. We've stayed at the Hilton, Paris and Wynn in the past. Will probably not stay at Aria again.

We entered through the entrance for Sky Suites/Villas which is separate from main entrance. There is a nice lounge area and beverages and light snacks available near Sky Suite check in. Our complaints are only service related. They tout two daily housekeeping and we were lucky to get once daily housekeeping. The bedside lamps didn't work nor did the tv in the bathroom. Small complaints but the small things are what set some properties apart. We requested housekeeping several times and sometimes we got it and sometimes not. We requested the lamps and tv be fixed and we got one lamp to work. The concierge was not helpful. I called several times requesting recommendations for restaurants or shows and I knew as much as he did. The most frustrating thing was our limo from the hotel to the airport.

The hotel staff was friendly but not nice enough. The hotel as a whole seemed pretentious and too formal. The restaurants and shops are very formal and remind me of a museum of modern art. Maybe I am not used to this type of luxury, but it was more of a modern, stuffy luxury compared to what I saw in the elegant luxury of the Venetian, Bellagio, Pallazzo. Location on the strp is great and the ability to walk to the connected Monte Carlo and take the tram from Crystals (upscale shops next door) to the Bellagio was very convenient. The construction going on next door (we were closest to the construction on the north end) was somewhat annoying if you are a light sleeper. I doubt you would have any problems if you were on the south end of the hotel. Valets and bellman were very friendly.

The negative... Don't drop your luggage with the porter when you arrive to the hotel. The porter lied to us and told us that if left the luggage with him, it would be in my room by the time we got to the room by the time we finished checking in. NOT TRUE! Back to this later! The GOOD... When I was reading the experience of previous guests, I was a little nervous because there were comments of how long it would take to be checked in. They must have worked out the quirks because check in was painless and person that took care of us was very good. That's when I found out I had to call to request the luggage when I got to the room to request the luggage and that it would take 15 - 20 minutes. I requested a room in the high floor regardless of view. The gave us Room 23288, on the 23rd floor. The only thing I didn't think of was the size of the window. There is NO false advertising. the windws are from ceiling to floor, but very small. In the previews of the room, the windows appear huge, but ours were not even 1/8 in width. With that said, I want to let you know that EVERYTHING in the room is state of the art. The Bed is one of the best mattresses I've slept in. The pillows HEAVENLY! You control the room controls on the TV, on the Alarm clock and by the panels on the walls. No keys, just wave the key and it opens. Security is superb, as you approach the guest elevators, there is always someone there and you must show your key. The TV, FLATscreen with many, many pixles because the crispness of the picture was incredible. I thought our tv at home was good, it's mediocre if you compare it to this on. The bathroom is spacious with his and hers sinks, a separate \"toilet\" room, and the shower was behind the same wall with a tub. You may wonder why I did not give the resort all 5s: Rate Hotel - Extremely large and front of it is not directly on the strip. You need to go around and go through a \"walk\" to get to the sidewalk and then to reach the elevators to get to the rooms. Location is good, it's next to the Monte Carlo. But just like with the Belagio, to get to the rooms you have to walk, walk, walk and walk some more. The value was good for everything you get, but the pool is not yet finished. You had to use the pool of the Monte Carlo. Value 4.5 I have to say that we spent a wonderful anniversary weekend! The only other complaint, that is really not a complaint is that I ordered chocolate covered strawberries and anothe crunchy package to be delivered or if possible to be in the room when we arrived. It didn't happen, but it was not charged either. A GREAT experience, I forgot my diamond earings on the nightstand, they were left untouched.

The room had a gorgeous lounge area, kitchen, dining area, 2 bathrooms, spa bath and the most gorgeous bed/pillows. I think the bed was a little too soft but only a minor detail. The hotel was gorgeous. The art, the finishing detail was all top notch. There are definitely hiccups with a new hotel. I think Wynn rooms are gorgeous and the service was sooo much better but the location of Aria is much much better. The staff uniforms are drab. I thought that a new hotel would dress there staff in funkier outfits, but the casino staff match the carpet.

First the good: rooms were spacious, clean and well-furnished. The maid services was great; the maids came by 2x per day - once to clean early in the day then again for turndown service in the evening. The bathrooms were really nice, with a separate water closet and a glass-enclosed bath/shower combo that was really very nice. The lobby, casino, and decor were fantastic. The pastry shop at the bottom of the elevators was fantastic. It's in the middle of the strip, convenient to Planet Hollywood, the Bellagio, Paris, etc. My boyfriend used the gym/spa and said it was well worth the $30 he paid to get in. Now for the not so good: They have two valet locations, but I found it odd that I had to wait 10-15 minutes for my car when I was the only person at the valet. There is no Starbucks in the resort, but there is one closeby in the walkway to Monte Carlo. The computerized controls were touchy; sometimes I didn't know if touching a button would turn lights on or off; sometimes I'd hit a button and some of the lights would go on while others would go off. And the bathroom could have used more towel bars -- there's nowhere to put your face towels around the vanity, and you have to hang your bath towels outside the shower/bath combo enclosure. None of these issues is a dealbreaker though. If these had been my biggest problems, I would have loved this hotel. Now the bad: the wireless internet cost $15/day, which is not my complaint. I logged on and had the $15 added to my room bill, but the internet stopped working after an hour. I called the internet helpdesk number, which was a inside call according to the guest services booklet and thus should have been free of charge. When I told the helpdesk guy that the internet wasn't working, his response was \"yeah, that's been happening\". I asked him if there was an ETA to fix it and he said \"no, it's just something we have to live with\". Seriously, there isn't a business in the world where that's an acceptable response from the helpdesk; I got the impression they weren't even working to resolve the problem. I asked if he could refund my $15 and he told me to call the front desk. So fine. I checked my portfolio to see if this was necessary (I thought that since this appeared to be a common, widespread problem maybe the hotel wasn't charging for internet that day) only to find that not only had they charged the $15, they had charged it TWICE. Yes, I was charged for 24 hours of internet (that didn't work) twice within an hour. And they had tacked on $1 for the call to the helpdesk. The lady at the front desk removed all the charges for me after arguing for a couple minutes about whether or not the helpdesk call should have been free. She also had no idea when the internet would be working. We also were unable to get our curtains open for the last two days, whether we used the GUI next to the bed, the TV, or the buttons on the wall to try to open them. At one point when I tried to open them, the whole room shut down while the computer system was \"reloading\", so we had to sit there in the dark for five minutes until it came back up. If they could get those internet issues worked out, fix their billing glitches, and get their computerized controls to work more intuitively and without shutting down, it would be a great hotel. But for the money, I'd rather get a room at a place that has their act more together.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cAria is the best of the strip.

Beautiful, contemorary and unique. CHECK-IN PROCESS- Took forever! Although I did not wait very long in line, the process just took to long. Just when you are done, they present you with this HUGE overwhelming map and give you a few minute presentation on how to get around the hotel. After a long trip from the east coast, I just wanted to get to my room. ROOMS- Good part- Beautiful room and fabulous sense of arrival. When you walk in, the lights magically turn on, mood music turns on and the curtians open. Its seriously amazing. Makes you want to act like a child and jump on the bed. Ahhh, the Bed. It was seriously the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in... makes getting up that much harder. ROOMS- Bad part- Everything in the room is controlled by a panel. Tv, air, service, LIGHTS, curtains, temperature, music, you name it. Imagine you wake up in th emiddle of the night to use the bathroom.. only to remember that you have to figure out where to turn the light on in the panel near your bed.... or when youve had too much to drink and cant figure out how to turn the hallway lights out without turning the whole lights out. Also, there were MAJOR malfuctions with the lights.. whenver you turned on the lights, the curtains woudl open. I contacted ENGINEERING many times about it, and they said that they would send someone up. Never happend. CALLS FROM THE ROOM- VERY IMPORTANT- me and a colleague of mine and mysterious local call charges added to our final bill I asked them to be removed at checkout and they did not give me any trouble. Made me wonder if this is a common problem and makes me wonder if this this happens frequently when people just dont pay attention to the bill. HALLWAYS- this hotel is MASSIVE. Im pretty sure its the largest (or one of) hotels on the strip. The elevators are located in 1 area. If you have a room at the far end of the hall (which I did), please pack your walking shoes!! I timed that it took me appx 10 minutes to walk from the elevator to my room. YOu'd think that they would do a better job of designing the hotel SECURITY- AWESOME!! They always asked for your keys when walking to the elevators. They were also very helpful with assisting with my random questions about things to do, restaurants, etc. RESTAURANTS- The Buffet is adequite, nothing special but reasonably priced. The Tapas restaurant (forgot the name) next to the front desk, has the BESSSSSSSTTT SANGRIA! I suggest getting the pitcher.. Trust me, its worth it. The Deuce lounge is a very nice spot to hang out with some friends for some drinks. The manager even made us reservations at a restaurant nearby for dinner... but it took us 30 minutes to get our bill.... VERY frustrating when we were 1 of 3 people in there. Overall, the hotel was beautiful; service needs some serious attention. Hopefully, a few months, they will get the hang of it and be a force to be reckoned with... in the meantime, you are better off splurging your $$ at the Bellagio, where the service is top notch.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cHANDS DOWN PERFECT\u201d", "Author": "phillysiteseer", "ReviewID": "UR54695922", "Content": "listen up all of you that are reading these negative reviews. dont worry this place is banging unbelievable from a to z i recently went there for a four night five day get a way i booked two months before my trip after reading all the negative reviews a was getting nervous and even called to switch my casino but my wife convinced me to stay with aria all i can say is thank god i kept it food bars night life shopping everything was perfect the rooms are wonderful they clean your room twice a day and all employees are extra nice 1 complaint make sure you have comfortable shoes the property is huge and you will do alot of walking", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver BC", "Title": "\u201ci would give it a couple more months..\u201d", "Author": "ryancass", "ReviewID": "UR54646450", "Content": "Stayed from January 10th to 12th. I was trying to change hotel before we arrived as I read some horrible reviews on this site. As we were so close to departure, we could not make any changes so decided to give Aria a fair shot and not expect much. Upon check in, I was pleasantly surprised by the lobby... saw reviews that the lobby reeked of smoke but found it very pleasant (smelt of vanilla). We went to check in, with only 2 people ahead of us. I had read reviews of the long wait with reception and they ARE TRUE. Only 2 people ahead of us but took over half an hour to check in. Other guests would come from behind the line to speak with the reception about problems they were having. Some guests were given key cards for rooms already occupied, Some guests reservations were not pulling up, etc. Management was hovering behind the front desk agents, but not assisting them. It was very odd. Sink or swim maybe? We had no problem with our reservation but no one at front desk was smiling, happy, or wishing us a pleasant stay. I even tried to make a joke to cut the tension but not even a smirk from our agent. You could tell that they had been hearing complaints all day (all week even!) and were too happy to be there. Walking into the Casino, you could smell that smoke that others had commented about, but that is with any casino in vegas with smoking permitted. This hotel is absolutely beautiful and very modern. We arrived in our room to a \"stripview\" facing mgm and planet hollywood. Someone commented on a loud noise in the room due to the wind??.. didn't experience that at all and wonder if they had the fan on without knowing it. Quite rooms- very high tech with the lighting, shades, tv, music. You could even control your privacy door setting with the click of a button on the tv :) I could see if your not used to these modern features, it could be quite frustrating, but we had no problems and had fun playing around with this. Some people complained about the $15/day internet fee. I think this is reasonable as many travelers won't need the internet while in vegas and those that need it, should pay a little more. Another note- its $15 for 24 hours... so if you get it at 4pm - you have it till 4pm the next day. That's less than 60 cents and hour- i think that a great deal in an expensive city like vegas. Beds are AWESOME! almost toooo soft. The main issue at this hotel is the service. As with our experience at check in, calling the front desk from our room was another challenge. The line would just ring and ring until you were put on a hold. I held for about twenty minutes before the line was answered, just to ask for a late check out. Luckily it was worth it, they gave us a late check out of 230pm. I went to check out on the final day and saw the line. I said forget it and left our keys at the elevator drop box. We didn't dine at any of the restaurants but did walk around and checked them out on our last day. The look of them is spectacular- every little corner of the hotel has some visual art, blown glass, contemporary designs, etc. #1 suggestion: use the spa facilities for $30/day. You have access to the fitness centre (all new equipment), indoor dip pools, sauna, steam room, salt room, heated stones, and shower/makeup area. There is also a heated outdoor infinity pool, not too big but great views of the mountains while sitting outside... so relaxing. Free products like shampoo, body lotions, razors, etc for use. Also free refreshments and fruit while you are in the spa. The outdoor pool is closed-- but could be because of the winter season (or it's not completed yet). Overall- we were very happy with the Aria. I would definitely pass on that the service is not good, with the exception of the spa staff. Give this hotel about 3-6 months and hopefully the reception staff will catch up & be happy to be working in this amazing hotel.

I originally booked an American Ailrline Vacation package that included the flight and the Aria Hotel. Well two days later, I received a call that they could not get me in the Aria. I really, really, really, really, wanted to stay at Aria, so I called direct and the rate was $399.00 a night. Although, more than I wanted to pay, I was willing since it was new, on the strip, and a great way to celebrate my birthday. Tons of problems at this highly advertised as a great 5 star hotel. My airport shuttle to the Aria would not allow me to be dropped off at the front, had to enter in the underground garage in the back of the hotel. The front seemed to take forever to get there, and once at the reservation desk, there was a line of people. Also, found out it was the Electronic Show Convention weekend, so it was busier than normal. It took 45 minutes to get to the desk and check in. Once checked in, I was informed that the non-smoking rooms were not cleaned or available yet, and it was around 5:00 pm. So I was offered a smoking room, in which only opened for 2 weeks, there shouldn't be any smoke smell, and given 50 off for two nights only. Hello, I'm staying 4 nights, what about those nights? She said that was the best she could do.?? As I approached the elevators, the \"guard\" was very rude to ask for my room key. I can understand making sure guests have a key, but his approach was very unpleasant. There was no nightly turn down or cleaning service as was told in the advertisement. One day, I went to get ice, and the door handle came off. I had to wait outside my room for maintenance, which was 30 minutes, b/c the housekeepers couldn't let me in. Well, the door lock was broke that I had to move rooms. So got another $100.00 off my bill for the inconvenience. I was told that my boarding pass could be printed if I call down to the front desk, and then they told me no, so I had to go down and request it. Last day as I checked out, I noticed my bill was incorrect-they added some mini bar items, THAT I DID NOT HAVE. So, as I left my room, I left my luggage, received a correct receipt, and they had checked me out, so my card was no longer useful, so I had to wait for SECURITY to open my door to get my luggage in which I missed my shuttle to the airport and ended up taking a taxi. I know it is new, but still how can you represent yourself as a 5 star hotel and so many mishappens on 1 stay? I did have a spa day and that was great! The room technology is great, the cleanliness and attention to detail was awful, and the front desk help still needs some help, as well as other personnell in the hotel. Very disappointed, and made for a bad birthday weekend with lots of money on a room that didn't make sense paying 399.00 a night, even with all the discounts. I would have preferred an even more discount, due to my disappointment, but mgmt., would not help me.

Quick, smooth check-in and upon entering our room we were pleasantly suprised at the first impression. Usually stay at the Encore and many of our favorite features there were available- black out shades, electronic lights (automatic here), soaking tub, large shower, comfy soft bed and extra lounging area. After a few moments our unpleasent discoveries appeared: 1. Multiple hairs in the soaking tub and shower area 2. Filthy windows overlooking our 'roof garden below' and a few city lights- looks as if a bird lives directly above our room- gross! and then the worst discovery of all...3. A partial piece of Condom in our BED!!!! I placed an immediate call to the front desk (took almost 10 minutes to even get through and they were NOT busy when we were just there). They offered to set us up in a new room or send up housekeeping 'immediately' to change the bedding. We picked the second option. I always travel with Clorox wipes and we had disinfected everything else already and started settling in so this was easier of us. The front desk also offered to take off $50 from our room for that nights stay- on check out we did have to remind them of this but it was taken care of in the end. About 15 minutes later a housekeeper arrived with fresh towels- no bed linens. I told her what was the problem and she returned immediately with a new set of linens. Quick, efficient and clean our room was returned to us in a better state and we enjoyed the rest of our short one night stay. Location is central for this hotel, poker room in the casino was a plus, casual to fine dining available as well although we only tried the pastries at the chocolate shop and the Cafe for a quick dinner salad (reasonable at only $13-$16 but nothing exceptional). Walking distance, or tram if you prefer, to Bellagio, and a CVS is conveniently located just below the hotel on the strip if you need anything you may have forgotten. Overall the hotel is quite 'brown' and a bit dark compared to some hotels on the strip but the public areas seem to be kept clean and the modern style is enjoyable. Staff in the casino area was friendly as well as the men who monitor the elevators to only allow guests in the room areas. Music is pumped throughout the hotel and in some spots a bit loud, including the elevators and hallways. Outside there are taxis available next to the water inspired decor including a wall of cascading water on the outer wall of the hotel, nice fountain in the center and an amazing collection of canoes (yes, the boat) that are all tied together and set as an artwork piece that is quite a sight and hovers above the entrance area.

The restaurants are not really family oriented which is a shame because it seems that CityCenter has attracted more of the larger family groups than most upscale properties on the strip even if they were mostly browsing. People staying at the hotel seem to frequent the pastry shop near the elevators serving light sandwiches and muffins. leaving the upscale Asian and Italian restaurants empty during dinner hours.

In fact, I even emailed their guest services department. I received a cookie cutter email response. This was not our first time in Vegas so I had a pretty good idea what I wanted in a \"five star\" hotel. This was not it. It is very beautiful. I have no complaints about the decor since that is highly subjective. It is dark but hardly the only dark casino on the strip so that wasn't an issue for me. Check in was fairly uneventful. A hotel employee directed us to the VIP line for quick service (we were not VIP's) and it went off smoothly. We did have trouble finding the hotel desk from the airport shuttle drop off and better signage could probably help with that. The room was small but just fine. The technology aspect was interesting but in some respects just make basic tasks more difficult. Of course, the batteries went out in our remote-just another annoyance. It is the first hotel that didn't ask us if we wanted to upgrade. Interesting. The bed is the most comfortable hotel bed EVER! Our issues involved the bathroom toilet which backed up 4 of the 5 days we were there. We did nothing that should have backed this thing up. The first time I called the front desk someone answered farily quickly and sent someone up right away (within 20 min.) to fix it but it was very early in the morning. From that point on it was downhill. I could never reach anyone at the front desk and discovered that no other \"floor\" employees even carry radio's so they can't help either. I took to leaving notes on the counter for Housekeeping in hopes that they would take care of it somehow. Day 3 I went to the front desk. We got back very late and they hadn't even been there. I was furious. They do not seem to care if you complain. Never were we offered any compensation for our time or trouble. It was just odd. Housekeeping was totally inconsistent. I do not understand why they do not have a \"to do in every room\" list. One day we had 1 washcloth. The next day I left a note and we received more. They emptied the ice bucket on one of the five days but that's it. They took glasses but didn't replace them or they left them sitting dirty. It made no sense to me. They actually took the hotel shampoo and soap amenities from our shower and set them all back up on the bathroom counter. Who does that? Overall, I found the staff to be pleasant but that wasn't enough to make up for all the little issues we had the whole stay. The location of the hotel is fantastic! The food is expensive even by Vegas standards. For the most part, we ate at other locations. The sports bar was okay but that's it. The cafe was the same. $7.50 for a glass of orange juice was a bit over the top for us. At least it tasted good. In my opinion, if this hotel doesn't improve dramatically - they will never make it. I would rate it a 3 star at best. It has a long way to go. On a side note, our last trip to Vegas we stayed at the MGM Signature - the rooms, staff, etc. were fantastic! The downside was the LONG walk to the strip. However, all things considered.....Aria could take a lesson from them.

(no idea what is wrong with them) Right now the \"cutting edge technology\" is \"bleeding edge\" and it is painful! This is a huge hotel, lots of great aspects to it, but don't think that they have targeted high end luxury segment (i.e., Wynn/Encore, Four Seasons, even Palazzo)...they have aimed much broader...need to appeal to all segments given it's size. So the result is a large, new MGM...not a large, new Wynn or even Bellagio. Still, some good dining (tried Sage, American Fish and Sirio), a pretty good Cirque show (Elvis), some amazing architecture, and a staff that seems to be trying...just really overwhelmed and ill-equipped to deliver a predictable level of service. Finally, the rooms are very contemporary...going for the New York loft look and feel. This is not bad, just a little too contemporary for my liking, at least on a regular basis. Fit and finish is not what you would find at the Wynn/Encore, Four Seasons, Palazzo and even the Bellagio.

The hotel is visually beautiful and still has that \"new hotel smell.\" The interior decor is tastefully but unorignally done. However, its at best a 3 star hotel. Its not on par with the other high end hotels in Las Vegas. If I got a super good deal I might consider going back, but otherwise I will pass in the future. Positives: The employees working in the self park are very friendly. The workers at the craps and blackjack tables are friendly. The staff at the elevators is friendly. Elevators do not take long. Pretty interesting art gallery within the City Center (just outside the main lobby). Negatives: The front desk staff is indifferent and unhelpful, and overall they appear to be materially understaffed. The rooms are on the darker side (intentionally designed that way), so if you want to read or work at the desk you will need to use the desk lamp. Unfortunately, my desk lamp did not work. I called down within two minutes of checking in to my room. The front desk person said \"we'll send someone right up.\" About an hour I called down again and got the response that \"engineering\" was very busy and my request was \"in the queue.\" I asked what this meant and could he give me at least an estimate of how long it would take -- the unhelpful employee said no, he was unable to do that. I asked if it would be longer than 20 minutes, he said I don't know. I asked if I could just come down there and pick up a replacement desk lamp. He said no, engineering has to do that and they have several \"orders\" ahead of you. 30 minutes later I called down again and got the same response. I asked that a manager or supervisor call me. Each time I called the front desk there was a long wait. The front desk person assured me he would. No one ever called or came by. Finally another hour later a repair guy came, and had no idea what the problem was. He spent 20 minutes trying to \"fix\" the lamp by taking it apart and the panel under the table (where the wires are located) apart. Finally he gave up and agreed I needed a new lamp and left. It took another 30 minutes to get the replacement. The repair guy was nice enough, but this whole episode should have been resolved in 10 minutes when I requested they bring up a new lamp. And the manager never called. The whole episode wasted about 3 hours of my Friday evening in Las Vegas. When I checked out, no one asked to follow up on the problem. I also have a pet peeve about hotels that over charge for mediocre internet access. This is supposed to be a hotel that claims to be technologically advanced. They charge $15 per day for wireless access that goes in and out. My sprint wireless card was twice as fast, so I ended using that instead. Also, they have the usual touch screen panel by the bed, but it doesn't really do anything other than look neat and give you the time. The television menu has a \"listen\" feature to allow you to listen to music, but it doesn't work. Instead you have to go to the \"watch\" television channels option and select a music station. Not a big deal, but this is a brand new hotel and some thought should have been put into the menu design of this supposedly advanced hotel. One other thing I found to be pretty amazing. Their business center is only open until 4 pm. So if you need any business support after 4 pm (send a fax, print a document, etc.) you are on your own. Finally, I recommend you avoid the \"Coffee Beanery\" downstairs by the parking elevators.

We booked through Continental and got a good deal on air + hotel combo. We've both been to Vegas several times and have stayed at various hotels. Im going to start w/ the negatives b/c there are only a few: 1. If you're looking for a warm/romantic room/hotel, this isnt the place for you. The hotel, while nice, is modern and doesn't have that romantic feel to it. 2. Check-out was a slight pain b/c we were checking out at 5 am and the self-checkout on the tv did not work and there was quite a large line at the front desk with only a few employees checking people out. 3. The casino is rather dark. Now on to the positives: 1. PERFECT location. This hotel is located in the city center, right in the middle of the action and the strip. Further, you can cut through the city center mall and take the bridge across to the other side (Planet Hollywood) where we ended up going out at night. Also, there is a free tram running from Monte Carlo to the Bellagio with a stop at the hotel. This was perfect b/c we didn't have to walk outside in the cold at night and it was much quicker. Further, we had friends staying at Monte Carlo and we were able to walk inside from our hotel to theirs and they connected in the middle. 2. Rooms. While not as big as some of the other hotels (Venetian/Wynn), our king room was a plenty big for 2 people. We fell in love with the technologically advanced room. When we walked in, the curtains and sheers opened and the tv turned on with a personalized welcome message. The innovation and technology provided in the room definitely made it a better experience. The housekeeping staff came to our room 2x a day which was nice b/c we always had clean towels and new amenities. We ordered room service one late night, and I was suprised as to how fast the food came up, within 15 minutes of us calling. 3. Staff: we had a quick check-in, and in fact the employee at the front desk upgraded us to a higher floor with a better view. We had trouble with the safe in our room, but security came and handled the issue quickly. All in all, the staff was friendly and very attentive. 4. Restaurants: unfortunately, we didn't really eat at the hotel that much so I can't really comment. However, we did have lunch at the restaurant near the front desk which served tapas. The food was, but the portions were small as it was a tapas restaurant. 5. Spa: what a relaxing experience. My husband and I both made spa appointments. We were allowed access to the spa area all day. We went a little earlier to enjoy some of the other amenities in the spa, such as: a heated pool, jacuzzis, and various relaxation rooms. Further, we were provided with plush robes and slippers. There were bathing facilities and several amenities to get ready at the spa. We were both very satisfied with our treatments and the staff at the spa.

As you enter, I noticed that there was a little confusion as to where to go but, we figured it out. When we were prompted to the next available person we were greeted by Ryan G. He helped us at check in with making sure the roll a bed was in our room as well as up grading us to a city view room. He was so helpful and friendly I was quite impressed how easy it was to do so. When we went to our room we were greeted with a pleasant surprise of the room. The lights came on automatically, the curtains were opening and all you can see was the strip. After checking out the room we realized that our toilet didn't work. I immediately called maintenance and they assured me that somebody would be there to fix it. So we went to check out the room and we quickly went by to say Thank you to Ryan for the fabulous view room and we mentioned that the toilet didn't work and told him that we already called but he then put in another request and assured us that somebody would be there to fix it. After exploring the strip for about an hour, we went back up to the room and checked the toilet and it didn't work still. So, we went back down to see Ryan and advised him that the toilet was still not working. He doubled checked and assured us that somebody was there and he offered to move us to another room. We declined and just advised him that all we wanted was a toilet that worked. He assured us that it would be done. After the second time of informing that our toilet was broken we had no other issues with our room.

We waited in line for at least 20 minutes and this was in the VIP/Invited guests check in. We were assigned a corner suite on the 7th floor. Amazing! This suite is perfect for romance. Check out the posted pictures. Most impressive was the floor to ceiling windows, the separate whirlpool tub for two and the fully stocked mini bar with a second empty mini fridge for your own beverages and snacks. Our bags arrived within 10 minutes of calling for them, no wait, no problems. The hubby liked the in room technology and gadgetry. Even the toilets were high tech with heated seats and built in bidet! The room would have been perfect if we had a higher floor but none was available due to the holiday weekend. Noise was not a problem at all. We heard NOTHING! That may have been because we were on the corner but our room was a quiet cocoon. The room had a contemporary look yet was still cozy and warm. Think W or Westin hotels. If your style is more traditional, a la Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, this is not the hotel for you. Housekeeping was on point, no complaints there. They respected the privacy sign and kept the towels fresh and the room clean. We used in room dining twice. Service was lightning fast both times (less than a 30 minute wait) the food was tasty and the servers were pleasant. The City Center tram made it easy to get around between the Bellagio and the Monte Carlo. We did check out Haze on a Saturday night. Be forewarned no special consideration for hotel guests, general admission line with everyone else, club just so-so. Also, the Aria buffet wasn't as bad as others have said.

My GF and I stayed here Jan 15-18. First, They are listening! They now have a few emplyees directing people into checkin lines. I think it could go a little faster, but it was not the worst I have seen. There were 3 people in line in front of me and it took about 20 min before I was at the counter. Yes the place is Brown. it works for them. If you dont like brown don't come here. ( which is pretty silly if you ask me) The rooms are very nice. As you have heard many times before, the beds are FANTASTIC. they got that right. But the rooms are smaller than I would expect for any place claiming to be 5 stars. I dont think they will ever get a AAA 5 diamond award. I would put this at a solid 4 stars 4 diamond place. better than most but not as nice as others. The remote control is ( despite what others have said) very easy to understand and operate. If you want to watch TV touch \"watch TV\" if you wnat to open or close curtains touch \"curtains\" ETC... The technology is cool and reasonably easy to use. Motorized curtains are cool but they do not make or break the room. Yes water pressure is low... but this is the law in vegas now. You dont get high pressure anywhere any more. and this is a \"Green\" Hotel so expect conservation all over the place. The layout of the shower/tub is a little odd. But they are very nice and the tub is big. Location is great. It's not that bad of a walk to the street. its right between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. We only ate at Cafe Vitro ( the standard cafe) for breakfast. it was good but way overpriced. Breakfast for 2 with coffee came to 40.00. It's worse than Bellagio prices. And yes the drinks at any of the bars are very expensive. count on at least 15.00 for standard mixed drinks. Alot more for premuim drinks. We did not eat anywhere else at this hotel. The casino is dark as all have said. It's a OK casino as casino's go. High limits on weekends. Dealers were for the most part very nice. The Poker Room is VERY NICE. if you are a poker player, this is a great place to play. the seats are super comfortable. Games are mostly 1-3 and 2-5 NL. with some 3-6 limit and an advertised 20-40 HORSE game on Wednesday nights. They have a GREAT tournament every day at 1:00PM 8000 in chips 30min rounds . buy in is 120.00. I loved it... mostly because I won the one I was in. We took in one of the preview performances of \"Viva Elvis\" it is not your regular Crique show. There is alot of dancing and singing. Not alot of the stunniong acrobatics I am accustomed too with Cirque. The music was great and the energy was high. It does still need work but I think once it opens for real it will be prety good. Just go to enjoy the Elvis and not the Cirque. Checkout was fast and easy. No complaints there. Overall you should expect a very nice hotel in a very nice loaction. Yes I would stay here again but I would not pay full price. I got a great rate for this stay. If I was asked to pay the same price as bellagio, Wynn, Palazzo or Venitian I would choose one of the others. As long as its a decent deal I would stay here again in a minute. I think star ratings are very suspect and subjective. so 5 stars... 4 stars... we all have our standards. I normally stay at 4 and 5 star hotels. I have stayed at Wynn, Bellagio and Palazzo. This place is very different from those and very nice in its own way. I will not say its better or worse. Those who gave this place realy bad reviews I am sure had a very frustrating experience. I dont think those reviews are indicative of what this hotel is like now. They have fixed alot of issues and are working to fix the rest. They are trying, and in time this will be a world class hotel. I guess my only complaints would be to bring the food and drink pricing in line with the rest of vegas. Your high prices will just push people away. If you got a good rate, take it and stay here. you will not be sorry. I am happy to answer any questions I have not addressed here.

It took 59 minutes to get our meal (based on our receipt time stamp) and despite twice asking about our meal, we were told it was coming. People who arrived 30 minutes after we came (I checked the time stamp on their receipt) and ordered similar food received theirs but ours was lost in the system (they prepare and bag the food in the back where you can't see them). The food was good, but an hour for finger food? No thanks! I asked for a supervisor but no one was available. 3) Ate at one of the fancy sit-down restaurants that server \"tapas\" (appetizers) and we had fresh calamari, a 5 oz or so piece of meat and one other tapas, plus two drinks (vodkas) for $80. Overpriced. 4) The view from the room looking at the strip actually looks at the other City Center skyscrapers and the parking circle/wide road leading up to the Aria and one small fountain. And it's set WAYYY back from the Strip, so it's a very boring view. 5) You have to walk thru the shower to get to the tub, which is nothing special and there is no view (except of the bathroom).

We arrived, very friendly check-in took maybe 5 minutes, easy to get to the elevators thru the casino, and we booked a corner suite at the very end of the hotel and it was maybe a 1 minute walk from the elevator, not 10 minutes like some have said. The room was great, loved the computerized system for the lights, temperature, curtains. Awesome. Now my parents who are 70 might have some trouble figuring it out, but we never had any issues. Our suite had the coolest bathroom, heated toilet seat, huge shower, tv jet tub, really nice. Beds were super comfy. We gambled some the first night and were promptly asked if we wanted drinks by the waitress, she came around often, very friendly. The casino lights are dim, but not a cave like some complaints. I loved the mood and atmosphere it created. Ate dinner at the Italian restaurant (can't remember the name)...very good, also had breakfast at the cafe which was a dissapointment, we still prefer the Paris restaurant. But the architecture of everything was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, great service and we would definently come back and miss it already!", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Vancouver BC", "Title": "\u201cFew Kinks to work out but is still a Great place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "trav69", "ReviewID": "UR53971363", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights from Jan 15th - 18th.

I had read many negative reviews here for weeks before leaving and was a little concerned. For me check in was a breeze, maybe 2 people in front of me, I asked for a mountain view and to be on a high floor not far from the elevator and got it all. The room is very modern and nice. The beds are the most comfortable I have ever been on and I personally own a $3k mattress at home. The high tech controls for the lights etc.. take a few minutes to get used to but are very cool. We did have a problem with the curtains fully closing and this did for some reason take 12 hours to fix. We could have changed rooms to avoid the wait but did not and was compensated $50 off our bill at check out for the problem. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels and bath products and had a turn down service in the evening. I had no problem with outlets for my cell phone and for the iron. We were on the 25th floor and did not hear any noise outside, it was very quiet and peaceful to sleep. We did not eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel as I had reservations each night at some of my favorite spots from past trips to Vegas. The sports book is awsome with some of the clearest and largest plasma screens I have ever seen. The staff were so friendly, they must be trained to stop and say hello every time someone walks by them. Aria is at the back of the City Center but still and excellent location that you can walk to Bellagio or Planet Hollywood in an easy 10min.

Turns out I made the right call. I'll bullet point some if the issues that have come up and my responses. 1. In room technology - was awesome. Moving from one TV channel to another was a tad slower than normal, but the ability to control lighting, drapes, wake up/sleep timer etc, all through either the TV or the night stand top device was cool - didn't try to bring any of my media stuff in through the TV - but the option to is cool. Self Parking- the self parking is a bit aggravating as they have a lot of extra space between parking spots at least on the first few levels. Seems like a lot of wasted space to me. Valet Parking - highly recommended for convenience. I do recommend you give them a call 10-15 before you need your vehicle though. They have a LOT of people staying there are valet parking - plan and call ahead and you will avoid frustration. Staff - everyone I worked with was really helpful - no problem with unmotivated staff, etc. Restaurants - only ate at Sage - it was lights out. Had the Sweetbreads for an appy and Roasted Loin of Iberico Pork - was phenomenal - service was excellent as well and the chef sent an amuse-bouche to start the meal and a tasty sipping chocolate shot to cap the meal that were awesome. If offered tap water or bottled - I always take tap - trying to be environmentally responsible - the tap water was terrible though - had to ask for replacement bottled water The Bacon Baguette was really tasty as well. Only real issue I had was the morning of checkout. Had an issue with the toilet clogging/failing to flush right before I checked out. Wasn't around to see what the response time from Maintenance was.

Once we got there, it was really nicely decorated and they had some vanilla sent pumping through the circulation system which was nice, I guess. We then had to wait THIRTY MINUTES to check in. It was chaos. There was no organization except some guy standing with a clipboard trying to look important. They also had a terrible time trying to explain that they will hold $130 of your money on your credit card a night in case you use anything in your room. When asked why they couldn't just charge us for what we used instead of holding our money, they said their way was easier. Ridiculous. The clerk was unhelpful and really rude when I told her how she was saying \"charge you $130\" when she meant \"hold $130\" didn't mean the same thing. Anyway, our room was very nice and the tech was okay. We found that most of the programmable things in the room didn't work most of the time. Also the windows were DISGUSTING.

That said, I am not someone who comes to Vegas quarterly, like a lot of people who write these reviews. Having stayed at the Bellagio in the past, I was lured by a great rate at Aria and wanted to try something different. I have been pleased. The rooms are well appointed, and I agree with many postings that the beds are fantastic. This is not a themey sort of joint like every other hotel, and the rooms reflect a modern (if marginally bland) simplicity. I think the bathroom was also great; spacious with a great layout (the shower and soaking tub are enclosed together, separate from the vanity, and then the toliet is also in a third separate enclosure). Aria is totally billed-as-advertised re: the technology thing. You can control the whole room from the bathroom light to the curtains from the bedside table. Not really my thing but I knew what to expect. Restaurants are good and at appropriate price point. We were there for 3 nights, so we didn't have a chance to try that many places, but what we ate was good. Not the best-meal-of-my-life good, but good. A few random things that were annoying: Very poor AT&T reception, iPhone users beware. Also, a paucity of electrical outlets in the room, and those available were poorly placed, like right next to the door of the room. Also, the gym is in the Spa, and requires a $30 *daily* admission fee, which is a little steep for some weights and a treadmill. IF YOU LIKE THE BELLAGIO OR VENETIAN because the whole opulent theme thing appeals to you (and I think the Bellagio is great), know that Aria is not like that, but still very nice. You will not be disappointed. Maybe at the outset, this place was befallen by quirky service and unexpected engineering problems. I mean, it is a 4000 bed hotel.

The \"check in line\" was a mob of people pushing their way to the front, made worse by employees taking upwards of 45 minutes to check in each room! After 4 weeks of being open, the check-in desk employees were still sneaking under the desk to consult their handbooks. The high-tech room key system didn't work for us, as 4 different sets of keys failed to magnetize, leaving us sitting in the hall outside of our room as we waited 45 minutes for someone to come up and rescue us. It might have been quicker to stand in the check-in line again, given that even the replacement keys they sent up for us didn't work, as well. We were traveling with colleagues who had to change rooms multiple times, thanks to overwhelming odors, dirty rooms, double bookings, and broken a/c. One fellow traveler had so many room problems (including being given the key to a room that ALREADY HAD GUESTS IN IT!) that the Aria management finally gave up and moved him over to a room at the Bellagio. Other travelers noted dirty bathrooms, dirty sheets and pillows, and toiletries left over from previous guests. We were told by sources in the city (cab drivers, other hotel employees) that the average training for hotel employees is 4 weeks, and to save money Aria employees were only trained for 1.5 weeks. That would explain the concierge who couldn't tell us where a restaurant WITHIN THE HOTEL was located. We asked for a map, located it on the Promenade level one floor up, and asked \"Is there a quick way up to the 2nd floor? An escalator, perhaps?\" She also didn't know, and said she had no idea how to get to the 2nd floor. We gave up and went back to the guest room elevators. The one bright spot was our dinner at Sage. Delicious, luxurious, a great experience. Stay somewhere else but come to Sage for dinner. I would absolutely not go back to Aria or recommend it. Any new hotel will have some kinks to work out, but we didn't find the hotel staff or management nearly solicitous enough about the overwhelming, obnoxious, visit-ruining problems.

The last thing Las Vegas needed was another high end hotel (3 of them!) but such is life in a new economic reality. Got a killer deal on a room at Aria through MGM Mirage Player's club and wanted to check it out. This hotel breaks new ground with technology and feels very futuristic...almost like something from the Jetsons. Everything is controlled through a main bedside touch screen or through the very nice flat screen TV. There are manual overrides for just about everything but they can get you into trouble. I found the technology to be a bit annoying and by hitting certain buttons you turn off everything in the room and it takes a while to get it back on. Don't hit the \"goodnight\" button next to the bed or you'll turn off everything and I hit something on the control screen more than once that had the same effect. Very annoying but still cool \"gee-whiz\" technology. I can't imagine an elderly person liking this! I'm young and was annoyed. The room itself is nice with very comfortable beds. Rooms are smaller than I would have imagined but perfectly fine and have a cozy feel to them. In my opinion, the bathroom is the sorest spot. I did not like it at all. First, it echoes like you are in a symphony hall. It gets really annoying! The sink space is also limited and the water pressure for the sinks is only so-so. There's no bathroom exhaust fan either. The shower/tub design was odd to me and I did not like it. I prefer a separate shower and tub. I kept getting the tub wet by taking a shower. Showerhead is marginal...nothing special. With such a massive project, there are things that were overlooked and need to be addressed. For example, the bathroom door in the room slides and has a latch for locking, however, nobody ever drilled a hole for the latch so there was no way to lock the door. Also, the sliding door felt flimsy like it could fall off at any moment. A creepy complaint were the lights over the bed...they would make noises...almost like a popping sound. It was unnerving at times. I don't know what caused it... maybe the room was haunted? The casino at Aria caters to higher rollers and is a little dull. Restaurants are pricey but I found good value and delicious food at Skybox. Bar Moderno is also fantastic and has a great Purple Haze beer and is in a prime location for people watching. Another strange aspect of Aria is the self-parking garage. For some odd reason they have huge distances between parking spots and it is very deceptive. People are trying to park in \"non-existant\" spots and I could feel the frustration. It's almost too bizarre to explain.... what were they thinking??????? Overall, I enjoyed my stay at Aria but it is not my favorite hotel on the strip. I much prefer THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay. The ambiance, etc. is much better at MB.

This hotel has been open for less than a month and while it has everything a top-notch Vegas hotel should have, they haven't worked out some of the small details. The floor-to-ceiling windows were filthy and really impacted your view of the skyline in day light (you would think a hotel covered in so much glass would clean the glass). My other complaint with cleanliness was that the room was very, very dusty. The carpet near the a/c vent was actually stained/discolored from the dust that was blowing out on it. The tops of the furniture are covered in glass, which was cleaned, but you could see all the dust under the glass on top of the furniture - it just looked very tacky. Housekeeping was a let down too. The hotel boasts that it offers all rooms a \"turn down service\". This only happened two of the four nights I was there. The housekeeping crew also did not restock the toiletries every day, even when the product was empty and in the trash can. Finally, one of the robes (left hanging in the bathroom) was taken, perhaps to be cleaned or something but a replacement never showed up. The over all experience was good.

The hotel is beautiful and luxurious. They haven't worked out all the bugs yet as previous reviewers have stated such as the pool wouldn't be ready until 2 days later. The staff is very friendly and the hotel was very clean. Check-in was different. Hotels usually have 1 line for everyone but here there was a line for each check-in station like a grocery store. If you happen to stand beyond someone who has problems you may be waiting for awhile, but the hotel did have staff to redirect customers to other lines if one line was taking too long. We had a standard room, it was located at the end of the hallway. I suggest you find a room closer to the elevator as it was a pretty long walk. There are 4 hallways where your room can be so you have to pay attention whenever you get out of the elevator to make sure you don't go down the wrong way. The room was modern and had nice technological upgrades such as opening the curtins when you come in the door. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were soft. We didn't have many channels for the TV (I'm not sure how a previous reviewer stated there was over 600, unless he was in a better room). The only complaint I had about the room was the toilet paper was rough, the soap and shampoo either didn't have much in them or were previously used and there wasn't any simple amenitites such as plastic bags for laundry or pen and paper. I don't think they worked out all the kinks in valet parking as one time it was so crowded that we waited about 10 minutes in line to give our ticket and we were the 3rd people in line. They said it would take about 20 minutes once we gave the ticket to get our car, but it only took 5 minutes. The shopping center called Crystal had only a few stores open.

The Room: The room was beautiful. Towels and bedding were first class. Bathroom was exceptionally well designed. Blackout curtains were motorized and worked great. The architecture is alot more likely to stand the test of time, compared to most Las Vegas properties. The Food: The two restaurants we visited were average. Food was not a very godd value, but about what you would expect in Vegas. The Bad: The Concierge desk was severely understaffed. Long lines in the lobby and poor service over the phone. We also had a botched reservation and poor experience at HAZE, their dance club. Had reserved a table with bottle service over the internet. When we got to the club, they did not have our reservation and the only table they had left was a 3 bottle minimum, at $500 per bottle, in a poor location.

Fun people and great service at the DEUCE. Although, as you would expect for Casino drinks, the drinks were weak. The drinks you pay full price for should not be weak.

The television had about 600 television channels which made it impossible to flip through all the channels in one sitting. I cannot criticize anything in my room. The hotel is a casino so the lobby is all gambling and crowds. And the day after Christmas there were CROWDS. Every restaurant, coffee area, and other places serving food were crowded with LONG lines to get into them. And they did not provide any special shorter line for hotel residents.

Service people overall were very young and in greater need of managing. Everyone was very friendly. The bed was s-o-f-t, so if you like that, this is your place. I would have liked at least a slightly firmer mattress. Sheets were very nice, and I loved the towels. The final unacceptable aspect of the Aria was the not very hot shower. The hot water in the sink was plenty hot, but in the shower, it wasn't very hot, and the spray (the shower head couldn't be adjusted) was the quite cool. There's a lot of competition on the Strip now, especially in this down economy, so given time, most of these problems should be remedied.", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, not well managed just yet.\u201d", "Author": "TommyJames", "ReviewID": "UR53460059", "Content": "I stayed at the Aria during the Consumer Electronics Show.

The rooms are very dark so drop anything small and black on the floor and good luck finding it. The touch screens in the room are nice but you have to spend a little time learning how to use them. There is a lack of outlets in standard rooms (you'd think they would figure out that guests want an outlet near the bed by now for laptops and other \"appliances\"). The food in the cafe was above average and overall, I'd give the place above average marks.

This is a brand new hotel and it was nice having everything new!! From the moment we left the limo our bags were loaded onto a trolly and waited near checkin for us. Checkin was busy but we were swiftly dealt with and on our way. Cases were taken to our rooms and arrived 5 mins after i did, no probs. Our rooms were on the 21st floor and we did have to walk through Casino to get to elevators but this is no issue. Very pleased with room. Had a king room overlooking the Vdara hotel. Room is fully electronic, which may put some off, but using the bedside panel you can control the tv, temperature, lighting, curtains, room service, all at the touch of a button. Bed is very comfy and the 42\" LCD TV is a nice addition. Plenty of wardrobe and draw space. Bathroom is lovely with dual sinks, and a large shower big enough for 2 with a large oval bath next to it. Bathroom contains all toiletries needed. Two bath robes were also provided. Large minibar in the room, but be careful everything is monitored electronically using sensors, so if you just move something you'll be charged. Prices aren't cheap with bottled water setting you back $5, and the bag of crisps $8, but they are nice. Hotel boasts a superb fitness centre but is pricey at $30 per day, but this includes the SPA. Plenty of bars and restaurants, we only used the buffet for breakfast each day and for one evening meal, breakfast service and food was very good and the evening menu is also very good. Hotel staff were very friendly and the waitresses are all lovely, lots of oriental girls and very classy dressed. Room service was very efficient, and can be requested simply by pressing the service button in your room, or select privacy and they wont come near you!! Only issue i had was the safe didn't work and neither did my colleagues, he was given another room straight away, however i stuck with it, and left valuables and laptop in the room and didn't feel an issue with this, foolish maybe, but it wasn't a problem. Hotel Casino is good, all the required games, waitresses service very good, and table staff very helpful. Our flight was delayed so we extended our room with no issue, there was supposed to be a charge for this, but we werent charged which was a bonus. Location of the hotel is not the best, but is not really a problem. A free monorail runs to the Bellagio, and there is a covered walkway too which is actually quicker to use. Taxi rank is always available too, but either way you are going to be doing a lot of walking, it is Vegas!!

I have stayed on most of the hotels on the strip over a number of years. I know I booked online for 3 people however they indicated it was only 2 and therefore could not provide me 2 queen beds but rather one King. Although they were nice about it they were firm on not giving me what I requested. It didn't help that my printed receipt did not indicate the number of people I stated. I was promised a roll away bed at no charge but never received. The rooms are a lovely chocolate color but extremely small. The fridge is packed so you cannot put your own stuff and we had no safe in the room. I managed to work my remote just fine, the technology in the rooms was definitely a cool treat. The restroom was nice but not enough towels and the robes not so soft. I never came across a rude employee nor did I have issues with my key or housekeeping. We ate at Union restaurant & lounge where my steak was cooked perfectly and wine chilled to perfection. All was a true delight, not to mention so was Kaleo the server ;). The bed was a little too soft for my back I needed a little more firmness. The spa was nicely decorated but I've honestly had better massages. Haze nightclub has a great layout and spacious dance floor but cover & drink costs were not worth it. I was on the VIP list & truly have never paid cover at a club in Vegas before but $20 wasn't bad I guess. The security apologized about the delay but the line seemed to take forever to get moving. I tried several different bartenders but all my drinks tasted like a baby shower punch and had no effect whatsoever! So I believe they dilute their bottles. The DJ was not all that great either, I preferred the mixes at Tao. I also spent several hours on the casino floor and I have NEVER lost so much money in such a short amount of time! Perhaps it was a bad day for me but honestly I did not see any real winners around me as well. Overall, my stay was okay and not having smoke burn my eyes while in my room was the best! Especially in Vegas. However I was disappointed with the value vs. cost of this hotel. Believe me I have no problem forking out the funds for great value...I just didn't find it here.

Step into the bathroom and it sounded like the people were talking right in your very own bedroom! The bed was comfy but it was oddly slanted and then I noticed the box springs were broken. Hotel is less than a month old and already falling apart. Also, no coffee maker, robe, telephone book...just the normal things you'd expect to find. I didnt even see a bible in the room. Restaurants/Bars - Unless you are on an Uber budget, don't plan to eat at the hotel. A sandwich and a cup of coffee at their little \"fast food\" bakery will run you about $15. The lunch buffet is about the best bargain but do not go for the weekend brunch. Its a lack luster version of their breakfast mixed with the previous days left overs for a premium price. Same goes for dinner...its simply lunch with a premium price tag. The hotel lounges/bars tend to have some nice eye candy but expect to pay club level prices for drinks. Beers ran between $6-9 depending on the lounge. Staff - Walk in to find the front desk in chaos. There isn't a line...everyone just kind of piles in and hopes at some point they are able to rush to an open station before someone else. The staff that's there is helpful for the most part but I could care less after waiting for 45 minutes in line. Overall, I spent most of my 4 nights in this hotel trying to figure out how to leave.

The hotel does not have a typical themed Las Vegas look. If you are wanting floral carpet and ornate columns or lots of gimmicks, do not stay here. It decorated with a lot of neutral colors, and the casino is a little dark, but I think very pretty. The restaurants that we tried were all good, and the best one was Lemongrass (Thai.) The city tram that transports you to Bellagio was easy to use and worked well for us. The hotel was set back from the strip, so it creates a very beautiful entrance, but is a bit of a walk to the street. The location is great, in the very center of the strip. Crystals is the shopping mall on the property, and contains a few, very high end shops with more to come. There were three nice art galleries open on the property that we enjoyed browsing. The sports book is very large and comfy and has a nice casual restaurant next to it that also has tvs with sports. The staff was very friendly and the only wait we had was once at the concierge desk for about 10 to 15 minutes and a short wait at the coffee shop in the morning. The taxi line did get a bit long on the weekend. We were not greeted by bell staff when we arrived and were never offered help with our bags until we were leaving the hotel. We didn't need help or would have asked for it. The beds were fabulously comfortable and the bedside control system worked wonderfully for us. We loved the good night button next to the bed that shut everything off and closed drapes. I also loved the bedside temperature controls and the way the wake up system worked. Tvs were very nice. Bathroom was great but the pressure in the shower was a little weak. The room had two closets and very nice, large drawers. There was no easily accessible outlet by the bed. I had to charge my phone on the desk or in the bathroom. The in room safe in the bedside drawer was the best I had ever used.

Last year, I stayed at the Encore a few weeks after it opened, and loved it, so I figured I'd compare the two. I received an outstanding deal via Southwest that had an Aria room and flight included. As a result, I upgraded into the Corner Suite on the 29th flloor. The room and the view were fantastic! I know that a lot of people have had tech issues in the Standard rooms, so I cannot comment on those issues. The tech issues take a little bit of time to work out, but otherwise are very easy to navigate and are quite convenient. The room was quite large at 920 square feet and had fantastic floor to ceiling views in the bedroom, the little living room area and in the BATHROOM! The maid service was very good, and check-in was painless, as well. The amenities in this room were great (heated toilet seats), free internet, daily newspaper, etc... I didn't have any problems with keys, plumbing etc.. The casino and the hallways were quite dark, and lacked the \"elegance\" of the Encore. However, besides that it was great! The elevators were super fast and I NEVER waited more than 10 seconds for an elevator during my entire trip. The Sports Book was great also. I really liked that it didn't have the betting parlor feel. Also, the rooms were very quiet! Great job on soundproofing! At Encore, you could easily hear the conversations of your neighbors through the walls. The architecture was amazing throughout the property. We ate at Sirio during a very busy night. We all thought that the food was excellent.The service was above average, but not perfect. We also ate a few quite meals at the Sports Bar and I thought that the service was pretty good there, as well. I really liked the layout of the property. It was really easy to navigate around and didn't see TOO BIG like other places like MGM, Caesar's and even the Venetian. I had a car and the parking lot was a little bit of a walk, but not too bad. Parking was never a problem, really. There are always kinks to be worked at a new property, and I think that they heading in the right direction at Aria. Everyone was friendly and helpful, and I'd certainly recommend this property to others. All in all, I think it ranked right up there with my experience at Encore last year. i liked the \"elegant feel\" and the brightness of the Encore better, but I thought that my room was much better at Aria, and the service was a trade off at both places.

While extremely modern and urban in design, contrasting starkly with the themed character of most of the hotels on the strip, I must say I felt overwhelmed taking it all in. From the sculptures to the walls, ceilings, and even the floors, the surroundings inside the Aria is enough to take one's breath away. Unlike some here, I had no problems checking in or out or with anything not working in the room, and I have no complaints about the maid service. The rooms were very relaxing and comfortable. While many of the restaurants are pricey, I enjoyed some of the less expensive eats, including the buffet. The buffet was $20 and had a decent selection of food. Better than TI or the MGM but inferior to Bellagio and the Wynn. Only one complaint, but it's a big one. I like to play slot machines. I made a point of arriving the morning of the first Saturday it was open, December 19, and stayed for three nights on an internet offer of $149/night + $50 in gaming credits. While the new \"Sex And The City\" machines were a lot of fun and kept you going for quite some time, none of the other machines I tried (and I tried a lot of them) would pay off more than pennies on the dollar, if at all. I recall not too soon after the reincarnated MGM opened, back in 1995, there was a bank of new machines there called the \"Majestic Lions\" machines, and they were lit up like a Christmas tree with people standing in line to play them because they were paying out $200, $300 and $1,000+ jackpots continuously. People traveled to stay at the MGM from all over the planet just to play those machines. The phenomenon lasted for about 10 years, before they tightened up the payouts and the crowds of gamblers disappeared, now replaced with roving packs of very noisy young partiers who can't hold their liquor. What I can't fathom is that although MGM management was smart enough to know that good paying machines draw crowds and keep the hotel rooms full from 1995 to 2005, apparently whoever's in charge of the casino at the MGM-owned Aria never learned that lesson. And this is tragic. Because Vegas has been going through an enormous economic slump, worse than the rest of the country, for the past couple of years, the City Center billed itself as a means of pulling Vegas back into prosperity. Sadly, that simply cannot happen with a brand new cavernous casino full of slot machines that are tighter than a badly rusted water faucet. Such a shame. I'd hate to see it go under and start dragging the rest of Vegas with it. So next trip to Vegas I'll go back to staying at the Palazzo where the basic suite is 720 square feet, everything is new and beautiful, and where there are enough slot machines that pay out well enough to keep you going for days. Plus the rooms are comped due to my very enjoyable play there.

We are travellers who try go with the flow and make the best of any situation rather than let things ruin our hard earned vacations. Check in was easy, had to wait for just one person in front of us. While our booked rate was good, we had to get our incentives through the Players Club and make a few phone calls at check out. Staff had a few problems coding our keys, so it took a few tries. I laughed and joked with the staff, talked about their growing pains and how their guests have been. Asked for a high floor. We received floor 53- a lovely view of the strip and Planet Hollywood. You can actually see the back view of the hotel at the end of each floor- would have been much better to have a back view of the mountains, Orleans, Palms, etc but we were still happy. The rooms were beautiful. When you walk in the room there are two closets. When you open each a light turns on. In the closet, there are suitcase racks in each. Loved this feature as you didn' t have open messy suitcases all over the room. (dont usually unpack much for such a short stay). The bathrooms were beautiful, lots of towels, and many fresh towels throughout our stay. Loved the shower/tub set up. No problems with water heat or pressure. On several of the reviews people mention toilets slow to flush. We found them to be no different than our low flow toilets at home. Loved the double sinks in the bathroom. There is only about 1 1/2 feet of counter space between the sinks, but there is a large drawer to put all your toiletries in so you don't have to use the counter. We had no problems with the room technology, loved it actually. The best part of the room was the bed. I could have stayed in bed the whole time we were there. It was loaded with pillows and light and airy bedding. Sheets could have been a little softer, but they were still great. Rooms were still clean, with some construction dust & muck in places. Having recently moved into a new house, we know not all is always sparkly and shiny and it is easy to miss the little areas still to be cleaned. We had read the reviews about long waits for valet. My husband would always go down a few minutes before and we never really had to wait more than 10 minutes. This resort is very expensive. Bottled water at the gift shop, $6. We ordered 2 coffees and two danishes from the Coffee Bean and it was $17. The only meal we had there was breakfast room service. Service was excellent and our breakfast arrived within 20 mins of ordering. Coffee was great, my husband's french toast was wonderful. I had egs benedict which was very tasty, but a little bit cold. Meal was $50. We didn't eat anywhere else in the resort as the reviews on food hadn't been too good. We found it a very long walk through Crystals to get to the strip. Once you were outside, it was a long walk to the pedway to cross to Planet Hollywood with many staircases. I would imagine there are future plans to have escalators. Just before we left we found it was very quick, simple walk to get to the Monte Carlo- which might be the better way to go. Would we stay there again?

I had read several reviews about the Aria, some poor and some mixed, so I was a bit worried about how my stay would turn out. Fortunately, I had a very nice visit. It appears as though the hotel is trying very hard to work the kinks out, and in my opinion they are making very good progress. You don\u2019t have to drive on the Strip to reach the Aria. From the airport have your taxi driver head west on Tropicana, then take a right at Koval and then a left at Harmon. Harmon crosses the Strip into City Center. The pleasant episodes started right away. I arrived at the Aria at noon on Sunday. I was second in the check-in line when an employee walked up and escorted me to an open line at the station reserved for guests of the casino. I checked in and went to my room right away even though the official check-in wasn\u2019t until 3:00. You have to walk through the casino to get to the guest elevators, but the walkways are wide enough to accommodate large crowds. Smoke in the casino wasn\u2019t too bad, but maybe that\u2019s because there weren\u2019t too many people playing when I was there. The casino is darker than most, as others have already noted. The dealers were very friendly. Security guards are present at all times to ensure that only guests showing room keys are permitted on the guest elevators. I was assigned a room on the 53rd floor, facing westward. Actually, it really wasn\u2019t the 53rd floor because the elevator button for the 50th floor was right next to the 39th. (BTW, I never had to wait very long for an elevator, but there were a couple of \u2018ghost floor\u2019 episodes where two buttons lit up even though I only touched one button.) While walking to my room I passed a room with a working ice machine. My room key worked perfectly throughout the trip. I lightly tapped the room key on the sensor and heard the door unlock (no sliding the key in and out). Several things happened when I opened the door for the first time: the curtains opened, the lights came on, the 42\u201d flatscreen TV turned on and displayed my name on the monitor, and the TV speakers filled the room with pleasant, upbeat music. I turned the music off, expecting to hear traffic noise from I-15. But to my surprise the room was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable! All room controls are accessible with a master touchscreen monitor on the nightstand. It takes some getting used to, so be patient. Once the TV is on, however, you can use its remote to navigate \u2013 it\u2019s easier than the master panel \u2013 but keep in mind that there is about a one-second delay between pressing the remote and seeing the change take place on the TV. With two closets and plenty of hangars, there was easily enough space for a week\u2019s worth of clothes. The in-room safe, which is located in the nightstand, was large enough for my 14\u201d laptop but not deep enough for my mini-DV camcorder. Service prices are high like the other strip hotels \u2013 $13 for a hamburger on the room service menu, $15/day for internet in the room, $1/minute to use a computer in the business center (15-minute minimum), $4 for a 12-ounce can of soda in the minibar, etc. Speaking of the minibar, the minibar is touch sensitive \u2013 if you accidentally take something out of its place you have about 45 seconds to put it back or you will be charged. There is no extra room in the minibar\u2019s refrigerator for personal items, so use the ice bucket supplied in the room. (Sorry, but I didn\u2019t find out if the Aria charged a resort fee to use the health club.) The bathroom in my room did have an electrical outlet. I found it between the sinks behind the Kleenex box. And yes you do have to step through the shower to get to the tub, so I stood in the tub while waiting for hot water to reach the shower (didn\u2019t take long). The shower head and bathroom mirrors were tall enough for me (I\u2019m 6\u2019 3\u201d). The shower head is one of those non-adjustable water-saving types, so not much water comes out and it will take you longer than usual to rinse the shampoo out of your hair. Housekeeping was OK in that my room was all prepared. On the second day they took the used bath mat and did not leave me a new one. On the third day they took the trash can out of the toilet area. They never emptied the melted water in the ice bucket. The housekeepers were friendly, just like the casino employees, especially if you spoke Spanish. I\u2019m not a gourmet eater, so I never tried the Aria\u2019s restaurants or buffet. A CVS pharmacy (open 24/7) is a short walk away, and they have a small but decent selection of snacks and groceries. I bought orange juice and yogurt, brought them to the room, and kept them cold in the ice bucket. Also, several fast-food and mid-priced family restaurants are just across the street. The day before check-out I visited the Aria\u2019s business center, where they printed my boarding passes for free. When catching a cab to the airport, note that the taxi pick-up point is a couple hundred feet from the drop-off point. A sign will show you the way. Many employees asked me if I was enjoying my stay. This was a minor annoyance, but I suspect they\u2019re being prompted my management because of all of the trouble they had after opening less than a month ago. Other minor annoyances about the room include no business stationary, no coffee pot, and no phone book. The Aria does not have much for the kids \u2013 a small video arcade, swimming pools and a good ice cream shop. If you like brown you\u2019ll love this hotel \u2013 brown is everywhere! I think the Aria is putting more emphasis on upscale chic with high tech and less emphasis on elegance. So I wouldn\u2019t call it a five-star. I wouldn\u2019t mind staying here again, but I like the elegance of other five-star hotels on the Strip. All in all, though, I enjoyed my stay there.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cDon't go!!!\u201d", "Author": "Juanpedrom", "ReviewID": "UR52777144", "Content": "I stayed there for three nights on January and had really high hopes and expectations as the hotel was brand new.

The staff was hillarious, when we called to report the dirty robe and linens the reply we got was \"but the towels were ok, weren\u00b4t they\". Distant apologies but lacked \"customer service\".

Five star is sooo much more than a pretty building or IT gadgetry - it starts and ends with service which is less than non-existent at Aria. I stayed over New Years from 12/30/09 to 1/3/10, solo woman traveler. Will add pics later; wanted to get a review up as quickly as possible since the place is new with a quick Aria vs. Encore comparison. Drop-off/check-in: The Gray Line shuttle that I booked as part of the Orbitz package drops you off at the back of the hotel, kind of like supplies being dropped off at a loading dock. A bellman met the shuttle bus, greeted me, took my suitcase and told me to call down once I got to my room. Check-in was fine at 11:45 p.m. The staff seem like kids practicing their manners instead of polished professionals like at Encore. I asked for a high floor with a strip view. The young lady told me I'd be happy with the view. Room #1: I get to room 26161. The room is on the back side of the building facing the front of Vdara with a view of Palms. After calling down about my bags, I scoped out the room and took some photos. The floor had small light-colored mud spots. I noticed that the door didn't close all the way behind me so I shut it. A rushing, wind-tunnel noise ensued, perhaps due to the concavity in building design and the fact that this room is in the center of the curve. I wasn't about to deal with lack of sleep due to wind noise, so I knew a room change was in order. However, 45 minutes after getting to the room, my bags still hadn't arrived. I called the bell desk and they suggested I COME GET MY OWN BAG as they were backed up. (HUH?? AM I AT MOTEL 6???) It was at 12:45 a.m. and I was tired due to a long flight from D.C. with flight delays, so I sucked it up. Once I got downstairs, I was told that I couldn't get the bag myself as luggage is stored downstairs, so I could wait downstairs at the bell desk or in the casino, or return to my room and wait. I told them that I would be changing rooms first and call back to let them know to which which room to deliver the bag. Room change: The 2nd front desk person is a man who asks me, \"Is the noise really that loud?\" (HUH?? I WALKED DOWN TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT, DIDN'T I???) He gives me keys to room 26106 after complain about the boring Vdara/Palms view. He tells me that the keys to the old room should work but if not, to use one of the hallway house phones to call security. I got nervous about that having read a previous reviewer's comments about being told to call security and waiting in the hall for an hour. I was able to get in the old room, grab my stuff and head down the hall to the new room. Hair, hair, everywhere: I scope the new room, check out my strip view, then turn down the bed spread and sheets. There is HAIR, long HAIR in the sheets. There is also hair in the felt/velour headboard. This must be a popular room because the hotel has only been open 2 weeks but there are at least 2 different hair types - brunette hair in the sheets and red hair in the head board. Hey, at least they weren't curlies, right? No, that was in the BATHROOM. Okay, only 1 curly, the rest were more long brunette hairs. I called down to housekeeping. They said they would send someone right up. By 1:45 a.m. when my bag finally arrived to my room, I finally just said screw it as I was exhausted. The other side of the bed was hair free, so I curled up on that side and slept as still as possible for the night - yes folks, I slept in a bed with other people's hair in the sheets at this TOUTED 5-STAR HOTEL. The next morning when I went to flush the toilet, a synchronized fountain event happened - water bubbled up the drains of both sinks. The toilet also backed up and water filled to the bowl's brim. I called for plumbing. Housekeeping was making their rounds, so I snagged a maid and showed her all the hair and explained that all the sheets and pillowcases needed to be changed. Meanwhile, I had tried to no avail to get my iPod going using their \"state-of-the-art\" control panel. I had a team in the room - 2 plumbers, 1 maid, and an IT gal. I had actually asked if the plumbers could come in 2 hours so I could get dressed. They came in 30 minutes - maybe the secret prompt service at Aria is use reverse psychology. The hotel management knows that the plumbing problem is property wide, and according to staff, management/ownership believes that sabotage may have occurred during the building process as plumbers have been finding grout when they have snaked the toilets. It took the plumbers 2 hours to snake my toilet, and at one point they thought they might have to disassemble the toilet. The maid was doing her thing. No wonder the carpets are already spotted - they have these cheap vacuum cleaners that look like a toy you'd give a girl at Christmas, only old. And this is at a place that's been open 2 weeks. The IT lady admitted that clicking the TV's connectivity icon is supposed to make the control panel recognize that there is something connected, but neither the iPod connection nor the USB connection work and management/ownership realizes that they spent $X-million for these features that don't work and will never work. The work-around is to just use a simple audio plug from any Radio Shack, Best Buy, etc. and plug your iPod into their system. I called the front desk to suggest that they make all front desk staff aware of this non-functionality to prevent guests from waiting 1-1/2 hours for IT to show up as I had done. I asked for free Internet for the duration of my stay because of this, and they obliged. I had to call down to the front desk every day once the 24 hours was up so they could renew it. The New Year's Eve party at Gold Lounge was nice with Cirque performers doing acrobatics on the bars and open bar 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. No organized champagne toast, just a sudden 10!...9!...8!...while you were mid-sentence, unaware that the hour had come. I tried to get into Club Haze Saturday night after talking with concierge desk staff Friday and Saturday about what was happening club wise. I was told guest DJ David Guetta was spinning Saturday, cover $100 guys, $20 ladies. Not once did any concierge staff mention that I should or even could purchase an advance ticket, much less offer to make the arrangement. I got to the club at 1 a.m. after a night at the poker tables and the line was backed up to the escalator. I explained to one of the bouncers that I was a hotel guest and concierge didn't suggest or even state that I could buy in advance and asked if there was a way to pay extra money for fast entry. I was told I was out of luck and that actually the club is separate from Aria even though it is inside the building and I would have to wait like anyone else. I headed back up the escalator to the poker room. Checkout/leaving: check-out went quickly. As promised, there were no room charges for Internet. Leaving: walked out to the semi-circle where a door man was standing. Asked about cabs and he pointed to the other end of the semi-circle and said I had to walk over to the cab station. (HUH?? You can't radio/motion/whistle/holler for a cab for me??) Had I not been very close to missing check-in time for my flight, I would have voiced my parenthetical question but I didn't have 5 minutes to have the conversation. I drag 50-pound suitcase, guitar, and carry-on bag around the semi-circle in front of the Mandarin to get in a cab. SUMMARY I think I'll stop here as I've painted a thorough enough picture of how Aria's lack of readiness, cleanliness polish, service.... Here's an overall summary: Rooms: Pros - nice neutral decor, panoramic windows. Cons: DIRTY (for 2 weeks old). DARK. Myriad towels but only 2 washcloths. Never could get the fridge/wet bar code to work. Bar with the usual overpriced fare but also a technology pack for $20 with an assortment of cords for computer and iPod in case you forgot your own. Technology: Roll the dice as to what will work in your room. This was an important feature for me. I'm a technical writer and so my work is very portable. Another guest laughed that nothing worked in their room - the curtains, the lighting. I was fortunate and both the bedside control screen as well as the TV remote control worked fine; the iPod and USB issue was the only thing that affected me. Food: Restaurants were overpriced - didn't eat at any. Elements gift shop has beer for $4-6 dollars if you don't want to pay $7 from the wet bar (but oh yeah, mine didn't work). Pool: Didn't check it out as it was closed. Service: Non-existent. Run by newbies who are like high-schoolers working a part-time after school restaurant or retail job. I heard another guest extoll in a thick Jersey Shore accent: \"This place is a friggin joke...I ain't never comin' back!\" The Philly girl in me whole-heartedly agreed - that's right East Coast, represent! LOL. Poker room: NICE. Roomy, good drink service, chips brought to you, friendly staff. One or two have complained about the noise as it's right on the edge of the main floor. Wasn't a distraction for me. Location: Great. Too bad the hotel is despicable in every other aspect besides the poker room. Shame, because it's in the thick of things on the strip where I like to be. If all I cared about were location, I stay across the street at Planet Hollywood (another \"never again\" - stayed twice and both times was given 6th floor view of ventilation system for 1st room - even with the \"$20 sandwich\" and many staff are rude). VERDICT: - I will never stay at Aria again. - Encore vs. Aria: ENCORE. I stayed at Encore over Inauguration weekend to get away from the D.C. madness and it was PHENOMENAL. I'll deal with the small time drain of strip traffic and the stuffy Deuce or a pricey cab to get to the places I want to go. Encore's rooms are superior in size, polish, and comfort with brightness and mirrors galore. The staff are PHENOMENAL. From the moment my daughter and I checked in at Encore, staff made us feel like royalty. The employees there have a quiet confidence about them that isn't cocky; rather, it makes you feel like they know they have the best establishment and are ready to show you just how good it is. I'm ready for them to show me again, especially if it happens to be a romantic excursion (do NOT pick Aria if you're in wooing mode - nothing ruins romance like being ticked off having to complain). Anywhoo, that's where I'll be next trip so if you see me at Encore, holla atcha girl LOL.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cAll Technology , NEW EDGE, NOT GOOD\u201d", "Author": "SherryLee15", "ReviewID": "UR52666605", "Content": "My husband and I come to Las Vegas after Christmas every year.

We were going to Vegas for Christmas anyway, but we got a fantastic deal on flights and hotel, hence why we decided to stay at the newest hotel on the strip! I don\u2019t regret staying at the Aria because it\u2019s nice to stay somewhere that\u2019s all new and sparkling, but given my time over again I\u2019d probably wait a year or so and that\u2019s what I\u2019d recommend if anyone were to ask me whether they should stay there or not? We expected teething problems; after all, it\u2019s a multi billion pound resort with thousands of rooms, with everything new to everyone, staff included, so anyone visiting shouldn\u2019t expect everything to be flawless. CHECK-IN - When we arrived on Christmas Day, the computer systems were down (something that can happen in any hotel at any time, so I was appalled at the attitude of guests towards the check-in staff, this wasn\u2019t their fault and they moved as fast as they could at a busy time). What I couldn\u2019t accept was the inadequate training the staff had obviously received. We never take credit cards to Vegas (for obvious reasons), paying our hotel bill up front through Expedia or Travelocity. We have been to Vegas six times previously and not once have we been asked to leave credit card details at check-in for \u2018incidentals\u2019. This time the lady on check-in told us that if we weren\u2019t prepared to leave credit card details then we would have to leave a deposit of $130 per day!!! We know exactly what each dollar is for when we bring our money to Vegas and we have a certain amount for gambling, a certain amount for food and a certain amount for shows etc, to take any money off us would have messed all this up! Anyway, after a small argument the check-in lady brought across her manager who immediately stated that this was incorrect and that we didn\u2019t have to pay anything, all extras would just be deactivated from our room i.e. we wouldn\u2019t be able to choose \u2018pay-per-view movies\u2019 or pay for internet access etc. All fine by us, you don\u2019t come to Vegas to watch TV! What did annoy me is that whilst we were checking in (which took us over an hour) all the managers were just standing back and watching their staff mess things up. Perhaps if they were training them properly in the first place, there would have been fewer arguments at check-in, meaning fewer mistakes to clear up! ROOMS - Once we were finally checked in, we found our room pretty easily, through the casino to the guest elevators which is pretty standard in most Vegas hotels. Our key card worked first time and we didn\u2019t have any problems with this throughout the duration of our stay. The room itself was fine. In my opinion, nothing special, the king size bed was standard size for Vegas, although the room itself was fairly small, definitely not as large as the room we had at the Mirage, earlier in the year. The technology was pretty hi-tec but an idiot\u2019s guide on how to work it would have been helpful, if you pressed the wrong buttons you found yourself in complete darkness with the curtains closed! If you wanted to attach your ipod to the TV, then you had to purchase the accessories kit, whereas at the Mirage they have an ipod docking station which you can use for free! The bath and shower were fine and with reference to what someone previously stated, the shower is more than powerful enough! What did surprise me was that for a hotel which is supposed to be \u2018green\u2019, there is no plug for the sinks, so when my husband had a shave he just had to leave the water running \u2013 an oversight??!! I agree that there are not enough electrical sockets in the rooms, the only ones I could find (apart from the two in the bathroom which were inconveniently positioned) were two by the door. Housekeeping left a lot to be desired, for a hotel that had only been open for nine days, I expected everything to be immaculate. However, I found black hairs on the side of the bath and on the toilet floor, plaster dust in the entrance hall, which was still there the day we left and dried in concrete/cement in the carpets! Being fully booked is no excuse for poor housekeeping! Just an aside, when we first got into the room we couldn\u2019t find the safe which I was beginning to get angry about until I discovered it in the nightstand in the lower drawer! FOOD \u2013 I can only comment on the buffet, Cafe Vettro and Jean Philippe\u2019s patisserie as we didn\u2019t dine anywhere else within the hotel. We used the buffet twice for brunch and found it more than satisfactory. Although not the Bellagio standards, there was more than enough choice to fill us up and keep us going until evening. Cafe Vettro is poor. They are trying to be more than they are and are trying to create upper class dining which isn\u2019t working. In my opinion they should stick to what their name states and just serve cafe food instead of trying to be pretentious! Even in cheap and cheerful eateries, plates aren\u2019t cleared until everyone has finished eating but here my husband\u2019s plate was taken away before I was even half way through my meal\u2013 the height of bad manners and again this comes down to a training issue. The menu is limited, in fact there was only one thing on the whole menu that I wanted and I\u2019m not a fussy eater so we could only eat there once! We were seated down a ramp overlooking the walkway to the Vdara and it was freezing cold, if they want to keep their customers they need to do something about the heating! Jean Philippe\u2019s patisserie was to die for, I tried the ham and cheese croissant one morning, which was delicious, as was the cherry danish and the ice cream (gelato). Definitely worth a try. There needs to be a few more casual eating places within the City Center complex, saving you having to walk out onto the strip if you don\u2019t want to pay $50 for a meal! CASINO \u2013 I actually enjoyed playing the slots in the casino and found them quite \u2018friendly\u2019. I won $1000 in my first hour of playing there! The only thing I found was that considering all the reviews stating that smoke will be drawn down into filters at the base of slot machines, I went back to my room each night reeking of cigarette smoke! Even my husband who is a smoker, complained about the smell of stale cigarette smoke each morning in the casino and this is something I have never experienced in any other casino on the strip. The casino is definitely smaller than many others on the strip but because of this appears friendlier and it doesn\u2019t take long to be able to find your way around. There was never a lack of cocktail waitresses asking if you needed a drink, although the strawberry daiquiri\u2019s which we both became addicted to varied depending on who made them. Sometimes they were creamy and out of this world but at other times it was just like eating coloured ice, with no flavour! SHOWS \u2013 We planned to use our Christmas money to book and see the Elvis show and it was money well spent. I\u2019m not an Elvis fan but everyone recognises the music and we both loved it. No so much Cirque stuff as some of the other shows and a lot more singing and dancing but great fun and well put together. They are still previewing the show so expect a few basic errors but this is what previews are for and this is why you pay the discounted price. Definitely recommend it and we are now planning a trip to Graceland! The whole City Center is not finished and from what I\u2019ve heard they had to rush to open it so that they could begin making money and you can tell! There is no colour anywhere on the outside, just a lot of concrete and if that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to stay then I\u2019m not impressed! Aria is set a long way back from the strip and we found it was a lot quicker to nip out of the North Valet entrance, along to Vdara and up the walkway to Bellagio and was also quicker than waiting for the tram. The Crystals is nowhere near finished and my first impressions were \u2018what a waste of space\u2019! So overall, would I stay at Aria again? Yes, definitely, but will I? Probably not for a long time. If there weren\u2019t so many other hotels in Vegas that I hadn\u2019t stayed at then, yes, I\u2019d definitely stay at Aria but I want to stay at Wynn, Encore, Bellagio, Venetian and Mandalay Bay so that will cover a few more years!!!", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel but will not go again.\u201d", "Author": "VancouverC63", "ReviewID": "UR52512607", "Content": "I was there on Christmas Day.

Our room was small, and on entering the lobby part the floor was covered in builders debris and dust, no coathangers in wardrobe a call to House keeping sorted these points out. We were surprised at how small the bathroom was with very little counter space for any products and a badly placed electrical socket.

This hotel still has a lot of bugs to work out. It will probably take up to 6 months to a year before the hotel runs without major issues. What\u2019s a major issue? How about computers going down and the telephone not working? The Entertainment Guide was empty. Staff at check-in were professional, helpful and polite. Bell desk was also really good. Room had a very large flat panel that generated lot of heat. This was very close to the thermostat. The result was a chilly room that I had to keep adjusting the temperature. At one point, I had to set it at 82 degrees to get the room to feel like 72 degrees. On a brighter note, the hotel that has extensive cable TV options as well as Hi Def. One of the few hotels with Hi Def on the strip. Others have the monitors, but few pay for the cable signal. The bed was a feather-top and oh so very comfortable.

We could have stayed in the room the whole time and it would have been worth it! A beautiful flat screen TV with all High Definition channels. The bathroom has a separate shower and soaking tub! Setting the computer controls for the TV, curtains and lighting took a few minutes to figure out but it was pretty easy. WiFi was 15 dollar daily rate. We happily skipped this fee and were free of email for three days! The casino was easily the nicest I've seen in Vegas as you could actually see the light of day! We also rarely smelled cigarette/cigar smoke that we knew surrounded us and did not smell like smoke when we returned to the room. We did wait in line to check in, but it only took about 20 minutes and for the thee days we never saw more than 3 people in line. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I particularly enjoyed the Sports Book with its very intimate layout and low keyed atmosphere. The cocktail waitresses kept the drinks flowing in the litle time we spent in the casino. We had two outstanding dinners at the Italian Sirio and American Fish. At Sirio, my wife had the ravioli and I ordered the Shrimp Gnocchi. While the ravioli was good, the gnocchi was the best I've had. Very tender and smaller pieces than normal. The staff was super friendly and took time to chat with us. They really seemed excited to be there. The same was true of American Fish. My wife had steak and I had rock salt baked scallops. The waiter took my on a tour of the kitchen and explained how they grill the scallops in the salt. The dinners were about $120 including tip. Not too bad. We did have sticker shock at the $64 buffet and turned around and hit the street as we could see a McDonald's on the strip across from the Casino! We then found some great breakfast/lunch deals on the strip and decided that in the mornings we'd hit the strip for cheap food and drinks, and spend out money on the fine restaurants in the Casino.

No matter what kind of food you are in the mood for, most likely there is a place that will satisfy your craving. 2) The whole \u201curban center thing\u201d is pretty cool. Granted, it isn\u2019t the real NY, but what it aims to be is quite interesting, and definitely worth a look at, even if you don\u2019t stay here. 3) The rooms are very high-tech, so if you\u2019re someone who values staying a place where one control can run your entire stay, this isn\u2019t a bad choice. Huh?: 1) The rooms are pretty small by Vegas high end standards (Encore rooms are 750 sqft, these are 520). This can become an issue, especially if a group would like to share a room. 2) That high-tech control panel thing is a better idea on paper than in reality. Frankly, I can pull my own curtains, so flipping through four menu pages to get the job done doesn\u2019t interest me that much. 3) The mini-bar has a \u201ctechnology kit\u201d they sell for $20 that includes an Ethernet cable and an iPod docking cable. Hysterically, they list it as a \u201csouvenir,\u201d so all of you that are wondering what to get your friends from Vegas \u2013 how about an internet cable? 4) The spa is massive, but not that relaxing. For example, there are four whirlpools, but all of them are the same temperature. The steam room \u2013 barely steamy. The sauna, half broken (after two weeks). In addition, there are zero robe hooks throughout the men\u2019s locker room, so you are forced to walk in a towel and leave your robe in the locker. Though these are relatively petty points, they are several of many (and who wants to deal with these kinds of things in a Vegas spa when there are so many nice ones out there). 5) Though the hotel is brand new, the carpets don\u2019t look that clean in the rooms. This may be due to their color (a dark brown) that isn\u2019t that forgiving, but in any respect, not what you\u2019d love to see in a hotel room. In sum, Aria isn\u2019t bad, but there are probably nicer places to stay in Vegas for the same money.

I called Concierge and they said they'd call some engineers to look at the issue. No one showed up for 2 hours so I gave up and just went down to the front desk to complain. Got moved to a second room but this time the air conditioner didn't work! Again no one answered when I called front desk so I had to go down in person. Front desk said they would call facilities but didn't have give a time frame. Considering it was around bed time and no one showed up for 2 hours to fix the fire alarm.. I didn't expect the air conditioner to be fixed any time soon, so I requested for another room. Finally everything in the room worked. Around midnight I called housekeeping (pushed the housekeeping button on the phone) for slippers. Housekeeping said they didn't know how long it would take because they couldn't contact anyone in housekeeping..whatever that meant! They also said that if no one answered the door that they would leave the stuff I requested at the door. Anyway.. again 2 hrs pass and nothing and by then I was asleep. Next thing I know, I get a call and am told that someone is outside with my slippers! First off, I was told they'd leave the slippers outside. Secondly, I had the Privacy light on my door. I couldn't believe it! Front desk is a pain to talk to since they don't answer the phones, and it takes forever just waiting in line to talk to one of them. Overall the rooms did look nice and modern. The \"smart rooms\" are nice to have but it's definitely slow.. especially when controlling things through the TV. The casino area was a little too dark for me and I prefer the casino area of the Bellagio. As for the food, Sage was a pretty decent place to eat. The servers were friendly and courteous. Cafe Vettro had horrible food and slow service. Jean Philippe's was great. I love their gelato. So definitely lots of things still need to be worked out on the hotel side. When the bell hops asked how my stay was, I told them what I've been through and none of them seemed surprised.. as if they've heard a similar story plenty of times in the past 2 weeks. I say give it a couple more months or maybe next year before giving Aria a try.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful ambiance and attention to detail\u201d", "Author": "Bluskyla", "ReviewID": "UR52140671", "Content": "We stayed at the Aria Christmas night. This hotel seems to be a great one to stay at, but the entire time we were there, the computers were plagued with problems. I would give it 4-6 months before I would stay there again. We waited to check in for 1 hour because there was only one printer working for 15 check in stations. The rooms were amazing and we figured that would override the long wait to check in. To our dismay, the touch screen operation of the entire room would not open the curtains. The rooms are entirely controlled by computer, this includes temperature, curtains, TV, lighting and sound as well as the privacy settings. Everything worked by the curtains. It was an amazing view after we lifted them and climbed in behind them. While sitting in the room, the computer would randomly change the lighting pattern. That night when we crawled into bed, it was by far the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. As you slid in, it was almost as if the bed just surrounded you and hugged you into it. Also, when in the elevators, randomly certain floors would light up and then the elevator stop at those floors as if a ghost had pressed the button. We were able to wander around the hotel, and it is really beautiful. There was great attention to detail taken for many parts of it. We also did try the buffet, which I would rate up there with Bellagio and Mirage. All in all, the stay turned out to be really comfortable. The staff was really excellent and seemed to roll with all the punches the computers could dish out. I would stay there again!", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cAn Absolute Disaster....\u201d", "Author": "Casablancalily99", "ReviewID": "UR52121807", "Content": "Aria was clearly not ready for prime-time.....we are frequent travelers to Las Vegas and stay at Bellagio, THE Hotel, etc. We arrived Christmas Day for what we had planned to be a three-night stay. We checked out after one night! NOTHING worked. It took an hour to check in and get our room, which caused us to pass on dinner so we could make it on time to the Elvis show. After the show, we selected the sushi restaurant, BarMasa, in the hotel. The restaurant was freezing cold; I had to go back up to my room to put on my long winter coat in order to dine. Guests were shivering and the management simply said - yes, it was cold in here yesterday too. (Why not fixed then?) Very overpriced menu for fine - not great, not imaginative, and not generous - sushi. Up in the room, we discovered that the extremely loud bathroom exhaust fan would not turn off. It is by now 10:30 pm. After being placed on hold and passed around at the front desk, no one could give advice on how to fix this problem. Finally they offered to send up Maintenance, which we declined, saying it was too late and we were just going to go to bed. We explicity said DO NOT send anyone. At 1:30 am, after being fast asleep for two and a half hours, there is pounding at our door. Two maintenance workers who had JUST received the repair call at 1:30 am! We sent them away. Next morning, as we prepared to order room service breakfast, none of the three phones in the room functioned. I had to use my cell phone to call the reservations line and get to a person at the front desk who told me that the entire hotel's phone system was down for more than an hour, but they \"were working on it\". We checked out and moved to the lovely, well-functioning , brand new Rush Tower at the Golden Nugget and salvaged our vacation. Incidentally, as we were checking out, the party in front of us in line were also complaining because their toilet would not stop flushing all night (!?!?) Clearly, Aria rushed to open in order to get the holiday business and satisfy debt-holders and stockholders. Systems were not checked, redundancy systems were not in place, and basic levels of service could not be ensured.

Staff is still trying to learn computer systems and there does not appear to have been any upstaffing for the learning curve.

Buffet - joke - more like what you get offstrip than other major properties Spa - gym was fine but locker room lacks any attendants. They stay at the front desk and don't check in the back to offer service. Room Service - slow and way overpriced for what is delivered. Room computer - come on - $20 for a serial computer cable plus cost of service. Of course during my stay the room internet was not working so blew that $20. Staff spend all day telling me someone was coming to fix it only to find out 5 hours later that it was hotel wide Room electronic control is wired with cable so short you cannot lift it off the night stand Room elevators are all bunched into one hallway so security can pretend to see keys. massive conjestion the way they designed this area forcing people into each other to get through because there was no open area designed to wait on others.

Check-in was an ordeal, as they did not provide any line markers, so people were wandering in and cutting people off inadvertantly, as you couldn't really tell where the line was. We got up to our room and within 2 minutes had hotel security at our door telling us that we had to leave immediately as someone else had booked our room for the night. (Not exactly a nice start) We ate dinner at Julian Serrano and had a wonderful time - - great staff and great food! (We considered going to the Thai place but found it to be very expensive) The next morning, housekeeping was knocking on our door shortly after 9:00, despite our \"privacy please\" light being on. We stopped for breakfast at the Jean Philippe patisserie which was overpriced and the service was terrible. It took at least 10 minutes to get 2 lattes and one pastry, and even then they gave us a different pastry than the one we ordered! Concierge was hit and miss - - one woman (Barbara) was amazing and booked 5 things for us while my wife talked to another woman who took 15 minutes to print off one map. Self parking was clearly marked but one night they had staff blocking it off and pointing everyone to valet (causing a huge backup). We did a U turn and went into self parking anyway and found tons of spots - no idea why they were blocking it off. Our room was not cleaned at all one day, another day they only gave us one bath towel. When my wife called to ask for another, they said \"Oh so you want a second towel??\" like she was asking for something unreasonable. We only got turndown service one night, which was disappointing as at Caesar's and Bellagio the housekeeping service was marvelous. At checkout, the man helping us was most apologetic about our housekeeping issues but since we had booked through Expedia, he said that he couldn't give us a discount on the room. Overall pros: Beautiful new space, innovative design, quiet rooms, interesting artwork Overall cons: Dark casino, staff in need of a lot more training, lack of informal / inexpensive lunch options We would go back to Bellagio or Caesar's Palace instead of going back to Aria.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "yeecheng", "Title": "\u201cNice but needs improvement\u201d", "Author": "yeecheng", "ReviewID": "UR52042907", "Content": "I understand this is a new hotel but they need to improve their check in AND check out procedures. Check in was horrible (long lines) and the some of the managers were just standing in the back smiling and talking to themselves while their workers were dealing with hostile guests trying to check in. Their express checkout (via tv) was not working so checking out was also a nightmare. Maid service was inconsistent. Got one bar of soap and several boxes of sea salts on the first night (of the three nights we stayed). When we asked for more soap, we got more sea salts instead (the boxes looked the same). They removed one of the robes and never replaced with another one. They could have easily left the ones we had in the room. Another problem is their self parking! It was always at capacity but they designed the parking structure so that there are so much space between each car (those spaces could have been used for more parking spaces). I love wide parking spaces but those were ridicuously wide (another car could easily parking in that space). Finally, their buffet was not up to par (as compared to say Belligio). It costed $27.00 but the food was similar to other $15.00 buffets. Not much choices and the quality was only so so.

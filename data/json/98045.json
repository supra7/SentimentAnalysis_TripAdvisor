Our Bucket list included seeing Elvis Presley's beloved Graceland and then to points out West. From the moment we entered the lobby we could feel the warmth of the employee's and their team spirit. How refreshing! The employee's from the front desk to the bellman and even the housekeeping staff were personable and very professional. The hotel is nice and had everything we needed. The location was great! Easy access to freeways also. When you are visiting Memphis whether business or pleasure this hotel would be a good choice. While there, one simply must go into the Gift Shop and meet 'Miss Jane'. Charming is the best way to describe this fascinating woman. She is truly a genuine treasure. She could easily have been an Ambassador. 'Miss Jane' also has a wealth of knowledge about her beloved city. You will spend a few minutes with her and feel that you have known her a lifetime and as in my case, I wish that I had. Why the movie producers or writers have not discovered her is beyond me. She is absolutely fascinating! Just a note of interest.

While the staff I encountered was very friendly & polite, you could tell that no one cared about caring for or maintaining this hotel. Where do I even begin? I thought that Holiday Inn had booted all the old and bad ones from the system. Not this one. Why, I don't know. They haven't relaunched, neither have they done any sort of updating or renovations in what looks like 15 years. That is probably how old my old & painful mattress was. I had a hard time falling asleep due to the terrible back pain that the mattress caused me. However, let's get back to the cleanliness. Carpets are filthy, grimy & worn. I saw lots of roaches crawling around outside the pool & fitness center first thing in the morning. Room air conditioners are probably 20 years old, though they did cool fine, just loud. However, the room stunk something terrible. I was afraid to look at the A/Cs to see how dirty they were, as that is no doubt where a lot of the odor came from. I did have a tiny fridge & a microwave. Went to throw some stuff in the fridge, not only was it not on, but it smelled so bad that it knocked me a few feet back. No shower curtain liner, broken clock, only a soap & shampoo, ratty, lumpy old pillows. Dirty phones, dirty tub & bath & carpet... I could go on and on. I am not sure there was one thing in the room that wasn't dirty, worn or needed replacing. The wallpaper in the halls is old, scratched up and peeling. If you don't mind staying at a dump, then by all means stay here. A property that cuts this many corners makes me wonder if they even do things like change the sheets. Do yourself a favor and stay anywhere else.

Our room's air conditioning was not working, and within 30 minutes, the maintenance worker switched out the wall unit. However, that unit did not function properly either. In less than 5 minutes, the bellman was at our door with keys to another room. The hotel is old, but I would not describe it as dingy or dirty. It was fine. I have never been to a hotel where the staff was friendlier than they were at this hotel. Rachel suggested Ken Neely's Bar-B-Que. She even offered to let us (16 kids and adults) bring the food to the hotel and eat together in a corner of the restaurant. Where else would anyone have done this? We weren't sure when we would need to check-out due to the basketball games, but we didn't have to worry because the hotel worked with us and allowed us to check out late. The bar and restaurant staff were very friendly and service oriented. The hotel is difficult to get into and out of. The only other complaint I have is the size of the \"double\" beds. They are not true double beds. So, it was uncomfortable for my husband to share a bed smaller than a double bed. There are plenty of restaurants nearby.

(Memphis - East/I-240)\u201d", "Author": "michael_210", "ReviewID": "UR3489306", "Content": "Holiday Inn Select - Memphis, TN (East) This is a review of the Holiday Inn Select East in Memphis Tennessee on Poplar Avenue. We stayed in this Holiday Inn in May 2005. Rates were around $55/night (business rate). This is your typical Holiday Inn Select that you are used to, but is one of the older properties, but has been kept up nicely and was very clean. It has an restuarant, plenty of parking, is conveinent right on Interstate I-240. The Rooms: The rooms were normal style and typical Holiday Inn. They weren't as fancy as most \"Select\" properties, but a little nicer than a regular Holiday Inn room. The room we stayed in had a King bed, a couch, a desk area and a TV in a TV cabinet. Nice features were a second phone at the desk and free \"Wireless Ethernet\" (802.11g) connection for guests. The wireless ethernet connection was just one click to agree to use terms and you were on the internet. The only big negatives I can say about this hotel was the room, or more specficially the bed. This has to be one of the \"cheapest\" mattresses I've ever slept on. I'd compare it to a mattress in a \"Motel 6\". For a Holiday Inn Select, they should have a much better mattress. It was very hard and cheap feeling and not much fun to sleep on. The old style wall mount A/C unit, while it worked fine, was extremely noisey. Anytime it cycled on, you had to pick up the TV remote and turn up the TV to watch it. When it cycled off, you had to turn the TV back down. But I could live with the noisey A/C if the mattress was just better. Fitness Center & Pool area: They had an older but decent fitness center at this location. It had 2 threadmills, 3 stair stepper machines, a stationary type bike, and a large multifunction Nautilus machine. The pool was an indoor one about the size of a large home pool with a nice deck area with chairs/tables around it. It was nothing fancy, but kids who love to swim wouldn't have any problem with is. Restuarant: We ate breakfast at the breakfast buffett in the main lobby restuarant. Again, typical Holiday Inn style operation with expected results. It was kinda pricey though for a buffett at $15 per person including breakfast, coffee, juice and gratuity. Service from the waitstaff was very good though. Other Ammenities: This hotel appears to have lots of meeting rooms and ballrooms. There were several corporate style meetings going on during our visit and they seemed to be geared towards this. There is also a very small gift shop in the lobby that had a few tourist type items. When we checked in we noticed some guests using a computer in the lobby looking up something on the internet or something. So there appears that there might be a \"general guest use\" computer for those who don't bring a laptop. One other thing to note was that security patrolled the parking lot in a golf cart and did a good job of making sure that everyone that was in the parking lot belonged there. I'm not sure if this was indicitive of a break in problem in the parking lot in past warranting these patrols or them just providing good customer care. Would we stay there again? Only if we had a meeting in the hotel or just because it was a great rate compared to other memphis hotels of this higher end. We just really didn't like that cheap mattress.

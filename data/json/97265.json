We saw a nice reservation building and decided to price them. Got a quote of $67 (AAA discount applied) for a king room. Wi-fi, free hot breakfast, hot tub in indoor pool area. Outdoor pool not open yet (but it is only May 5th). Somehow it appeared from the placing of the check in building that the rooms were in the nice building adjacent. Then we learned, behind the check in area was the super old dingy group of buildings. The room was just ok. No headboard, old style tv and the A/C was not turned on so the room was musty and damp. It did quickly cool down though. The bathtub was old, the shower head was humorous. I am a 5'8 female and shower head was so low I had to practically do 1/2 a back bend to get my hair and upper body washed. The handle in the one piece tub enclosure fell out, while I was using it to steady myself to shave my legs. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows (look at the photos on here and you will see them) are like 1/2 the size of a normal bed pillow. I had to ask for more. The 'maid\" who brought them to me is the same woman I saw running around in circles in a lower lot with in a golf cart. She knocked on the door, while smoking a cigarette, and handed me the pillows while her son was with her, and a dog was on a leash. The towels smelled of cigarette smoke. We later saw the same maid running around with a man and her son racing through the lower lot playing with the golf cart. Seemed rather odd. While walking up to the breakfast area, we noticed all the employees standing in and around the doorway to their laundry room. All of them were smoking, which is probably another reason why the towels and pillows smelled like they do. The indoor pool is very small. The hot tub is only suppose to serve 3-4 people, but everyone literally crams in. If this place was booked to capacity, it would be no fun at all, as there simply isn't enough room. The hotel didn't have many people there now, and it was already too crowded in the pool area. Admittedly, all the ladies working the breakfast area were cheerful, helpful and very friendly. Breakfast was the best part of the stay. We had scrambled eggs with ham and cheese, pancakes, donuts, etc. The food was hot and fresh. The gentleman at the front desk were all friendly and dressed very well. First impressions were awesome, but then you drive around to the rear of the property and are shocked! Pluses, front desk appearance and reservation agents were nice. Bed was comfortable, breakfast was very good. Free wi-fi worked well too. It was a short walk to a great late night \"just dessert\" establishment right across the street. Next time, I will pass this place by. There are too many other places to choose from to sleep in a place that smells of cigarette smoke and not so old, dark and dank, along with the musty feeling.

What more do you want because your plans in Branson are to see things, not stay in your room. Then things got good. We were there during the week and had the pool pretty much to ourselves in the afternoon. For a dollar we could use a dryer so we didn't have to pack our wet swimsuits. Breakfast was included in the price and included biscuits and gravy, cereal, fruit, etc. For a very small price you could get a cooked to order menu. It's centrally located and quiet while we were there, but then again it wasn't busy season. Every person on staff that we met, from the housekeepers to the maintainance, to the front desk always spoke to us and it was heart felt. Not simply a cordial hello.

The room we were given was very well used...the carpeting was almost bare and needed a good vacuum job (thick with dust in one corner and lots of ???? near the bed), the tile in the bathroom and lavatory area was cracked in several places and had some burn holes in it even though the room was a \"no smoking\" room. The toilet seat was loose also. I had explained that I didn't do well with stairs and asked if an elevator was available if we weren't given a street level room....we were put in the area that is the most removed from the motel office/breakfast room and we had to walk to full length of the motel to get to a ramp or use the stairs - I never saw an elevator. The walk to the breakfast area was very hilly and hard to traverse from our room. The breakfast featured powdered eggs (yuck) which I could not eat - the waffles were the pre-frozen variety (verses the \"cook them fresh\" kind that some motels feature)....the biscuits and sausage gravy were good (thankfully) as was the pancakes, but both mornings had very long lines waiting not only for food but also for a table once you had food. We would have moved to another place but I was recovering from an injured arm and our daughters had paid for the room for us in advance for our 40th anniversary and we didn't want to make them feel bad about the room.", "Date": "July 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cQuality Inn on 76\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2589295", "Content": "Nice, convenient place to stay.

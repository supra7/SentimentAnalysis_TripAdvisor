If you want a quality room/hotel, forget it, this is budget with a capital B. The room and whole ambience of the place were just that. I must have had the noisiest room in the place as well, by the door leading out from the dining area, lots of shouting and running kids from 6 am. One couple I spoke with had a quieter experience, 3rd floor at the end. Breakfast was a shambles with far too few tables for the number of diners. The pool for a decent size though and nice for a dip after a hot busy day. I paid about \u00a3170 for 4 nights B&B so it is fantastic value despite it's shortcomings. I just feel that given the competition in the area with tens of thousands of rooms available there will be better for not much more money. I do not plan on visiting the area again, but if I do return it will not be to this hotel.

Our first morning there, I opted to have one of the \"make your own waffle\" waffles, and oh, the tummy trouble that followed! After that morning, I opted to skip the breakfast.

The pool was nice, and we liked that they had on-site coin operated washer and dryers (however, they have no change machine, and don't keep enough quarters on hand on the front desk to make change.) The machines are located on the second floor, where our rooms were, which was nice to not have to carry laundry up and down stairs on vacation.

We were arriving late from Disney, so we were concerned that we would get there and that there would be no room even with a reservation. I called ahead and they assured me that there would be no problem. We arrived at the hotel at about 10PM. Check-in took under five minutes and was thorough. I was informed of checkout time, complimentary continental breakfast, $200 charge if smoking in a non-smoking room and the $1 charge for using the in room safe, which I thought was odd. The room was very clean. It was nice to find it with a fridge and microwave. The bed was firm, but comfortable. It seems that some 2 star hotels use small square pillows now instead of the traditional rectangular ones. This was one of them. The pillows feel a little lumpy with cotton balls inside. Twice I woke up because of noise outside (people walking/talking) so I am not sure if the walls are a little thin or I just wasn't in a deep sleep. Other than that there were no issues with the room. I should have mentioned the pillows to the front desk. The breakfast room was packed at 9 AM, but it wasn\u2019t a problem. We just had to be a little patient the one waffle iron. Breakfast included egg, sausage, waffle, white bagel/bread, warm danish, cereal and yogurt for the most part. Coffee and juices were also available. Check-out was fine. It was just as smooth as the check-in. Travel time to Disney main gate is no more than 10 minutes. Disney Animal Kingdom would be half that due to its proximity to the hotel. I also like the quick access to the Osceola Parkway from this hotel. Other than what I may think are slightly thin walls and lumpy pillows I enjoyed my stay. The staff was professional and courteous.

Arrived early in the morning before our room was ready but the receptionist was extremely helpful and accomodating and gave us our assigned room keys for later as well as offering to hold our bags in the staff office until we returned later that evening. We had stayed in a 'suite' hotel near Old Town for 3 previous nights and in comparison this feels much more a motel and from the outside appears to be rather lacking. Our first impression of the reception area was of all all pervading smell of disinfectant in a rather dim-lit area with a loud TV set, dingy elevator and a small eating area but the quality of service from the staff who were always happy to assist, completely overrides this, so don't be put off by first 'lobby' impressions, check out the room too. Our room was on the 3rd floor and was very clean and nicely presented. A large than usual mini-fridge enabled us to keep good supply of chilled drinks and there was a microwave and coffee maker too. Bathroom was very clean, our only quibble with it being that the towels were rather few and far between and also rather on the thin side. Also some kind of curtain separating the vanity sink area alcove from the main room would have been nice and afforded a little extra privacy when dressing / washing. Not such a problem when you have little kids or one couple staying but 2 couples sharing or a family with older kids would probably appreciate it. Beds were extremely comfortable, with sheets and comforters as opposed to blankets and we both slept very well and found it hard to get out of them in the morning! AC was a little on the noisy side but kept the rooms just right. Didn't use the shuttle service, pool or free breakfast so unable to comment on them, however we did use the internet. Connection was a little slow but it was also free so who's complaining. One point worth mentioning though - there was no ethernet (laptop to hub) cable in the room, we had luckily brought our own but it's worth checking with reception so you don't get caught out and unable to connect. Hotel is situated very close to the 192 and with a gas station mere seconds away. Plenty of good cheap eats around in various family restaurants, there's a supermarket close by plus a 24hr Walgreens across the 192 just a few mins down the road if you need milk, cereals, medicines, toiletries etc (oh and speaking of the latter, the hotel itself is happy to supply you with 'emergency' toothbrush etc if you arrive and find you've forgotten it!) Hotel is also very convenient for driving to the Disney Parks, we had a hire car and were parking up at the Magic Kingdom lot within 10 mins or so of leaving the hotel depending on volume of traffic. It's also easy to get up to I-Drive for Universal etc as well as other main routes. We stayed in Feb and it was very quiet so possibly it's noisier in peak season but even so all we really wanted was a place to sleep and this exceeded expectation. The option for an 'express check out' would have been welcome to allow for a quick getaway on that final day but even without this we weren't kept waiting too long. All in all, our stay here was pleasant and relaxed and we would certainly think of using this hotel again in the future.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "hersheyfanNy", "ReviewID": "UR125099314", "Content": "Stayed only one night because our timeshare started the next day but was amazed at how great the mattresss and pillows were - you had to practically climb to get in bed - check-in was fast and curtious - room had micro wave and frig. - best of all was the free wonderful continental breakfast in the morning from hot waffles, eggs, sausage to yogurt, cereal and fruit - it had everything.

Not uncommon for Florida, but because the rooms have doors that led directly outside, we commented that we hoped that didn't mean cockroaches could easily access our rooms. When we opened the door, the first thing we saw was a giant cockroach on the wall. We immediately went back to the front desk and requested a room on a higher floor to reduce the chances of cockroaches. Even though we checked in late at night, he was able to accomodate us immediately and got us a third floor room. Sadly, no other compensation was offered. We scoured the second room for any sign of bed bugs, cockroaches, other unwelcome guests and found nothing. In our search though, we found that the rooms weren't cleaned very thoroughly (booger on the shower wall, trash under the mattress) but we were emotionally and physically exhausted at that point, so we took the bug free room and tried to sleep. Luckily, we had only booked one night at this hotel. We skipped the complementary breakfast. Once you see one cockroach, you can only imagine where the rest of them might be hiding, so we passed on the food that had been sitting out on the counter for three hours. Had we checked into that first room first, our ratings of this place would have been higher. But you can never get totally comfortable after a first impression like that.

This leads to a bit more noise and there were a lot of bugs all around the door to our room (and all the rooms). The bugs were everywhere, that wasn't their fault, but if the doors opened inside it wouldn't be a problem. We only saw a couple of bugs inside the room.

The rooms look just like the ones shown on their website - roomy, crystal clean and warm/inviting. The colors are rich and vibrant - certainly much nicer than your average motel room. We asked for a quiet room on the third floor and that's exactly what we got. We never heard a peep from traffic or from other guests. Unlike many other motels, this one has your usual outside stairs, but it also has an elevator. This was wonderful when it came to not having to lug our stuff up three flights of stairs to our room, yet allowed us to park close to the stairwell near our room. They offered a free hot breakfast which was average. There was a nice selection and for free, what can you expect? It was perfectly located to the Disney parks - only about a ten minute drive away. We paid $63/night with our AAA discount which was a down right bargin. This is well maintained and managed facility that I would recommend to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because we had a problem with a discount ticket agency that they have on their premise. Though it is independently owned and operated and not affiliated with the hotel, it still reflects poorly on the hotel. We paid $20 to \"hold\" four one day tickets to Magic Kingdom for the following day. We were told to stop by the office at 8am the following morning and we would be given the tickets as well as someone would accompany us to the park to make sure we didn't have any problems getting in. 8 am rolled around and no show. 8:20 rolled around and no show. My husband called and was told that they were running late and would be there in 15 minutes. At 8:45 they still weren't there, but were told they'd be there with the tickets in 15 minutes. At 9:15 when they still weren't there and were told that they'd be there in 15 minutes, we gave up and went to the park - losing our $20. The front desk appeared quite upset about the situation and also informed us that two other people were waiting for their tickets too. They made some calls, but it didn't seem to matter. We're not sure if the ticket guy ever showed up or not. The next morning, nobody was in the ticket office to complain to and get our money back by the time we had to leave.

It is a rather small hotel. The front desk attendants during check-in were very nice and friendly. When we got to our room we realized they upgraded us to a room with a refrigerator and microwave - which was nice, but it was a handicapped accessible room....meaning the bathroom was huge, no tub, but rather a shower (that was a bit of an issue for my 2 year old.) On our first night there, a rather large spider crawled/leaped (who knows) onto my fiancees head and it wasnt a daddy long legs, either! The flat sheets smelled clean but had greyish stains on them. The next day, my son spotted a trail of five other smaller spiders on the curtain and the top of the TV had a thick film of dust on it. As far as breakfast goes...they serve until 9:30 AM and they do start picking up at close time. They have a good selection (muffins, toast, pastries, eggs, sausage patties, cereal, yogurt, and they have a waffle maker - which is pretty nice, juice and coffee). They have ample seating, but if it gets to crowded you wont have a place to sit, which happened to us one of the days. We had a pretty positive breakfast experience overall. The pool is not kept clean, you can see the thin grey film of dirt around the floor and walls of the pool. Definitely not a pool to go in. The location is excellent, we were a 5 minute (if that) drive from Animal Kingdom and a few minutes further from Disneys Hollywood Studios. There are restaurants close by (Cracker Barrel, Perkins, a seafood restaurant - forgot the name, etc.) The location really could not be beat. On our last day, we got locked out of our room at 8:30 AM, the keycard apparently had been deactivated despite that we had not checked out yet. I called front desk and they had me walk over there to get another card as if I wasnt inconvinienced enough. Overall, the stay was do-able. But I'm not sure I'd stay here again. I've stayed at way bad hotels, and great hotels...this one is inbetween. Perhaps, they just need to get some sort of pest company to come fumigate on a regular basis, get a pool cleaning service and dump stained sheets. ;) Pros: Location, Breakfast and friendliness of front desk.

I don't write reviews often but felt I should in this case. I had a few questions including ADA rooms so I called and Jim answered.

Everything in our room (a suite) was exactly like in the pictures. and the maid service was excellent. She cleaned and replaced everything while also working around all of our stuff - quite the task because we had things everywhere! Outside was hot but the room was chilly so we turned off the AC at night. When we'd return from the parks, the maid had turned it back on for us. The pool was crystal clear, the breakfast was better than any other Choice hotel we have stayed at and the location was excellent. Note: Learn the Sherberth Rd way to Disney parks before you arrive. Entry Point becomes Sherberth on the other side of 192. A local I met referred to it as the hidden 5th exit into Disney and it is a big time saver when traffic is bad. We even used it returning from Universal because I-4 and 192 were jammed. We got off I-4 heading to Magic Kingdom and then to Sherberth.

After stopping at several other hotels and Seaworld, I was dropped off at Universal around 0815. The park was surprisingly quiet and I was ready to head back to the hotel at 1330. When I called the hotel to be picked up, I was told that the contracted shuttle would only pickup at 1800 when the park closed. I inquired about a taxi, but was quoted $30-40 to get from Universal to the hotel. I ended aup waiting for the 1800 shuttle, and after all stops were complete, it was 1930 before we got back to the Quality Inn.

It is one of those places that must be experienced to be appreciated. As I write this, this Qualiy Inn is less than 1 year old. It is a franchise (privately owned hotel - not a corporate hotel). It was previously a Masters Inn. As a Masters Inn, this was a wonderful hotel and an annual destination for us. When we came to stay last February, the new Quality Inn was not yet officially opened and was still under renovations, but when we told them that we come here every year the wonderful new owners invited us to stay in one of the recently completed rooms for a stunningly low rate. The room was nothing less than beautiful. Well, we came back again this year, the hotel is fully open, and it was simply magnificent. EVERYTHING was new - carpets, beds (with beautiful dark wood headboards), expensive looking dark wood nightstands, a table desk, and a large dresser with built in microwave and refridgerator. It's freshly painted inside and outside in very tasteful colors. Rooms have coffeemaker, iron & ironing board, LOTS of hangers and a rack to hang your clothes, a very comfortable office chair, several lamps and lights, new air conditioning, new TVs, some rooms have computers but WIFI is available and there are computers for use in the lobby as well. The pool area is spotless and lovely, several brand new vending machines can be found throughout the complex, parking surrounds the complex in a way that you are certain to be able to park near your door. The beautifully decorated and furnished lobby also doubles as a lounge and breakfast area - and not just with your old fashioned continental breakfast but a free buffet with eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, ceral, milk and juices, pasteries, coffees and teas (and much more which I never got around to seeing, being too busy eating my yummy bacon). The staff is absolutely delightful and kind, and the owners nearly fall over themselves and bend over backwards to be of service to you. If you have any problems with them - I can assure you that the problem is yours, not theirs. Taking out any frustration on them would be quite cruel - as has been attested to by nearly everyone else who has posted here. In fact, to demonstrate their generousity... because we had returned to their hotel, the owners gave us an unbelievable discount! And let me tell you - their regular prices are a STEAL!!! I see someone posting here complained that they were charged $60. OMG... what the heck is WRONG with those people to complain about that price?!! Let me tell you all this... my spouse has been a Cape Cod five-star resort hotel manager for nearly 30 years, and you must believe me when I say freom experience that this hotel is worth DOUBLE that price! $60 is NOTHING. However, I do believe that this price is probably their high season price, so you can expect not to pay even that all the time. Talk to the owners in person and you may even be able to \"haggle a little with them. There is a reason that this hotel, as of the writing of this review, has been rated #9 out of 183 Kissimmee hotels: IT'S THAT GOOD. The bottom floor rooms are wonderful, but for a really great experience try to get a 2nd or 3rd floor room. There are tons of shops, restaurants and even attractions up and down the road, and the West Gate to Disney World is just down the block. The hotel offers shuttle services to all of the parks. The managment are truly sweet people and they WANT you to have a good time and be happy here. They aren't a big corporation, but rather they treat you like your are guests in their home, and you should behave as such. If you chose to stay at this hotel (which you should), I suggest introducing yourself to one of owners or managers and let them know why you chose their hotel, and get that person's name. And when you leave, don't just drop off your key at the front desk and split, but ask to talk to that person again and TELL HIM/HER about your experience there and let them know if you would return again and if you would recommend them to others. They will sincerely APPRECIATE it. We have been treated with such great care on each of our visits here that we very much feel like family now, and we will continue to make this our stop in Kissimmee/Orlando/Disney.

I was taking her to Disney World Magic Kingdom for her 5th birthday and wanted somewhere close by with a shuttle that was affordable. Check in was very quick, the staff at the front desk were exceedingly polite, and upon check-in we found out that we had been upgraded from a regular king room to a king suite, because the room type we booked online were all full. The suite was very large and spacious, had a couch & tv, with a separate area with a very comfy king bed and flat screen tv. It also had a dining area with fridge & microwave, and a nice desk with computer. The bathroom was a standard hotel bathroom, but it was very clean and that is all I am looking for. From our windows you could see the pool, which looked very inviting, however, it was REALLY cold, so we didn't get to go swimming. They have a nice free breakfast with your usual continental fare, toast, muffins, a variety of cereal, yogurt, a waffle maker, scrambled eggs, and sausage, as well as different juices & coffee. I would suggest you get there earlier rather than later, as we went down around 9 (I believe it was served from 6:30-9:30 AM) and there were a lot of people down there, and there was not a lot of seating. The shuttle service was nice, so that we didn't have to worry about parking, but the shuttle service is shared with a few other hotels, so it was sometimes crowded. We had a wonderful time at Magic Kingdom, of course, and after a full day there, it was nice to come back to a comfy king bed and rest. The hotel is also situated very close to a lot of different restaraunts as well as a few stores, in case you need to pick up any misc. items (my daughter's camera batteries died, and we had to get a screwdriver and batteries). We had an excellent time and we will definitely be staying there again next time we go to WDW!", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fleet, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuperb!

We secured a great deal through Expedia on this hotel and were concerned that because we'd paid so little for 7 nights, we'd compromised on quality. However.... It was superb, comfy, the room was big and had everything we needed. (Fridge, TV, free wireless, tea/coffee facilities, bathroom etc) It's a motel style hotel with ample parking and we couldn't believe that included in the price was breakfast. The beds were really great to sleep on, although the aircon was a bit loud at times. Breakfast was great, including everything from cooked food to waffles, to pastries, cereal, juice etc. The pool looked really inviting, although it wasn't warm enough when we were there to try it. There are several restaurants and supermarkets nearby so you don't have to pay the theme park prices to get a meal. Within a stones throw are Indian, Steak and Mexican restaurants. A petrol station is nearby too. Amazingly, you can also get a free shuttle to Epcot and Universal. There aren't hundreds but , again it saves dollars ($14 per day in Disney and Universal parks) We were there to do the parks and this hotel enabled us to afford it. It took about 10 mins to Disney and 15 min drive to Universal. We also went to the Kennedy Space Centre and the drive was a little over an hour.

He was very helpful at check-in and told us about the free hot breakfast in the morning and to let him know if we needed anything. One of the rooms had a key that wouldn't work right away and he came over immediately. The rooms are newly renovated and look brand new. The beds are very comfortable. Everything was super clean. The only thing I would have liked was a refrigerator in the room - he said they are hoping to get them in all of the rooms in the future - right now they are available in certain rooms for an additional fee. (It's been a long time since I've been in a hotel room that didn't have a fridge in it - I thought it was a little odd).
